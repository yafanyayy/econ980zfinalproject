Okay, good. Good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us this morning for our results.And I think, first up, I'd like to acknowledge my colleagues that are here with us today. Firstly, Ren",3742,"[indiscernible]? Good. Okay, well, all right. Okay, good. Good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us this morning for our results.
And I think, first up, I'd like to acknowledge my colleagues that are here with us today. Firstly, René will be presenting the financials for the last time, and so I know you will give him a rousing reception. Stephen Pearce joins us for the first time. He actually gets to enjoy this set of results. From here on in, he'll be singing for his supper. Tony, here as well. Norman, Anik, Seamus, Bruce, Didier, Peter and Duncan are all here in the audience. And one thing I would suggest or encourage you to do is make sure you talk to the team members for us. I think it's very important to be respectful to you guys and give you the opportunity to talk to people in the business that are actually driving the business and driving the change. And please take the opportunity to tap them on the shoulder and get their perspectives on what we're doing because, at the end of the day, we get somewhat used to presenting here and I think it's important that you hear it from the guys that are actually doing the hard work on the ground. It's a very tight team. We've done a lot of hard work and still have a lot of hard work to do. So good to see people here, and hopefully, you'll take advantage of the opportunity to able to talk to the guys.
Well, jumping straight into the key issues. You'll see that we've used the word delivering change and building resilience, and we're making a very clear statement of intent with those words. There can be no doubt, I think, today in presenting these results that we've done a lot of work in terms of change. And our focus has to be to continue to improve the business to ensure that we deliver free cash flow under literally any market scenario that is thrown at us. And I will talk to and point to a couple of points during the presentation to reinforce that key issue for us. And to me and to us, that is the definition of a resilient business, the ability to handle anything the market throws at you. 
Now in developing and talking to the 2016 story, we'll actually use this flow. We'll talk about delivering on commitments. We will talk to the operational improvement, go to the balance sheet. René will obviously pick up the financials, and I will talk specifically to the portfolio approach towards the end of the conversation. And obviously, we'll then have Q&A. And I'm sure you'll have quite a few questions.
I think, firstly, on commitments, free cash flow, significant for the year, $2.6 billion versus $0.4 billion. For us, the
[indiscernible][indiscernible][indiscernible][indiscernible][indiscernible][indiscernible]      
importance of that number, I think, is best considered when you look at our average prices 2015 versus 2016. In fact
[Audio Gap]
[indiscernible][indiscernible][indiscernible][indiscernible]    
drove the net debt performance. And that number is obviously being contributed on a number of fronts, and again, René will pick that up. But certainly, well below the $10 billion target. And yes, disposals did make a material contribution, but we didn't have to go as far as we originally indicated to achieve those numbers. So we're pleased with progress, a lot more to be done.
On the operating side, we've seen continuing improvements through each of the operations. And in particular, when you look at EBITDA margin, despite a 3% drop in prices for the full year, our EBITDA margins actually gone from 21% to 26%. So we're really pleased with that aspect of the performance and for us probably one of the most important numbers to focus on in terms of what we've done and also where we need to go to continue to improve the quality of the results that we're delivering.
On the balance sheet, again from our point of view, very important that we'll get to investment-grade rating. In the end, the numbers are getting in that territory. For us, we can't forecast when the rating agents may look favorably upon the change. And René will give you his views on that, but for us, we'll do everything to make sure we get there as quick as we can. More specifically, we are targeting a reinstatement of the dividend by year-end, to be paid in 2018. On the portfolio, we'll continue to clean up -- continue the clean-up work that we defined when we talked about the portfolio back in '13 and '14. Our recently announced Union sale is an example of that continuing cleanup, but at the same time, I'll make the point that, as far as deleveraging the balance sheet, we are not required to make disposals to help us position because we see our free cash flow and the work that we're doing inside the business with the ability to deliver on our debt targets. So it'll be about portfolio cleanup. And again, I'll talk a little bit about that to give you more color through the presentation. Finally and to be very specific, we will retain Moranbah, Grosvenor and the coking coal and the nickel assets as well. And as I said, I'll pick that conversation up around the portfolio a little bit later.
On the results and going straight to the numbers, I think these numbers best describe -- these 6 numbers best describe Anglo American in 2016: EBITDA, a good result, again considering the basket price had dropped 3%. So we got a 25% improvement on where we were in 2015. Cost and volume improvements actually represent around a $200 billion -- a $2 billion improvement for the full year. We did have some headwinds. Net, we're about $1.5 billion -- $1.6 billion in cash terms. And we had a $100 million adjustment due to platinum inventories. Again, we'll pick that up a little bit later, but on a cash basis we had -- we hit the $1.6 billion. On capital, we continue to hold our discipline across the organization. I think that's critical. And you'll see what we're forecasting for '17. The attributable free cash flow reflects the volume and cost work we did across the business. The net debt-EBITDA is a straight calculation. And obviously, the net debt number is certainly for us a very important number that we were focusing on for the full year. We've made good progress, but there's still a lot for us to do. And certainly, we are not [ph][ph][ph][ph][ph]     going down to the next phase of improvement during the course of this year. We'll talk about that a little bit later.
I've got to say that across the business the one disappointment that we've reported is in safety. With 11 fatalities, it's both disappointing. Or if I could say, more importantly, it's unacceptable. The focus on critical controls, the planning of the work through the operating model is where our focus is, and we still obviously have a lot of work to do. The good news is a 24% improvement in our total recorded injury rate was encouraging. And at the end of the day, if we're not managing the key risks, then we remain exposed, and that's unacceptable. On the environmental side, we've done a lot of work. We've really focused on measuring what we're doing and how we're performing. And the reduction, almost an 85% reduction, in the incidents reported, I think, does talk to the planning work and the focus on the detail. And for us, it goes with cost reductions, productivity improvements and the overall business in -- performance. So we've got to get the safety right. A lot of work going into that by everyone in this room and through the organization.
On production. If I work from the right-hand side, 2% overall. Nickel, with the commissioning of the Barro Alto furnace, that we actually hit the full rate during Q3. So pleased with the good progress there. On iron ore, obviously supported by the continuing ramp-up at Minas-Rio. Guys have done some good work there. Kumba, with all of the restructuring during the course of the year, we're pretty happy with the numbers that were ultimately delivered. Chris and the guys continue to do very well on the finished platinum side. Yes, we had a couple of problems during the year, but overall the performance was solid. De Beers, reflecting the market, making sure that we're balancing our production to market demand, so a good recovery from 2015. In both the coal regions or the 3 coal regions, really solid work, restructuring, even with some sales, done a good job on the operating side. Productivity has continued to improve. And so some really good work across the portfolio.
On copper, I won't talk too much about the mid-year issues that we talked on Los Bronces. Since then, the guys have delivered the numbers. The good news, I think, from the copper side, and we saw those in the half year numbers, was the cost work. And so Duncan and the guys were able to improve their EBITDA contribution, and that was really a function of the very good work done on the copper side.
So overall, we're happy with the results. Yes, we could do better in terms of the areas that we had a few headwinds, but overall the numbers were pretty solid and supported much better performance on the cost side. And that's really where our focus was. On a full basis, we've reflected 9%, which is normalized for the portfolio changes. I think you'll see a headline number of 10% reduction. That's just how the numbers actually landed for the full year; nickel reflecting Barro Alto's contribution; very good progress in iron ore, particularly at Kumba. And you know that we've come from the $77 a tonne break-even price to $29 for the year. I'll talk to that a little bit later. So a good performance there. Minas-Rio, also making a contribution. I think Seamus and the guys made good progress there even with a constrained footprint, some good work on the cost side. De Beers, Bruce and the team focusing on the efficiency work, obviously helped by getting the volumes out. Coal Australia, again a good focus on costs. And they've come a long way. Don't forget in Australia in particular we're down more than 50%, so continuing good work. And in South Africa, some good progress. SA export coal, I'll pick that up. And copper, as I said
[indiscernible][indiscernible][indiscernible][indiscernible]    
[Audio Gap]
[indiscernible][indiscernible][indiscernible][indiscernible]    
we were expecting a bit of a higher contribution, particularly with De Beers. We did see some headwinds with the smelter failure at -- the Waterval smelter failure and the Los Bronces issue in copper which we dealt with at the half year. So net-net, we saw a $400 million contribution on the volume side. That got us on a cash basis to a $1.6 billion performance improvement across the portfolio. The platinum noncash inventory adjustment, we do the inventories on an annual basis. In 2015, it was $180 million contribution. This year, it was $80 million, so the difference in the $100 million is what we've recorded there. And so we do that inventory adjustment. It's in the range of expected outcomes, so there were no big surprises there, but it does have an impact. And it shows as a noncash, but it is something we should report on the basis that it talks to our run rate that we talked to earlier this year. So this is where the numbers are.
For us, when we look at what we can do. And I talked about the word or used the word ""resilient."" We recorded a 3% drop in our commodity basket price. I noticed some of the press stuff [ph] this morning was saying we got saved by commodity prices. In fact, during '16, our basket was actually on average below the 2015 numbers. Certainly, a great recovery in the second half, and we're enjoying that and still enjoying some of that recovery, but the improvement from 21% to 26%, this is -- I think, makes the most important statement for the business. 3 years ago, we talked about improving our margins in tougher environments. And for us, that's where we've got to keep doing as much work as we can. And the second last bullet there, the marketing activities and marketing's contribution to that margin improvement has been also very strong. I'm very pleased with the progress that Peter and his team have made in their work. And they've delivered more than the $400 million we were targeting back in 2013, so very pleased with their contribution.
On a commodity-by-commodity basis, diamonds, as you would expect, where the market's starting to stabilize and certainly providing movement for products, we were able to deliver volume and cost improvement on the business. In looking forward, we'll continue to work closely with our customers to make sure that we're in the right conversations, with an understanding how the market is balanced so that we're making the right decisions. On the quality side, Gahcho Kué will make a bigger contribution this year and for us a very important part of the quality improvement that we're looking for across the portfolio to support margin improvement. And our production range forecast for the year is 31 million to 33 million carats. That's based on what we believe the market will certainly support in its current configuration. I think we've got to be a bit careful with the first site because there was some stock movement in those numbers. So I don't want people to get too excited. We've made the point, Bruce has made the point we've just got to keep an eye on the market. And we'll make sure that we stay very close to our customers in particular.
On platinum, we've been working right across the portfolio on improvement. Chris, you'll see, is here, jumping up and down in terms of the results. The sale of Rustenburg, for us, was a very important milestone for the year. And I have to give Chris full credit for the hard work that he put in, with the rest of the team, in making sure that, that got through. For us, the quality of the portfolio and making sure that we're positioned on the left-hand side of the cost curve is where I think we need to be, as we still see a bit of platinum around. And over time as the market moves our way, we should be the beneficiaries, particularly with our assets, on the right side -- on left-hand side literally of the cost curve. But there is still some more work to be done, good progress and certainly very good progress on the portfolio restructuring front.
On copper, on volumes, we're unable to rely on volumes to help us with our efficiencies, but really good work on the costs side. As I said, I won't get back through the half year challenges we had, other than to say that the guys have done a good job in the last 6 months continuing on the cost-reduction front and making a very solid contribution. Our production guidance for 2017 remains in similar ballpark. We're more focused on the margins on copper and make sure that we've got the right things happening in the business. On El Soldado, some of you would have heard that there is a debate with the government regarding some of the approvals. If we remember, back 18 months ago, we were on the wrong side of cash flow at El Soldado some $100 million. We've restructured, made a lot of changes. And it's now making a positive contribution and would have made a positive contribution back at prices at that time, so there's been significant improvement. I think it'll be next 3 or 4 weeks where we'll sort out what we need to do to get approvals going forward, but at the same time, if we're not able to agree and we don't believe that the operation will be making a contribution, then we won't continue going forward with the operation. We'd like to think that we can work something through with the government and get the right licenses in place, but if not, we'll make the right decisions in -- with regard to each asset has to pull its weight and make a contribution.
On coal, the Australian operations again have been leaders in improvement across the business; and certainly doing very well on any comparative basis, unit costs in the lowest we've seen since 2006. Grosvenor has made its first contribution. It's 7 months ahead of schedule, so that's significant. We've continued to clean up the portfolio through Callide and Foxleigh. And sorry, I should make one other comment on Grosvenor: We're still in the first longwall block. We have experienced geotechnical challenges that we're getting on top of. It's quite normal in your first block where you've got what we'd call virgin stresses around the wall to see some challenges. Usually, things get better in the second and third blocks, but we're making good progress. And we'll watch that closely and keep the people updated on the progress that we're making. In terms of going forward, we're forecasting somewhere between 19 and 21 million tonne. Again, the guys are doing really good work on the cost side. Grosvenor will obviously be an important part of that production recovery -- or production forecast over the next 12 months.
In South Africa and Colombia, good progress. Certainly in South Africa the productivity work has been exceptional. We're actually up 45% on the last 3 years, so again good progress there. As a consequence, we've actually kept our costs at 2013 levels. There is still more we can do, and that, Seamus, with the team, is focusing on the continuing improvements that we can make. But I'd have to say that what it does demonstrate is that in South Africa we can be competitive with anyone in the world. We've still got a long way to go to match numbers that we're delivering elsewhere, but the progress has been very good, and so from my point of view, very pleased with the progress. And credit to the team for doing the hard work. And we still see lots of opportunities in Colombia as well. Again, the forecast there, the real focus for us is productivity improvements, getting our costs and continuing to improve our costs to make sure we can handle anything the market throws at us.
Kumba, most people are aware of the amount of restructuring that we've done. It has been a bit of a journey, taken a bit longer than we would like, but at the same time, if you go back to where we started with a $77 a tonne break-even price, we delivered for the full year $29 a tonne break-even price. I will put a cautionary point around the $29. It is a volatile number depending on where foreign exchange is and oil prices are, and so it can move anywhere between $30 and $40. The team is focused on continuing to improve the underlying performance and so that we're doing the best we can with what we've got, but the move from $77 to $29 substantially reflects good work of the team and in particular in '16, with not a lot of help in '15 on FX and oil, but in '16, it's primarily been the restructuring and the changes that we've made inside the business. For example, the downsizing by 40% was the important part of the improvements that have been delivered this year. So for me, that's a really important point to make. And credit to the team in the progress they've made. We all understand there's a lot more work to be done, but so far, we're very pleased with progress. And we'll certainly continue to encourage the guys to look for every opportunity to improve the business.
Similar story at Minas-Rio, improvements. We are constrained, as we said, by the pit room until we get the final license or the third phased license, which we expect to get by the end of '18. But at the same time, Seamus and the team have done really well on the cost side. Our FOB numbers are pretty solid. In fact, FOB costs are inside the range that we forecast at full production rates. Yes, we're getting a little bit of a help from the real, but don't forget we pegged it at around 4 [ph]. I think we're at about 3.2, 3.3 [ph] at the moment, so we've made good progress. They've pulled out overheads and indirect costs. We'll continue to focus on getting that configuration right. And once we get a bit more pit room, we end up getting a bit of balance in the feed, and so there's an opportunity to improve those costs once we open the pit up. But we're expecting that license to come through in '18, a really important milestone, and we'll keep you posted on the progress as we go through that.
Finally, for those that get really excited when people talk about nickel. It has been an important transition for us as we brought Barro Alto on today. For those that check these things and the ramp-up curves for the new generation of laterite deposits. It's been the best performer based on the new laterites, and that's in the last 6 or 7 years. We've still got some performance improvement we can deliver through consistency. I guess, from our point of view, a bit more patience will be required on the marketing side, but certainly we're not leaving the business in the hands of the markets. We will continue to improve the operations and again really pleased with the progress that's been made and what the team has delivered from Barro Alto with the new furnace. And I think we hit full rate in Q3, and we've kept it at a pretty consistent rate all the way through.
I think, with that, I'll hand across to René to unpack the financials based on that performance. And then I'll pick up the strategy after René. [indiscernible]."

And I would like to start by thanking the management team for the strong performance and allowing me to present a very strong set of results.So first goes through the key financial for 2016. So a very strong EBITDA number of $6.",1051,"Good morning, everybody. And I would like to start by thanking the management team for the strong performance and allowing me to present a very strong set of results.
So first goes through the key financial for 2016. So a very strong EBITDA number of $6.1 billion, an increase of 25%. A lower tax rate at 25%, it's really on the back of 2 special items. First, in Australia we were able to use some unrecognized tax reserves, especially with the strong performance in coking coal in the second half of 2016, but also the change in tax regime in Chile for withholding tax and the impact on the deferred tax assets. Going forward, we expect the tax rate to be between 30% and 32%, obviously depending on the structure of the portfolio. CapEx, down to $2.5 billion. And as you know, we commissioned 2 projects in 2016, Gahcho Kué in Canada, in De Beers; and Grosvenor, the new longwall operation in Australia. We still have some spending in Minas-Rio in Brazil.
Very strong shift in cash flow from negative cash flow of $1 billion in 2015 to a positive cash flow of $2.6 billion in 2016. Disposal proceed of $1.8 billion, predominantly in the second half of this year. And we closed, we completed the sale of niobium and phosphate and the sale of our 10% stake in Exxaro in South Africa for $200 million.
So net debt, down to $8.5 billion at the end of December, which represents a net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.4x on a pro forma basis. We maintain the same focus on costs, operational performance and CapEx. And we keep getting the benefit, obviously, of higher -- high commodity prices. And at end of January, our net debt was in fact down to $8.1 billion, so continued to good -- make good progress in term of strengthening the balance sheet.
Turning to the EBITDA waterfall. On the left-hand side, you see the uncontrollable elements. Mark mentioned the slight year-on-year basket price decline, a 3% negative impact of $100 million, but there was a strong recovery, as you know, in the second half of the year. The point-to-point increase, so from end of June to end of December, for our basket price was 27%. So the 25% increase in EBITDA was really driven by the cost and volume improvement, a net impact of $1.5 billion that Mark covered earlier. And then you had the impact of the platinum noncash inventory adjustment and the impact of the disposal both in '15 and '16.
Turning to the reduction in net debt. So overall, a reduction of $4.4 billion from $12.9 billion to $8.5 billion at the end of December. I will cover in more detail working capital and CapEx. Just to maybe clarify on what happened with the tax side and on the interest charge: On the tax side, we had also the benefit in Chile of accelerating the tax depreciation, and we had a tax refund of close to $200 million in 2016. So I think some of you were surprised by the much lower cash impact on the tax line. That's what's behind this lower number. On the interest side also needs some explanation. On the cash standpoint, we will get the benefit of the lower debt in 2017. That will reduce, from a cash standpoint, interest charge by $200 million, but from a P&L standpoint, as we have now commissioned Grosvenor and Minas-Rio, we will capitalize less. And the net impact from a P&L standpoint will be in fact an increase of $200 million.
So net debt down to $8.5 billion. Our objective is to have a net debt-to-EBITDA between 1x and 1.5x using long-term prices. Our EBITDA number using both our internal forecast and the market consensus, net EBITDA [ph] roughly around $6.5 billion. So we would like the level of net debt to be closer to $6 billion to $6.5 billion. I think we agree that we need to run the business with probably a more conservative balance sheet.
Turning to the -- what happened in term of gross debt and where we are in term of liquidity. So a 27% decline in gross debt in 2016. So we had obviously the impact of the maturity in 2016 but also the liability management exercise that we did earlier in the year and the repayment of a BNDES loan in Brazil for $1.7 billion. So that will help us reduce the level of interest charge that I mentioned earlier in 2017. Liquidity has been critical over the last 2 years. That was very important for us as we were going through the downturn and the pressure. We have maintained a very strong liquidity close to $16 billion. As we -- there is still some volatility in term of prices and we continue to make progress on deleveraging the balance sheet, but we expect the level of liquidity to be adjusted going forward as we make more progress in term of reducing the level of net debt. And you see the maturity over the next 3 years, so around $6 billion of bond maturing of the -- in '17, '18 and '19.
Working capital. So a net reduction of $400 million, and that's the impact of the higher prices in -- especially in the last months of 2016. We got the benefit of optimizing our level of inventory in De Beers, a benefit of $300 million; as well as our ability to renegotiate some debtors, some deal with some clients involving some prepayment and also some supplier payment terms.
CapEx. So down to $2.5 billion compared to $4 billion in 2015 and in excess of $6 billion in the prior years. We expect the level of CapEx to be maintained at this level in '17 and '18, the benefit of the commissioning of the projects that I mentioned earlier, but there will be an increase in SIB CapEx as we commission some new project, for example, Minas-Rio and Grosvenor.
And then in term of disposals. So $3.5 billion over the last 2 years, so including $1.8 billion in 2016. And you have the breakdown between niobium and phosphates back [ph] that we completed in September and the sale of our stake in Exxaro in December.
Thank you."

Since w",3381,"Thank you very much, René.
I will just quickly give a bit more flavor around the progress we've made, talk a little bit about the portfolio and then just update you on guidance and give a few final comments.
Firstly, in terms of change overall. Since we started the significant work we've been doing since '13, on the organization front we've basically streamlined and reduced the numbers across the business both as a consequence of focusing on the assets that can add material value, the way we run those assets, the way we operate and the way we work together as an organization. And so there has been a lot of work done, still more to be done, but from our point of view, that was a very important part of the strategy that we outlined back in '13. And we've made good progress but, again, looking to continue to improve that work to support our productivity improvements across-the-board. On the portfolio front, we've either sold or closed 27 assets, reducing the portfolio to 41. I think it's a bit overly simplistic to say we're dealing with the tail of clearly that $600 million conversation we had back in December in '15, when we talked about $600 million. The costs associated with those operations is down to $100 million, so we have dealt with the tail, but there will always be some assets that are in different phases that you have to deal with. But certainly from our point of view, that's been a big part of the work we've done but as well as that the ongoing improvements to the portfolio have been absolutely key in helping improve the overall quality of the business that we're running and certainly been very important in improving the margins across the business as we go forward.  Having said that, today, we've also added 5 new projects to the portfolio. So when we talk about margin improvement, it is a function of the work we've done on the portfolio and it's a function of the efficiency work we've done within each of the assets. And so from our perspective, it has been strategic in the way we've gone about the business, with still more to be done particularly on the cleaning up of the portfolio and the efficiency work in particular.
We won't go through the FutureSmart work. We will save that conversation for another day, but for those that saw what we were doing in December and understand what we're trying to do with the cost base on a go-forward basis, there's still a lot of opportunities across the business.
And finally, the operating model is about the way we operate. It's more of an industrial approach to the way we run our assets. Certainly, it's not about 1 or 2 years game. This is a long game that we're playing in operating and improving the business, as is the marketing model. And as I said earlier, Peter and the team have contributed more than $400 million worth of improvements, which was the number we talked to a few years back. And that's from -- literally from the resource right the way through to customers, improving logistics, returning [ph] costs and improving the realized prices that we achieved. And certainly, we'll continue to work on that model, which is different to a trading model or a sales model. It's a very different approach; a lot learned from De Beers and what we're doing in platinum applied to other parts of the business, including bulk. So for us, the whole improvement strategy was not simply about costs. It's about improving every part of the business, drive our margins, drive returns and make sure that from our point of view we're doing the best for our shareholders on a sustainable improvement basis.
On safety and environment, again we've made significant progress, 50% down since we first stood up in 2013, clearly disappointed with how 2016 shaped up, a lot of work going on to make sure that we recover and keep going forward and continue the broader improvement trends. Similar for environment, in the end, knowing that we're doing the work, I think, is the important piece. These things really only come to the fore when you have a problem. What we're going to try and do is continue to improve the discipline, the planning of the work we're doing in improving incidences. So that we don't have any large incidents. It's something that we all have to pay attention to in this type of business.  Of the operating side, our copper equivalent production from where we were up is actually up 8%. Now that's from 40% less assets. So clearly, the cleanup has been around the smaller assets and getting a lot more out of the larger scale, higher margin type assets. And so as a consequence of all of that work, our copper equivalent unit costs are down 31%. And that's in normal turns so from our point of view, that's an important number.  And cash generation flows from both improvements. For those that do track back to what we talked about in 2013, the underlying EBITDA improvement is $3.1 billion delivered against the target. So we've done well against those original targets and in fact, we've exceeded in most fronts. And capital expenditure, and other the major projects are through, with 55% reduction in capital and in terms of underlying capital, we've seen on average 20% to 30% efficiency improvements, which are consistent with what we've done inside the operations with our general operating improvements.
In talking to the story in its most starkest terms, the blue represents the actual copper equivalent production that we've delivered on a year-on-year basis. So while we've been restructuring the portfolio, selling or closing assets and bringing new assets into play, we've actually held the production or slightly improved our production over that 5-year period. As a consequence of the portfolio work and the efficiency work, the production per person is up 41% from where we were back in 2012. And as a consequence, our actual reported operating cost in U.S. dollars 69%. Now when we talk inflation and FX, there's been a netting generally of those numbers. So the underlying improvements and portfolio change, not going to say they're both making significant contributions, just improve the quality of the business. That's where our focus will remain going forward, to keep driving those numbers to improve our margins. Put the marketing work and the other elements that we're working through, including the focus on the discipline on the capital side, looking to improve our returns on a consistent basis as we go forward and put as much of our future in our hands as we do in terms of commodity prices.
On the portfolio side, I think we need to make a few key points. First, we've been committed to the cleanup. And so when we talk back in '14 of coming down to around 35, 37 assets, that was about improving the quality and making sure that we were focused on those assets that could drive value and that we are putting our capital in place to deliver the best returns over the long term. A lot of that work or in fact most of that work have been pretty done. Second, we identified the need to go further on our restructuring program and as everybody knows the story, in 2015, pretty dramatic drop in commodity prices. We were confronting a real challenge in diamonds the pipeline having filled probably the prior 12 months. The prognosis for China was a bit open. And so from our point of view, we took the decision to drive and effectively put in place a self-help program. Accelerated the improvements across the business in terms of costs, pulled our capital in hard but still making sure we remain committed to things like innovation where we knew that we'd have benefits longer-term and we sold some assets. The one thing we promised our shareholders in all of those conversations and the questions we're asked, you get the [indiscernible] value, we said that we would hold in strict value criteria. And I think that we held true to that. In the case of niobium and phosphate, so the 1 point we made is that niobium we did see a long-term opportunity to improve our position there given to the size of competitors in the industry. The phosphate business was very much a local market, and therefore, from our point of view, the price we realized was almost double consensus numbers and we thought that, that was a solid price. It was subject to an open bidding price. That, plus the cleanup work helped deliver about $1.8 billion and with the $1.7 billion before, helped us get to the net debt number. So from our point of view, whilst we had solid offers on the table for other assets, those offers didn't match our value criteria at the time, and therefore, we didn't make the sale. From our point of view, it was appropriate and we made, I think, the right calls. In the end, it's easy to reflect back now. But from our point of view, it was the right thing to do at the time and it certainly has given us the flexibility and going forward. And certainly, from an organization point of view, helped demonstrate the changes that we've been talking to and the restructuring that we've done could be achieved and certainly from our point of view, was a real rallying moment for the organization, a very important one, a very positive one.  Consistent with that, we will maintain and keep Moranbah and Grosvenor and the nickel assets in the portfolio. And so I guess the conversation around the portfolio was important, so I'll put the materials aside and kind of talk this through to help get you an insight into how we're thinking.
Firstly, 3 global commodities: Diamonds is a global business. Not all of the assets are Tier 1 assets, but each of the assets add value to the value proposition that we present to our customers. Bruce has configured the organization to deliver sustainable performance and results for the diamond industry, and he has our supports on a number of France, whether it's technical or other areas. That business has been configured to perform and deliver on a global scale.  Similarly, platinum, although it's not the same industry and there are lots of learnings that are going on between the 2 businesses, again, Chris has the most significant platinum business in the world, and we run and set that up as a platinum business and it is on a global scale. Copper is not yet at the scale we'd like it to be, but it's certainly with the assets we have, we believe we can improve the business both in terms of quality and contribution it makes and that will take time. We will be patient. We will be disciplined. But it is a business that has global scale potential.  The fourth part of the portfolio, we'd call very deliberately bulks and other minerals around 18 months ago. Our assets that have technical similarities, operational similarities, Seamus has aligned the operations and is sharing best practices across the bulk assets, the thermal coal, the met coal, the iron ore businesses, Minas-Rio, and the learnings that we have for each of those businesses are being shared as we continue to improve their performance. Very different in nature, but the most important point we make is they're good assets. They aren't in of themselves global in scale. So it's not a global met coal business or a global thermal coal business or a global iron ore business that's relative to competitors. And so we configure them differently because we find this far more efficient and effective in terms of the way we've structured the overall business. And for us, that works. So the focus will be on quality assets, so it's an asset quality strategy, but it's also a strategy that pays attention to the nature of the commodities we're, looking to drive returns in those businesses that are appropriate for the scale and the way we've positioned the business in those markets.
We've articulated those points in these bullets, and I'll let you read those. But I do, though, will make 1 observation in relation to South Africa. In defining the strategy going forward, we talked about what we would do in South Africa and where our focus will be. The first thing I would say about South Africa is that we've restructured the business as we have the global business and we've improve productivities in South Africa by more than 40%. We've reduced our costs in the same sort of 30% range, learning from all parts of the business. And that improvement has been done with stakeholders, even though there have been tough conversations, the government has been constructive as you would expect them to be, and with our other stakeholders in the country, we've been able to navigate significant change in the Kumba scenario, the thermal coal scenario, Chris' restructuring of  platinum. All of those conversations have been tough but required, have been necessary and we've improved all of our businesses. They're all making cash. They're all making a contribution, and that's the first or that was our starting point in terms of making sure we had a good business in South Africa.
The third  pint that when I talk about South Africa and I think we are in an important moment in terms of policy certainty, the focus on the MPRDI, the Mining Charter and general fiscal arrangements to make sure that we encourage in what investment South Africa important issues for us. As we stand here today, we can manage our assets, manage our operations for the long term and make a real contribution to Anglo American. If at the same time there are conversations around opportunity to do something different, we're open to those conversations. One key criteria: it has to add value for all of our shareholders, and that's the position we take. So we're happy with what we've got. We believe we can continue to improve and make the contribution, and that's where we stand.  If there's another opportunity for another or another opportunity for another conversation, then we're open. But it has to be on the basis that delivers value for our shareholders.  I'm sure I'll probably get a few more questions on that point. 
Targeting further improvement, as was said, for 2017, a lot of opportunities we've identified, and we will continue to improve and as many of you know, that quest to improve it never ends. We've been quite specific so far. we've identified $0.5 billion or $500 million that we've hardwired into each of the operating plans. We've also identified another $250 million of opportunity that have been worked on as we speak in terms of plans, and we're working to identify and bring to book another $250 million to deliver an EBITDA during the course of the year. It's certainly a stretch. I won't under its underestimate the challenge we see. I certainly believe in a cash basis, we can deliver that type of number certainly on a much more confident basis. But for us, we want to drive that EBITDA improvement and continue that improvement basis that we've got going through the business, and everyone's focused on delivering those improvements. And I think that's an important piece of work for us and certainly will be in and up important update that we'll give at the half year.
In terms of guidance on the full year numbers, again, René has packed the numbers. EBITDA improvements that we're targeting, capital will be around the same number. The free cash flow, you have to adjust for compared to last year, we have to adjust for working capital and some ins and outs and again. René has provided the reconciliation. So those number should land. We would certainly see the net debt at less than 7. As Rene pointed out, we're making good progress at this part of the year. Folks are obviously helping us the moment, and so I think it's a bit too early for us to book that on a full year basis. But certainly, we've had a good start, and we thought it was appropriate to advise you we were up to in January, given what we've seen on the books in particular.  And that range that we're looking for, I think, is very important and certainly we'll be making sure that our friends at the rating agencies are aware of where we are.
Finally, in terms of that theme, delivering change, building resistance -- resilience, it's a Freudian slip. We're building a portfolio, high quality, long-life assets. We will continue to rollout the operating model because at the end of the day, the disciplines, the structure, the process that, that would require, those require us to think differently and operate differently and it really does provide, I think, a very solid platform for longer-term improvement. And so the conversation each year has to be about how much better can we do. We've got the foundations in place. Still a lot of work to be done. Free cash flow generation remains the imperative. We need to keep generating and making sure that we've got the flexibility to deliver on the potential we have in terms of our next phase of evolution. This year is about the discipline and making sure that we're doing things right, get the balance sheet where it needs to be in this role. I think volatility will be the key word of the day, and therefore, we need to have a much more flexible balance sheet. On capital management, we will maintain our discipline, returns to our shareholders are a priority. And from that point of view, shareholders come first in terms of dividends. So by the end of the year, we want to be in a position to make that commitment and hold that commitment. And from our point of view, the discipline is expressed through the balance sheet is absolutely critical.
So there are the numbers. Before I open the conversation up to questions, did want to make a couple of points. Firstly, I'd like to thank René for the contribution that he's made to the organization. I think his contribution, making sure that we kept our liquidity in the right place as we navigated the major projects I think has been a very important point. One that might have missed a little bit in 2015, again René, thank you for the contribution you've made to the group.  I think for many, wind the clock 18 months, it was a very tough set of conversations and appropriately so. What I would like to do is acknowledge the work of everyone in the room here, the executives, my colleagues and all of our employees. Many of our employees are watching this presentation so I think it's important to acknowledge them. The one thing they all know and we all know is we still have a long way to go in delivering on the potential in the business. So we just say [indiscernible] a lot of work to be done. We've still got, I think, a lot of catch-up to get ourselves to the front of the industry. But we've made some good gains. We've got a lot more work to be done. I think it was a more important to make that point to yourselves. And then finally, to think many of you for the support that you provided. And in some cases, the tough conversations have been direct conversations and certainly from our point of view, people have made us think differently and we've continued to evolve the business and I'd like to think today is a bit rather than we were 12 months ago and I hope I can say that again next year and beyond.
So I thank you for the support, thank you for being here today, and we're very happy to take questions."

So very healthy capital competition across the portfolio. We do take into account a global commodity position in thinking about that, but all of the assets will have, in our view the right capital to make sure they're delivering good returns. But we'll take that commodity point into account. In terms of long-life assets, what we see there is there are assets that do have long-life and are very competitive, but we said we need to consider putting on the block to manage debt. We're clear that, that was the imperative. We still have those 3 global commodities, very much in focus and I will continue to get our support. But what we have said we've got another set of assets that are high-quality, long-life and will continue to make a contribution and they have a place in the portfolio. We've got the debt to where we wanted and we've got great potential. In the case of Kumba more specifically, I think the technical opportunities that we've been working on for a couple of years around the DMS plant and those opportunities suggest to us that [indiscernible] got better than 20 years life. Still to be worked through, but certainly good potential. So from my point of view, it has certainly the potential to remain in the portfolio, they're going to continue to improve. And other assets we continue to make improvements on. So we think what we've identified in the portfolio fits with the focus on asset quality and long-life in areas that we can add value. And therefore, they can remain in the portfolio. We will continue to do some cleanup as we go, assess it to get to an age where we don't think there's much more we can do. We will sell. I think that discipline is something that we have to be much tougher on and turning assets over. So managing the portfolio. I think that's very important for us. And in terms of South Africa, the point I've made is very clear, that for us, with the portfolio we have, we can operate and manage that portfolio and manage the financial issues quite effectively in our current configuration. It's my view over time that bulk will probably come off a bit in terms of the relative contribution. And so the difference in the 2 jurisdictions will change a little bit over time, but we can operate very happily in our current configuration. At the same time, if there are other ways or opportunities to improve how South Africa sits in the portfolio, then we're also very open to having the conversation. But it has to deliver value to all of our shareholders, okay? Yes?"

When we stood up in '13, we talked about strategy in 4 parts. We talked about cleaning up the portfolio and getting ourselves back in the game being competitive, that was driving value. We delivered and you see that in production -- productivity, costs, capital efficiencies, that part, I think, from our point of view, we made good progress on. Secondly, we said that we needed to restructure the business and the change the way we were running the assets. And so significant leadership change the way we've organized the functional model, the whole approach to running the business is very different. Third which we actually changed and our key presses. The industrial -- the adoption of a more industrial model, the marketing model is very different to what the majors were doing in this space. We've got a trading model, a sales model, we've tried to pitch and we saw this big opportunity to improve our margins across the board, hit our marketing model. That was the third element. The fourth element was portfolio where we said that we would look to focus on those quality assets because you'll remember we did a comparison of margins against our major competitors and I said we're well behind our competitors in terms of margins. And that we're going to have to change the nature of the way we ran the business, the first 3, and the portfolio to close that gap. So we're closing the gap, we're not there yet, we've certainly had to take a more aggressive approach to the portfolio restructuring hence to get the balance sheet down. So if you like, the way I talk to it, and I've used the word before and you can use whatever word you like. What we said is we tried to be [indiscernible] to deal with the debt, which I think was the right thing to do, and we're pivoting back. So we would certainly argue that we've adjusted the strategy to deal with a tough set of circumstances, which was appropriate. And we've now pivoted back to where we were, which is an asset focus strategy, cognizant of the portfolio that we have and the commodities we have. And regarding your final point, I think the commodity mix we have is actually quite unique. So you might think about that a little bit differently to where we are against our competitors. But secondly, the real gap between ourselves and our competitors on margins, we're closing the gap. We've got a lot more work to do, but what we want to do and provide to our shareholders is a different set of options in terms of the commodities that can be exposed, and that's a function of the assets you have. But the quality of the assets is a driver. There is this quote that I heard the other day, which I quite like. There are no bad commodities, only bad projects, and for us, it's about the quality of the assets. And what we try to do is preserve those assets in the portfolio that we think we can add value in over time and continue to improve margins and returns. That's what we think we can do and make a difference, and people will make their own decisions about the commodities that we'd like to be exposed. So I'll cover that fall sweep. I'll go here in the now come here."

So we'd be open in terms of the conversation there. My comment was more around Kumba and export thermal coal, our Anglo type assets, but at the same time, we're open to a conversation, and therefore, from our point of view, the statement we're making is we're very confident is that over time, we continue to navigate and be successful in South Africa. That's a commitment. But at the same time, if there are other opportunities to create value for our shareholders, we're open. And so we are making positions pretty clear. But we're supporters and what we want to see is more certainty, and we will be positive and constructive contributors to the debate. On Quellaveco, what we said -- is we want to be by the end of the year. We'll watch the copper price carefully. I think everyone's got to be careful. I know there's a quote of $2.70 in the paper and I was asked the question of where I said we think that's a pretty good price for copper. However, we think at the moment Escondido is a factor in the price, plus some other issues around uncertainty of the majors being able to deliver on their commitments. So we are not yet convinced that copper is in the right direction and from our point of view, we would need to be convinced that it's the right thing for copper and that's certainly [indiscernible] in '17 from our perspective we've got a lot of work to do. We will take that up in '18 but it will be a really serious consideration around of the market. We're in a good [indiscernible] with our colleagues in Peru, and so we'll continue to engage and try and do right thing. But right before time.

We've delivered our 26%-plus, in fact, we're north of 27% on our ownership. So we think we're in good shape. The only area where we're down near the 26% was I think on the thermal coal on a technical glitch on production so for us, not enough exposure in terms of the assets. So we're pretty happy with our position, but really is making sure to go forward position is the right one."

But one we're very conscious of and certainly we've worked with Neil and the guys on things that we were doing and I know they have taken stuff on and doing other things to improve that performance. At Amandelbult, looking at technical changes, looking at what we could mechanize over time, so Chris has got a long-term incremental strategy to improve the contribution from Amandelbult and Tumela.

Those 3 points have been made very strongly. On growth, Hunter, people know that we've got 35 million-carat installed capacity and it's a bit unfair to say that Bruce wriggles his way and puppet out. The market but we were produced to the market may not going to get ahead of ourselves or the market. We have other incremental opportunities that make sense but only when the market's in the right position. And that conversation could equally apply to copper, to platinum in Chris's case. And in Chris' discipline 40% reduction in our own mine production. So we're really focused on the quality of our production and the margins across of that part of the business and improving the efficiency of our processing operation. So we improve our margins on par that's why the marketing work is also so important to improve those margins in both parts of the business.

Second point on commodities, there is still a lot of iron ore and coal around the world, and over time, I don't think any of the fundamental parameters that we talked to have changed. But when you get the problems that we saw in China, you might get a site in Queensland and the other things, there's 1 thing that we do observe is the market is pretty balanced. And so it can away short periods of time pretty dramatically. That volatility, I think, is actually the keyword for us in these commodity markets. The other thing is you have to be flexible. You have to think and watch what's happening in the marketplace. We believe we made the right call in staking out what we had to do to fix the business and the fact I'm still standing here probably is testament that we made that call generally right. However, what we'd also see as we will continue to be a volatile market, that we have to watch it carefully and make the right positions them. The key thing that we talked about this time last year was holding through to the value conversation, and that has kept us in the right place. And that changes in the short term because how do you value a coal asset at $300 a tonne is it going to be 3 months or 6 months? And you've probably got a reasonable change of estimating what are going to be there, when you put those numbers together, think we've made the right call. So we will continue to change. The one thing I know, this industry will continue to change. What we do know is we've got some commodities there.

You made an observation I don't know if you could do this, Paul, if you look at the price volatility we saw at our commodities, if you go to the midpoint of 2016, which was the low point, we think, in certainly the most recent cycles, one of the tests we've asked ourselves is can we deliver cash and still make the right decisions in the business at that point? And the answer is yes. Now this business is a very different business to where we were even 18 months ago on the basis of that test. And I think you've got to continually test the business, can you may cash at the bottom of the cycle or what you think might be the bottom of the cycle and make sure you're performance is geared and that your efficient than you continually interesting yourself about sides and that's one of the things that I think we have to keep in touch with across the business on a go-forward basis.

And our focus has to be to continue to improve the business to ensure that we deliver free cash flow under literally any market scenario that is thrown at us. And I will talk to and point to a couple of points during the presentation to reinforce that key issue for us. And to me and to us, that is the definition of a resilient business: your ability to handle anything the market throws at you.
Now in developing and talking to the 2016 story, we'll actually use this flow. We'll talk about delivering on commitments. We will talk to the operational improvement, go to the balance sheet. René will obviously pick up the financials. And I will talk specifically to the portfolio approach towards the end of the conversation. And obviously, we'll then have Q&A, and I'm sure you'll have quite a few questions.
I think, firstly, on commitments. Free cash flow, significant for the year, $2.6 billion versus $0.4 billion. For us, the importance of that number, I think, is best considered when you look at our average prices 2015 versus 2016. In fact, we saw about a 3% drop in our average prices on our commodity basket. And so the work that we've done is substantially stuff that we've driven, and I think that's an important point to make through the presentation. Clearly, the free cash flow drove the net debt performance. And that number is obviously being contributed on a number of fronts, and again, René will pick that up. But certainly, well below the $10 billion target. And yes, disposals did make a material contribution, but we didn't have to go as far as we originally indicated to achieve those numbers. So we're pleased with progress, a lot more to be done.
On the operating side, we've seen continuing improvements through each of the operations. And in particular, when you look at EBITDA margin, despite a 3% drop in prices for the full year, our EBITDA margins actually gone from 21% to 26%. So we're really pleased with that aspect of the performance and for us probably one of the most important numbers to focus on in terms of what we've done and also where we need to go to continue to improve the quality of the results that we're delivering.
On the balance sheet, again from our point of view, very important that we'll get to investment-grade rating. In the end, the numbers are getting in that territory. For us, we can't forecast when the rating agents may look favorably upon the change. And René will give you his views on that, but for us, we'll do everything to make sure we get there as quick as we can. More specifically, we are targeting a reinstatement of the dividend by year-end, to be paid in 2018. On the portfolio, we'll continue to clean up -- continue the clean-up work that we defined when we talked about the portfolio back in '13 and '14. Our recently announced Union sale is an example of that continuing cleanup, but at the same time, I'll make the point that, as far as deleveraging the balance sheet, we are not required to make disposals to help us position because we see our free cash flow and the work that we're doing inside the business with the ability to deliver on our debt targets. So it'll be about portfolio cleanup. And again, I'll talk a little bit about that to give you more color through the presentation. Finally and to be very specific, we will retain Moranbah, Grosvenor and the coking coal and the nickel assets as well. And as I said, I'll pick that conversation up around the portfolio a little bit later.
On the results and going straight to the numbers, I think these numbers best describe -- these 6 numbers best describe Anglo American in 2016: EBITDA, a good result, again considering the basket price had dropped 3%. So we got a 25% improvement on where we were in 2015. Cost and volume improvements actually represent around a $200 billion -- a $2 billion improvement for the full year. We did have some headwinds. Net, we're about $1.5 billion -- $1.6 billion in cash terms. And we had a $100 million adjustment due to platinum inventories. Again, we'll pick that up a little bit later, but on a cash basis we had -- we hit the $1.6 billion. On capital, we continue to hold our discipline across the organization. I think that's critical. And you'll see what we're forecasting for '17. The attributable free cash flow reflects the volume and cost work we did across the business. The net debt-EBITDA is a straight calculation. And obviously, the net debt number is certainly for us a very important number that we were focusing on for the full year. We've made good progress, but there's still a lot for us to do. And certainly, we are not [ph] going down to the next phase of improvement during the course of this year. We'll talk about that a little bit later.
I've got to say that across the business the one disappointment that we've reported is in safety. With 11 fatalities, it's both disappointing. Or if I could say, more importantly, it's unacceptable. The focus on critical controls, the planning of the work through the operating model is where our focus is, and we still obviously have a lot of work to do. The good news is a 24% improvement in our total recorded injury rate was encouraging. And at the end of the day, if we're not managing the key risks, then we remain exposed, and that's unacceptable. On the environmental side, we've done a lot of work. We've really focused on measuring what we're doing and how we're performing. And the reduction, almost an 85% reduction, in the incidents reported, I think, does talk to the planning work and the focus on the detail. And for us, it goes with cost reductions, productivity improvements and the overall business in -- performance. So we've got to get the safety right. A lot of work going into that by everyone in this room and through the organization.
On production. If I work from the right-hand side, 2% overall. Nickel, with the commissioning of the Barro Alto furnace, that we actually hit the full rate during Q3. So pleased with the good progress there. On iron ore, obviously supported by the continuing ramp-up at Minas-Rio. Guys have done some good work there. Kumba, with all of the restructuring during the course of the year, we're pretty happy with the numbers that were ultimately delivered. Chris and the guys continue to do very well on the finished platinum side. Yes, we had a couple of problems during the year, but overall the performance was solid. De Beers, reflecting the market, making sure that we're balancing our production to market demand, so a good recovery from 2015. In both the coal regions or the 3 coal regions, really solid work, restructuring, even with some sales, done a good job on the operating side. Productivity has continued to improve. And so some really good work across the portfolio.
On copper, I won't talk too much about the mid-year issues that we talked on Los Bronces. Since then, the guys have delivered the numbers. The good news, I think, from the copper side, and we saw those in the half year numbers, was the cost work. And so Duncan and the guys were able to improve their EBITDA contribution, and that was really a function of the very good work done on the copper side.
So overall, we're happy with the results. Yes, we could do better in terms of the areas that we had a few headwinds, but overall the numbers were pretty solid and supported much better performance on the cost side. And that's really where our focus was. On a full basis, we've reflected 9%, which is normalized for the portfolio changes. I think you'll see a headline number of 10% reduction. That's just how the numbers actually landed for the full year; nickel reflecting Barro Alto's contribution; very good progress in iron ore, particularly at Kumba. And you know that we've come from the $77 a tonne break-even price to $29 for the year. I'll talk to that a little bit later. So a good performance there. Minas-Rio, also making a contribution. I think Seamus and the guys made good progress there even with a constrained footprint, some good work on the cost side. De Beers, Bruce and the team focusing on the efficiency work, obviously helped by getting the volumes out. Coal Australia, again a good focus on costs. And they've come a long way. Don't forget in Australia in particular we're down more than 50%, so continuing good work. And in South Africa, some good progress. SA export coal, I'll pick that up. And copper, as I said, despite the volume challenges, good work on the cost side.
For us, the words we use are, ""the relentless pursuit of operations improvement,"" and I think, at the end of the day, costs, as we -- the rubber really hits the road. And I think we've made good progress but a lot more work to be done in terms of underlying efficiencies.
On the EBITDA, cost and volume improvement you can see that on the cost side we were forecasting around $900 million contribution. We actually delivered about $1.2 billion, so we're pleased with the progress. On the volume side, we were expecting a bit of a higher contribution, particularly with De Beers. We did see some headwinds with the smelter failure at -- the Waterval smelter failure and the Los Bronces issue in copper which we dealt with at the half year. So net-net, we saw a $400 million contribution on the volume side. That got us on a cash basis to a $1.6 billion performance improvement across the portfolio. The platinum noncash inventory adjustment, we do the inventories on an annual basis. In 2015, it was $180 million contribution. This year, it was $80 million, so the difference in the $100 million is what we've recorded there. And so we do that inventory adjustment. It's in the range of expected outcomes, so there were no big surprises there, but it does have an impact. And it shows as a noncash, but it is something we should report on the basis that it talks to our run rate that we talked to earlier this year. So this is where the numbers are.
For us, when we look at what we can do. And I talked about the word or used the word ""resilient."" We recorded a 3% drop in our commodity basket price. I noticed some of the press stuff [ph] this morning was saying we got saved by commodity prices. In fact, during '16, our basket was actually on average below the 2015 numbers. Certainly, a great recovery in the second half, and we're enjoying that and still enjoying some of that recovery, but the improvement from 21% to 26%, this is -- I think, makes the most important statement for the business. 3 years ago, we talked about improving our margins in tougher environments. And for us, that's where we've got to keep doing as much work as we can. And the second last bullet there, the marketing activities and marketing's contribution to that margin improvement has been also very strong. I'm very pleased with the progress that Peter and his team have made in their work. And they've delivered more than the $400 million we were targeting back in 2013, so very pleased with their contribution.
On a commodity-by-commodity basis, diamonds, as you would expect, where the market's starting to stabilize and certainly providing movement for products, we were able to deliver volume and cost improvement on the business. In looking forward, we'll continue to work closely with our customers to make sure that we're in the right conversations, with an understanding how the market is balanced so that we're making the right decisions. On the quality side, Gahcho Kué will make a bigger contribution this year and for us a very important part of the quality improvement that we're looking for across the portfolio to support margin improvement. And our production range forecast for the year is 31 million to 33 million carats. That's based on what we believe the market will certainly support in its current configuration. I think we've got to be a bit careful with the first site because there was some stock movement in those numbers. So I don't want people to get too excited. We've made the point, Bruce has made the point we've just got to keep an eye on the market. And we'll make sure that we stay very close to our customers in particular.
On platinum, we've been working right across the portfolio on improvement. Chris, you'll see, is here, jumping up and down in terms of the results. The sale of Rustenburg, for us, was a very important milestone for the year. And I have to give Chris full credit for the hard work that he put in, with the rest of the team, in making sure that, that got through. For us, the quality of the portfolio and making sure that we're positioned on the left-hand side of the cost curve is where I think we need to be, as we still see a bit of platinum around. And over time as the market moves our way, we should be the beneficiaries, particularly with our assets, on the right side -- on left-hand side literally of the cost curve. But there is still some more work to be done, good progress and certainly very good progress on the portfolio restructuring front.
On copper, on volumes, we're unable to rely on volumes to help us with our efficiencies, but really good work on the costs side. As I said, I won't get back through the half year challenges we had, other than to say that the guys have done a good job in the last 6 months continuing on the cost-reduction front and making a very solid contribution. Our production guidance for 2017 remains in similar ballpark. We're more focused on the margins on copper and make sure that we've got the right things happening in the business. On El Soldado, some of you would have heard that there is a debate with the government regarding some of the approvals. If we remember, back 18 months ago, we were on the wrong side of cash flow at El Soldado some $100 million. We've restructured, made a lot of changes. And it's now making a positive contribution and would have made a positive contribution back at prices at that time, so there's been significant improvement. I think it'll be next 3 or 4 weeks where we'll sort out what we need to do to get approvals going forward, but at the same time, if we're not able to agree and we don't believe that the operation will be making a contribution, then we won't continue going forward with the operation. We'd like to think that we can work something through with the government and get the right licenses in place, but if not, we'll make the right decisions in -- with regard to each asset has to pull its weight and make a contribution.
On coal, the Australian operations again have been leaders in improvement across the business; and certainly doing very well on any comparative basis, unit costs in the lowest we've seen since 2006. Grosvenor has made its first contribution. It's 7 months ahead of schedule, so that's significant. We've continued to clean up the portfolio through Callide and Foxleigh. And sorry, I should make one other comment on Grosvenor: We're still in the first longwall block. We have experienced geotechnical challenges that we're getting on top of. It's quite normal in your first block where you've got what we'd call virgin stresses around the wall to see some challenges. Usually, things get better in the second and third blocks, but we're making good progress. And we'll watch that closely and keep the people updated on the progress that we're making. In terms of going forward, we're forecasting somewhere between 19 and 21 million tonne. Again, the guys are doing really good work on the cost side. Grosvenor will obviously be an important part of that production recovery -- or production forecast over the next 12 months.
In South Africa and Colombia, good progress. Certainly in South Africa the productivity work has been exceptional. We're actually up 45% on the last 3 years, so again good progress there. As a consequence, we've actually kept our costs at 2013 levels. There is still more we can do, and that, Seamus, with the team, is focusing on the continuing improvements that we can make. But I'd have to say that what it does demonstrate is that in South Africa we can be competitive with anyone in the world. We've still got a long way to go to match numbers that we're delivering elsewhere, but the progress has been very good, and so from my point of view, very pleased with the progress. And credit to the team for doing the hard work. And we still see lots of opportunities in Colombia as well. Again, the forecast there, the real focus for us is productivity improvements, getting our costs and continuing to improve our costs to make sure we can handle anything the market throws at us.
Kumba, most people are aware of the amount of restructuring that we've done. It has been a bit of a journey, taken a bit longer than we would like, but at the same time, if you go back to where we started with a $77 a tonne break-even price, we delivered for the full year $29 a tonne break-even price. I will put a cautionary point around the $29. It is a volatile number depending on where foreign exchange is and oil prices are, and so it can move anywhere between $30 and $40. The team is focused on continuing to improve the underlying performance and so that we're doing the best we can with what we've got, but the move from $77 to $29 substantially reflects good work of the team and in particular in '16, with not a lot of help in '15 on FX and oil, but in '16, it's primarily been the restructuring and the changes that we've made inside the business. For example, the downsizing by 40% was the important part of the improvements that have been delivered this year. So for me, that's a really important point to make. And credit to the team in the progress they've made. We all understand there's a lot more work to be done, but so far, we're very pleased with progress. And we'll certainly continue to encourage the guys to look for every opportunity to improve the business.
Similar story at Minas-Rio, improvements. We are constrained, as we said, by the pit room until we get the final license or the third phased license, which we expect to get by the end of '18. But at the same time, Seamus and the team have done really well on the cost side. Our FOB numbers are pretty solid. In fact, FOB costs are inside the range that we forecast at full production rates. Yes, we're getting a little bit of a help from the real, but don't forget we pegged it at around 4 [ph]. I think we're at about 3.2, 3.3 [ph] at the moment, so we've made good progress. They've pulled out overheads and indirect costs. We'll continue to focus on getting that configuration right. And once we get a bit more pit room, we end up getting a bit of balance in the feed, and so there's an opportunity to improve those costs once we open the pit up. But we're expecting that license to come through in '18, a really important milestone, and we'll keep you posted on the progress as we go through that.
Finally, for those that get really excited when people talk about nickel. It has been an important transition for us as we brought Barro Alto on today. For those that check these things and the ramp-up curves for the new generation of laterite deposits. It's been the best performer based on the new laterites, and that's in the last 6 or 7 years. We've still got some performance improvement we can deliver through consistency. I guess, from our point of view, a bit more patience will be required on the marketing side, but certainly we're not leaving the business in the hands of the markets. We will continue to improve the operations and again really pleased with the progress that's been made and what the team has delivered from Barro Alto with the new furnace. And I think we hit full rate in Q3, and we've kept it at a pretty consistent rate all the way through.
I think, with that, I'll hand across to René to unpack the financials based on that performance. And then I'll pick up the strategy after René. [indiscernible]."

And I would like to start by thanking the management team for the strong performance and allowing me to present a very strong set of results.So first goes through the key financial for 2016. So a very strong EBITDA number of $6.",1051,"Good morning, everybody. And I would like to start by thanking the management team for the strong performance and allowing me to present a very strong set of results.
So first goes through the key financial for 2016. So a very strong EBITDA number of $6.1 billion, an increase of 25%. A lower tax rate at 25%, it's really on the back of 2 special items. First, in Australia we were able to use some unrecognized tax reserves, especially with the strong performance in coking coal in the second half of 2016, but also the change in tax regime in Chile for withholding tax and the impact on the deferred tax assets. Going forward, we expect the tax rate to be between 30% and 32%, obviously depending on the structure of the portfolio. CapEx, down to $2.5 billion. And as you know, we commissioned 2 projects in 2016, Gahcho Kué in Canada, in De Beers; and Grosvenor, the new longwall operation in Australia. We still have some spending in Minas-Rio in Brazil.
Very strong shift in cash flow from negative cash flow of $1 billion in 2015 to a positive cash flow of $2.6 billion in 2016. Disposal proceed of $1.8 billion, predominantly in the second half of this year. And we closed, we completed the sale of niobium and phosphate and the sale of our 10% stake in Exxaro in South Africa for $200 million.
So net debt, down to $8.5 billion at the end of December, which represents a net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.4x on a pro forma basis. We maintain the same focus on costs, operational performance and CapEx. And we keep getting the benefit, obviously, of higher -- high commodity prices. And at end of January, our net debt was in fact down to $8.1 billion, so continued to good -- make good progress in term of strengthening the balance sheet.
Turning to the EBITDA waterfall. On the left-hand side, you see the uncontrollable elements. Mark mentioned the slight year-on-year basket price decline, a 3% negative impact of $100 million, but there was a strong recovery, as you know, in the second half of the year. The point-to-point increase, so from end of June to end of December, for our basket price was 27%. So the 25% increase in EBITDA was really driven by the cost and volume improvement, a net impact of $1.5 billion that Mark covered earlier. And then you had the impact of the platinum noncash inventory adjustment and the impact of the disposal both in '15 and '16.
Turning to the reduction in net debt. So overall, a reduction of $4.4 billion from $12.9 billion to $8.5 billion at the end of December. I will cover in more detail working capital and CapEx. Just to maybe clarify on what happened with the tax side and on the interest charge: On the tax side, we had also the benefit in Chile of accelerating the tax depreciation, and we had a tax refund of close to $200 million in 2016. So I think some of you were surprised by the much lower cash impact on the tax line. That's what's behind this lower number. On the interest side also needs some explanation. On the cash standpoint, we will get the benefit of the lower debt in 2017. That will reduce, from a cash standpoint, interest charge by $200 million, but from a P&L standpoint, as we have now commissioned Grosvenor and Minas-Rio, we will capitalize less. And the net impact from a P&L standpoint will be in fact an increase of $200 million.
So net debt down to $8.5 billion. Our objective is to have a net debt-to-EBITDA between 1x and 1.5x using long-term prices. Our EBITDA number using both our internal forecast and the market consensus, net EBITDA [ph] roughly around $6.5 billion. So we would like the level of net debt to be closer to $6 billion to $6.5 billion. I think we agree that we need to run the business with probably a more conservative balance sheet.
Turning to the -- what happened in term of gross debt and where we are in term of liquidity. So a 27% decline in gross debt in 2016. So we had obviously the impact of the maturity in 2016 but also the liability management exercise that we did earlier in the year and the repayment of a BNDES loan in Brazil for $1.7 billion. So that will help us reduce the level of interest charge that I mentioned earlier in 2017. Liquidity has been critical over the last 2 years. That was very important for us as we were going through the downturn and the pressure. We have maintained a very strong liquidity close to $16 billion. As we -- there is still some volatility in term of prices and we continue to make progress on deleveraging the balance sheet, but we expect the level of liquidity to be adjusted going forward as we make more progress in term of reducing the level of net debt. And you see the maturity over the next 3 years, so around $6 billion of bond maturing of the -- in '17, '18 and '19.
Working capital. So a net reduction of $400 million, and that's the impact of the higher prices in -- especially in the last months of 2016. We got the benefit of optimizing our level of inventory in De Beers, a benefit of $300 million; as well as our ability to renegotiate some debtors, some deal with some clients involving some prepayment and also some supplier payment terms.
CapEx. So down to $2.5 billion compared to $4 billion in 2015 and in excess of $6 billion in the prior years. We expect the level of CapEx to be maintained at this level in '17 and '18, the benefit of the commissioning of the projects that I mentioned earlier, but there will be an increase in SIB CapEx as we commission some new project, for example, Minas-Rio and Grosvenor.
And then in term of disposals. So $3.5 billion over the last 2 years, so including $1.8 billion in 2016. And you have the breakdown between niobium and phosphates back [ph] that we completed in September and the sale of our stake in Exxaro in December.
Thank you."

Since w",3425,"Thank you very much, René.
I will just quickly give a bit more flavor around the progress we've made, talk a little bit about the portfolio and then just update you on guidance and give a few final comments.
Firstly, in terms of change overall. Since we started the significant work we've been doing since '13, on the organization front we've basically streamlined and reduced the numbers across the business both as a consequence of focusing on the assets that can add material value, the way we run those assets, the way we operate and the way we work together as an organization. And so there has been a lot of work done, still more to be done, but from our point of view, that was a very important part of the strategy that we outlined back in '13. And we've made good progress but, again, looking to continue to improve that work to support our productivity improvements across-the-board. On the portfolio front, we've either sold or closed 27 assets, reducing the portfolio to 41. I think it's a bit overly simplistic to say we're dealing with the tail of clearly that $600 million conversation we had back in December in '15, when we talked about $600 million. The costs associated with those operations is down to $100 million, so we have dealt with the tail, but there will always be some assets that are in different phases that you have to deal with. But certainly from our point of view, that's been a big part of the work we've done but as well as that the ongoing improvements to the portfolio have been absolutely key in helping improve the overall quality of the business that we're running and certainly been very important in improving the margins across the business as we go forward.  Having said that, today, we've also added 5 new projects to the portfolio. So when we talk about margin improvement, it is a function of the work we've done on the portfolio and it's a function of the efficiency work we've done within each of the assets. And so from our perspective, it has been strategic in the way we've gone about the business, with still more to be done particularly on the cleaning up of the portfolio and the efficiency work in particular.
We won't go through the FutureSmart work. We will save that conversation for another day, but for those that saw what we were doing in December and understand what we're trying to do with the cost base on a go-forward basis, there's still a lot of opportunities across the business.
And finally, the operating model is about the way we operate. It's more of an industrial approach to the way we run our assets. Certainly, it's not about 1 or 2 years game. This is a long game that we're playing in operating and improving the business, as is the marketing model. And as I said earlier, Peter and the team have contributed more than $400 million worth of improvements, which was the number we talked to a few years back. And that's from -- literally from the resource right the way through to customers, improving logistics, returning [ph] costs and improving the realized prices that we achieved. And certainly, we'll continue to work on that model, which is different to a trading model or a sales model. It's a very different approach; a lot learned from De Beers and what we're doing in platinum applied to other parts of the business, including bulk. So for us, the whole improvement strategy was not simply about costs. It's about improving every part of the business, drive our margins, drive returns and make sure that from our point of view we're doing the best for our shareholders on a sustainable improvement basis.
On safety and environment, again we've made significant progress, 50% down since we first stood up in 2013, clearly disappointed with how 2016 shaped up, a lot of work going on to make sure that we recover and keep going forward and continue the broader improvement trends. Similar for environment, in the end, knowing that we're doing the work, I think, is the important piece. These things really only come to the fore when you have a problem. What we're going to try and do is continue to improve the discipline, the planning and the work we're doing in improving incidents so that we don't have any large incidents. And that's where we're -- something that we all have to pay attention to in this type of business.
On the operating side, our copper equivalent production, from where we were, is actually up 8%. Now that's from 40% less assets. So clearly, the cleanup has been around the smaller assets and getting a lot more out of the larger-scale, higher-margin type assets. And so as a consequence of all of that work, our copper equivalent unit costs are down 31%. And that's in normal terms, so from our point of view, that's an important number. And cash generation flows from those improvements. For those that do track back to what we talked about in 2013: The underlying, the EBITDA improvement is $3.1 billion delivered against the target. So we've done well against those original targets, and in fact, we've exceeded on most fronts. And capital expenditure, now that the major projects are through, we've seen a 55% reduction in capital. And in terms of underlying capital, we've seen on average 20% to 30% efficiency improvements, which are consistent with what we've done inside the operations with our general operating improvements.
In talking to the story in its most starkest [ph] terms. The blue represents the actual copper equivalent production that we've delivered on a year-on-year basis. So while we've been restructuring the portfolio, selling or closing assets and bringing new assets into play, we've actually held the production or slightly improved our production over that 5-year period. As a consequence of the portfolio work and the efficiency work, the production per person is up 41% from where we were back in 2012. And as a consequence, our actual -- we reported operating costs in U.S. dollars 69%. Now when we talk inflation and FX, there's been a netting generally of those numbers, so the underlying improvements and portfolio changes, I'm not going to say they're both making significant contributions, just improve the quality of the business. That's where our focus will remain going forward, to keep driving those numbers to improve our margins. And with the marketing work and the other elements that we're working through, including the focus on being disciplined on the capital side, looking to improve our returns on a consistent basis as we go forward and put as much of our future in our hands and as we do in terms of commodity prices.
On the portfolio side, I think we need to make a few key points. First, we've been committed to the cleanup. And so when we talk, back in '14, of coming down to around 35, 37 assets, that was about improving the quality and making sure that we were focused on those assets that could drive value and that we were putting our capital in place to deliver the best returns over the long term. A lot of that work or in fact most of that work have been pretty well done. Second, we identified the need to go further on our restructuring program; and as everybody knows the story, in 2015, a pretty dramatic drop in commodity prices. We were confronting a real challenge in diamonds of the pipeline having filled probably in the prior 12 months. The prognosis for China was a bit open. And so from our point of view, we took the decision to drive and effectively put in place a self-help program, accelerated the improvements across the business in terms of costs, pulled our capital in hard but still making sure we remain committed to things like innovation where we knew that we'd have benefits longer-term. And we sold some assets. The one thing we promised our shareholders in all of those conversations and the questions we're asked, you're going to self value [ph], we've said that we would hold ourselves to very strict value criteria. And I think that we held true to that. In the case of niobium and phosphates, the one point we made is that, niobium, we didn't see a long-term opportunity to improve our position there given the size of competitors in the industry. The phosphate business was very much a local market, and therefore from our point of view, the price we realized was almost double consensus numbers. And we thought that, that was a solid price. It was subject to an open bidding process. That, plus the cleanup work, helped deliver about $1.8 billion and, with the $1.7 billion before, helped us get to the net debt number. So from our point of view, whilst we had solid offers on the table for other assets, those offers didn't match our value criteria at the time, and therefore we didn't make the sale. From our point of view, it was appropriate. And we made, I think, the right calls. In the end, it's easy to reflect back now, but from our point of view it was the right thing to do at the time; and certainly has given us the flexibility in going forward; and certainly from an organization point of view helped demonstrate that changes that we've been talking to and the restructuring that we've done could be achieved; and certainly from our point of view was a real rallying moment for the organization, a very important one, a very positive one. Consistent with that, we will maintain and keep Moranbah and Grosvenor and the nickel assets in the portfolio.
I -- so I guess the conversation around the portfolio is important, so I'll put the materials aside and try and talk these through to help you get an insight into how we're thinking. Firstly, 3 global commodities: Diamonds is a global business. Not all of the assets are Tier 1 assets, but each of the assets add value to the value proposition that we present to our customers. Bruce has configured the organization to deliver sustainable performance and results for the diamond industry. And he has our support on a number of fronts, whether it's technical or in other areas. That business has been configured to perform and deliver on a global scale. Similarly, platinum, although it's not the same industry and there are lots of learnings that are going on between the 2 businesses, again, Chris has the most significant platinum business in the world. And we run and set that up as a platinum business, and it is on a global scale. Copper is not yet at the scale we'd like it to be, but certainly with the assets we have, we believe we can improve the business both in terms of the quality and the contribution it makes. And that will take time. We will be patient. We will be disciplined, but it is a business that has global scale potential.
The fourth part of the portfolio we'd called very deliberately bulks and other minerals around 18 months ago are assets that have technical similarities, operational similarities. And Seamus has aligned the operations; and is sharing best practices across the bulk assets, the thermal coal, the met coal, the iron ore businesses, Minas-Rio. And the learnings that we have from each of those businesses are being shared as we continue to improve their performance. Very different in nature, but the most important point we make is that they're good assets. They aren't in of themselves global in scale, so it's not a global met coal business or a global thermal coal business or a global iron ore business. And that's relative to competitors. And so we configure them differently because we find setting this up is far more efficient and effective in terms of the way we've structured the overall business. And for us, that works. So the focus will be on quality assets, so it's an asset quality strategy, but it's also a strategy that pays attention to the nature of the commodities we're in, looking to drive returns in those businesses that are appropriate for the scale and the way we've positioned the business in those markets.
We've articulated those points in these bullets, and I'll let you read those, but I do -- will make one observation in relation to South Africa. In defining the strategy going forward, we talked about what we would do in South Africa and where our focus would be. The first thing I would say about South Africa is that we've restructured the business as we have the global business, and we've improved productivities in South Africa by more than 40%. We've reduced our costs in the same sort of 30% range, learning from all parts of the business. And that improvement has been done with stakeholders. Even though there have been tough conversations, the government has been constructive, albeit tough, as you'd expect them to be. And with our other stakeholders in the country, we've been able to navigate significant change in the Kumba scenario, the thermal coal scenario, Chris's restructuring of platinum. All of those conversations have been tough but required, have been necessary. And we've improved all of our businesses. They're all making cash. They're all making a contribution. And that's the first -- or that was our starting point in terms of making sure we have a good business in South Africa.
The third point that -- when I talk about South Africa and I think we are in an important moment in terms of policy certainty. The focus on the MPRDA, the Mining Charter and general fiscal arrangements to make sure that we encourage inward investment to South Africa are all important issues for us. As we stand here today, we can manage our assets, manage our operations for the long term and make a real contribution to Anglo American. If at the same time there are conversations around opportunity to do something different, we're open to those conversations. One key criteria: It has to add value for all of our shareholders, and that's the position we take. So we're happy with what we've got. We believe we can continue to improve and make a contribution, and that's where we stand. If there is another opportunity for another -- or an opportunity for another conversation, then we're open, but it has to be on the basis that delivers value for all shareholders, yes. I'm sure I'll probably get a few more questions on that point.
Targeting further improvement. As was said, for 2017, a lot of opportunities we've identified, and we will continue to improve. And as many of you know, the quest to improve never ends. We've been quite specific. So far, we've identified the $0.5 billion or $500 million that we've hardwired into each of the operating plans. We've also identified another $250 million of opportunity that are being worked on as we speak in terms of plans. And we're working to identify and bring to book another $250 million to deliver on EBITDA during the course of the year. It's certainly a stretch. I won't underestimate the challenge we see. I certainly believe on a cash basis we can deliver that type of number certainly on a much more confident basis, but for us, we want to drive that EBITDA improvement and continue that improvement basis that we've got going through the business. And everyone is focused on delivering those improvements. And I think that's an important piece of work for us and certainly will be an important update that we give at the half year.
In terms of guidance on the full year numbers. Again, René has unpacked the numbers. EBITDA, the improvements that we're targeting, capital will be around the same number. The free cash flow, you have to adjust for -- compared to last year. You have to adjust for working capital and some ins and outs. And again, René has provided a reconciliation, so those numbers should land. We would certainly see the net debt at less than $7 billion. As René pointed out, we're making good progress at this part of the year. Bulks are obviously helping us at the moment. And so I think it's a bit too early for us to book that on a full year basis, but certainly we've had a good start, and we thought it was appropriate to advise you where we're up to in January given what we've seen on the bulks in particular. And that range that we're looking for, I think, is very important. And certainly we'll be making sure that our friends at the rating agencies are aware of where we are.
Finally, in terms of that theme, delivering change, building resistance -- resilience -- it's a Freudian slip. We're building a portfolio of high-quality long-life assets. We will continue to roll out the operating model because, at the end of the day, the disciplines, the structure, the process that, that required, those require us to think differently and operate differently. And it really does provide, I think, a very solid platform for longer-term improvement, and so the conversation each year has to be about how much better can we do. We've got the foundations in place, still a lot of work to be done. Free cash flow generation remains the imperative. We need to keep generating and making sure that we've got the flexibility to deliver on the potential we have in terms of our next phase of evolution. This year is about the discipline and making sure that we're doing things right to get the balance sheet where it needs to be. In this world, I think volatility will be the keyword of the day, and therefore we need to have a much more flexible balance sheet. On capital management, we will maintain our discipline. Returns to our shareholders are a priority. And from that point of view, shareholders come first in terms of dividends. And by the end of the year, we want to be in a position to make that commitment and hold that commitment. And from that point of view, the discipline that's expressed through the balance sheet is absolutely critical.
So they're the numbers. Before I open the conversation up to questions, I did want to make a couple of points. Firstly, I'd like to thank René for the contribution that he's made to the organization. I think his contribution making sure that we've kept our liquidity in the right place as we navigated the major projects, I think, has been a very important point; one that might have missed a little bit in 2015. But again, René, thank you for the contribution that you've made to the group.
And I think, for many, wind the clock back 18 months, it was a fairly tough set of conversations and appropriately so. What I would like to do is acknowledge the work of everyone in the room here, the executives, my colleagues and all of our employees. Many of our employees are watching this presentation, so I think it's important to acknowledge them. The one thing they all know and we all know is we still have a long way to go in delivering on the potential in the business, so we just see it as a must then [ph] and a lot of work to be done. We've still got, I think, a lot of catch-up to get ourselves to the front of the industry. But we've made some good gains. We've got a lot more work to be done. And I think it was important to make that point to yourselves.
And then finally, to thank many of you for the support that you've provided. And in some cases, the tough conversations have been the right conversations. And certainly from our point of view, people have made us think differently, and we've continued to evolve the business. And I'd like to think that, today, we're a little bit better than we were 12 months ago. And I hope I can say that again next year and beyond. So thanks for the support. Thank you for being here today.
And we're very happy to take questions."

And secondly, you made a point of wanting to focus on long-life assets. So what has changed in terms of your thinking around the thermal and Kumba assets? And is it just a case of you appreciating the diversification more? And then secondly, based on your comments of retaining now being an option, are you still actively looking at a disposal of these assets?

So it's very healthy capital competition across the portfolio. We do take into account a global commodity position in thinking about that, but all of the assets will have, in our view, the right capital to make sure they're delivering good returns. But we will take that commodity point into account. In terms of long-life assets, what we've seen here is there are assets that do have long lives and are very competitive that we said we need to consider putting on a block to manage debt. We're very clear that, that was the imperative. We still have those 3 global commodities very much in focus, and they will continue to get our support, but what we have said, we've got another set of assets that are high quality, long life and will continue to make a contribution. And they have a place in the portfolio because we've got the debt to where we wanted it. And they've got great potential; in the case of Kumba more specifically, I think, the technical opportunities that we've been working on for a couple of years around the DMS plant. And those opportunities suggest to us that Sishen has got better than 20 years life still to be worked through but certainly good potential. So from my point of view, it has certainly the potential to remain in the portfolio. They're going to continue to improve, and other assets we continue to make improvements on. So we think what we've identified in the portfolio fits with the focus on asset quality and long life in areas that we can add value, and therefore they can remain in the portfolio. We will continue to do some cleanup as we go, as assets get to an age where we don't think there's much more we can do. We will sell. I think that discipline is something that we have to be much tougher on and turning assets over, so managing the portfolio. I think that's very important for us. And in terms of South Africa, the point I've made is fairly clear, that for us, with the portfolio we have, we can operate and manage that portfolio and manage the financial issues quite effectively in our current configuration. It's my view, over time, that bulk will probably come off a bit in terms of the relative contribution. And so the difference in the 2 jurisdictions will change a little bit over time, but we can operate very happily in our current configuration. At the same time, if there are other ways or opportunities to improve how that -- how South Africa sits in the portfolio, then we're also very open to having the conversation, but it has to deliver value to all of our shareholders, okay? Jason?"

When we stood up in '13, we talked about strategy in 4 parts. We talked about cleaning up the portfolio and getting ourselves back in the game, being competitive. That was driving value. We've delivered, and you see that in production -- productivity, costs, capital efficiencies. That part, I think, from our point of view, we've made good progress on. Secondly, we said that we needed to restructure the business and to change the way we were running the assets, and so significant leadership change, the way we've organized, the functional model, the whole approach to running the business is very different. The third was we actually changed our key processes, the industrial -- the adoption of a more of an industrial model. The marketing model was very different to what the majors were doing in this space. You've got a trading model, a sales model. We've tried to pitch. And we saw this big opportunity to improve our margins across the board in our marketing model. That was the third element. The fourth element was portfolio, where we said that we would look to focus on those quality assets because, you'll remember, we did a comparison of margins against our major competitors. And I said we're well behind our competitors in terms of margins; and that we're going to have to change the nature of the way we ran the business, the first three; and the portfolio to close that gap. So we're closing the gap. We're not there yet. We've certainly had to take a more aggressive approach to the portfolio restructuring, hence to get the balance sheet down. So if you like, the way I talk to it -- I've used the word before and you can use whatever word you like. What we said is we tried to -- we pivoted to deal with the debt, which I think was the right thing to do, and we're pivoting back. So we would certainly argue that we've adjusted the strategy to deal with a tough set of circumstances, which was appropriate. And we've now pivoted back to where we were, which is an asset-focused strategy cognizant of the portfolio that we have and the commodities we have. And regarding your final point, I think the commodity mix we have is actually quite unique. So you might think about that a little bit differently to where we are against our competitors, but secondly, the real gap between ourselves and our competitors on margins, we're closing the gap. We've got a lot more work to do, but what we want to do and provide to our shareholders is a different set of options in terms of the commodities they can be exposed to. And that's just the -- a function of the assets you have, but the quality of the assets is a driver. There is this quote that I heard the other day which I quite like: There are no bad commodities, only bad projects. And for us, it's about the quality of the assets. And what we've tried to do is preserve those assets in the portfolio that we think we can add value in over time and continue to improve margins and returns. And that's what we think we can do and make a difference. And people will make their own decisions about the commodities they'd like to be exposed to. So I think I've tried to cover that full sweep. I'll go here, and then I'll come here."

We have made the observations that we're a 40% holder in Cemenco [ph]. It is unlikely that would be allowed to consolidate the manganese industry in South Africa, so we'd be open in terms of the conversation there. My comment was more around Kumba and export thermal coal, our Anglo-type assets, but at the same time, we're open to a conversation. And therefore, from our point of view, the statement we're making is we're very confident that over time we can continue to navigate and be successful in South Africa. That's a commitment, but at the same time, if there are other opportunities to create value for our shareholders, we're open. So we're making those positions pretty clear, but we're supporters. What we want to see is more certainty. And we will be positive and constructive contributors to the debate. On Quellaveco, what we've said is we want to get the balance sheet where it needs to be by the end of the year. We'll watch the copper price carefully. I think everyone's got to be careful. I know there was a quote of $2.70 in the paper. And I was asked the question and where I said we think that's a pretty good price for copper. However, we think at the moment Escondida is a factor in the price, plus some other issues around uncertainty of the majors being able to deliver on their commitments. So we're not yet convinced that copper is in the right direction. And from our point of view, we would need to be convinced that it's the right thing for copper. And that's certainly weren't the -- in '17, from our perspective. We've got a lot of work to do. We will take that up in '18, but it'll be a really serious consideration around the market. We're in a good dialogue with our colleagues in Peru, and so we will continue, engage and try and do the right thing but not before time. The other one that we did there was Sakatti. Sakatti is more on operation long time before [indiscernible]. There's a lot of licensing to be done, but for us, we're not talking the G [ph] word. We have no intention to talk to the G [ph] word. We've got a lot of cleanup we've got to do. We're focused on doing the right things, get the capital disciplines right.

So the MPRDA has been debated for 5 years. Its original construct -- or the construct of 2 years ago, we are very supportive of. There is talk of some changes. If there are changes, the chamber will engage aggressively. And I think it would be fair to say that, if we see something that we're not happy with, we will make that known. And we'll challenge it if it's inappropriate, but I'm hopeful that people will listen to what we've been saying and will come up with something constructive, something that encourages inward investment into South Africa. That's our position. We've been very strong, and we will continue to debate that. From our point of view, we don't see significant risk across our portfolio. We've delivered now 26% plus. In fact, we're north of 27% on our ownership, so we think we're in good shape.

The MPRDA, the Mining Charter and the fiscal arrangements to encourage inbound investment stuff [ph] to touch on the flexibility question that I got earlier, those 3 points have been made very strongly.

The market -- we will produce to the market, we're not going to get ahead of ourselves or the market. We have other incremental opportunities that make sense, but only when the market's in the right position. And that conversation could equally apply to copper, to platinum in Chris' case. And, I think, in Chris' discipline where you've seen a 40% reduction in our own mine production. So we're really focused on the quality of our production and the margins across that part of the business and improving the efficiency of our processing operation. So we improve our margins on par. That's why the marketing work is also so important to improve those margins in both parts of the business. So it's a common conversation across all of our commodities, that's where we're focused.

But as Mark said, we had a good site in Site 1. Many of the factories in Surat have reopened, not all of them, but many of them post demonetization. So post Diwali, none of them reopened, which was what we spoke about in November. A number of them have reopened, so there's certainly an improvement in the low-end.

Second point, on commodities, there is still a lot of iron ore and coal around the world, and over time, I don't think any of the fundamental parameters that we've talked to have changed. But when you get the problems that we saw in China, you might get a cyclone in Queensland and the other things, there's one thing that we do observe is the market is pretty finely balanced. And so it can [indiscernible] away over short periods of time pretty dramatically. That volatility, I think, is actually the keyword for us in these commodity markets. The other thing is you have to be flexible. You have to think and watch what's happening in the marketplace. We believe we made the right call in staking out what we had to do to fix the business and the fact I'm still standing here probably is testament that we made that call generally right. However, what we'd also say is it will continue to be a volatile market, that we have to watch it carefully and make the right decisions. The key thing that we talked about this time last year was holding true to the value conversation, and that has kept us in the right place. And that changes in the short term because how do you value a coal asset at $300 a tonne, is it going to be 3 months or 6 months? So you've probably got a reasonable change of estimating what are [indiscernible] there. When you put those numbers together, I think, we've made the right call. So it will continue to change.

If it is -- if your target is $6 billion -- $6.5 billion of net debt, it's not very long until you're facing the same problem, call it a problem that other companies are facing, which is that their balance sheet is becoming undergeared, has a lot of capital that needs to be allocated, and I can't believe I'm asking this, but in all seriousness, with where your portfolio is sitting today, would you be more inclined towards using that capital to rebalance the portfolio through M&A or would it be more likely to be returning cash to shareholders -- or CapEx, I should say?"

But let's be clear: For us, first priority was to get the debt down. Second priority is pay the dividend. If at the end of the day, we don't have great options inside the portfolio, then we'll give that cash back to shareholders. I think that's the way companies should operate and from that point of view, assessing how good those opportunities are will depend on the market and how we see things at the time. But we have no problem giving money to shareholders on the basis of the best use of our capital. And we want to get back to that as quick as we can. We want to make sure that the company is in good shape in terms of its debt and that we've got some great opportunities since how the business [indiscernible] will also depend on how the markets are shaping up and whether you're comfortable that you can forecast those returns on a reasonable basis. Now that's what we do in the business. That's what we've done for 40 years, in some cases well, some cases not well. We just hope that we have -- we expect to bring the discipline that I don't think the industry has had for a long period of time. Certainly, we talk about that word in the way we think about capital. We've got to hold to that discipline in the organization. I think that's important. And so far, it's 3.5 years we've stuck with that discipline, and I think that's where we're in a bit of plus. One thing I'll mention. You made an observation. I don't know if you can do this, Paul. If you look at the price volatility we saw in our commodities, if you go to the midpoint of 2016, which was the low point, we think, in certainly the most recent cycles, one of the tests we've asked ourselves is can we deliver cash and still make the right decisions in the business at that point? The answer is yes. Now this business is a very different business to where we were even 18 months ago on the basis of that test. And I think you've got to continually test the business. Can you may cash at the bottom of the cycle or what you think might be the bottom of the cycle? And you've got to make sure your portfolio is geared and that you're efficient and you continually test yourself both sides and that's one of the things that I think we have to keep in touch with across the business on a go-forward basis. Pricing can go both ways. We want to make sure that we've got very clear pathway either way and in all cases delivering value for shareholders. Can I take a couple of calls?

For us, I think it's very important to be respectful to you guys and give you the opportunity to talk to people in the business that are actually driving the business and driving the change. And please take the opportunity to tap them on the shoulder and get their perspectives on what we're doing because, at the end of the day, we get somewhat used to presenting here and I think it's important that you hear it from the guys that are actually doing the hard work on the ground. It's a very tight team. We've done a lot of hard work and still have a lot of hard work to do. So good to see people here, and hopefully, you'll take advantage of the opportunity to able to talk to the guys.
Well, jumping straight into the key issues. You'll see that we've used the word delivering change and building resilience, and we're making a very clear statement of intent with those words. There can be no doubt, I think, today in presenting these results that we've done a lot of work in terms of change. And our focus has to be to continue to improve the business to ensure that we deliver free cash flow under literally any market scenario that is thrown at us. And I will talk to and point to a couple of points during the presentation to reinforce that key issue for us. And to me and to us, that is the definition of a resilient business: your ability to handle anything the market throws at you.
Now in developing and talking to the 2016 story, we'll actually use this flow. We'll talk about delivering on commitments. We will talk to the operational improvement, go to the balance sheet. René will obviously pick up the financials. And I will talk specifically to the portfolio approach towards the end of the conversation. And obviously, we'll then have Q&A, and I'm sure you'll have quite a few questions.
I think, firstly, on commitments. Free cash flow, significant for the year, $2.6 billion versus $0.4 billion. For us, the importance of that number, I think, is best considered when you look at our average prices 2015 versus 2016. In fact, we saw about a 3% drop in our average prices on our commodity basket. And so the work that we've done is substantially stuff that we've driven, and I think that's an important point to make through the presentation. Clearly, the free cash flow drove the net debt performance. And that number is obviously being contributed on a number of fronts, and again, René will pick that up. But certainly, well below the $10 billion target. And yes, disposals did make a material contribution, but we didn't have to go as far as we originally indicated to achieve those numbers. So we're pleased with progress, a lot more to be done.
On the operating side, we've seen continuing improvements through each of the operations. And in particular, when you look at EBITDA margin, despite a 3% drop in prices for the full year, our EBITDA margin has actually gone from 21% to 26%. So we're really pleased with that aspect of the performance and for us probably one of the most important numbers to focus on in terms of what we've done and also where we need to go to continue to improve the quality of the results that we're delivering.
On the balance sheet, again from our point of view, very important that we get to investment-grade rating. In the end, the numbers are getting in that territory. For us, we can't forecast when the rating agents may look favorably upon the change. And René will give you his views on that, but for us, we'll do everything to make sure we get there as quick as we can. More specifically, we are targeting a reinstatement of the dividend by year-end, to be paid in 2018. On the portfolio, we'll continue to clean up -- continue the clean-up work that we defined when we talked about the portfolio back in '13 and '14. Our recently announced Union sale is an example of that continuing cleanup, but at the same time, I'll make the point that, as far as deleveraging the balance sheet, we are not required to make disposals to help us position because we see our free cash flow and the work that we're doing inside the business with the ability to deliver on our debt targets. So it'll be about portfolio cleanup. And again, I'll talk a little bit about that to give you more color through the presentation. Finally and to be very specific, we will retain Moranbah, Grosvenor and the coking coal and the nickel assets as well. And as I said, I'll pick that conversation up around the portfolio a little bit later.
On the results and going straight to the numbers, I think these numbers best describe -- these 6 numbers best describe Anglo American in 2016: EBITDA, a good result, again considering the basket price had dropped 3%. So we got a 25% improvement on where we were in 2015. Cost and volume improvements actually represent around a $200 billion -- a $2 billion improvement for the full year. We did have some headwinds. So net, we're about $1.5 billion -- or $1.6 billion in cash terms. And we had a $100 million adjustment due to platinum inventories. Again, we'll pick that up a little bit later, but on a cash basis we actually hit the $1.6 billion. On capital, we continue to hold our discipline across the organization. I think that's critical. And you'll see what we're forecasting for '17. The attributable free cash flow reflects the volume and cost work we did across the business. The net debt-EBITDA is a straight calculation. And obviously, the net debt number is certainly for us a very important number that we were focusing on for the full year. We've made good progress, but there's still a lot for us to do. And certainly, we are knuckling down to the next phase of improvement during the course of this year. We'll talk about that a little bit later.
I've got to say that across the business the one disappointment that we've reported is in safety. With 11 fatalities, it's both disappointing -- or if I could say, more importantly, it's unacceptable. The focus on critical controls, the planning of the work through the operating model is where our focus is, and we still obviously have a lot of work to do. The good news is a 24% improvement in our total recorded injury rate was encouraging. And at the end of the day, if we're not managing the key risks, then we remain exposed, and that's unacceptable. On the environmental side, we've done a lot of work. We've really focused on measuring what we're doing and how we're performing. And the reduction, almost an 85% reduction, in the incidents reported, I think, does talk to the planning work and the focus on the detail. And for us, it goes with cost reductions, productivity improvements and the overall business and performance. So we've got to get the safety right. A lot of work going into that by everyone in this room and through the organization.
On production. If I work from the right-hand side, 2% overall. Nickel, with the commissioning of the Barro Alto furnace, that we actually hit the full rate during Q3. So pleased with the good progress there. On iron ore, obviously supported by the continuing ramp-up at Minas-Rio. Guys have done some good work there. Kumba, with all of the restructuring during the course of the year, we're pretty happy with the numbers that were ultimately delivered. Chris and the guys continue to do very well on the finished platinum side. Yes, we had a couple of problems during the year, but overall the performance was solid. De Beers, reflecting the market, making sure that we're balancing our production to market demand, so a good recovery from 2015. In both the coal regions or the 3 coal regions, really solid work, restructuring, even with some sales, done a good job on the operating side. Productivity has continued to improve. And so some really good work across the portfolio.
On copper, I won't talk too much about the mid-year issues that we talked on Los Bronces. Since then, the guys have delivered the numbers. The good news, I think, from the copper side, and we saw those in the half year numbers, was the cost work. And so Duncan and the guys were able to improve their EBITDA contribution, and that was really a function of the very good work done on the copper side.
So overall, we're happy with the results. Yes, we could do better in terms of the areas that we had a few headwinds, but overall the numbers were pretty solid and supported much better performance on the cost side. And that's really where our focus was. On a full basis, we've reflected 9%, which is normalized for the portfolio changes. I think you'll see a headline number of 10% reduction. That's just how the numbers actually landed for the full year; nickel reflecting Barro Alto's contribution; very good progress in iron ore, particularly at Kumba. And you know that we've come from the $77 a tonne break-even price to $29 for the year. I'll talk to that a little bit later. So a good performance there. Minas-Rio, also making a contribution. I think Seamus and the guys made good progress there even with the constrained footprint, some good work on the cost side. De Beers, Bruce and the team focusing on the efficiency work, obviously helped by getting the volumes out. Coal Australia, again a good focus on costs. And they've come a long way. Don't forget in Australia in particular we're down more than 50%, so continuing good work. And in South Africa, some good progress. SA export coal, I'll pick that up. And copper, as I said, despite the volume challenges, good work on the cost side.
For us, the words we use are, ""the relentless pursuit of operations improvement,"" and I think, at the end of the day, cost is where the rubber really hits the road. And I think we've made good progress but a lot more work to be done in terms of underlying efficiencies.
On the EBITDA, cost and volume improvement you can see that on the cost side we were forecasting around $900 million contribution. We actually delivered about $1.2 billion, so we're pleased with the progress. On the volume side, we were expecting a bit of a higher contribution, particularly with De Beers. We did see some headwinds with the smelter failure at -- the Waterval smelter failure and the Los Bronces issue in copper which we dealt with at the half year. So net-net, we saw a $400 million contribution on the volume side. That got us on a cash basis to a $1.6 billion performance improvement across the portfolio. The platinum noncash inventory adjustment, we do the inventories on an annual basis. In 2015, it was $180 million contribution. This year, it was $80 million, so the difference in the $100 million is what we've recorded there. And so we do that inventory adjustment. It's in the range of expected outcomes, so there were no big surprises there, but it does have an impact. And it shows as a noncash, but it is something we should report on the basis that it talks to our run rate that we talked to earlier this year. So this is where the numbers are.
For us, when we look at what we can do. And I talked about the word or used the word ""resilient."" We recorded a 3% drop in our commodity basket price. I noticed some of the press stuff this morning was saying we got saved by commodity prices. In fact, during '16, our basket was actually on average below the 2015 numbers. Certainly, a great recovery in the second half, and we're enjoying that and still enjoying some of that recovery, but the improvement from 21% to 26%, says -- I think, makes the most important statement for the business. 3 years ago, we talked about improving our margins in tougher environments. And for us, that's where we've got to keep doing as much work as we can. And the second last bullet there, the marketing activities and marketing's contribution to that margin improvement has been also very strong. I'm very pleased with the progress that Peter and his team have made in their work. And they've delivered more than the $400 million we were targeting back in 2013, so very pleased with their contribution.
On a commodity-by-commodity basis, diamonds, as you would expect, where the market's starting to stabilize and certainly providing movement for products, we were able to deliver volume and cost improvement on the business. In looking forward, we'll continue to work closely with our customers to make sure that we're in the right conversations, with an understanding how the market is balanced so that we're making the right decisions. On the quality side, Gahcho Kué will make a bigger contribution this year and for us a very important part of the quality improvement that we're looking for across the portfolio to support margin improvement. And our production range forecast for the year is 31 million to 33 million carats. That's based on what we believe the market will certainly support in its current configuration. I think we've got to be a bit careful with the first site because there was some stock movement in those numbers. So I don't want people to get too excited. We've made the point, Bruce has made the point we've just got to keep an eye on the market. And we'll make sure that we stay very close to our customers in particular.
On platinum, we've been working right across the portfolio on improvement. Chris, you'll see, is here, jumping up and down in terms of the results. The sale of Rustenburg, for us, was a very important milestone for the year. And I have to give Chris full credit for the hard work that he put in, with the rest of the team, in making sure that, that got through. For us, the quality of the portfolio and making sure that we're positioned on the left-hand side of the cost curve is where I think we need to be, as we still see a bit of platinum around. And over time as the market moves our way, we should be the beneficiaries, particularly with our assets, on the right side -- on left-hand side literally of the cost curve. But there is still some more work to be done, good progress and certainly very good progress on the portfolio restructuring front.
On copper, on volumes, we're unable to rely on volumes to help us with our efficiencies, but really good work on the costs side. As I said, I won't get back through the half year challenges we had, other than to say that the guys have done a good job in the last 6 months continuing on the cost-reduction front and making a very solid contribution. Our production guidance for 2017 remains in similar ballpark. We're more focused on the margins on copper and make sure that we've got the right things happening in the business. On El Soldado, some of you would have heard that there is a debate with the government regarding some of the approvals. If we remember, back 18 months ago, we were on the wrong side of cash flow at El Soldado some $100 million. We've restructured, made a lot of changes. And it's now making a positive contribution and would have made a positive contribution back at prices at that time, so there's been significant improvement. I think it'll be next 3 or 4 weeks where we'll sort out what we need to do to get approvals going forward, but at the same time, if we're not able to agree and we don't believe that the operation will be making a contribution, then we won't continue going forward with the operation. We'd like to think that we can work something through with the government and get the right licenses in place, but if not, we'll make the right decisions in -- with regard to each asset has to pull its weight and make a contribution.
On coal, the Australian operations again have been leaders in improvement across the business; and certainly doing very well on any comparative basis, unit costs in the lowest we've seen since 2006. Grosvenor has made its first contribution. It's 7 months ahead of schedule, so that's significant. We've continued to clean up the portfolio through Callide and Foxleigh. And sorry, I should make one other comment on Grosvenor: We're still in the first longwall block. We have experienced geotechnical challenges that we're getting on top of. It's quite normal in your first block where you've got what we'd call virgin stresses around the wall to see some challenges. Usually, things get better in the second and third blocks, but we're making good progress. And we'll watch that closely and keep the people updated on the progress that we're making. In terms of going forward, we're forecasting somewhere between 19 million and 21 million tonne. Again, the guys are doing really good work on the cost side. Grosvenor will obviously be an important part of that production recovery -- or production forecast over the next 12 months.
In South Africa and Colombia, good progress. Certainly in South Africa the productivity work has been exceptional. We're actually up 45% on the last 3 years, so again good progress there. As a consequence, we've actually kept our costs at 2013 levels. There is still more we can do, and that, Seamus, with the team, is focusing on the continuing improvements that we can make. But I'd have to say that what it does demonstrate is that in South Africa we can be competitive with anyone in the world. We've still got a long way to go to match numbers that we're delivering elsewhere, but the progress has been very good, and so from my point of view, very pleased with the progress. And credit to the team for doing the hard work. And we still see lots of opportunities in Colombia as well. Again, the forecast there, the real focus for us is productivity improvements, getting our costs and continuing to improve our costs to make sure we can handle anything the market throws at us.
Kumba, most people are aware of the amount of restructuring that we've done. It has been a bit of a journey, taken a bit longer than we would like, but at the same time, if you go back to where we started at a $77 a tonne break-even price, we delivered for the full year $29 a tonne break-even price. I will put a cautionary point around the $29. It is a volatile number depending on where foreign exchange is and oil prices are, and so it can move anywhere between $30 and $40. The team is focused on continuing to improve the underlying performance and so that we're doing the best we can with what we've got, but the move from $77 to $29 substantially reflects good work of the team and in particular in '16, we got a lot of help in '15 on FX and oil, but in '16, it's primarily been the restructuring and the changes that we've made inside the business. For example, the downsizing by 40% was the important part of the improvements that have been delivered this year. So for me, that's a really important point to make. And credit to the team in the progress they've made. We all understand there's a lot more work to be done, but so far, we're very pleased with progress. And we'll certainly continue to encourage the guys to look for every opportunity to improve the business.
Similar story at Minas-Rio, improvement. We are constrained, as we said, by the pit room until we get the final license or the third-phase license, which we expect to get by the end of '18. But at the same time, Seamus and the team have done really well on the cost side. Our FOB numbers are pretty solid. In fact, FOB costs are inside the range that we forecast at full production rates. Yes, we're getting a little bit of a help from the real, but don't forget we peaked at around 4, I think we're at about 3.2, 3.3 at the moment, so we've made good progress. They've pulled out overheads and indirect costs. We'll continue to focus on getting that configuration right. And once we get a bit more pit room, we end up getting a bit of balance in the feed, and so there's an opportunity to improve those costs once we open the pit up. But we're expecting that license to come through in '18, a really important milestone, and we'll keep you posted on the progress as we go through that.
Finally, for those that get really excited when people talk about nickel. It has been an important transition for us as we brought Barro Alto on today. For those that check these things and the ramp-up curves for the new generation of laterite deposits. It's been the best performer based on the new laterites, and that's in the last 6 or 7 years. We've still got some performance improvement we can deliver through consistency. I guess, from our point of view, a bit more patience will be required on the marketing side, but certainly we're not leaving the business in the hands of the markets. We will continue to improve the operations and again really pleased with the progress that's been made and what the team has delivered from Barro Alto with the new furnace. And I think we hit full rate in Q3, and we've kept it at a pretty consistent rate all the way through.
I think, with that, I'll hand across to René to unpack the financials based on that performance. And then I'll pick up the strategy after René. All yours René. [indiscernible]"

And I would like to start by thanking the management team for the strong performance and allowing me to present a very strong set of results.So first goes through the key financial for 2016. So a very strong EBIT",1055,"[indiscernible] Good morning, everybody. And I would like to start by thanking the management team for the strong performance and allowing me to present a very strong set of results.
So first goes through the key financial for 2016. So a very strong EBITDA number of $6.1 billion, an increase of 25%. A lower tax rate at 25%, it's really on the back of 2 special items. First, in Australia we were able to use some unrecognized tax reserves, especially with the strong performance in coking coal in the second half of 2016, but also the change in tax regime in Chile for withholding tax and the impact on the deferred tax assets. Going forward, we expect the tax rate to be between 30% and 32%, obviously depending on the structure of the portfolio. CapEx, down to $2.5 billion. And as you know, we commissioned 2 projects in 2016, Gahcho Kué in Canada, in De Beers; and Grosvenor, the new longwall operation in Australia. We still have some spending in Minas-Rio in Brazil.
Very strong shift in cash flow from negative cash flow of $1 billion in 2015 to a positive cash flow of $2.6 billion in 2016. Disposal proceed of $1.8 billion, predominantly in the second half of this year. And we closed, we completed the sale of niobium and phosphate and the sale of our 10% stake in Exxaro in South Africa for $200 million.
So net debt, down to $8.5 billion at the end of December, which represents a net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.4x on a pro forma basis. We maintain the same focus on costs, operational performance and CapEx. And we keep getting the benefit, obviously, of higher -- high commodity prices. And at end of January, our net debt was in fact down to $8.1 billion, so continued to good -- make good progress in term of strengthening the balance sheet.
Turning to the EBITDA waterfall. On the left-hand side, you see the uncontrollable elements. Mark mentioned the slight year-on-year basket price decline, a 3% negative impact of $100 million, but there was a strong recovery, as you know, in the second half of the year. The point-to-point increase, so from end of June to end of December, for our basket price was 27%. So the 25% increase in EBITDA was really driven by the cost and volume improvement, a net impact of $1.5 billion that Mark covered earlier. And then you had the impact of the platinum noncash inventory adjustment and the impact of the disposal both in '15 and '16.
Turning to the reduction in net debt. So overall, a reduction of $4.4 billion from $12.9 billion to $8.5 billion at the end of December. I will cover in more detail working capital and CapEx. Just to maybe clarify on what happened with the tax side and on the interest charge: On the tax side, we had also the benefit in Chile of accelerating the tax depreciation, and we had a tax refund of close to $200 million in 2016. So I think some of you were surprised by the much lower cash impact on the tax line. That's what's behind this lower number. On the interest side also needs some explanation. On the -- from the cash standpoint, we will get the benefit of the lower debt in 2017. That will reduce, from a cash standpoint, interest charge by $200 million, but from a P&L standpoint, as we have now commissioned Grosvenor and Minas-Rio, we will capitalize less. And the net impact from a P&L standpoint will be in fact an increase of $200 million.
So net debt down to $8.5 billion. Our objective is to have a net debt-to-EBITDA between 1x and 1.5x using long-term prices. Our EBITDA number using both our internal forecast and the market consensus, net EBITDA roughly around $6.5 billion. So we would like the level of net debt to be closer to $6 billion to $6.5 billion. I think we agree that we need to run the business with probably a more conservative balance sheet.
Turning to the -- what happened in term of gross debt and where we are in term of liquidity. So a 27% decline in gross debt in 2016. So we had obviously the impact of the maturity in 2016 but also the liability management exercise that we did earlier in the year and the repayment of a BNDES loan in Brazil for $1.7 billion. So that will help us reduce the level of interest charge that I mentioned earlier in 2017. Liquidity has been critical over the last 2 years. That was very important for us as we were going through the downturn and the pressure. We have maintained a very strong liquidity close to $16 billion. As we -- there is still some volatility in term of prices and we continue to make progress on deleveraging the balance sheet, but we expect the level of liquidity to be adjusted going forward as we make more progress in term of reducing the level of net debt. And you see the maturity over the next 3 years, so around $6 billion of bond maturing of the -- in '17, '18 and '19.
Working capital. So a net reduction of $400 million, and that's the impact of the higher prices in -- especially in the last months of 2016. We got the benefit of optimizing our level of inventory in De Beers, a benefit of $300 million; as well as our ability to renegotiate some debtors -- some deal with some clients involving some prepayment and also some supplier payment terms.
CapEx. So down to $2.5 billion compared to $4 billion in 2015 and in excess of $6 billion in the prior years. We expect the level of CapEx to be maintained at this level in '17 and '18, the benefit of the commissioning of the projects that I mentioned earlier, but there will be an increase in SIB CapEx as we commission some new projects, for example, Minas-Rio and Grosvenor.
And then in term of disposals. So $3.5 billion over the last 2 years, so including $1.8 billion in 2016. And you have the breakdown between niobium and phosphates back -- that we completed in September and the sale of our stake in Exxaro in December.
Thank you."

Since w",3417,"Thank you very much, René.
I will just quickly give a bit more flavor around the progress we've made, talk a little bit about the portfolio and then just update you on guidance and give a few final comments.
Firstly, in terms of change overall. Since we started the significant work we've been doing since '13, on the organization front we've basically streamlined and reduced the numbers across the business both as a consequence of focusing on the assets that can add material value, the way we run those assets, the way we operate and the way we work together as an organization. And so there has been a lot of work done, still more to be done, but from our point of view, that was a very important part of the strategy that we outlined back in '13. And we've made good progress but, again, looking to continue to improve that work to support our productivity improvements across-the-board. On the portfolio front, we've either sold or closed 27 assets, reducing the portfolio to 41. I think it's a bit overly simplistic to say we're dealing with the tail of clearly that $600 million conversation we had back in December in '15, when we talked about $600 million. The costs associated with those operations is down to $100 million, so we have dealt with the tail, but there will always be some assets that are in different phases that you have to deal with. But certainly from our point of view, that's been a big part of the work we've done but as well as that the ongoing improvements to the portfolio have been absolutely key in helping improve the overall quality of the business that we're running and certainly been very important in improving the margins across the business as we go forward.  Having said that, today, we've also added 5 new projects to the portfolio. So when we talk about margin improvement, it is a function of the work we've done on the portfolio and it's a function of the efficiency work we've done within each of the assets. And so from our perspective, it has been strategic in the way we've gone about the business, with still more to be done particularly on the cleaning up of the portfolio and the efficiency work in particular.
We won't go through the FutureSmart work. We will save that conversation for another day, but for those that saw what we were doing in December and understand what we're trying to do with the cost base on a go-forward basis, there's still a lot of opportunities across the business.
And finally, the operating model is about the way we operate. It's more of an industrial approach to the way we run our assets. Certainly, it's not about 1 or 2 years' game. This is a long game that we're playing in operating and improving the business, as is the marketing model. And as I said earlier, Peter and the team have contributed more than $400 million worth of improvements, which was the number we talked to a few years back. And that's from -- literally from the resource right the way through to customers, improving logistics, improving costs and improving the realized prices that we achieved. And certainly, we'll continue to work on that model, which is different to a trading model or a sales model. It's a very different approach; a lot learned from De Beers and what we're doing in platinum applied to other parts of the business, including bulk. So for us, the whole improvement strategy was not simply about costs. It's about improving every part of the business, drive our margins, drive returns and make sure that from our point of view we're doing the best for our shareholders on a sustainable improvement basis.
On safety and environment, again we've made significant progress, 50% down since we first stood up in 2013, clearly disappointed with how 2016 shaped up, a lot of work going on to make sure that we recover and keep going forward and continue the broader improvement trends. Similar for environment, in the end, knowing that we're doing the work, I think, is the important piece. These things really only come to the fore when you have a problem. What we're going to try and do is continue to improve the discipline, the planning and the work we're doing in improving incidents so that we don't have any large incidents. And that's always something that we all have to pay attention to in this type of business.
On the operating side, our copper equivalent production, from where we were, is actually up 8%. Now that's from 40% less assets. So clearly, the cleanup has been around the smaller assets and getting a lot more out of the larger-scale, higher-margin type assets. And so as a consequence of all of that work, our copper equivalent unit costs are down 31%. And that's in nominal terms, so from our point of view, that's an important number. And cash generation flows from those improvements. For those that do track back to what we talked about in 2013: The underlying, the EBITDA improvement is $3.1 billion delivered against the target. So we've done well against those original targets, and in fact, we've exceeded on most fronts. And capital expenditure, now that the major projects are through, we've seen a 55% reduction in capital. And in terms of underlying capital, we've seen on average 20% to 30% efficiency improvements, which are consistent with what we've done inside the operations with our general operating improvements.
In talking to the story in its most starkest terms. The blue represents the actual copper equivalent production that we've delivered on a year-on-year basis. So while we've been restructuring the portfolio, selling or closing assets and bringing new assets into play, we've actually held the production or slightly improved our production over that 5-year period. As a consequence of the portfolio work and the efficiency work, the production per person is up 41% from where we were back in 2012. And as a consequence, our actual reported operating costs in U.S. dollars 69%. Now when we talk inflation and FX, there's been a netting generally of those numbers, so the underlying improvements and portfolio changes, I'm not going to say they're both making significant contributions, just improve the quality of the business. That's where our focus will remain going forward, to keep driving those numbers to improve our margins. And with the marketing work and the other elements that we're working through, including the focus on being disciplined on the capital side, looking to improve our returns on a consistent basis as we go forward and put as much of our future in our hands and as we do in terms of commodity prices.
On the portfolio side, I think we need to make a few key points. First, we've been committed to the cleanup. And so when we talk, back in '14, of coming down to around 35, 37 assets, that was about improving the quality and making sure that we were focused on those assets that could drive value and that we were putting our capital in places that delivered the best returns over the long term. A lot of that work or in fact most of that work has been pretty well done. Second, we identified the need to go further on our restructuring program; and as everybody knows the story, in 2015, a pretty dramatic drop in commodity prices. We were confronting a real challenge in diamonds of the pipeline having filled probably in the prior 12 months. The prognosis for China was a bit open. And so from our point of view, we took the decision to drive and effectively put in place a self-help program, accelerated the improvements across the business in terms of costs, pulled our capital in hard but still making sure we remain committed to things like innovation where we knew that we'd have benefits longer-term. And we sold some assets. The one thing we promised our shareholders in all of those conversations and the questions we're asked, you're going to self value, we've said that we would hold ourselves to very strict value criteria. And I think that we held true to that. In the case of niobium and phosphates, the one point we made is that, niobium, we didn't see a long-term opportunity to improve our position there given the size of competitors in the industry. The phosphate business was very much a local market, and therefore from our point of view, the price we realized was almost double consensus numbers. And we thought that, that was a solid price. It was subject to an open bidding process. That, plus the cleanup work, helped deliver about $1.8 billion and, with the $1.7 billion before, helped us get to the net debt number. So from our point of view, whilst we had solid offers on the table for other assets, those offers didn't match our value criteria at the time, and therefore we didn't make the sale. From our point of view, it was appropriate. And we made, I think, the right calls. In the end, it's easy to reflect back now, but from our point of view it was the right thing to do at the time; and certainly has given us the flexibility in going forward; and certainly from an organization point of view helped demonstrate the changes that we'd been talking to and the restructuring that we'd done could be achieved; and certainly from our point of view was a real rallying moment for the organization, a very important one, a very positive one. Consistent with that, we will maintain and keep Moranbah and Grosvenor and the nickel assets in the portfolio.
I -- so I guess the conversation around the portfolio is important, so I'll put the materials aside and try and talk these through to help you get an insight into how we're thinking. Firstly, 3 global commodities: Diamonds is a global business. Not all of the assets are Tier 1 assets, but each of the assets add value to the value proposition that we present to our customers. Bruce has configured the organization to deliver sustainable performance and results for the diamond industry. And he has our support on a number of fronts, whether it's technical or in other areas. That business has been configured to perform and deliver on a global scale. Similarly, platinum, although it's not the same industry and there are lots of learnings that are going on between the 2 businesses, again, Chris has the most significant platinum business in the world. And we run and set that up as a platinum business, and it is on a global scale. Copper is not yet at the scale we'd like it to be, but certainly with the assets we have, we believe we can improve the business both in terms of the quality and the contribution it makes. And that will take time. We will be patient. We will be disciplined, but it is a business that has global scale potential.
The fourth part of the portfolio we'd called very deliberately bulks and other minerals around 18 months ago are assets that have technical similarities, operational similarities. And Seamus has aligned the operations; and is sharing best practices across the bulk assets, the thermal coal, the met coal, the iron ore businesses, Minas-Rio. And the learnings that we have from each of those businesses are being shared as we continue to improve their performance. Very different in nature, but the most important point we make is that they're good assets. They aren't in of themselves global in scale, so it's not a global met coal business or a global thermal coal business or a global iron ore business, and that's relative to competitors. And so we configured them differently because we find setting this up is far more efficient and effective in terms of the way we've structured the overall business. And for us, that works. 
So the focus will be on quality assets, so it's an asset quality strategy, but it's also a strategy that pays attention to the nature of the commodities we're in, looking to drive returns in those businesses that are appropriate for the scale and the way we've positioned the business in those markets.
We've articulated those points in these bullets, and I'll let you read those, but I do -- will make one observation in relation to South Africa. In defining the strategy going forward, we talked about what we would do in South Africa and where our focus would be. The first thing I would say about South Africa is that we've restructured the business as we have the global business, and we've improved productivities in South Africa by more than 40%. We've reduced our costs in the same sort of 30% range, learning from all parts of the business. And that improvement has been done with stakeholders. Even though there have been tough conversations, the government has been constructive, albeit tough, as you'd expect them to be. And with our other stakeholders in the country, we've been able to navigate significant change in the Kumba scenario, the thermal coal scenario, Chris's restructuring of platinum. All of those conversations have been tough but required, have been necessary. And we've improved all of our businesses. They're all making cash. They're all making a contribution. And that's the first -- or that was our starting point in terms of making sure we had a good business in South Africa.
The third point that -- when I talk about South Africa and I think we are in an important moment in terms of policy certainty. The focus on the MPRDA, the Mining Charter and general fiscal arrangements to make sure that we encourage inward investment to South Africa are all important issues for us. As we stand here today, we can manage our assets, manage our operations for the long term and make a real contribution to Anglo American. If at the same time there are conversations around opportunity to do something different, we're open to those conversations. One key criteria: It has to add value for all of our shareholders, and that's the position we take. So we're happy with what we've got. We believe we can continue to improve and make a contribution, and that's where we stand. If there is another opportunity for another -- or an opportunity for another conversation, then we're open, but it has to be on the basis that delivers value for all shareholders, yes. I'm sure I'll probably get a few more questions on that point.
Targeting further improvement. As was said, for 2017, a lot of opportunities we've identified, and we will continue to improve. And as many of you know, the quest to improve never ends. We've been quite specific. So far, we've identified the $0.5 billion, or $500 million, that we've hardwired into each of the operating plans. We've also identified another $250 million of opportunity that are being worked on as we speak in terms of plans. And we're working to identify and bring to book another $250 million to deliver on EBITDA during the course of the year. It's certainly a stretch. I won't underestimate the challenge we see. I certainly believe on a cash basis we can deliver that type of number certainly on a much more confident basis, but for us, we want to drive that EBITDA improvement and continue that improvement basis that we've got going through the business. And everyone is focused on delivering those improvements. And I think that's an important piece of work for us and certainly will be an important update that we give at the half year.
In terms of guidance on the full year numbers. Again, René has unpacked the numbers. EBITDA, the improvements that we're targeting, capital will be around the same number. The free cash flow, you have to adjust for -- compared to last year. You have to adjust for working capital and some ins and outs. And again, René has provided a reconciliation, so those numbers should land. We would certainly see the net debt at less than $7 billion. As René pointed out, we're making good progress at this part of the year. Bulks are obviously helping us at the moment. And so I think it's a bit too early for us to book that on a full year basis, but certainly we've had a good start, and we thought it was appropriate to advise you where we're up to in January given what we've seen on the bulks in particular. And that range that we're looking for, I think, is very important. And certainly we'll be making sure that our friends at the rating agencies are aware of where we are.
Finally, in terms of that theme, delivering change, building resistance -- resilience -- it's a Freudian slip. We're building a portfolio of high-quality long-life assets. We will continue to roll out the operating model because, at the end of the day, the disciplines, the structure, the process that, that required, does require us to think differently and operate differently. And it really does provide, I think, a very solid platform for longer-term improvement, and so the conversation each year has to be about how much better can we do. We've got the foundations in place, still a lot of work to be done. Free cash flow generation remains the imperative. We need to keep generating and making sure that we've got the flexibility to deliver on the potential we have in terms of our next phase of evolution. This year is about the discipline and making sure that we're doing things right to get the balance sheet where it needs to be. In this world, I think volatility will be the keyword of the day, and therefore we need to have a much more flexible balance sheet. On capital management, we will maintain our discipline. Returns to our shareholders are a priority. And from our point of view, shareholders come first in terms of dividends. And by the end of the year, we want to be in a position to make that commitment and hold that commitment. And from our point of view, the discipline that's expressed through the balance sheet is absolutely critical.
So there are the numbers. Before I open the conversation up to questions, I did want to make a couple of points. Firstly, I'd like to thank René for the contribution that he's made to the organization. I think his contribution making sure that we've kept our liquidity in the right place as we navigated the major projects, I think, has been a very important point; one that might have missed a little bit in 2015. But again, René, thank you for the contribution that you've made to the group.
And I think, for many, wind the clock back 18 months, it was a fairly tough set of conversations and appropriately so. What I would like to do is acknowledge the work of everyone in the room here, the executives, my colleagues and all of our employees. Many of our employees are watching this presentation, so I think it's important to acknowledge them. The one thing they all know and we all know is we still have a long way to go in delivering on the potential in the business, so we just see it as a milestone and a lot of work to be done. We've still got, I think, a lot of catch-up to get ourselves to the front of the industry. But we've made some good gains. We've got a lot more work to be done. And I think it was important to make that point to yourselves.
And then finally, to thank many of you for the support that you've provided. And in some cases, the tough conversations have been the right conversations. And certainly from our point of view, people have made us think differently, and we've continued to evolve the business. And I'd like to think that, today, we're a little bit better than we were 12 months ago. And I hope I can say that again next year and beyond. So thanks for the support. Thank you for being here today.
And we're very happy to take questions."

One was around the capital controls and political uncertainty causing issues around or inefficiencies around capital allocation. And secondly, you made a point of wanting to focus on long-life assets. So what has changed in terms of your thinking around the thermal and Kumba assets? And is it just a case of you appreciating the diversification more? 
And then secondly, based on your comments of retaining now being an option, are you still actively looking at a disposal of these assets? Or are you now just sitting there and waiting for any potential offers that may come?"

So it's very healthy capital competition across the portfolio. We do take into account a global commodity position in thinking about that, but all of the assets will have, in our view, the right capital to make sure they're delivering good returns. But we will take that commodity point into account. 
In terms of long-life assets, what we've seen here is there are assets that do have long lives and are very competitive that we said we need to consider putting on a block to manage debt. We're very clear that, that was the imperative. We still have those 3 global commodities very much in focus, and that will continue to get our support, but what we have said, we've got another set of assets that are high quality, long-life and will continue to make a contribution. And they have a place in the portfolio because we've got the debt to where we wanted it and they've got great potential. In the case of Kumba more specifically, I think, the technical opportunities that we've been working on for a couple of years around the DMS plant. And those opportunities suggest to us that Sishen has got better than 20 years life still to be worked through but certainly good potential. So from my point of view, it has certainly the potential to remain in the portfolio. They're going to continue to improve, and other assets we continue to make improvements on. So we think what we've identified in the portfolio fits with the focus on asset quality and long life in areas that we can add value, and therefore they can remain in the portfolio. We will continue to do some cleanup as we go, as assets get to an age where we don't think there's much more we can do. We will sell. I think that discipline is something that we have to be much tougher on, in turning assets over, so managing the portfolio. I think that's very important for us. And in terms of South Africa, the point I've made is fairly clear, that for us, with the portfolio we have, we can operate and manage that portfolio and manage the financial issues quite effectively in our current configuration. It's my view, over time, that bulk will probably come off a bit in terms of the relative contribution. And so the difference in the 2 jurisdictions will change a little bit over time, but we can operate very happily in our current configuration. At the same time, if there are other ways or opportunities to improve how that, say South Africa sits in the portfolio, then we're also very open to having the conversation, but it has to deliver value to all of our shareholders, okay?

When we stood up in '13, we talked about strategy in 4 parts. We talked about cleaning up the portfolio and getting ourselves back in the game, being competitive. That was driving value. We've delivered, and you see that in production -- productivity, costs, capital efficiencies. That part, I think, from our point of view, we've made good progress on. Secondly, we said that we needed to restructure the business and to change the way we were running the assets, and so significant leadership change, the way we've organized, the functional model, the whole approach to running the business is very different. The third was we actually changed our key processes, the industrial -- the adoption of a more of an industrial model. The marketing model was very different to what the majors were doing in this space. You've got a trading model, a sales model, we've tried to pitch. And we saw this big opportunity to improve our margins across the board in our marketing model. That was the third element. The fourth element was portfolio, where we said that we would look to focus on those quality assets because, you'll remember, we did a comparison of margins against our major competitors. And I said we're well behind our competitors in terms of margins; and that we're going to have to change the nature of the way we ran the business, the first three; and the portfolio to close that gap. So we're closing the gap. We're not there yet. We've certainly had to take a more aggressive approach to the portfolio restructuring, hence to get the balance sheet down. So if you like, the way I talk to it -- I've used the word before and you can use whatever word you like. What we said is we tried to -- we pivoted to deal with the debt, which I think was the right thing to do, and we're pivoting back. So we would certainly argue that we've adjusted the strategy to deal with a tough set of circumstances, which was appropriate. And we've now pivoted back to where we were, which is an asset-focused strategy cognizant of the portfolio that we have and the commodities we have. And to go to your final point, I think the commodity mix we have is actually quite unique. So you might think about that a little bit differently to where we are against our competitors, but secondly, the real gap between ourselves and our competitors on margins, we're closing the gap. We've got a lot more work to do, but what we want to do and provide to our shareholders is a different set of options in terms of the commodities they can be exposed to. And that's just the -- a function of the assets you have, but the quality of the assets is the driver. There is this quote that I heard the other day which I quite like: There are no bad commodities, only bad projects. And for us, it's about the quality of the assets. And what we've tried to do is preserve those assets in the portfolio that we think we can add value in over time and continue to improve margins and returns. And that's what we think we can do and make a difference. And people will make their own decisions about the commodities they'd like to be exposed to. So I think I've tried to cover that full sweep. I'll go here, and then I'll come here."

Very quickly: We are in a process on domestic assets because the government has stipulated that we can have less than 50% given that we supply Eskom. We will continue on that process. We have made the observations that we're a 40% holder in Cemenco [ph]. It is unlikely that would be allowed to consolidate the manganese industry in South Africa, so we'd be open in terms of the conversation there. My comment was more around Kumba and export thermal coal, our Anglo-type assets, but at the same time, we're open to a conversation. And therefore, from our point of view, the statement we're making is we're very confident that over time we can continue to navigate and be successful in South Africa. That's a commitment, but at the same time, if there are other opportunities to create value for our shareholders, we're open. So we're making those positions pretty clear, but we're supporters. What we want to see is more certainty. And we will be positive and constructive contributors to the debate. 
On Quellaveco, what we've said is we want to get the balance sheet where it needs to be by the end of the year. We'll watch the copper price carefully. I think everyone's got to be careful. I know there was a quote of $2.70 in the paper. And I was asked the question and where I said we think that's a pretty good price for copper. However, we think at the moment Escondida is a factor in the price, plus some other issues around uncertainty of the majors being able to deliver on their commitments. So we're not yet convinced that copper is in the right direction. And from our point of view, we would need to be convinced that it's the right thing for copper and that certainly won't be in '17, from our perspective. We've got a lot of work to do. We will take that up in '18, but it'll be a really serious consideration around the market. We're in a good dialogue with our colleagues in Peru, and so we will continue, engage and try and do the right thing but not before time. The other one that we did bold there was Sakatti. Sakatti is more on operation long time before its due. There's a lot of licensing to be done, but for us, we're not talking the G word. We have no intention to talk to the G word. We've got a lot of cleanup we've got to do. We're focused on doing the right things, get the capital disciplines right. If the market is moving in the right direction in future periods, then we'll give that consideration but not before we finish the really important tasks at hand."

If there are changes, the chamber will engage aggressively. And I think it would be fair to say that if we see something that we're not happy with, we will make that known. And we'll challenge it if it's inappropriate, but I'm hopeful that people will listen to what we've been saying and will come up with something constructive, something that encourages inward investment into South Africa. That's our position. We've been very strong, and we will continue to debate that. From our point of view, we don't see significant risk across our portfolio. We've delivered now 26% plus. In fact, we're north of 27% on our ownership, so we think we're in good shape. The only area where we're down near the 26%, I think, was in thermal coal on a technical glitch on production, so for us not an exposure in terms of the assets. So we are pretty happy with our position. It really is making sure the go-forward position is the right one."

We've got there, the self-help has worked. We go back to the original strategy where we started before we did the pivot to deal with the balance sheet. It's quality assets, margins, returns, can we do as well as, if not better than, anyone else in the industry. We think we've got a running start with the 3 commodities I talked to, but we've also got other assets, for example, the longwall assets, best-performing productivities, margins, we've taken 50% out of the cost. Kumba we've gone from $77 down to $29, a lot more stuff we can do. We think the good assets, there's more value we can extract and at the moment, no one's been willing to pay the price. Therefore, we'll run them, and we've got to give the guys certainty in the business that they're going to run them for value and that's what we've done.

But one we're very conscious of and certainly, we've worked with Neil and the guys on things that we were doing and I know they have taken stuff on and doing other things to improve the performance. At Amandelbult, looking at technical changes, looking at what we could mechanize over time, so Chris has got a long-term incremental strategy to improve the contribution from Amandelbult and Tumela.

For us, we'll talk about policy and we'll debate policy, we'll debate it hard, but we also will be constructive. So we had those conversations. We'll continue to have those conversations. Norman has been the banner bearer for us as an Anglo consolidated position in South Africa. We've had constructive conversations about what we think should be done. It's all around policy certainty. The MPRDA, the Mining Charter and the fiscal arrangements to encourage inbound investment starts to touch on the flexibility question that I got earlier, those 3 points have been made very strongly. 
On growth, Hunter, people know that we've got 35 million carat installed capacity and it's a bit unfair to say to Bruce he could just wiggle his nose and pop it out. The market -- we will produce to the market, we're not going to get ahead of ourselves or the market. We have other incremental opportunities that make sense, but only when the market's in the right position. And that conversation could equally apply to copper, to platinum in Chris' case. And, I think, in Chris' discipline where you've seen a 40% reduction in our own mine production. So we're really focused on the quality of our production and the margins across that part of the business and improving the efficiency of our processing operation. So we improve our margins on par. That's why the marketing work is also so important to improve those margins in both parts of the business. So it's a common conversation across all of our commodities, that's where we're focused. I don't want to exacerbate those sorts of issues. I had 1 here, here and then I'll work my way back up."

But as Mark said, we had a good site in Site 1. Many of the factories in Surat have reopened, not all of them, but many of them post demonetization. So post Diwali, none of them reopened, which was what we spoke about in November. A number of them have reopened, so there's certainly an improvement in the low-end.

Second point, on commodities, there is still a lot of iron ore and coal around the world, and over time, I don't think any of the fundamental parameters that we talked to have changed. But when you get the problems that we saw in China, you might get a cyclone in Queensland and the other things, there's one thing that we do observe is the market is pretty finely balanced.

The other thing is you have to be flexible. You have to think and watch what's happening in the marketplace. We believe we made the right call in staking out what we had to do to fix the business and the fact I'm still standing here probably is testament that we made that call generally right. However, what we'd also say is it will continue to be a volatile market, that we have to watch it carefully and make the right decisions. The key thing that we talked about this time last year was holding true to the value conversation, and that has kept us in the right place. And that changes in the short term because how do you value a coal asset at $300 a tonne, is it going to be 3 months or 6 months? Well you've probably got a reasonable chance of estimating what it will be there. When you put those numbers together, I think, we've made the right call. So it will continue to change. The one thing I know, this industry will continue to change. What we do know is we've got some commodities there. We've got good long-term position. We'll continue to nurture them, and we will build a strategy of those positions. We've also got some great assets that will continue to improve, that will deliver good returns and will certainly, we hope, provide long-term value for shareholders."

If it is -- if your target is $6 billion, $6.5 billion of net debt, it's not very long until you're facing the same problem, call it a problem that other companies are facing, which is that their balance sheet is becoming under-geared, and there's a lot of capital that needs to be allocated, and I can't believe I'm asking this, but in all seriousness, with where your portfolio is sitting today, would you be more inclined towards using that capital to rebalance the portfolio through M&A or would it be more likely to be returning cash to shareholders -- or CapEx, I should say?"

But let's be clear: For us, first priority was to get the debt down. Second priority is pay the dividend. If at the end of the day, we don't have great options inside the portfolio, then we'll give that cash back to shareholders. I think that's the way companies should operate and from that point of view, assessing how good those opportunities are will depend on the market and how we see things at the time. But we have no problem giving money to shareholders on the basis that it's the best use of our capital. And we want to get back to that as quick as we can. We want to make sure that the company is in good shape in terms of its debt and that we've got some great opportunities inside the business but that will also depend on how the markets are shaping up and whether you're comfortable that you can forecast those returns on a reasonable basis. Now that's what we do in the business. That's what we've done for 40 years, in some cases well, some cases not well. We just hope that we have -- or we expect to bring the discipline that I don't think the industry has had for a long period of time. Certainly, we talk about that word in the way we think about capital. We've got to hold to that discipline in the organization. I think that's important. And so far, in 3.5 years we've stuck with that discipline, and I think that's why we're in a bit of plus. 
One thing I'll mention. You made an observation. I don't know if you can do this, Paul. If you look at the price volatility we saw in our commodities, if you go to the midpoint of 2016, which was the low point, we think, in certainly the most recent cycles, one of the tests we've asked ourselves is can we deliver cash and still make the right decisions in the business at that point? The answer is yes. Now this business is a very different business to where we were even 18 months ago on the basis of that test. And I think you've got to continually test the business. Can you may cash at the bottom of the cycle or what you think might be the bottom of the cycle? And you've got to make sure your portfolio is geared and that you're efficient and you continually testing yourself both sides. And that's one of the things that I think we have to keep in touch with across the business on a go-forward basis. Pricing can go both ways. We want to make sure that we've got very clear pathway either way and in all cases delivering value for shareholders. Can I take a couple of calls?

The only -- I won't call it creep, what Tony and the team are doing, they've identified a number of small-scale opportunities with rapid payback that we might look at depending on where the market is. Sensible stuff that you get very quick returns on the water, the energy, we are innovating in every part of the business, mostly without capital, but where there's a smart place to put a few dollars we will always be on the lookout for those sort of opportunities, a good one is the recovery project in Collahuasi on the floatation cells, no-brainer stuff, 12-month payback, quick return, sorts of things you do instead of throwing it on the tailings dam, we can bring that to market. Small scale, but nice returns. So in terms of capital creep, somebody talked about capital way. We don't have a capital way. We've under -- if you look at what we've done in the portfolio, we've changed the configuration of the business. The capital intensity is reducing as a consequence of those changes. So again, the portfolio work we've done is strategic insofar as it's uplifting the quality, which includes capital commitments required on an ongoing basis.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us this morning for our results.And I think, first up, I'd like to acknowledge my colleagues that are here with us today. Firstly, René",3876,"On the button? Good, okay. Well, all right. Okay, good. Good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us this morning for our results.
And I think, first up, I'd like to acknowledge my colleagues that are here with us today. Firstly, René will be presenting the financials for the last time, and so I know you will give him a rousing reception. Stephen Pearce joins us for the first time. He actually gets to enjoy this set of results. From here on in, he'll be singing for his supper. Tony, here as well. Norman, Anik, Seamus, Bruce, Didier, Peter and Duncan are all here in the audience. And one thing I would suggest or encourage you to do is make sure you talk to the team members. For us, I think it's very important to be respectful to you guys and give you the opportunity to talk to people in the business that are actually driving the business and driving the change. And please take the opportunity to tap them on the shoulder and get their perspectives on what we're doing because, at the end of the day, we get somewhat used to presenting here and I think it's important that you hear it from the guys that are actually doing the hard work on the ground. It's a very tight team. We've done a lot of hard work and still have a lot of hard work to do. So good to see people here, and hopefully, you'll take advantage of the opportunity to able to talk to the guys.
Well, jumping straight into the key issues. You'll see that we've used the word delivering change and building resilience, and we're making a very clear statement of intent with those words. There can be no doubt, I think, today in presenting these results that we've done a lot of work in terms of change. And our focus has to be to continue to improve the business to ensure that we deliver free cash flow under literally any market scenario that is thrown at us. And I will talk to and point to a couple of points during the presentation to reinforce that key issue for us. And to me and to us, that is the definition of a resilient business: your ability to handle anything the market throws at you.
Now in developing and talking to the 2016 story, we'll actually use this flow. We'll talk about delivering on commitments. We will talk to the operational improvement, go to the balance sheet. René will obviously pick up the financials. And I will talk specifically to the portfolio approach towards the end of the conversation. And obviously, we'll then have Q&A, and I'm sure you'll have quite a few questions.
I think, firstly, on commitments. Free cash flow, significant for the year, $2.6 billion versus $0.4 billion. For us, the importance of that number, I think, is best considered when you look at our average prices 2015 versus 2016. In fact, we saw about a 3% drop in our average prices on our commodity basket. And so the work that we've done is substantially stuff that we've driven, and I think that's an important point to make through the presentation. Clearly, the free cash flow drove the net debt performance. And that number is obviously being contributed on a number of fronts, and again, René will pick that up. But certainly, well below the $10 billion target. And yes, disposals did make a material contribution, but we didn't have to go as far as we originally indicated to achieve those numbers. So we're pleased with progress, a lot more to be done.
On the operating side, we've seen continuing improvements through each of the operations. And in particular, when you look at EBITDA margin, despite a 3% drop in prices for the full year, our EBITDA margin has actually gone from 21% to 26%. So we're really pleased with that aspect of the performance and for us probably one of the most important numbers to focus on in terms of what we've done and also where we need to go to continue to improve the quality of the results that we're delivering.
On the balance sheet, again from our point of view, very important that we get to investment-grade rating. In the end, the numbers are getting in that territory. For us, we can't forecast when the rating agents may look favorably upon the change. And René will give you his views on that, but for us, we'll do everything to make sure we get there as quick as we can. More specifically, we are targeting a reinstatement of the dividend by year-end, to be paid in 2018. On the portfolio, we'll continue to clean up -- continue the clean-up work that we defined when we talked about the portfolio back in '13 and '14. Our recently announced Union sale is an example of that continuing cleanup, but at the same time, I'll make the point that, as far as deleveraging the balance sheet, we are not required to make disposals to help us position because we see our free cash flow and the work that we're doing inside the business with the ability to deliver on our debt targets. So it'll be about portfolio cleanup. And again, I'll talk a little bit about that to give you more color through the presentation. Finally and to be very specific, we will retain Moranbah, Grosvenor and the coking coal and the nickel assets as well. And as I said, I'll pick that conversation up around the portfolio a little bit later.
On the results and going straight to the numbers, I think these numbers best describe -- these 6 numbers best describe Anglo American in 2016: EBITDA, a good result, again considering the basket price had dropped 3%. So we got a 25% improvement on where we were in 2015. Cost and volume improvements actually represent around a $200 billion -- a $2 billion improvement for the full year. We did have some headwinds. So net, we're about $1.5 billion -- or $1.6 billion in cash terms. And we had a $100 million adjustment due to platinum inventories. Again, we'll pick that up a little bit later, but on a cash basis we actually hit the $1.6 billion. On capital, we continue to hold our discipline across the organization. I think that's critical. And you'll see what we're forecasting for '17. The attributable free cash flow reflects the volume and cost work we did across the business. The net debt-EBITDA is a straight calculation. And obviously, the net debt number is certainly for us a very important number that we were focusing on for the full year. We've made good progress, but there's still a lot for us to do. And certainly, we are knuckling down to the next phase of improvement during the course of this year. We'll talk about that a little bit later.
I've got to say that across the business the one disappointment that we've reported is in safety. With 11 fatalities, it's both disappointing -- or if I could say, more importantly, it's unacceptable. The focus on critical controls, the planning of the work through the operating model is where our focus is, and we still obviously have a lot of work to do. The good news is a 24% improvement in our total recorded injury rate was encouraging. And at the end of the day, if we're not managing the key risks, then we remain exposed, and that's unacceptable. On the environmental side, we've done a lot of work. We've really focused on measuring what we're doing and how we're performing. And the reduction, almost an 85% reduction, in the incidents reported, I think, does talk to the planning work and the focus on the detail. And for us, it goes with cost reductions, productivity improvements and the overall business and performance. So we've got to get the safety right. A lot of work going into that by everyone in this room and through the organization.
On production. If I work from the right-hand side, 2% overall. Nickel, with the commissioning of the Barro Alto furnace, that we actually hit the full rate during Q3. So pleased with the good progress there. On iron ore, obviously supported by the continuing ramp-up at Minas-Rio. Guys have done some good work there. Kumba, with all of the restructuring during the course of the year, we're pretty happy with the numbers that were ultimately delivered. Chris and the guys continue to do very well on the finished platinum side. Yes, we had a couple of problems during the year, but overall the performance was solid. De Beers, reflecting the market, making sure that we're balancing our production to market demand, so a good recovery from 2015. In both the coal regions or the 3 coal regions, really solid work, restructuring, even with some sales, done a good job on the operating side. Productivity has continued to improve. And so some really good work across the portfolio.
On copper, I won't talk too much about the mid-year issues that we talked on Los Bronces. Since then, the guys have delivered the numbers. The good news, I think, from the copper side, and we saw those in the half year numbers, was the cost work. And so Duncan and the guys were able to improve their EBITDA contribution, and that was really a function of the very good work done on the copper side.
So overall, we're happy with the results. Yes, we could do better in terms of the areas that we had a few headwinds, but overall the numbers were pretty solid and supported much better performance on the cost side. And that's really where our focus was. On a full basis, we've reflected 9%, which is normalized for the portfolio changes. I think you'll see a headline number of 10% reduction. That's just how the numbers actually landed for the full year; nickel reflecting Barro Alto's contribution; very good progress in iron ore, particularly at Kumba. And you know that we've come from the $77 a tonne break-even price to $29 for the year. I'll talk to that a little bit later. So a good performance there. Minas-Rio, also making a contribution. I think Seamus and the guys made good progress there even with the constrained footprint, some good work on the cost side. De Beers, Bruce and the team focusing on the efficiency work, obviously helped by getting the volumes out. Coal Australia, again a good focus on costs. And they've come a long way. Don't forget in Australia in particular we're down more than 50%, so continuing good work. And in South Africa, some good progress. SA export coal, I'll pick that up. And copper, as I said, despite the volume challenges, good work on the cost side.
For us, the words we use are, ""the relentless pursuit of operations improvement,"" and I think, at the end of the day, cost is where the rubber really hits the road. And I think we've made good progress but a lot more work to be done in terms of underlying efficiencies.
On the EBITDA, cost and volume improvement you can see that on the cost side we were forecasting around $900 million contribution. We actually delivered about $1.2 billion, so we're pleased with the progress. On the volume side, we were expecting a bit of a higher contribution, particularly with De Beers. We did see some headwinds with the smelter failure at -- the Waterval smelter failure and the Los Bronces issue in copper which we dealt with at the half year. So net-net, we saw a $400 million contribution on the volume side. That got us on a cash basis to a $1.6 billion performance improvement across the portfolio. The platinum noncash inventory adjustment, we do the inventories on an annual basis. In 2015, it was $180 million contribution. This year, it was $80 million, so the difference in the $100 million is what we've recorded there. And so we do that inventory adjustment. It's in the range of expected outcomes, so there were no big surprises there, but it does have an impact. And it shows as a noncash, but it is something we should report on the basis that it talks to our run rate that we talked to earlier this year. So this is where the numbers are.
For us, when we look at what we can do. And I talked about the word or used the word ""resilient."" We recorded a 3% drop in our commodity basket price. I noticed some of the press stuff this morning was saying we got saved by commodity prices. In fact, during '16, our basket was actually on average below the 2015 numbers. Certainly, a great recovery in the second half, and we're enjoying that and still enjoying some of that recovery, but the improvement from 21% to 26%, says -- I think, makes the most important statement for the business. 3 years ago, we talked about improving our margins in tougher environments. And for us, that's where we've got to keep doing as much work as we can. And the second last bullet there, the marketing activities and marketing's contribution to that margin improvement has been also very strong. I'm very pleased with the progress that Peter and his team have made in their work. And they've delivered more than the $400 million we were targeting back in 2013, so very pleased with their contribution.
On a commodity-by-commodity basis, diamonds, as you would expect, where the market's starting to stabilize and certainly providing movement for products, we were able to deliver volume and cost improvement on the business. In looking forward, we'll continue to work closely with our customers to make sure that we're in the right conversations, with an understanding how the market is balanced so that we're making the right decisions. On the quality side, Gahcho Kué will make a bigger contribution this year and for us a very important part of the quality improvement that we're looking for across the portfolio to support margin improvement. And our production range forecast for the year is 31 million to 33 million carats. That's based on what we believe the market will certainly support in its current configuration. I think we've got to be a bit careful with the first site because there was some stock movement in those numbers. So I don't want people to get too excited. We've made the point, Bruce has made the point we've just got to keep an eye on the market. And we'll make sure that we stay very close to our customers in particular.
On platinum, we've been working right across the portfolio on improvement. Chris, you'll see, is here, jumping up and down in terms of the results. The sale of Rustenburg, for us, was a very important milestone for the year. And I have to give Chris full credit for the hard work that he put in, with the rest of the team, in making sure that, that got through. For us, the quality of the portfolio and making sure that we're positioned on the left-hand side of the cost curve is where I think we need to be, as we still see a bit of platinum around. And over time as the market moves our way, we should be the beneficiaries, particularly with our assets, on the right side -- on left-hand side literally of the cost curve. But there is still some more work to be done, good progress and certainly very good progress on the portfolio restructuring front.
On copper, on volumes, we're unable to rely on volumes to help us with our efficiencies, but really good work on the costs side. As I said, I won't get back through the half year challenges we had, other than to say that the guys have done a good job in the last 6 months continuing on the cost-reduction front and making a very solid contribution. Our production guidance for 2017 remains in similar ballpark. We're more focused on the margins on copper and make sure that we've got the right things happening in the business. On El Soldado, some of you would have heard that there is a debate with the government regarding some of the approvals. If we remember, back 18 months ago, we were on the wrong side of cash flow at El Soldado some $100 million. We've restructured, made a lot of changes. And it's now making a positive contribution and would have made a positive contribution back at prices at that time, so there's been significant improvement. I think it'll be next 3 or 4 weeks where we'll sort out what we need to do to get approvals going forward, but at the same time, if we're not able to agree and we don't believe that the operation will be making a contribution, then we won't continue going forward with the operation. We'd like to think that we can work something through with the government and get the right licenses in place, but if not, we'll make the right decisions in -- with regard to each asset has to pull its weight and make a contribution.
On coal, the Australian operations again have been leaders in improvement across the business; and certainly doing very well on any comparative basis, unit costs in the lowest we've seen since 2006. Grosvenor has made its first contribution. It's 7 months ahead of schedule, so that's significant. We've continued to clean up the portfolio through Callide and Foxleigh. And sorry, I should make one other comment on Grosvenor: We're still in the first longwall block. We have experienced geotechnical challenges that we're getting on top of. It's quite normal in your first block where you've got what we'd call virgin stresses around the wall to see some challenges. Usually, things get better in the second and third blocks, but we're making good progress. And we'll watch that closely and keep the people updated on the progress that we're making. In terms of going forward, we're forecasting somewhere between 19 million and 21 million tonne. Again, the guys are doing really good work on the cost side. Grosvenor will obviously be an important part of that production recovery -- or production forecast over the next 12 months.
In South Africa and Colombia, good progress. Certainly in South Africa the productivity work has been exceptional. We're actually up 45% on the last 3 years, so again good progress there. As a consequence, we've actually kept our costs at 2013 levels. There is still more we can do, and that, Seamus, with the team, is focusing on the continuing improvements that we can make. But I'd have to say that what it does demonstrate is that in South Africa we can be competitive with anyone in the world. We've still got a long way to go to match numbers that we're delivering elsewhere, but the progress has been very good, and so from my point of view, very pleased with the progress. And credit to the team for doing the hard work. And we still see lots of opportunities in Colombia as well. Again, the forecast there, the real focus for us is productivity improvements, getting our costs and continuing to improve our costs to make sure we can handle anything the market throws at us.
Kumba, most people are aware of the amount of restructuring that we've done. It has been a bit of a journey, taken a bit longer than we would like, but at the same time, if you go back to where we started at a $77 a tonne break-even price, we delivered for the full year $29 a tonne break-even price. I will put a cautionary point around the $29. It is a volatile number depending on where foreign exchange is and oil prices are, and so it can move anywhere between $30 and $40. The team is focused on continuing to improve the underlying performance and so that we're doing the best we can with what we've got, but the move from $77 to $29 substantially reflects good work of the team and in particular in '16, we got a lot of help in '15 on FX and oil, but in '16, it's primarily been the restructuring and the changes that we've made inside the business. For example, the downsizing by 40% was the important part of the improvements that have been delivered this year. So for me, that's a really important point to make. And credit to the team in the progress they've made. We all understand there's a lot more work to be done, but so far, we're very pleased with progress. And we'll certainly continue to encourage the guys to look for every opportunity to improve the business.
Similar story at Minas-Rio, improvement. We are constrained, as we said, by the pit room until we get the final license or the third-phase license, which we expect to get by the end of '18. But at the same time, Seamus and the team have done really well on the cost side. Our FOB numbers are pretty solid. In fact, FOB costs are inside the range that we forecast at full production rates. Yes, we're getting a little bit of a help from the real, but don't forget we peaked at around 4, I think we're at about 3.2, 3.3 at the moment, so we've made good progress. They've pulled out overheads and indirect costs. We'll continue to focus on getting that configuration right. And once we get a bit more pit room, we end up getting a bit of balance in the feed, and so there's an opportunity to improve those costs once we open the pit up. But we're expecting that license to come through in '18, a really important milestone, and we'll keep you posted on the progress as we go through that.
Finally, for those that get really excited when people talk about nickel. It has been an important transition for us as we brought Barro Alto on today. For those that check these things and the ramp-up curves for the new generation of laterite deposits. It's been the best performer based on the new laterites, and that's in the last 6 or 7 years. We've still got some performance improvement we can deliver through consistency. I guess, from our point of view, a bit more patience will be required on the marketing side, but certainly we're not leaving the business in the hands of the markets. We will continue to improve the operations and again really pleased with the progress that's been made and what the team has delivered from Barro Alto with the new furnace. And I think we hit full rate in Q3, and we've kept it at a pretty consistent rate all the way through.
I think, with that, I'll hand across to René to unpack the financials based on that performance. And then I'll pick up the strategy after René. All yours René. [indiscernible]"

And I would like to start by thanking the management team for the strong performance and allowing me to present a very strong set of results.So first goes through the key financial for 2016. So a very strong EBIT",1055,"[indiscernible] Good morning, everybody. And I would like to start by thanking the management team for the strong performance and allowing me to present a very strong set of results.
So first goes through the key financial for 2016. So a very strong EBITDA number of $6.1 billion, an increase of 25%. A lower tax rate at 25%, it's really on the back of 2 special items. First, in Australia we were able to use some unrecognized tax reserves, especially with the strong performance in coking coal in the second half of 2016, but also the change in tax regime in Chile for withholding tax and the impact on the deferred tax assets. Going forward, we expect the tax rate to be between 30% and 32%, obviously depending on the structure of the portfolio. CapEx, down to $2.5 billion. And as you know, we commissioned 2 projects in 2016, Gahcho Kué in Canada, in De Beers; and Grosvenor, the new longwall operation in Australia. We still have some spending in Minas-Rio in Brazil.
Very strong shift in cash flow from negative cash flow of $1 billion in 2015 to a positive cash flow of $2.6 billion in 2016. Disposal proceed of $1.8 billion, predominantly in the second half of this year. And we closed, we completed the sale of niobium and phosphate and the sale of our 10% stake in Exxaro in South Africa for $200 million.
So net debt, down to $8.5 billion at the end of December, which represents a net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.4x on a pro forma basis. We maintain the same focus on costs, operational performance and CapEx. And we keep getting the benefit, obviously, of higher -- high commodity prices. And at end of January, our net debt was in fact down to $8.1 billion, so continued to good -- make good progress in term of strengthening the balance sheet.
Turning to the EBITDA waterfall. On the left-hand side, you see the uncontrollable elements. Mark mentioned the slight year-on-year basket price decline, a 3% negative impact of $100 million, but there was a strong recovery, as you know, in the second half of the year. The point-to-point increase, so from end of June to end of December, for our basket price was 27%. So the 25% increase in EBITDA was really driven by the cost and volume improvement, a net impact of $1.5 billion that Mark covered earlier. And then you had the impact of the platinum noncash inventory adjustment and the impact of the disposal both in '15 and '16.
Turning to the reduction in net debt. So overall, a reduction of $4.4 billion from $12.9 billion to $8.5 billion at the end of December. I will cover in more detail working capital and CapEx. Just to maybe clarify on what happened with the tax side and on the interest charge: On the tax side, we had also the benefit in Chile of accelerating the tax depreciation, and we had a tax refund of close to $200 million in 2016. So I think some of you were surprised by the much lower cash impact on the tax line. That's what's behind this lower number. On the interest side also needs some explanation. On the -- from the cash standpoint, we will get the benefit of the lower debt in 2017. That will reduce, from a cash standpoint, interest charge by $200 million, but from a P&L standpoint, as we have now commissioned Grosvenor and Minas-Rio, we will capitalize less. And the net impact from a P&L standpoint will be in fact an increase of $200 million.
So net debt down to $8.5 billion. Our objective is to have a net debt-to-EBITDA between 1x and 1.5x using long-term prices. Our EBITDA number using both our internal forecast and the market consensus, net EBITDA roughly around $6.5 billion. So we would like the level of net debt to be closer to $6 billion to $6.5 billion. I think we agree that we need to run the business with probably a more conservative balance sheet.
Turning to the -- what happened in term of gross debt and where we are in term of liquidity. So a 27% decline in gross debt in 2016. So we had obviously the impact of the maturity in 2016 but also the liability management exercise that we did earlier in the year and the repayment of a BNDES loan in Brazil for $1.7 billion. So that will help us reduce the level of interest charge that I mentioned earlier in 2017. Liquidity has been critical over the last 2 years. That was very important for us as we were going through the downturn and the pressure. We have maintained a very strong liquidity close to $16 billion. As we -- there is still some volatility in term of prices and we continue to make progress on deleveraging the balance sheet, but we expect the level of liquidity to be adjusted going forward as we make more progress in term of reducing the level of net debt. And you see the maturity over the next 3 years, so around $6 billion of bond maturing of the -- in '17, '18 and '19.
Working capital. So a net reduction of $400 million, and that's the impact of the higher prices in -- especially in the last months of 2016. We got the benefit of optimizing our level of inventory in De Beers, a benefit of $300 million; as well as our ability to renegotiate some debtors -- some deal with some clients involving some prepayment and also some supplier payment terms.
CapEx. So down to $2.5 billion compared to $4 billion in 2015 and in excess of $6 billion in the prior years. We expect the level of CapEx to be maintained at this level in '17 and '18, the benefit of the commissioning of the projects that I mentioned earlier, but there will be an increase in SIB CapEx as we commission some new projects, for example, Minas-Rio and Grosvenor.
And then in term of disposals. So $3.5 billion over the last 2 years, so including $1.8 billion in 2016. And you have the breakdown between niobium and phosphates back -- that we completed in September and the sale of our stake in Exxaro in December.
Thank you."

Since w",3416,"Thank you very much, René.
I will just quickly give a bit more flavor around the progress we've made, talk a little bit about the portfolio and then just update you on guidance and give a few final comments.
Firstly, in terms of change overall. Since we started the significant work we've been doing since '13, on the organization front we've basically streamlined and reduced the numbers across the business both as a consequence of focusing on the assets that can add material value, the way we run those assets, the way we operate and the way we work together as an organization. And so there has been a lot of work done, still more to be done, but from our point of view, that was a very important part of the strategy that we outlined back in '13. And we've made good progress but, again, looking to continue to improve that work to support our productivity improvements across-the-board. On the portfolio front, we've either sold or closed 27 assets, reducing the portfolio to 41. I think it's a bit overly simplistic to say we're dealing with the tail of clearly that $600 million conversation we had back in December in '15, when we talked about $600 million. The costs associated with those operations is down to $100 million, so we have dealt with the tail, but there will always be some assets that are in different phases that you have to deal with. But certainly from our point of view, that's been a big part of the work we've done but as well as that the ongoing improvements to the portfolio have been absolutely key in helping improve the overall quality of the business that we're running and certainly been very important in improving the margins across the business as we go forward. Having said that, today, we've also added 5 new projects to the portfolio. So when we talk about margin improvement, it is a function of the work we've done on the portfolio and it's a function of the efficiency work we've done within each of the assets. And so from our perspective, it has been strategic in the way we've gone about the business, with still more to be done particularly on the cleaning up of the portfolio and the efficiency work in particular.
We won't go through the FutureSmart work. We will save that conversation for another day, but for those that saw what we were doing in December and understand what we're trying to do with the cost base on a go-forward basis, there's still a lot of opportunities across the business.
And finally, the operating model is about the way we operate. It's more of an industrial approach to the way we run our assets. Certainly, it's not about 1 or 2 years' game. This is a long game that we're playing in operating and improving the business, as is the marketing model. And as I said earlier, Peter and the team have contributed more than $400 million worth of improvements, which was the number we talked to a few years back. And that's from -- literally from the resource right the way through to customers, improving logistics, improving costs and improving the realized prices that we achieved. And certainly, we'll continue to work on that model, which is different to a trading model or a sales model. It's a very different approach; a lot learned from De Beers and what we're doing in platinum applied to other parts of the business, including bulk. So for us, the whole improvement strategy was not simply about costs. It's about improving every part of the business, drive our margins, drive returns and make sure that from our point of view we're doing the best for our shareholders on a sustainable improvement basis.
On safety and environment, again we've made significant progress, 50% down since we first stood up in 2013, clearly disappointed with how 2016 shaped up, a lot of work going on to make sure that we recover and keep going forward and continue the broader improvement trends. Similar for environment, in the end, knowing that we're doing the work, I think, is the important piece. These things really only come to the fore when you have a problem. What we're going to try and do is continue to improve the discipline, the planning and the work we're doing in improving incidents so that we don't have any large incidents. And that's always something that we all have to pay attention to in this type of business.
On the operating side, our copper equivalent production, from where we were, is actually up 8%. Now that's from 40% less assets. So clearly, the cleanup has been around the smaller assets and getting a lot more out of the larger-scale, higher-margin type assets. And so as a consequence of all of that work, our copper equivalent unit costs are down 31%. And that's in nominal terms, so from our point of view, that's an important number. And cash generation flows from those improvements. For those that do track back to what we talked about in 2013: The underlying, the EBITDA improvement is $3.1 billion delivered against the target. So we've done well against those original targets, and in fact, we've exceeded on most fronts. And capital expenditure, now that the major projects are through, we've seen a 55% reduction in capital. And in terms of underlying capital, we've seen on average 20% to 30% efficiency improvements, which are consistent with what we've done inside the operations with our general operating improvements.
In talking to the story in its most starkest terms. The blue represents the actual copper equivalent production that we've delivered on a year-on-year basis. So while we've been restructuring the portfolio, selling or closing assets and bringing new assets into play, we've actually held the production or slightly improved our production over that 5-year period. As a consequence of the portfolio work and the efficiency work, the production per person is up 41% from where we were back in 2012. And as a consequence, our actual reported operating costs in U.S. dollars 69%. Now when we talk inflation and FX, there's been a netting generally of those numbers, so the underlying improvements and portfolio changes, I'm not going to say they're both making significant contributions, just improve the quality of the business. That's where our focus will remain going forward, to keep driving those numbers to improve our margins. And with the marketing work and the other elements that we're working through, including the focus on being disciplined on the capital side, looking to improve our returns on a consistent basis as we go forward and put as much of our future in our hands and as we do in terms of commodity prices.
On the portfolio side, I think we need to make a few key points. First, we've been committed to the cleanup. And so when we talk, back in '14, of coming down to around 35, 37 assets, that was about improving the quality and making sure that we were focused on those assets that could drive value and that we were putting our capital in places that delivered the best returns over the long term. A lot of that work or in fact most of that work has been pretty well done. Second, we identified the need to go further on our restructuring program; and as everybody knows the story, in 2015, a pretty dramatic drop in commodity prices. We were confronting a real challenge in diamonds of the pipeline having filled probably in the prior 12 months. The prognosis for China was a bit open. And so from our point of view, we took the decision to drive and effectively put in place a self-help program, accelerated the improvements across the business in terms of costs, pulled our capital in hard but still making sure we remain committed to things like innovation where we knew that we'd have benefits longer-term. And we sold some assets. The one thing we promised our shareholders in all of those conversations and the questions we're asked, you're going to self-value, we've said that we would hold ourselves to very strict value criteria. And I think that we held true to that. In the case of niobium and phosphates, the one point we made is that, niobium, we didn't see a long-term opportunity to improve our position there given the size of competitors in the industry. The phosphate business was very much a local market, and therefore from our point of view, the price we realized was almost double consensus numbers. And we thought that, that was a solid price. It was subject to an open bidding process. That, plus the cleanup work, helped deliver about $1.8 billion and, with the $1.7 billion before, helped us get to the net debt number. So from our point of view, whilst we had solid offers on the table for other assets, those offers didn't match our value criteria at the time, and therefore we didn't make the sale. From our point of view, it was appropriate. And we made, I think, the right calls. In the end, it's easy to reflect back now, but from our point of view it was the right thing to do at the time; and certainly has given us the flexibility in going forward; and certainly from an organization point of view helped demonstrate the changes that we'd been talking to and the restructuring that we'd done could be achieved; and certainly from our point of view was a real rallying moment for the organization, a very important one, a very positive one. Consistent with that, we will maintain and keep Moranbah and Grosvenor and the nickel assets in the portfolio.
I -- so I guess the conversation around the portfolio is important, so I'll put the materials aside and try and talk these through to help you get an insight into how we're thinking. Firstly, 3 global commodities: Diamonds is a global business. Not all of the assets are Tier 1 assets, but each of the assets add value to the value proposition that we present to our customers. Bruce has configured the organization to deliver sustainable performance and results for the diamond industry. And he has our support on a number of fronts, whether it's technical or in other areas. That business has been configured to perform and deliver on a global scale. Similarly, platinum, although it's not the same industry and there are lots of learnings that are going on between the 2 businesses, again, Chris has the most significant platinum business in the world. And we run and set that up as a platinum business, and it is on a global scale. Copper is not yet at the scale we'd like it to be, but certainly with the assets we have, we believe we can improve the business both in terms of the quality and the contribution it makes. And that will take time. We will be patient. We will be disciplined, but it is a business that has global scale potential.
The fourth part of the portfolio we'd called very deliberately bulks and other minerals around 18 months ago are assets that have technical similarities, operational similarities. And Seamus has aligned the operations; and is sharing best practices across the bulk assets, the thermal coal, the met coal, the iron ore businesses, Minas-Rio. And the learnings that we have from each of those businesses are being shared as we continue to improve their performance. Very different in nature, but the most important point we make is that they're good assets. They aren't in of themselves global in scale, so it's not a global met coal business or a global thermal coal business or a global iron ore business, and that's relative to competitors. And so we configured them differently because we find setting this up is far more efficient and effective in terms of the way we've structured the overall business. And for us, that works. 
So the focus will be on quality assets, so it's an asset quality strategy, but it's also a strategy that pays attention to the nature of the commodities we're in, looking to drive returns in those businesses that are appropriate for the scale and the way we've positioned the business in those markets.
We've articulated those points in these bullets, and I'll let you read those, but I do -- will make one observation in relation to South Africa. In defining the strategy going forward, we talked about what we would do in South Africa and where our focus would be. The first thing I would say about South Africa is that we've restructured the business as we have the global business, and we've improved productivities in South Africa by more than 40%. We've reduced our costs in the same sort of 30% range, learning from all parts of the business. And that improvement has been done with stakeholders. Even though there have been tough conversations, the government has been constructive, albeit tough, as you'd expect them to be. And with our other stakeholders in the country, we've been able to navigate significant change in the Kumba scenario, the thermal coal scenario, Chris's restructuring of platinum. All of those conversations have been tough but required, have been necessary. And we've improved all of our businesses. They're all making cash. They're all making a contribution. And that's the first -- or that was our starting point in terms of making sure we had a good business in South Africa.
The third point that -- when I talk about South Africa and I think we are in an important moment in terms of policy certainty. The focus on the MPRDA, the Mining Charter and general fiscal arrangements to make sure that we encourage inward investment to South Africa are all important issues for us. As we stand here today, we can manage our assets, manage our operations for the long term and make a real contribution to Anglo American. If at the same time there are conversations around opportunity to do something different, we're open to those conversations. One key criteria: It has to add value for all of our shareholders, and that's the position we take. So we're happy with what we've got. We believe we can continue to improve and make a contribution, and that's where we stand. If there is another opportunity for another -- or an opportunity for another conversation, then we're open, but it has to be on the basis that delivers value for all shareholders, yes. I'm sure I'll probably get a few more questions on that point.
Targeting further improvement. As was said, for 2017, a lot of opportunities we've identified, and we will continue to improve. And as many of you know, the quest to improve never ends. We've been quite specific. So far, we've identified the $0.5 billion, or $500 million, that we've hardwired into each of the operating plans. We've also identified another $250 million of opportunity that are being worked on as we speak in terms of plans. And we're working to identify and bring to book another $250 million to deliver on EBITDA during the course of the year. It's certainly a stretch. I won't underestimate the challenge we see. I certainly believe on a cash basis we can deliver that type of number certainly on a much more confident basis, but for us, we want to drive that EBITDA improvement and continue that improvement basis that we've got going through the business. And everyone is focused on delivering those improvements. And I think that's an important piece of work for us and certainly will be an important update that we give at the half year.
In terms of guidance on the full year numbers. Again, René has unpacked the numbers. EBITDA, the improvements that we're targeting, capital will be around the same number. The free cash flow, you have to adjust for -- compared to last year. You have to adjust for working capital and some ins and outs. And again, René has provided a reconciliation, so those numbers should land. We would certainly see the net debt at less than $7 billion. As René pointed out, we're making good progress at this part of the year. Bulks are obviously helping us at the moment. And so I think it's a bit too early for us to book that on a full year basis, but certainly we've had a good start, and we thought it was appropriate to advise you where we're up to in January given what we've seen on the bulks in particular. And that range that we're looking for, I think, is very important. And certainly we'll be making sure that our friends at the rating agencies are aware of where we are.
Finally, in terms of that theme, delivering change, building resistance -- resilience -- it's a Freudian slip. We're building a portfolio of high-quality long-life assets. We will continue to roll out the operating model because, at the end of the day, the disciplines, the structure, the process that, that required, does require us to think differently and operate differently. And it really does provide, I think, a very solid platform for longer-term improvement, and so the conversation each year has to be about how much better can we do. We've got the foundations in place, still a lot of work to be done. Free cash flow generation remains the imperative. We need to keep generating and making sure that we've got the flexibility to deliver on the potential we have in terms of our next phase of evolution. This year is about the discipline and making sure that we're doing things right to get the balance sheet where it needs to be. In this world, I think volatility will be the keyword of the day, and therefore we need to have a much more flexible balance sheet. On capital management, we will maintain our discipline. Returns to our shareholders are a priority. And from our point of view, shareholders come first in terms of dividends. And by the end of the year, we want to be in a position to make that commitment and hold that commitment. And from our point of view, the discipline that's expressed through the balance sheet is absolutely critical.
So there are the numbers. Before I open the conversation up to questions, I did want to make a couple of points. Firstly, I'd like to thank René for the contribution that he's made to the organization. I think his contribution making sure that we've kept our liquidity in the right place as we navigated the major projects, I think, has been a very important point; one that might have missed a little bit in 2015. But again, René, thank you for the contribution that you've made to the group.
And I think, for many, wind the clock back 18 months, it was a fairly tough set of conversations and appropriately so. What I would like to do is acknowledge the work of everyone in the room here, the executives, my colleagues and all of our employees. Many of our employees are watching this presentation, so I think it's important to acknowledge them. The one thing they all know and we all know is we still have a long way to go in delivering on the potential in the business, so we just see it as a milestone and a lot of work to be done. We've still got, I think, a lot of catch-up to get ourselves to the front of the industry. But we've made some good gains. We've got a lot more work to be done. And I think it was important to make that point to yourselves.
And then finally, to thank many of you for the support that you've provided. And in some cases, the tough conversations have been the right conversations. And certainly from our point of view, people have made us think differently, and we've continued to evolve the business. And I'd like to think that, today, we're a little bit better than we were 12 months ago. And I hope I can say that again next year and beyond. So thanks for the support. Thank you for being here today.
And we're very happy to take questions."

One was around the capital controls and political uncertainty causing issues around or inefficiencies around capital allocation. And secondly, you made a point of wanting to focus on long-life assets. So what has changed in terms of your thinking around the thermal and Kumba assets? And is it just a case of you appreciating the diversification more? And then secondly, based on your comments of retaining now being an option, are you still actively looking at a disposal of these assets?

So it's very healthy capital competition across the portfolio. We do take into account a global commodity position in thinking about that, but all of the assets will have, in our view, the right capital to make sure they're delivering good returns. But we will take that commodity point into account. In terms of long-life assets, what we've seen here is there are assets that do have long lives and are very competitive that we said we need to consider putting on a block to manage debt. We're very clear that, that was the imperative. We still have those 3 global commodities very much in focus, and that will continue to get our support, but what we have said, we've got another set of assets that are high quality, long-life and will continue to make a contribution. And they have a place in the portfolio because we've got the debt to where we wanted it and they've got great potential. In the case of Kumba more specifically, I think, the technical opportunities that we've been working on for a couple of years around the DMS plant. And those opportunities suggest to us that Sishen has got better than 20 years life still to be worked through but certainly good potential. So from my point of view, it has certainly the potential to remain in the portfolio. They're going to continue to improve, and other assets we continue to make improvements on. So we think what we've identified in the portfolio fits with the focus on asset quality and long life in areas that we can add value, and therefore they can remain in the portfolio. We will continue to do some cleanup as we go, as assets get to an age where we don't think there's much more we can do. We will sell. I think that discipline is something that we have to be much tougher on, in turning assets over, so managing the portfolio. I think that's very important for us. And in terms of South Africa, the point I've made is fairly clear, that for us, with the portfolio we have, we can operate and manage that portfolio and manage the financial issues quite effectively in our current configuration. It's my view, over time, that bulk will probably come off a bit in terms of the relative contribution. And so the difference in the 2 jurisdictions will change a little bit over time, but we can operate very happily in our current configuration. At the same time, if there are other ways or opportunities to improve how that, say South Africa sits in the portfolio, then we're also very open to having the conversation, but it has to deliver value to all of our shareholders, okay?

When we stood up in '13, we talked about strategy in 4 parts. We talked about cleaning up the portfolio and getting ourselves back in the game, being competitive. That was driving value. We've delivered, and you see that in production -- productivity, costs, capital efficiencies. That part, I think, from our point of view, we've made good progress on. Secondly, we said that we needed to restructure the business and to change the way we were running the assets, and so significant leadership change, the way we've organized, the functional model, the whole approach to running the business is very different. The third was we actually changed our key processes, the industrial -- the adoption of a more of an industrial model. The marketing model was very different to what the majors were doing in this space. You've got a trading model, a sales model, we've tried to pitch. And we saw this big opportunity to improve our margins across the board in our marketing model. That was the third element. The fourth element was portfolio, where we said that we would look to focus on those quality assets because, you'll remember, we did a comparison of margins against our major competitors. And I said we're well behind our competitors in terms of margins; and that we're going to have to change the nature of the way we ran the business, the first three; and the portfolio to close that gap. So we're closing the gap. We're not there yet. We've certainly had to take a more aggressive approach to the portfolio restructuring, hence to get the balance sheet down. So if you like, the way I talk to it -- I've used the word before and you can use whatever word you like. What we said is we tried to -- we pivoted to deal with the debt, which I think was the right thing to do, and we're pivoting back. So we would certainly argue that we've adjusted the strategy to deal with a tough set of circumstances, which was appropriate. And we've now pivoted back to where we were, which is an asset-focused strategy cognizant of the portfolio that we have and the commodities we have. And to go to your final point, I think the commodity mix we have is actually quite unique. So you might think about that a little bit differently to where we are against our competitors, but secondly, the real gap between ourselves and our competitors on margins, we're closing the gap. We've got a lot more work to do, but what we want to do and provide to our shareholders is a different set of options in terms of the commodities they can be exposed to. And that's just the -- a function of the assets you have, but the quality of the assets is the driver. There is this quote that I heard the other day which I quite like: There are no bad commodities, only bad projects. And for us, it's about the quality of the assets. And what we've tried to do is preserve those assets in the portfolio that we think we can add value in over time and continue to improve margins and returns. And that's what we think we can do and make a difference. And people will make their own decisions about the commodities they'd like to be exposed to. So I think I've tried to cover that full sweep. I'll go here, and then I'll come here."

Very quickly: We are in a process on domestic assets because the government has stipulated that we can have less than 50% given that we supply Eskom. We will continue on that process. We have made the observations that we're a 40% holder in Cemenco [ph]. It is unlikely that would be allowed to consolidate the manganese industry in South Africa, so we'd be open in terms of the conversation there. My comment was more around Kumba and export thermal coal, our Anglo-type assets, but at the same time, we're open to a conversation. And therefore, from our point of view, the statement we're making is we're very confident that over time we can continue to navigate and be successful in South Africa. That's a commitment, but at the same time, if there are other opportunities to create value for our shareholders, we're open. So we're making those positions pretty clear, but we're supporters. What we want to see is more certainty. And we will be positive and constructive contributors to the debate. On Quellaveco, what we've said is we want to get the balance sheet where it needs to be by the end of the year. We'll watch the copper price carefully. I think everyone's got to be careful. I know there was a quote of $2.70 in the paper. And I was asked the question and where I said we think that's a pretty good price for copper. However, we think at the moment Escondida is a factor in the price, plus some other issues around uncertainty of the majors being able to deliver on their commitments. So we're not yet convinced that copper is in the right direction. And from our point of view, we would need to be convinced that it's the right thing for copper and that certainly won't be in '17, from our perspective. We've got a lot of work to do. We will take that up in '18, but it'll be a really serious consideration around the market. We're in a good dialogue with our colleagues in Peru, and so we will continue, engage and try and do the right thing but not before time. The other one that we did bold there was Sakatti. Sakatti is more on operation long time before its due. There's a lot of licensing to be done, but for us, we're not talking the G word. We have no intention to talk to the G word. We've got a lot of cleanup we've got to do. We're focused on doing the right things, get the capital disciplines right. If the market is moving in the right direction in future periods, then we'll give that consideration but not before we finish the really important tasks at hand."

And so we're hopeful that we'll get something constructive, something workable. And that's the point I was making at INDABA a couple of weeks ago, we want policy. So the MPRDA has been debated for 5 years. Its original construct -- or the construct of 2 years ago, we are very supportive of. There is talk of some changes. If there are changes, the chamber will engage aggressively. And I think it would be fair to say that if we see something that we're not happy with, we will make that known. And we'll challenge it if it's inappropriate, but I'm hopeful that people will listen to what we've been saying and will come up with something constructive, something that encourages inward investment into South Africa. That's our position. We've been very strong, and we will continue to debate that. From our point of view, we don't see significant risk across our portfolio. We've delivered now 26% plus. In fact, we're north of 27% on our ownership, so we think we're in good shape. The only area where we're down near the 26%, I think, was in thermal coal on a technical glitch on production, so for us not an exposure in terms of the assets. So we are pretty happy with our position. It really is making sure the go-forward position is the right one."

It's quality assets, margins, returns, can we do as well as, if not better than, anyone else in the industry.

Therefore, we'll run them, and we've got to give the guys certainty in the business that they're going to run them for value and that's what we've done.

But one we're very conscious of and certainly, we've worked with Neil and the guys on things that we were doing and I know they have taken stuff on and doing other things to improve the performance. At Amandelbult, looking at technical changes, looking at what we could mechanize over time, so Chris has got a long-term incremental strategy to improve the contribution from Amandelbult and Tumela.

The market -- we will produce to the market, we're not going to get ahead of ourselves or the market. We have other incremental opportunities that make sense, but only when the market's in the right position. And that conversation could equally apply to copper, to platinum in Chris' case. And I think, in Chris' discipline where you've seen a 40% reduction in our own mine production. So we're really focused on the quality of our production and the margins across that part of the business and improving the efficiency of our processing operation. So we improve our margins on par. That's why the marketing work is also so important to improve those margins in both parts of the business. So it's a common conversation across all of our commodities, that's where we're focused.

But as Mark said, we had a good site in Site 1. Many of the factories in Surat have reopened, not all of them, but many of them post demonetization. So post Diwali, none of them reopened, which was what we spoke about in November. A number of them have reopened, so there's certainly an improvement in the low-end.

Best-in-class, and this guy, who is actually working at one of those operations is getting 7,000 hours out of a truck. We've still got a long way to go. So I'm not going to be surprised if we continue to deliver operating improvements. That's our job. And we know what we've got to do. We've got a long way to go. We talk water, we talk energy. We're trying to take a leading position in step-change innovation. So that's important. Second point, on commodities, there is still a lot of iron ore and coal around the world, and over time, I don't think any of the fundamental parameters that we talked to have changed. But when you get the problems that we saw in China, you might get a cyclone in Queensland and the other things, there's one thing that we do observe is the market is pretty finely balanced. And so it can kick you either way over short periods of time pretty dramatically. That volatility, I think, is actually the keyword for us in these commodity markets. The other thing is you have to be flexible. You have to think and watch what's happening in the marketplace. We believe we made the right call in staking out what we had to do to fix the business and the fact I'm still standing here probably is testament that we made that call generally right. However, what we'd also say is it will continue to be a volatile market, that we have to watch it carefully and make the right decisions. The key thing that we talked about this time last year was holding true to the value conversation, and that has kept us in the right place. And that changes in the short term because how do you value a coal asset at $300 a tonne, is it going to be 3 months or 6 months? Well you've probably got a reasonable chance of estimating what it will be there. When you put those numbers together, I think, we've made the right call. So it will continue to change. The one thing I know, this industry will continue to change. What we do know is we've got some commodities there. We've got good long-term position. We'll continue to nurture them, and we will build a strategy of those positions. We've also got some great assets that will continue to improve, that will deliver good returns and will certainly, we hope, provide long-term value for shareholders."

If it is -- if your target is $6 billion, $6.5 billion of net debt, it's not very long until you're facing the same problem, call it a problem that other companies are facing, which is that their balance sheet is becoming under-geared, and there's a lot of capital that needs to be allocated, and I can't believe I'm asking this, but in all seriousness, with where your portfolio is sitting today, would you be more inclined towards using that capital to rebalance the portfolio through M&A or would it be more likely to be returning cash to shareholders -- or CapEx, I should say?"

But let's be clear: For us, first priority was to get the debt down. Second priority is pay the dividend. If at the end of the day, we don't have great options inside the portfolio, then we'll give that cash back to shareholders. I think that's the way companies should operate and from that point of view, assessing how good those opportunities are will depend on the market and how we see things at the time. But we have no problem giving money to shareholders on the basis that it's the best use of our capital. And we want to get back to that as quick as we can. We want to make sure that the company is in good shape in terms of its debt and that we've got some great opportunities inside the business but that will also depend on how the markets are shaping up and whether you're comfortable that you can forecast those returns on a reasonable basis. Now that's what we do in the business. That's what we've done for 40 years, in some cases well, some cases not well. We just hope that we have -- or we expect to bring the discipline that I don't think the industry has had for a long period of time. Certainly, we talk about that word in the way we think about capital. We've got to hold to that discipline in the organization. I think that's important. And so far, in 3.5 years we've stuck with that discipline, and I think that's why we're in a bit of plus. One thing I'll mention. You made an observation. I don't know if you can do this, Paul. If you look at the price volatility we saw in our commodities, if you go to the midpoint of 2016, which was the low point, we think, in certainly the most recent cycles, one of the tests we've asked ourselves is can we deliver cash and still make the right decisions in the business at that point? The answer is yes. Now this business is a very different business to where we were even 18 months ago on the basis of that test. And I think you've got to continually test the business. Can you may cash at the bottom of the cycle or what you think might be the bottom of the cycle? And you've got to make sure your portfolio is geared and that you're efficient and you continually testing yourself both sides. And that's one of the things that I think we have to keep in touch with across the business on a go-forward basis. Pricing can go both ways. We want to make sure that we've got very clear pathway either way and in all cases delivering value for shareholders. Can I take a couple of calls?

The only -- I won't call it creep, what Tony and the team are doing, they've identified a number of small-scale opportunities with rapid payback that we might look at depending on where the market is. Sensible stuff that you get very quick returns on the water, the energy, we are innovating in every part of the business, mostly without capital, but where there's a smart place to put a few dollars we will always be on the lookout for those sort of opportunities, a good one is the recovery project in Collahuasi on the floatation cells, no-brainer stuff, 12-month payback, quick return, sorts of things you do instead of throwing it on the tailings dam, we can bring that to market. Small scale, but nice returns. So in terms of capital creep, somebody talked about capital way. We don't have a capital way. We've under -- if you look at what we've done in the portfolio, we've changed the configuration of the business. The capital intensity is reducing as a consequence of those changes.

So in terms of what we can control, I'm not assuming FX numbers, that's stuff we can control, that's maybe the point of the question, okay. Stuff we can control.
Okay, guys, I think that's it. Thank you very much for joining us today and spending some time with us, much appreciated. And again, René, thank you."

So welcome, ladies and gentlemen. There aren't many women in the audience, I've got to say. They've got a lot -- we've all got a lot more work to do on diversity.
Firstly, I would like to acknowledge my colleagues in the audience. The feedback we've had from people generally is that they appreciate the interaction and the ability to chat to people regarding the results. So we'll continue to make the guys who really do know what's happening in the business and then the guys driving the change. From the presentation of results, we'd like to keep things fairly crisp and clear. Stephen will cover the detail behind the numbers in his presentation. So after I do my very short business summary, he'll take on the detail and I'll do I wrap at the end just to make a couple of other points and do a little bit on the forward-looking basis. So that's the format. We've structured it so that we can be fairly crisp through the presentation to give you an opportunity to ask questions. So with that, let's kick away and get straight into things.
Again, I know you will have seen the numbers. The key points that I thought needed to be emphasized in our conversations is obviously starting with the delivering on commitments mantra that we've talked to over the last 4 years. And certainly from our point of view, absolutely critical in terms of getting the right behaviors across the organization. In the operating performance, the self-help focus has been a key driver in improving margins. Yes, more recently, prices helped. But if you look at last year in particular, of course, prices were actually lower than they was in '15 yet there was a $4 billion -- turnaround so there's been a big contribution from the self-help side. We continue to improve productivities and that supported the 9% increase in volume on a period-to-period basis. As a consequence, EBITDA of $4.1 million is probably around the range that people were forecasting, free cash flow of $2.7 billion has been the important number from our perspective, more than all of 2016. Yes, prices helped but half of that improvement has been on the self-help work. And you'll see the $600 million of cost and volume improvement that we have achieved in the first half as well so we're on track to achieve the $1 billion. The balance sheet, good position. It's allowed -- or the net debt 6 months earlier and $800 million below the actual full year target, there's obviously a lag in the resumption of the dividend, which we're very pleased to be able to talk to today as well.
In terms of the portfolio, the continuing work on sales of the smaller-scale, lower-margin assets that don't fit the portfolio have continued with the announcement of the thermal coal sales -- the domestic thermal coal sales and the platinum assets during the first 6 months. And obviously the ramping up of both Minas-Rio and Gahcho Kué has obviously helped support and improving production outcome as well. In terms of positioning the future, we'll pick up those points in the second half of the presentation so I won't dwell too much on the points that we have made there on the slide.
Most importantly, for us, doesn't matter what we do operationally in terms of improvement in the business getting cost down. If you're not managing safety, environment and those issues that can create major issues across the group. We made better progress in the second quarter of the year, very disappointing first quarter on the safety front. Unfortunately though, we still reported 3 fatalities. In the end, it's not simply about the numbers. It's about the tragedies that go behind that, so we still got a lot of work to do on the safety front. I'm encouraged that the performance in the second quarter, on a total each injury frequency rate, was better but still more work to be done and a lot more work to be done as we continue the improvement program.
On the environment sent, we had a pipeline spill at Los Bronces that was cleaned up pretty quickly. We had the driven incident. And in coal, more -- an incident associated with some of the flooding that we saw both in South Africa and Australia in fact. But overall, much better control, and the results have been encouraging. We're not get done to 0 but certainly in terms of where we started, we've made good progress, and we'll keep driving the focus on planning, execution and focus on the detail that ultimately ensures that we're driving productivity in costs as well.
In terms of production, we're up 9%, as I said, period-on-period. Across the group, the focus on the implementation of the operating model and the performance improvements that go with that remains a key focus. The operating model is not something you can do in 6 months. It's a long-term change program with. We're 3 years into its implementation, and there are some very obvious benefits we're seeing in the portfolio. From my point of view, some honorable mentions in terms of the performance over the period. Certainly, De Beers, very solid. The -- ramp-up's going well. Mogalakwena in platinum continues to improve and we certainly see more potential as we get into the detail of drawing -- and other technical issues. Sishen done extremely well. I think tenders work off of the foundations that Norman started. I think Seamus Timber and the team have done a great job in curtailing to build and improve the performance. And the only real disappointment in the half was nickel. We started pulling in the first quarter, good recovery. Second quarter, more to be done. I still think there's a chance they might give the guidance a nudge but we're doing prudent. I think in suggesting a bit touch and go at the moment. So overall, a pretty strong sets of results, more to come.
For us, productivity, that is how much production each person is contributing, up almost 70% from where we started with the changed programs. If you look at the portfolio of changes we've made and the underlying cost efficiencies, if you look at how that's impacted on the numbers, we've gone from 162,000 to 95,000. And we're forecasting, with the sales that we've announced to [indiscernible] to  87,000 people, the contribution in portfolio change and restructuring and efficiency improvements is about 50-50, about 50% portfolio, 50% efficiency work. We still think there's a lot more to be done on the efficiency front. And so for us, certainly, the targets remain aggressive in continuing to improve. But obviously we've done the bulk the portfolio change and we don't have any active processes in place at the current time.
As an aside, when you look at our underlying cost structures, we've actually improved our energy consumption against our products by around 30% over the same 4-year period. So again, partly portfolio, partly efficiency work, and that's contributed to the real cost reduction in excess of 30%. We'll show you that it's about 23% in the numbers but continuing and important focal point for our cost improvement work.
On the margins, again, a real focal point for us. Obviously we get impact from the cost side but also the change in market and strategy was quite an important in terms of improving our margins. People are aware that we've seen against the benchmarks, we set ourselves back in '13 were up 4% in the material contribution to that margin improvement. As I've said earlier, the see-through margin, and just explain see-through margin, we take out the diamond trading work and the the purchase of concentrates so that people can see our margin as you would against our industrial competitors. Really making sure people understand what we're focused on in terms of the industrial business, and these are the margins that we've reported. So the 21% to 26% reflects that the adjustment in terms of the underlying numbers of you can see what we're doing. 26% to 34%. We actually had a lower price realized in '16. So that improvement in margin was in our hands and the 34% to 40%, about 50% our contribution with our efficiency rate and about 50% price.
So for us, it's a real focal point, and I'll pick that up and compare it to our competitors, not so much to make up any other statements than just to say, ""well, we've got a lot of work to do. We've improved and from our point of view, we think we're in the game with a lot more to come in terms of the underlying improvements that we think we can deliver across the portfolio.""
So with that, I will hand across to Stephen. So the good news about Stephen is he's not an an Arsenal sport and I think we've got him thinking very hard about Chelsea."
409115,530480088,1255640,"Anglo American plc, H1 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks, Mark. I'll kick you -- on the football team front.So listen, thanks, Mark, and it's a real pleasure to present my first set of Anglo American results.

So listen, thanks, Mark, and it's a real pleasure to present my first set of Anglo American results. So thanks for having me.
There's a couple of themes that I want to touch on through today's presentation. So firstly, clearly, a good set of operating and financial results reflects strongly in the numbers. The strength of the underlying cash flows. It's driven by price but also from the cost out and efficiency delivery and from project delivery as well. Clearly, a continued focus on the balance sheet and continuing to drive net debt down as we've reset and strengthened our financial position. Ongoing discipline around capital allocation, and that will continue. And pleasingly, restoration of the dividend.
But there's one overriding theme that I want to leave you as we talk through the slides and that does that we've still got work to do, I think both on the balance sheet front and on the cost out front. As I work through these slides, I'll expand on some of the numbers but I'll also try to just give you sort of a fiber of my thinking both on the numbers and how we'll take things forward across the different areas.
So let's go over the numbers. EBITDA of $4.1 billion, as Mark said, up 68% on the prior period, resulting in EPS of $1.19 per share. I'll touch on CapEx in more detail a little bit later, but clearly, lower in the first half. I'll talk through the first half, second half split, and we have lowered our guidance for the full year down from $2.5 billion down to $2.3 billion. Attributable free cash flow, $2.7 billion. All of that meant we reduced our debt down to $6.2 billion, so down $2.3 billion in the half, significantly below the $7 billion target that we set ourselves for the the of this calendar year.
So self-help. Obviously self-help continued in terms of EBITDA improvement through the half and brings the total gains over the last -- since 2013 to $3.7 billion, so across the last 4 or 5 years. In the current half, you can see we did have the benefit of higher prices, offset a little bit by inflation and exchange rates. From a price point of view, the standout clearly was met coal, so realized about $194, $195 per tonne across the half, offset a little bit by currencies in particular and the strengthening of the rand. Great news is we're on track to meet the $1 billion target. So another -- so $600 million realized in the first half, $400 million to go in the second half.
Most of you are aware, I've spent the first couple of months when I joined Anglo getting a bit about across a number of operations and praise to the teams. They welcomed me and are feeling to spend a lot of time with me. But one of my impressions is that there is still a huge opportunity in this business to continue to drive efficiency gains, get better at what we do, and it's going to be, I think, exciting as we take on that challenge in the years ahead.
So let's look at the $600 million that we delivered and the $1 billion challenge. So $600 million in the first half, a great start. A couple of points to note. Obviously De Beers and Los Bronces did well in terms of cost position and so sort of setting themselves up also for the second half of the year. Sishen was probably the standout. As Mark mentioned adopting the operating model over a period of time, adapting to the new mine plan, you saw that reflected in their announcement earlier in the week. So really, really great, really great drive of improvement. I think the exciting be there is a lot of that happened towards the end of the first half and again, I think there's a great journey ahead for that operation.
We still have work to do. If it was easy, we would've already done it, and it's one of those things where you keep delivering cost out and efficiency improvements. The expectation is that it will just carry on and it's not an easy thing to deliver. I can assure you the team is working exceptionally hard to try to hit that $1 billion target.
As we look beyond 2017, we'll come back to you towards the end of this calendar year in terms of how we're going to set the targets again for 2018 as we continue that journey.
So if you prove EBITDA obviously, and earnings clearly shows the benefit as Mark mentioned from the work done over the last couple of years in terms of portfolio, marketing margins and cost efficiency improvements. One thing I would just like to touch on is effective tax rate for the year. So for those of you trying to balance your balance sheets and get the numbers right when you the bottom line, guidance for the full year at 28% to 30% across the full year. So if you could plug that one in.
So let's then have a quick look at CapEx. So CapEx of $800 million for the first half reflect a couple of themes. Obviously capital discipline, about how and when we're spending money. When we do spend it, we're starting to see some of the same benefits that you're seeing from the operating side of the business flow into the capital side and to capital spend. And that should be no surprise because a lot of our capital spend in the half has been around sustained business and stripping capital. And in a lot of cases, it's some of the same fleet and the same setup that's doing that work, so we're starting to see some of that flow through into the capital spend numbers as well.
In terms of the first half and second half split, every mining company I've had the pleasure of working with has exactly the same issue in terms of first half and second half. It's probably a little more exaggerated this time around for a couple of reasons. One is we had a lot of wet weather in South Africa and through the first quarter. We also then had some geotech issues at Grosvenor and then Cycling Debbie, which also had some impact on our ability to spend some of the capital that we were planning the first half. So the second half will be higher, $1.5 billion, is what we're guiding in time on top of the $0.8 billion. And that would bring us in the $2.3 billion, as I say, some $200 million below our original guidance.
As we look forward to 2018, we've guided to $2.5 billion. I'd ask for your patience a little bit. We're sort of dusting off both how we're allocating capital, how we evaluate capital spend and we're obviously at the start of planning for 2018. So we'll come back and give you some more updated guidance there. But there's 2 things that I'm really looking at as we start to set the capital budget for 2018. Obviously are we spending what we spend well? And that's got to really drive through every single capital dollar that we do spend. The second one, I'll ask my Anglo colleagues to put their heads over there is if they can, and you may be surprised at this but I was spending enough particularly in terms of the projects that are going to deliver that next round of innovation and change and efficiency in the business. And so we need to challenge ourselves both not to spend money but to make sure when we spend it, we spend it in the right path.
This is clearly one of Mr. Cutifani's absolute favorite slides. So you know he loves to talk about return on capital employed, and return on capital employed 18% versus the 8% this time last year clearly shows the work that the team has done and delivered over the last couple of years. Attributable free cash flow of $2.7 billion, again, remember, this is the half. We delivered $2.5 billion of free cash flow for the whole year last year so we're significantly stepped up. And yes, that is partly priced but it's also partly self-help as we've shown.
So let's look at the balance sheet. A key focus for the group over the last 2 years has been getting the balance sheet back into shape, and the journey clearly has continued this half. So net debt, down to $6.2 billion. Again, well ahead of our year-end target. But we still have work to do and particularly in respect to our debt portfolio. So our debt portfolio is relatively short in its average life compared to our long-life quality assets that we have in that portfolio. So similar to what we did back in March, you should expect us to just gradually work on that over time as we extent out the maturity profile.
In terms of ratios, net debt-to-EBITDA at 0.8x below our longer-term guidance of 1 to 1.5x through the cycle. Gearing, 19%. Again, strongly supports and works with getting net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and certainly puts us well in positioning in terms of our peers through the industry as well.
We will be running a more conservative balance sheet than what you've seen the company run in the past. And that's particularly the volatility in metal prices as well as learned the lessons from the past. We have and are still coming off a period of higher than average long-term gold prices, particularly in iron ore and coal. So what you should expect to see and what you have seen is that they would take the balance sheet to a much lower level than what does long term through the cycle targets imply. And I've got absolutely no qualms at all in continuing to take the debt lower over the next 18 months. And I think with prices, where they are, we have a fantastic opportunity to continue to do that.
So dividends. Obviously, it's a real pleasure in your first results presentation to reinstate the dividend. And while I can't take full credit for the the dividend, one of the first things I did when I joined the company was make sure I got my name on the authorized signature list for the bank accounts so that when the checks go out, it can be my name on it and not René's. So watch out for that in the mail. Clearly, we have exceeded our targets, whether it be balance sheet, cash flow, ratios, et cetera, and that's really set us up to make for what was a fairly straightforward discussion at the board. So for the half, a 40% payout ratio on the half, that's $0.48 per share, $600 million back to shareholders. So it's a really great start as we've come back into this period. As we look forward in terms of policy, again, a 40% payout ratio based on underlying earnings will be paid on that basis each half.
We will consider additional return to shareholders, and I'll touch on that in terms of how we're thinking about cash and allocation. But right now, we've got other priorities in terms of continuing the balance sheet journey in particular. So it will be a nice problem to have when we get there. Right now, we'll continue the journey.
So just to wrap up before I hand back to Mark, just a couple of thoughts on how we're thinking about cash flow and capital allocation. A couple of smiles in the audience, obviously, a number of companies have similar sort of slides. Left-hand side, the theory; right-hand side, the actual numbers for the have and we'll sort of continue to report on this basis as we go forward.
So again, great cash flow generation in the half, and you'll be used to seeing the $2.7 billion. But we've adjusted that prior to make a discretionary capital, so $2.8 billion prior to that discretionary capital. Have we spent that money? Obviously nearly all of it was allocated to reduction in debt in terms of that balance sheet priority. And that's consistent with our commitment that Anglo American made in terms of getting the balance sheet right and obviously with the dividend, reinstating the dividend before we consider spending money and allocating capital to other things.
So you can see in there, the $2.3 billion is the reduction in debt, a few other balance sheet bits and bulbs, and obviously the dividend that we've declared now, that $600 million will drop into that red sort of category into the second half of the full year. Again, you can see very limited allocation to discretionary capital studies, exploration, et cetera. And again, to me, that sits really well in terms of where our priorities were for the half and where they will be for the remainder -- for the balance of this year.
So again, just to leave you one thought, I think, we do have quite a lot of compelling opportunities that wasn't the portfolio and a lot of compelling projects within the portfolio. And we'll consider those in time as we allocate that cash. But it does -- it is important to realize those projects have to compete with additional returns to shareholders, and we'll really consider that as we think about our cash flow allocation. Mark?"

Okay. So in terms of where we started, I guess, a 1-slide recap. Firstly, with all the work that's been done, it is a more efficient business. It has required a lot of work, probably coming off a lower base than any of us would've liked. But today, 46% less assets in terms of people, similarly reduced. About half of that change, as I said is portfolio, and the other half the actual restructuring, downsizing and efficiency work to be done. That obviously has improved our competitive position but still a long way to go, in our view. But at the same time, with all of that change and all of those changes occurring, the portfolio reductions, our production is actually up 6%. So the generating more cash and higher returns have been about fundamental change across the business, a $4.4 billion turnaround in the cash flow and obviously an improvement in return which, for us, is an important number. And if I can say it this way, the focus on ROCE is absolutely critical because the way you get that cash flow is all about how you allocate capital to make sure you're delivering efficiency. It changes the mind set in the organization. And I think the most important thing that I can say about what we've done from this perspective has been focused on changing mindsets, and I'll make the point at the end of the presentation that driving that cultural change has to be around the numbers you tell people are important. And I think we're making good progress but still a long way to go.
In terms of the portfolio, you've seen this slide before. I won't dwell too much on this slide before. From us, a lot of the hard work was done in '14 and '15 but we've continued to work on improving the portfolio and making sure that the assets we have today, when you look forward, are assets that can be competitive, that can generate cash, can generate returns and to continue to improve the underlying performance of the business, and that's where we've been coming from.
Again, in making the point on margins, this is where we were back in 2015 compared to our 3 major peers. Again, we're showing the comparison not to make any comment about others. I think everyone's doing hard work and doing good work, but more to make a comment about what we've tried to do in the business. 26% of 34% from '15 to '16 was achieved with a lower-priced deck in 2016. That was about self-help, and I think that's an important point to make. And for 2017, the first half, we're at 40%. Again, we know there's a lot more to be done but that focus on margin, which is why the markings that is a waypoint, it's not simply about costs, it's about efficiency, it's about making sure the assets are working to their potential and from our point of view, marketing in contribution has been important in terms of that prices. So that's what we focus on because that's what drives cash flow and returns in terms of the capital that we've deployed across the business.
Again, just to reinforce the strategic approach and the conversations that we had, it's about assets. It's about the quality of the assets. And so when I show revenue a product in terms of commodities, it's not about deliberately positioning in one commodity over another. None of us have been terribly successful in forecasting commodity prices, certainly in the short term and even in the longer term. It's a bit of a fraud guide. What we're focused on is the quality of the assets we have, and as a consequence, we've got quite nicely diversified portfolio in terms of the assets we have and the positions we have.
From a geographic point of view, same story. The geographic diversity we have in the portfolio is a function of where we have quality assets. And yes, partly still a work in progress but the portfolio, as a consequence of the decisions we've made on selling assets and in where we've allocated our capital in building new projects is, as a consequence, rebalancing the portfolio as you can see there today. And with South Africa about 25% of our capital employed, the balance is starting to look quite sensible. In the end, it will be a function of the quality of the assets. So it will change over time as a natural consequence of focusing our capital where we think we can deliver the best returns.
On South Africa itself, from our point of view, we remain, I think, committed to the assets that we think can deliver the long-term returns in the business. If I talk about Mining Charter 3, I think the important point to make is that for Mining Charters 1 and 2, we've delivered all the requirements plus some in terms of transformation and all of the other objective measures that we use to judge whether you actually transform the business. And as an aside, Anglo American has been the most transformative company in the last 24 years in South Africa. We represented 61% of the JAC back in 1987. Today, we're about 67%. The 90% change in our configuration in relation to the JAC has been about the companies that have been demerged or spun off in South Africa that represents massive transformation on a scale no one else has matched across the country. Today, in the assets that we operate in South Africa, approximately 40% of the ownership of those assets in direct South African hands. And when we take South African ownership, mostly pension funds and others who aren't Anglo American, their ownership a 62%. We are committed to transformation and making sure that we've got the balance right for both staff South Africa and our shareholders.
Today, the document that we have that has been presented is an unworkable document. Without saying anything else, I think it's important that we come together with the government and work through and find a solution that works for everyone. There's no point shrinking the pie to 0. We have to create a larger pie to make sure that all benefit. But from our point of view, that's where the focus needs to be and certainly, we're part and part of the industry and making sure that conversation goes forward the right way. From our point of view, we've been doing a lot of work on restructuring. The corporate structure simplification, overheads, improving the business. We will continue to focus on efficiencies of the operations and certainly, from our point of view, making sure that we're delivering the best performance we can in terms of the assets that we operate in the country.
For us, over time, clearly, in terms of allocation, we have a number of opportunities, many of them outside South Africa so that's where the capital will go. And as a consequence, you will continue to see an adjustment of our -- the relative capital employed across the business. But it's a function of the assets and where the opportunities are. For us, wherever we allocate capital, it's about value. Value for shareholders and for us, that's where the focus will remain and that's where we'll consider having positioned ourselves in any jurisdiction across the globe.
More specifically across the commodity positions we have. Clearly, in copper in De Beers, we have very good positions. I think the prognosis in terms of market dynamics is very strong. We've got great assets. We're certainly well-positioned to advantage of those markets with very good assets that we have. And so a very strong and very much gets the green light in terms of allocating capital carefully into those areas where we think returns are certainly available to us.
In PGMs, I see Buffalo -- is here from South Africa. Chris -- Chris has done a fantastic job in restructuring the business, focusing the portfolio on those assets that we believe can deliver returns through any price scenario in the market. There's still a lot more work to be done. And Chris I know has spent quite a bit of time talking about the cost-reduction strategy for Amandelbult and we ongoing improvements he wants to deliver in Mogalakwena, and you also have to remember that we've got very good margins in our processing operations and leaving reasonable capital returns what to do better. But in terms of the portfolio, the best performer portfolio in the industry and certainly from our point of view, on these prices, we now want to make sure that portfolio can deliver better than the 15% return and that's what Chris and the guys are working on and they have come long way. 
In iron ore and coal, Seamus has done a great job with the bulks team right across the board. We've been absolutely thrilled with the progress that's been made. We've had to think very carefully about the market positions we take. High-quality assets, very good cost structures in coal and mid- to mid-third quartile cost in iron ore but with a great quality product. So how do we think about maximizing our margins in the markets in which we operate? And so a lot of thought has gone into us positioning to make sure we can maintain the margins and improve our returns. And I think we're well on the way to showing how far we go, and we still think we've got a lot of improvement to go. And I think, all credit to Seamus and the guys, a few challenges in the first half at Grosvenor. They've continued to improve and certainly, the last month has been very encouraging. But with that asset, another leg that I think will make a material contribution to the business. I'm very excited about the potential we see particularly in the last month. So a lot of work to be done, thinking very careful about our capital allocation and it will all be about making sure we can generate cash flow and returns.
So finally, just making -- or taking all of those pieces and summarizing the key points. Again, from a portfolio perspective, it's about the quality of the asset. The portfolio upgrading to support sustainable cash flow and returns is the mantra that we work to within the business. It's about cash flow and returns. Those assets are the assets we see the best potential today, tomorrow and into the future. And everything is focused on improving those positions and making sure those positions are sustainable. We see a lot of smaller scale, smaller scale capital opportunities to improve the business. Steven's point about making sure that we get the expenditures right. We've been tough. The guys have done a great job managing and improving the efficiencies of the capital. We've got to continue that focus but at the same time make sure that we're seeing the best opportunities to actually grow the performance of the business. And we've also got larger scale opportunities that will be very carefully schedule considered in terms of the way we allocate capital, and I'll pick up that in my last bullet point.
In terms of capability, you can't make money in this business if you don't have the engine running to its potential. We've made significant improvements, but we're still not near the potential the assets have. That's the challenge to the team. There's a lot of work done on the cultural change across the organization. The focus on capital efficiencies is key. We acknowledge team for the performance improvement they've delivered but they're also the first to say we've got's still got a long way to go. Innovation then becomes a second phase for us in terms of improvement. We still see more from an operations point of view, but the technical stuff that Tony and the team have been working on, on energy, water, mining methods and step changes across the business I think are critical. And to those that have taken the time to dial into the future smart stuff can see how the thinking is starting to evolve across those areas. Again, marketing remains an important part of the business in helping us improve our returns, our margins and driving the returns. And certainly we've made great progress and we could still see a lot more opportunities in terms of improvement.
On the return type, balance sheet flexibility is being restored. Steve and I think made a very important point about keeping our balance sheet flexible so that we always thinking about right place to put money to drive the business to improve performance. And what you tend to do if you let yourself get out of whack on the balance sheet is you then start making short-term decisions around what you should spend and what you shouldn't spend. We don't want to get back into that trap. So for us, very important. For us, that cash flow and returns absolutely critical. The syndication comment, we've been talking about syndication of major project ever since we got ourselves in a position where we were building 5 major projects at the one time. And we've got quarter and stressing the balance sheet. So I wanted to make the point, the lesson has been learned. We studied the oil and gas business and other businesses and how they effectively manage a portfolio and risk on those major projects. So for us, the -- is very much about getting the syndication and our propellant because there are always things you don't know, you don't know that you could touch here. So I think most importantly, we've taken the lessons of the industry in the last 5 years in particular, applying them, always learning, but we certainly see that the improvement in the operation reflects the focus on what we think are the critical issues. And if I make one final point and in many ways, it's the elevator test, the elevator message I'd like to make with you. In our business, we talk about 3 things in measuring whether we're doing the right thing for shareholders. Are we generating cash flow, free cash flow that supports the future development of the business and delivers real returns to shareholders? So it's about free cash flow. Secondly, how did you get that cash flow? And the best way to measure your efficiency in delivering those cash flows is your returns on capital. So that conversation from the first day, return on capital employed remains a mantra for us. Absolutely critical. Third point, how do you grow those cash flows? How do you improve the business? How do you make sure the business is sustainable? So safety, environment, the social development work you've got to do, people, the talent pool you have, competitive cost and capital allocation. Absolutely the critical elements to make sure cash flow and returns are sustainable and we can grow off the foundations we've created. That's how we're thinking. That's how we're approaching the business. Very happy to take questions with that.
Well, I'll start from the right, work across."

Gahcho Kué, I think it would be fair to say, Bruce, that what we found so far is that whilst the quality has been a little bit lower than the anticipated, the actual carats per tonne have been more than we thought. And therefore, the revenue springtime have been on or better than anticipated in terms of the current mix. So we think that the news is fine with the production ramp ups that are going very, very well, so we've had a good few months. So I think you've always got to be a bit careful, particularly in the upper levels of the or body. But the revenue per tonne is holding up okay, a little bit down on quality but better carat. So so far, so good in terms of the revenue. But again, we've got to be very careful. It's still very early, And I think but we're certainly not worried by what we've seen so far. It would be within the scope of what we expect. On Los Bronces, it is a tight pit. You're right. Duncan and the teams are working with a very tight pit room and until we can get that further opened up, things will remain tight. I think the key with Los Bronces is to again establish that pit room and continue to work with Codelco in finding the best way to work together across the pillar so that we both get the positive outcome. The relationship with the Codelco is very good, very open both ways. I think we've mended all the fences plus some. So I think it's a good relationship. The team's got a lot of work to do. So I think it's still going to be tied to deliver the balance of this year and I think the key will be that relationship with -- to get a bit more flexibly.

So those basic numbers tell you that we still got 20% to 30% underlying productivity across the business that we want to chase.

So I'd like to see that index hopped over 200 in the next couple of years. And so that will give you sense of what were going to try to achieve in terms of the people side.

Automation is only a small subset of our broader program, and we're really concentrating in 3 main areas. One is the ore body getting much better tagging of the mineralogy at the properties of the ore body. And we're generally doing that with hyper spectral imaging. So it's basically processes that we'll ultimately replace SA. If we don't flow that through into our processing plants, what we're really trying to do is become much more precise in the way we target the minerals entering our processing. We're working basically taking this tagging and then working on flotation in particular, the way we cyclone cross-particle flotation. And I think a lot of the industry rolls around flotation and recoveries you actually get are about to be rewritten. An example of that is some of the new process that we're developing with partners in Germany, break the rock in a very different manner than a beat ever been used to. It tends to break along the particle boundaries rather than just mash everything. And I think it will actually set us up for very different chemical recoveries. And we'll see step changes coming out. So I found this much more interesting than the balance sheet. The day we get you guys into the [indiscernible] space I think we've made it. But we are putting quite a full presentation on our innovation out in Australia in a couple of week's time.

The one thing that we believe in our diamond portfolio is we've got a great endowment that we haven't fully tested. So what can we do more at Ruppa, Jwaning longer term, Venetia, Gahcho Kué is still too early to make a call in the future but those are quite significant and we haven't done a lot of testing beyond where we are today. The most significant one that we think is not working towards the potential is Ruppa. And so Bruce is thinking very hard about how we can get in the right way and working with Tony and the team on stepping that out with incremental improvements in the operations. And so we've got a few of those. Some of those will take up a little longer but certainly we think that's where the big opportunities are around those major assets really haven't really tested those endowment. Secondly in copper, Collahuasi and Los Bronces both have lots of potential. Los Bronces is going to take a little more time and I think we'll require some -- a little bit more flexibly around the mine, as I talked to and certainly with our friends next door. We can help each other we'd be a lot more flexibility there's an opportunity there. I think the technology stuff that's in copper is really important. So we currently got our pilot plant operating on cross-flotation with crushing, cross-flotation and the dewatering so that we can materially reduce our water consumption, we'll reduce our energy probably 20%. Those opportunities in copper require significant. And the reason why they're important is that water allows you to produce more because that's the scarce resource. There are 2 opportunities in Collahuasi and Los Bronces, I think it's around technology and Tony and -- are teaming up in that work. In platinum, Chris's incremental options on will go look why not is still very good. If you remember, he put money aside to do debottlenecking to get to 400,000 ounces. He didn't need the money to get to 400,000. He's done a fantastic job with the team debottlenecking. Just do simple things smarter. He's still got some money there to do a little bit of sensible debottlenecking given its $1,000 an ounce margin, it's a great place to be. He's already highlighted this week his intentions on Amandelbult to try and take $200 to $300 an ounce out. He's already building a chrome plant that he's got a 12-month payback risk on the delivery of the chrome plant. So lots of opportunity to do things smarter in platinum. I could talk about the Grosvenor debottlenecking with the processing plant. Let's make sure we get the as attorney to potential. It is not going to operate 5 days a week. If we can get it 7 days through the incremental contribution to the business. Know about Minas-Rio going to its 26.5 million. Obviously that's linked to the licensing process and we think there are things we can do to get it to around 30 million  tonnes at the right time with very small capital increment. So there's a whole raft of projects that we've got and can we see across the portfolio that are being nurtured through either innovation or basic technical changes that we think we can deliver very good payback and very return to well above 15%. In terms of major projects, I think if we made a comment 1 or 2 meetings ago, we prefer not to have 1 big project opened at any one time. You might be at the start or the tale so you will have some overlaps. But that's your preference. And in our case, clearly -- is the one that's moving towards a commitment, probably the earliest. But I again keeping the balance sheet in the red please make sure you got a good balance opportunities I think is the key to continually improving the business. And I think we've got a lot of those opportunities that we still scratching -- where we go to from here that's why Stephen is making is clear that 2.5 is the pitch number. There may be opportunities to do some really good stuff for a little bit more, make sure we've got the development balances right. We haven't starved the business. Although we made tough calls what we want to make sure is we've got everybody balanced in the right place and we got the flexibility to be productive and get the productivity number over 200%."

At the moment, building many project is probably quite cheap, contractors are cheap, everything's cheap at the moment. Wouldn't it make sense to fast-track some of these projects instead of paying down net debt and getting on with it well costs are cheap rather than having to chase it when everyone else is vying for growth in 2 or 3 year's time?"

The underlying performance, you can do the numbers, and we would agree with you. We think we look at but a bit hopefully people will give us more credit. But I also acknowledge the South African question is the question. So in terms of South Africa, we're doing all things we said we'd do on corporate structures, we're simplifying them, we're working on all of our overheads and our costs across the business and we've reduced those significantly. We've managed and sold assets that are either small scale or not long term. Really not a fit. That's the 5 assets we've got in process at the moment. We're doing that type of work. We're improving the businesses a lot more still to be done. And that's where we've got to remain focused. I've said, I think I've said this last time. We don't expect to land a longer-term position on South Africa this year because I think there'll be so much or noise around the leadership debate that it will be really difficult to get anyone to focus and align with us on the pieces going forward. So what we said is we like the assets we have, we're going to continue to improve them, and at some point, there'll be a dialogue on the positioning and approach on the way forward. I'm not sure where that will land. In the meantime, we like the business. The guys are doing a great job in restructuring. We're -- driving it and hopefully continue to generate cash and with Chris and the guys working hard in platinum, we'll continue to improve it. I think the other point that's really important is if you look at the U.S., they're still arguing about the election. There's nothing new in countries going through leadership the best have lots of noise. Unfortunately, South Africa tends to be more noisier than most given it's 20 years into a constitution. So we knew they'd be noisy. It is noisy. It's unlikely we'll get someone on the other side post the electoral -- the leadership piece, probably in November, Norman, and we'll continue doing the things we said we do. Okay."

There's no mention in the presentation review of the idea of core Anglo anymore. So would it be fair to assume that pursuing asset sales activity is no longer a priority for the management team? Related to that, how do we think about the South African bulks piece within the group that have been price articles in SA about Anglo potentially considering a partial exit or an exit of it South African bulks businesses. With no core Anglo in the presentation, should we assume that that's not something that you're working on? Following on from that, is an exit or a partial exit or some kind of restructuring in SA dependent on the political outcome? Or can you do something in SA without having a more business-friendly leader of the ANC in place, if you want to call it that? And then the last point, can you do anything in SA until we get a resolution on the charter as it relates to transfers of mining rights?

I don't want to go any further than that because it;s a bit hard speculating on what we don't know and the politics will change over the next 12 months. Like all like all these things, politics is something you take into account but it's not the only issue. There are a range of things that we'll take into account. So at this stage, we're open, we're operating, we're improving and we'll make those decisions probably during the course of '18 as you would expect we would in making sure that we've got a portfolio right. Politics, yes, it will make a difference but not to the extent that it's the only factor. They're a range of factors and in every country we operate, we take a whole range of factors into account in making decisions to allocate capital.

And this big net debt -- sorry, net cash, looks especially noticeable in the context of increased political risks. I understand that it helps balance out net debt for the group but in ultimately the only thing you can do with this is pay it out as dividends, right? So why is it still sitting there? And second question is about why is it about diamond market outlook. The rough diamond market has been performing reasonably well or even pretty well, which stands I think in contrast with somewhat unimpressive performance in the Polish market with prices stagnating and very mixed signals in terms of demand from jewelry and midstream. What do you see here in terms of outlook for the second half, outlook for 2018? Is there a risk that the situation in the rough diamond market could deteriorate sharply as -- or haven't before or you think it's just not on the cards?"

So now not changing our long-term targets at this point in terms of the sort of stated target we've had in terms of debt-to-EBITDA ratio. So 1 to 1.5x through the cycle. That doesn't mean though where we have periods of higher prices, we should be really right towards the low end or below the low end so that when you do get back to long-term cyclical prices, you're back in that range. And that's just very happy to be in the journey at the moment. So I'm going to make much of it over the next 18 months particularly in terms of getting that as low as we possibly can. You touched on the sort of the split balance sheet. So while the 0.8 looks very attractive from a rest of the world point of view, we're below 2, but still on a long-term price scenario, that would probably create back towards 2 and we'd like to be below 2 from a rest of the world point of view. So yes, we're just nicely, neatly in that range at the moment. The South African cash has built up partly because of the operations in pricing particularly on bulks but also because we suspended the dividend. And so what you'll see even in this half as some -- so I think Kumba's dividend was about USD 500 million equivalent, just over half of that effectively close to us. Half of that will flow to minorities. And so you'll see a little bit of a self-correction in that, particularly as we continue the payout ratio journey in the 6-month periods ahead. So we're not rushing out to do anything other than run the business as usual and you'll see some of those things sort of correct themselves over time."

First of all, with FY '18 CapEx, are you hinting that that's going to creep up? Is that the way we should interpret the comments today that you actually have some great opportunities to deliver kind of good returns on slightly high CapEx? The second thing is again, I'm slightly confused around sort of the -- what you're talking about in terms of cost savings because you say $1 billion is a stretched target but in the same breath, we started saying that there's huge potential across the portfolio. So just -- we've -- cost saving, should we -- can you more than offset underlying inflation or are you just going to be offsetting mining inflation just thinking about the business as a whole going forward, what we should expect in terms of cost?"

It's never linear or without a few bumps. So what we're saying is we picked I think the lower hanging fruit and we've made some really hard changes with the processes we put in place. The operating model actually drives a continuous improvement. So we want to continue to do that and see if we can keep ahead this inflation plus some and that's a sort of probably a good guideline for how we're thinking about delivering cost and volume improvement because they do, hand-in-hand. So that's where we are. So looking to do better than inflation across any of our jurisdictions. That's probably the sort of guide that we're looking to achieve or better.

It gives me -- it makes me think there's an opportunity in the second half to actually keep improving. Really good question in terms of cycle of our working capital. And I think again, particularly in platinum in the processing facility, that does take a while to flow itself through. Offsetting that, we had some positive working capital moves in diamonds. The stock levels are probably a little bit lower given the sales they had in the first half and we might rebuild that a little bit of a second. So a number of moving parts. Still want to dive into stores and space and what the right targets should be by business unit and really start to drill that down so we're understanding it and then deciding and chasing if we think there's a price there to chase.

I think it's a great competitive discipline internally as well in terms of how we think about cash allocation and whether it's to shareholders, the dividends or the capital projects. In time, we'll have a look at various forms of returns to shareholders. Right now, I think a simple dividend suits as well, and we'll look at those options. How are we going to evaluate it? It'll depend a little bit -- the phase you're in the capital projects and the growth opportunities that may come through that pipeline. So it's hard to give you a hard and fast rule.

So welcome, ladies and gentlemen. There aren't many women in the audience, I've got to say. They've got a lot -- we've all got a lot more work to do on diversity.
Firstly, I would like to acknowledge my colleagues in the audience. The feedback we've had from people generally is that they appreciate the interaction and the ability to chat to people regarding the results. So we'll continue to make the guys who really do know what's happening in the business and other the guys driving the change. From the presentation of results, we'd like to keep things fairly crisp and clear. Stephen will cover the detail behind the numbers in his presentation. So after I do my very short business summary, he'll take on the detail and I'll do I wrap at the end just to make a couple of other points and do a little bit on a forward-looking basis. So that's the format. We've structured it so that we can be fairly crisp through the presentation to give you an opportunity to ask questions. So with that, let's kick away and get straight into things.
Again, I know you will see the numbers. The key points that I thought needed to be emphasized in our conversations is obviously starting with the delivering on commitments mantra that we've talked to over the last 4 years. And certainly from our point of view, absolutely critical in terms of getting the right behaviors across the organization. 
In the operating performance, the self-help focus has been a key driver in improving margins. Yes, more recently, prices helped. But if you look at last year, in particular, price [indiscernible] lower than they were in '15, yet there was a $4 billion cash flow turnaround. So there's been a big contribution from the self-help side. We continue to improve productivities, and that supported the 9% increase in volume on a period-to-period basis. As a consequence, EBITDA of $4.1 billion is probably around the range that people were forecasting. Free cash flow of $2.7 billion has been the important number from our perspective, more than all of 2016. Yes, prices helped, but half of that improvement has been on the self-help work. And you'll see the $600 million of cost and volume improvement that we've achieved in the first half as well. So we're on track to achieve the $1 billion. 
The balance sheet, good position. It's allowed -- or the net debt 6 months earlier and $800 million blow us below the actual full year target. There's obviously a lag and early resumption of the dividend, which we're very pleased to be able to talk to today as well.
In terms of the portfolio, the continuing work on sales of the smallest scale lower margin assets that don't fit the portfolio have continued with the announcement of the thermal coal sales -- the domestic thermal coal sales and the platinum assets during the first 6 months. And obviously the ramping up of both Minas-Rio and Gahcho Kué has obviously helped the support and improving production outcome as well. 
In terms of positioning for the future, we'll pick up those points in the second half of the presentation. So I won't dwell too much on the points that we have made there on the slide.
Most importantly, for us, doesn't matter what we do operationally in terms of improvement in the business getting cost down. If you're not managing safety, environment and those issues that can create major issues across the group, we've made better progress in the second quarter of the year, very disappointing first quarter on the safety front. Unfortunately though, we still reported 3 fatalities. In the end, it's not simply about the numbers. It's about the tragedies that go behind that. So we still got work to do on the safety front. I'm encouraged that the performance in the second quarter, on a total injury frequency rate, was better, but still more work to be done and a lot more work to be done as we continue the improvement program.
On the environment side, we had a pipeline spill at Los Bronces that was quick -- cleaned up very quickly. We had a drilling incident. And in coal, more -- an incident associated with some of the flooding that we saw, both in South Africa and Australia in fact. But overall, much better control, and the results have been encouraging. We're not yet done to 0. But certainly in terms of where we started, we've made good progress, and we'll keep driving the focus on planning, execution and focus on the detail that ultimately ensures that we're driving productivity in costs as well.
In terms of production, we're up 9%, as I said, period-on-period. Across the group, the focus on the implementation of the operating model and the performance improvements that go with that remains a key focus. The operating model is not something you can do in 6 months. It's a long-term change program with 3 years into its implementation, and there are some very obvious benefits we're seeing in the portfolio. From my point of view, some honorable mentions in terms of the performance over the period. Certainly, De Beers is very solid. The Gahcho Kué ramp-up is going well. Mogalakwena in platinum continues to improve, and we certainly see more potential as we get into the detail of drawing glass and the other technical issues. Sishen done extremely well. I think tenders work off the foundations that Norman started. I think Seamus, Timber and the team have done a great job in continuing to build and improve the performance. 
And the only real disappointment in the half was nickel. We started pulling in the first quarter, good recovery. Second quarter, more to be done. I still think there's a chance they might give the guidance a nudge, but we're being prudent, I think, in suggesting that it's a bit touch and go at the moment. So overall, a pretty strong sets of results, more to come.
For us, productivity, that is how much production each person is contributing, up almost 70% from where we started with the changed programs. If you look at the portfolio of changes we've made and the underlying cost efficiencies or if you look at how that's impacted on the numbers, we've gone from 162,000 to 95,000. We're forecasting with the sales that we've announced to guide in the way, these 7,000 people. The contribution in portfolio change and restructuring and efficiency improvements is about 50-50, about 50% portfolio, 50% efficiency work. We still think there's a lot more to be done on the efficiency front. And so for us, certainly, the targets remain aggressive in continuing to improve. But obviously, we've done the bulk with the portfolio change and we don't have any active processes in place at the current time.
As an aside, when you look at our underlying cost structures, we've actually improved our energy consumption against our products by around 30% over the same 4-year period. So again, partly portfolio, partly efficiency work, and that's contributed to the real cost reduction in excess of 30%. We'll show you that it's about 23% in the numbers, but continuing and important focal point for our cost improvement work.
On the margins, again, a real focal point for us. Obviously, we can impact from the cost side, but also the change in market and strategy was quite important in terms of improving our margins. People are aware that we've seen against the benchmarks. We set ourselves back in '13. We're up 4% on realized prices. So they might have a material contribution to that margin improvement. As I've said earlier, the see-through margin, and just to explain see-through margin, we take out the diamond trading work and the purchase of concentrates so that people can see our margin as you would against our industrial competitors. Really making sure people understand what we're focused on in terms of the industrial business, and these are the margins that we've reported. So the 21% to 26% reflects that adjustment in terms of the underlying numbers, so you can see what we're doing. 26% to 34%, we actually had a lower price realized in '16. So that improvement in margin was in our hands. And the 34% to 40%, about 50% our contribution with our efficiency work and about 50% price.
So for us, a real focal point, and I'll pick that up and compare it to our competitors, not so much to make any other statements than to say, look, we had a lot of work to do. We've improved. And from our point of view, we think we're in the game with a lot more to come in terms of the underlying improvements that we think we can deliver across the portfolio.
So with that, I will hand across to Stephen. So good news about Stephen is he's not an Arsenal support, and I think we've got him thinking very hard about Chelsea."

So listen, thanks, Mark, and it's a real pleasure to present my first set of Anglo American results. So thanks for having me.
There's a couple of themes that I want to touch on through today's presentation. So firstly, clearly, a good set of operating and financial results reflects strongly in the numbers. The strength of the underlying cash flows, he is driven by price, but also from the cost out and the efficiency delivery and from project delivery as well. Clearly, a continued focus on the balance sheet and continuing to drive net debt down as we've reset and strengthened our financial position. Ongoing discipline around capital allocation, and that will continue. And pleasingly, restoration of the dividend.
But there's one overriding theme that I want to leave you unless we talk through the slides, and that is that we've still got work to do, I think both on the balance sheet front and on the cost out front. As I work through these slides, I'll expand on some of the numbers, but I'll also try to just give you sort of a fiber of my thinking both on the numbers and how we'll take things forward across the different areas.
So let's look at the numbers. EBITDA of $4.1 billion, as Mark said, up 68% on the prior period, resulting in EPS of $1.19 per share. I'll touch on CapEx in more detail a little bit later, but clearly, lower in the first half. I'll talk through the first half, second half split. And we have lowered our guidance for the full year down from $2.5 billion down to $2.3 billion. 
Attributable free cash flow, $2.7 billion. All of that meant we reduced our debt down to $6.2 billion. So down $2.3 billion in the half, significantly below the $7 billion target that we've set ourselves for the end of this calendar year.
So self-help. Obviously, the self-help continued in terms of EBITDA improvement through the half and brings the total gains over the last -- since 2013 to $3.7 billion. So across the last 4 or 5 years. In the current half, you can see we did have the benefit of higher prices, offset a little bit by inflation and exchange rates. From a price point of view, the standout clearly was met coal. So realized about $194, $195 per tonne across the half, offset a little bit by currencies, in particular, the strengthening of the rand. Great news is we're on track to meet the $1 billion target. So another -- so $600 million realized in the first half, $400 million to go in the second half.
Most of you are aware, I've spent the first couple of months when I joined Anglo getting out and about across quite a number of the operations and praise to the teams. They welcomed me, and they're willing to spend a lot of time with me. But one of my big impressions now is that there is still a huge opportunity in this business to continue to drive efficiency gains, get better at what we do, and it's going to be, I think, exciting as we take on that challenge in the years ahead.
So let's look at the $600 million that we delivered and the $1 billion challenge. So $600 million in the first half, a great start. A couple of points to note. Obviously, De Beers and Los Bronces did well in terms of cost position and sort of setting themselves up also for the second half of the year. Sishen was probably the standout. As Mark mentioned in terms of adopting the operating model over a period of time, adapting to the new mine plan, you saw that reflected in their announcement earlier in the week. So really, really great, really great drive of improvement. I think the exciting thing there is a lot of that happened towards the end of the first half, and again, I think there's a great journey ahead for that operation.
We still have got work to do. If it was easy, we would've already done it, and it's one of those things where you keep delivering cost out and efficiency improvements. The expectation is that it will just carry on, and that's an easy thing to deliver. But I can assure you the team is working exceptionally hard to try to hit that $1 billion target.
As we look beyond 2017, we'll come back to you towards the end of this calendar year in terms of how we're going to set the targets again for 2018 as we continue that journey.
So if you prove in EBITDA obviously, and earnings clearly shows the benefit, as Mark mentioned, from the work done over the last couple of years in terms of portfolio, marketing margins and cost-efficiency improvements. One thing I would just like to touch on is effective tax rate for the year. So for those of you trying to balance your balance sheets and get the numbers right when you hit the bottom line, guidance for the full year at 28% to 30% across the full year. So if you can plug that one in.
So let's then have a quick look at CapEx. So CapEx of $800 million for the first half reflects a couple of things. Obviously, capital discipline about how and when we're spending money. When we do spend it, we're starting to see some of the same benefits that you're seeing from the operating side of the business flow into the capital side and capital spend. And that should be no surprise because a lot of our capital spend in the half has been around staying business and stripping capital. And in a lot of cases, it's some of the same fleet and the same setup that's doing that work. So you're starting to see some of that flow through into the capital spend numbers as well.
In terms of the first half and second half split, every mining company I've had the pleasure of working with has exactly the same issue in terms of first half and second half. It's probably a little more exaggerated this time around for a couple of reasons. One is we had a lot of wet weather in South Africa and through the first quarter. We also then had some geotech issues at Grosvenor and then Cyclone Debbie, which also impacted on our ability to spend some of the capital that we were planning in the first half. So the second half will be higher. $1.5 billion is what we're guiding on top of the $0.8 billion, and that would bring us in the $2.3 billion, as I say, some $200 million below our original guidance.
As we look forward to 2018, we've guided to $2.5 billion. I'd ask for your patience a little bit. We're sort of dusting off both how we're allocating capital, how we evaluate capital spend, and we're obviously at the start of planning for 2018. So we'll come back and give you some updated guidance there. But there's 2 things that I'm really looking at as we start to set the capital budgets for 2018. Obviously, are we spending what we spend well? And that's got to really drive through every single capital dollar that we do spend. 
The second one, I'll ask my Anglo colleagues to put their heads over their ears is, if they can, and you may be surprised at this, but I was spending enough, particularly in terms of the projects that are going to deliver that next round of innovation and change and efficiency in the business. And so we need to challenge ourselves both not to spend money, but to make sure when we spend it, we spend it in the right path.
This is clearly one of Mr. Cutifani's absolute favorite slides. So you know he loves to talk about return on capital employed, and return on capital employed 18% versus the 8% this time last year. Clearly, it shows the work that the team has done and delivered over the last couple of years. 
Attributable free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Again, remember, this is the half. We delivered $2.5 billion of free cash flow for the whole year last year, so we're significantly stepped up. And yes, it is partly priced, but it's also partly self-help as we've shown.
So let's look at the balance sheet. A key focus for the group over the last 2 years has been getting the balance sheet back into shape, and the journey clearly has continued this half. So net debt, down to $6.2 billion. Again, well ahead of our year-end target. But we still have work to do and particularly in respect to our debt portfolio. So our debt portfolio is relatively short in its average life compared to our long-life quality assets that we have in that portfolio. So similar to what we did back in March. You should expect us to just gradually work on that over time as we extend out the maturity profile.
In terms of ratios, net debt-to-EBITDA at 0.8x, below our longer-term guidance of 1 to 1.5x through the cycle. Gearing, 19%. Again, strongly supports and works with the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and certainly puts us well in positioning in terms of our peers through the industry as well.
We will be running a more conservative balance sheet than what you've seen the company run in the past, and that's particularly the -- with volatility in metal prices as well and learn the lessons from the past. We have and are still coming off a period of higher-than-average long-term bulk prices, particularly in iron ore and coal. So what you should expect to see and what you have seen is that we will take the balance sheet to a much lower level than what does long term through the cycle targets imply. And I've got absolutely no qualms at all in continuing to take the debt lower over the next 18 months. And I think with prices where they are, we have a fantastic opportunity to continue to do that.
So dividends. Obviously, it's a real pleasure in your first results presentation to reinstate the dividend. And while I can't take full credit for the dividend, one of the first things I did when I joined the company was make sure I got my name on the authorized signature list for the bank accounts. So that when the checks go out, it can be my name on it and not René's. So watch out for that in the mail. Clearly, we have exceeded our targets, whether it be balance sheet, cash flow, ratios, et cetera, and that really set us up to make for what was a fairly straightforward discussion at the board. So for the half, a 40% payout ratio on the half, that's $0.48 per share, $600 million back to shareholders. So a really great start as we have come back into this period. As we look forward in terms of policy, again, a 40% payout ratio based on underlying earnings will be paid on that basis each half.
We will consider additional return to shareholders, and I'll touch on that in terms of how we're thinking about cash and allocation. But right now, we've got other priorities in terms of continuing the balance sheet journey in particular. So it will be a nice problem to have when we get there. Right now, we'll continue the balance sheet journey.
So just to wrap up before I hand back to Mark, just a couple of thoughts on how we're thinking about cash flow and capital allocation. A couple of smiles in the audience, obviously, a number of companies have similar sort of slides. Left-hand side, the theory. Right-hand side, the actual numbers for the half, and we'll sort of continue to report on this basis as we go forward.
So again, great cash flow generation in the half, and you'll be used to seeing the $2.7 billion. But we've adjusted that prior -- to make it prior to discretionary capital. So $2.8 billion prior to that discretionary capital. Have we spent that money? Obviously, nearly all of it was allocated to reduction in debt in terms of that balance sheet priority. And that's consistent with our commitment that Anglo American made in terms of getting the balance sheet right, then obviously with the dividend, reinstating the dividend before we consider spending money and allocating capital to other things.
So you can see in there, the $2.3 billion is the reduction in debt, a few other balance sheet bits and bobs. And obviously the dividend that we've declared now, that $600 million will drop into that red sort of category into the second half of the full year. Again, you can see very limited allocation to discretionary capital studies, exploration, et cetera. And again, to me, that sits really well in terms of where our priorities were for the half and where they will be for the remainder -- for the balance of this year.
So again, just to leave you one thought, I think we do have quite a lot of compelling opportunities when the -- within the portfolio and a lot of compelling projects within the portfolio. And we'll consider those in time as we allocate that cash. But it does -- it is important to realize those projects have to compete with additional returns to shareholders, and we'll clearly consider that as we think about our cash flow allocation. 
Mark, thank you"

It has required a lot of work, probably coming off a lower base than any of us would've liked. B",2557,"Thanks, Steve. Okay. So in terms of where we started, I guess, a 1-slide recap. Firstly, with all the work that's being done, it is a more efficient business. It has required a lot of work, probably coming off a lower base than any of us would've liked. But today, 46% less assets in terms of people, similarly reduced. About half of that changed, as I said, this portfolio and half the actual restructuring, downsizing and efficiency work to be done. That obviously has improved our competitive position, but still a long way to go, in our view. But at the same time, with all of that change and all of those changes occurring and the portfolio reductions, our production is actually up 6%. So the generating more cash and higher returns have been about fundamental change across the business, a $4.4 billion turnaround in the cash flow and obviously an improvement in return which, for us, is an important number. And if I can say it this way, the focus on ROCE is absolutely critical because the way you get that cash flow is all about how you allocate capital to make sure you're delivering efficiency. It changes the mind set in the organization. And I think the most important thing that I can say about what we've done from this perspective has been focused on changing mindsets, and I'll make a point at the end of the presentation that driving that cultural change has to be around the numbers you tell people are important. And I think we're making good progress, but still a long way to go.
In terms of the portfolio, you've seen this slide before. I won't dwell too much on the slide before. From us, a lot of the hard work was done in '14 and '15, but we've continued to work on improving the portfolio and making sure that the assets we have today, when you look forward, are assets that can be competitive, that can generate cash, can generate returns and continue to improve the underlying performance of the business. And that's where we've been coming from.
Again, in making the point on margins, this is where we were back in 2015 compared to our 3 major peers. Again, we're showing the comparison not to make any comment about others. I think everyone's doing hard work and doing good work, but more to make a comment about what we've tried to do in the business. 26% to 34% from '15 to '16 was achieved with a lower-priced deck in 2016. That was about self-help, and I think that's an important point to make. And for 2017, the first half, we're at 40%. Again, we know there's a lot more to be done, but that focus on margin, which is why the marketing side is so important, it's not simply about costs. It's about efficiency. It's about making sure the assets are working to their potential. And from our point of view, marketing's contribution has been important in terms of that prices. So that's what we focus on because that's what drives cash flow and returns in terms of the capital that we've deployed across the business.
Again, just to reinforce the strategic approach and the conversations that we had, it's about assets. It's about the quality of the assets. And so when I show revenue by product in terms of commodities, it's not about deliberately positioning in one commodity over another. None of us have been terribly successful in forecasting commodity prices, certainly in the short term and even in the longer term. It's a bit of a fraud guide. What we're focused on is the quality of the assets we have. And as a consequence, we've got a quite nicely diversified portfolio in terms of the assets we have and the positions we have.
From a geographic point of view, same story. The geographic diversity we have in the portfolio is a function of where we have quality assets. And yes, partly, it's still a work in progress, but the portfolio, as a consequence of the decisions we've made on selling assets and in where we've allocated our capital in building new projects is, as a consequence, rebalancing the portfolio as you can see there today. And with South Africa, about 25% of their capital employed. The balance is starting to look quite sensible. In the end, it will be a function of the quality of the assets. So it will change over time as a natural consequence of focusing our capital where we think we can deliver the best returns.
On South Africa itself, from our point of view, we remain, I think, committed to the assets that we think can deliver the long-term returns in the business. If I talk about Mining Charter 3, I think the important point to make is that, for Mining Charters 1 and 2, we've delivered all the requirements plus some in terms of transformation and all of the other objective measures that used to judge whether you've actually transformed the business. And as an aside, Anglo American has been the most transformative company in the last 24 years in South Africa. We represented 61% of the [ JAC ] back in 1987. Today, we're about 67%. The 90% change in our configuration in relation to the [ JAC ] has been about the companies that have been demerged or spun off in South Africa that represents massive transformation on a scale no one else has matched across the country. Today, in the assets that we operate in South Africa, approximately 40% of the ownership of those assets in direct South African hands. And when we take South African ownership, mostly pension funds and others who own Anglo American, their ownership is 62%. We are committed to transformation and making sure that we've got the balance right for both South Africa and our shareholders.
Today, the document that we have that has been presented is an unworkable document. Without saying anything else, I think it's important that we come together with the government and work through and find a solution that works for everyone. There's no point shrinking the pie to 0. We have to create a larger pie and make sure that all benefit. But from our point of view, that's where the focus needs to be and certainly, we're part -- and part of the industry in making sure that conversation goes forward the right way. From our point of view, we've been doing a lot of work on restructuring. The corporate structure simplification, overheads, improving the business as we will continue to focus on the efficiencies of the operations. And certainly, from our point of view, making sure that we're delivering the best performance we can in terms of the assets that we operate in the country.
For us, over time, clearly, in terms of capital allocation, we have a number of opportunities, many of them outside South Africa. So that's where the capital will go. And as a consequence, you will continue to see an adjustment of our -- the relative capital employed across the business. But it's a function of the assets and where the opportunities are. For us, wherever we allocate capital, it's about value, value for shareholders and for us. That's where the focus will remain, and that's where we'll consider having positioned ourselves in any jurisdiction across the globe.
More specifically across the commodity positions we have. Clearly, in copper in De Beers, we have very good positions. I think the prognosis in terms of market dynamics is very strong. We've got great assets. We're certainly well positioned to advantage of those markets with very good assets that we have. And so a very strong and very much gets the green light in terms of allocating capital carefully into those areas where we think returns are certainly available to us.
In PGMs, I see how Buffalo [indiscernible] here from South Africa. Hi, Chris. Chris and the guys has done a fantastic job in restructuring the business, focusing the portfolio on those assets that we believe can deliver returns through any price scenario in the market. There's still a lot more work to be done. And Chris I know has spent quite a bit of time talking about the cost-reduction strategy for Amandelbult and the ongoing improvements he wants to deliver in Mogalakwena. And you also have to remember that we've got very good margins in our processing operations and leaving reasonable capital returns, he wants to do better. But in terms of the portfolio, the best portfolio in the industry. And certainly from our point of view on these prices, we want to make sure that portfolio can deliver better than the 15% return, and that's what Chris and the guys are working on and they have come long way. 
In iron ore and coal, Seamus has done a great job with the bulks team right across the board. We've been absolutely thrilled with the progress that's being made. We've had to think very carefully about the market positions we take. High-quality assets, very good cost structures in coal and mid to mid-third quartile cost in iron ore, but with a great quality product. So how do we think about maximizing our margins in the markets in which we operate? And so a lot of thought has gone into us positioning to make sure we can maintain the margins and improve our returns. And I think we're well underway to showing how far we go, and we still think we've got a lot of improvement to go. And I think, credit to Seamus and the guys, a few challenges in the first half at Grosvenor. They've continued to improve. And certainly, the last month has been very encouraging. But with that asset, another leg that I think will make a material contribution to the business. I'm very excited with the potential we see particularly in the last month. So a lot of work to be done, thinking very careful about our capital allocation, and it will all be about making sure we can generate cash flow and returns.
So finally, just making -- or taking all of those pieces and summarizing the key points. Again, from a portfolio perspective, it's about the quality of the assets. The portfolio upgrading to support sustainable cash flow and returns is the mantra that we work to within the business. It's about cash flow and returns. And those assets are the assets we see the best potential today, tomorrow and into the future. And everything is focused on improving those positions and making sure those positions are sustainable. We see a lot of smaller scale, small scale capital opportunities to improve the business. Stephen's point about making sure that we get the expenditures right. We've been tough. The guys have done a great job in managing and improving the efficiencies of the capital. We're going to continue that focus, but at the same time, make sure that we're seeing the best opportunities to actually grow the performance of the business. And we've also got larger scale opportunities that will be very carefully considered in terms of the way we allocate capital, and I'll pick it up that in my last bullet point.
In terms of capability, you can't make money in this business if you don't have the engine running to its potential. We've made significant improvements, but we're still not near the potential the assets have. That's the challenge to the team. There's a lot of work done on the cultural change across the organization. The focus on capital efficiencies is key. We acknowledge or I acknowledge team for the performance improvement they've delivered, but we're also the first to say we still got a long way to go. 
Innovation then becomes a second phase for us in terms of improvement. We still see more from an operations point of view, but the technical stuff that Tony and the team have been working on, on energy, water, mining methods and step changes across the business I think are critical. And for those that have taken the time to dial into the future smart stuff can see how the thinking is starting to evolve across those areas. Again, marketing remains an important part of the business in helping us improve our returns or margins and driving the returns. And certainly, we've made great progress, and we could still see a lot more opportunities in terms of improvement.
On the return type, balance sheet flexibility is being restored. Stephen, I think, made a very important point about keeping our balance sheet flexible, so that we're always thinking about right place to put money to drive the business to improve performance. And what you tend to do if you let yourself get out of whack on the balance sheet is you then start making short-term decisions around what you should spend and what you shouldn't spend. We don't want to get back into that trap. So for us, very important. For us, the bad cash flow and returns absolutely critical. The syndication comment, we've been talking about syndication of major projects ever since we got ourselves in a position where we were building 5 major projects at the onetime, and we got caught in stressing the balance sheet. So I wanted to make the point, the lesson has been learned. We've studied the oil and gas business and other businesses and how they effectively manage a portfolio and risk on those major projects. So for us, the Quellaveco is very much about getting the syndication and our profile, right, because there are always things you don't know, you don't know that could touch in here. So I think, most importantly, we've taken the lessons of the industry in the last 5 years in particular, applying them, always learning, but we certainly see that the improvement in the operation reflects the focus on what we think are the critical issues. And if I make one final point and in many ways, it's the elevator test or the elevator message that I'd like to leave with you. In our business, we talk about 3 things in measuring whether we're doing the right thing for shareholders: Are we generating cash flow, free cash flow that supports the future development of the business and delivers real returns to shareholders? So it's about free cash flow. Secondly, how did you get that cash flow? And the best way to measure your efficiency in delivering those cash flows is your returns on capital. So that conversation from the first day, return on capital employed remains a mantra for us. Absolutely critical. Third point, how do you grow those cash flows? How do you improve the business? How do you make sure the business is sustainable? So safety, environment, the social development work you've got to do, people, the talent people you have, competitive costs and capital allocation. Absolutely the critical elements to make sure cash flow and returns are sustainable, and we can grow off the foundations we've created. That's how we're thinking. That's how we're approaching the business. Very happy to take questions with that.
Well, I'll start from the right and work across."

What we've got to do irrespective of what happens is make 15% or better return at these prices and lower, and that's what Chris and the guys are focused on. And so from our point of view, if that means we trim a bit of production, stopping areas that aren't making money, that's what we've been doing.

So the guys have had to adjust their practices to the conditions they found, and they have reset and also did a lot of work on the equipment and changed their operating practices. And so we were averaging around 80,000 tonnes per week in the period up to that middle of June, Seamus? And then on a look-forward basis, the last 4 weeks, we're certainly north of 150,000, hitting closer to 200,000 tonnes a week, so that's 4 weeks. I wouldn't book that yet. I think there's still more learnings that the guys will pick up. The geotechnical conditions haven't improved markedly. I think the practices have improved, and I think that's important.

So we think that the news is fine with -- the production ramp ups, they're going very well, so they've had good few months. So I think you've always got to be a bit careful, particularly in the upper levels of the ore body. But the revenue per tonne is holding up okay, a little bit down on quality but better carat.

I think the key with Los Bronces is to again establish that pit room and continue to work with CODELCO in finding the best way to work together across the pillar so that we both get a positive outcome. The relationship with CODELCO is very good, very open both ways. I think we've mended all the fences plus some, so I think it's a good relationship. The team has got a lot of work to do. So I think it's still going to be tied certainly for the balance of this year, and I think the key will be that relationship with CODELCO to get a bit more flexibly.

And our average truck hours are probably only a bit over 5,000 hours, where we would like to see truck hours across the organization pushing 6,000 on average. There's always some structural issues. So those basic numbers tell you that we still got 20% to 30% underlying productivity across the business that we want to chase. Clearly, we've picked and worked on the areas that we thought we could impact the quickest, but there's still a lot more stuff up across the portfolio. So I'd like to see that index hopped over 200 in the next couple of years, and so that'll give you sense of what we're going to try to achieve in terms of the people side. Energy improvements will continue. The real opportunity, I think, though is beyond the daily stuff, and it's in the technology. Tony, did want to say something about how you see technology framing up? And what sort of time frames are we looking at in improvement?"

Automation is only a small subset of our broader program, and we're really concentrating in 3 main areas. One is the ore body, getting much better tagging of the mineralogy and the properties of the ore body. And we're generally doing that with hyperspectral imaging. So it's basically processes that will ultimately replace SA. If we don't flow that through into our processing plants, what we're really trying to do is become much more precise in the way we target the minerals entering our processing. We're working basically, taking this tagging and then working on flotation in particular, the way we cyclone cross-particle flotation. And I think a lot of the industry rules around flotation, and recoveries you actually get are about to be rewritten. An example of that is some of the new crushes we're developing with partners in Germany, break rock in a very different manner than we've ever been used to. It tends to break along the particle boundaries rather than just smash everything. And I think it'll actually set us up for very different chemical recoveries, and we'll see step changes coming out. So I found this much more interesting than the balance sheet. The day we get you guys into this head space, I actually thought made it. But we are putting quite a full presentation on our innovation out in Australia in a couple of weeks' time. So I think if you can pay some interest in that, you'll get a lot clearer idea of where we're going."

And then just a second part to that. If you're syndicating projects, would you go -- is there a maximum number of projects you'd do on a syndicated basis just in a more conceptual level? And then secondly for Stephen. Is an EBITDA margin business of 40% with the CapEx as low as it is right now and the balance sheet now at below 1x net debt-to-EBITDA, I guess, from a conceptual level as well, is there -- is it ever appropriate to run a business like this at net cash?

Obviously, debt costs are relatively low at this point in the cycle, so that don't provide a huge sort of shelter in any event. So yes, listen, I am really comfortable in taking the balance sheet debt down low. You'd be aware we still have a little bit of a split balance sheet to work through, so I wouldn't see that happening in a hurry in terms of getting to a net cash position. But we'll balance up, sort of feeding into your other questions to Mark, the number of projects that we're committing to, the amount of money that they commit to over periods of time, the balance sheet, the liquidity, and obviously absolute debt levels and the debt portfolio and maturity profile. So we'll piece all of those things together and how we're then setting up the capital structure for the company going forward."

The one thing that we believe in our diamond portfolio is we've got a great endowment that we haven't fully tested. So what can we do more at Orapa, Jwaneng longer term, Venetia? Gahcho Kué is still too early to make a call in the future. But those endowments are quite significant, and we haven't done a lot of testing beyond where we are today. The most significant one that we think is not working towards its potential is Orapa. And so Bruce is thinking very hard about how he can get more of that in the right way and working with Tony and the team on stepping that out with incremental improvements in the operations. And so we've got a few of those. Some of those will take up a little longer. But certainly, we think that's where the big opportunities are around those major assets where we haven't really tested those endowments. Secondly, in copper. Collahuasi and Los Bronces both have lots of potential. Los Bronces is going to take a little more time, and I think will require some -- a little bit more flexibility around the mine as I talked to -- and certainly with our friends next door. If we can help each other, we'd be a bit more flexibility. There's an opportunity there. I think the technology stuff there in copper is really important. So we currently got our pilot plants operating on cross-flotation with crushing, cross-flotation and the dewatering so that we can materially reduce our water consumption, we'll reduce our energy probably 20%. Those opportunities in copper are quite significant. And the reason why they're important is water allows you to produce more because that's the scarce resource. They're are 2 opportunities in Collahuasi and Los Bronces. I think it's around technology, and Tony and Duncan are teaming up in that work. In platinum, Chris's incremental options on Mogalakwena still look very good. If you remember, he put money aside to do debottlenecking to get to 400,000 ounces. He didn't need the money to get to 400,000. He's done a fantastic job with the team debottlenecking, just doing simple things smarter. He's still got some money there to do a little bit of sensible debottlenecking given it's $1,000 an ounce margin. It's a great place to be. He's already highlighted this week his intentions on Amandelbult to try and take $200 to $300 an ounce out. He's already building a chrome plant that he's got less than a 12-month payback risk on the delivery of the chrome plant. So lots of opportunity to do things smarter in platinum. I could talk about the Grosvenor debottlenecking with the processing plant. Let's make sure we get the asset running to potential. It was only going to operate 5 days a week. We can get it to 7 days so we're still going to work in the coal prep plant. That's a great incremental contribution to the business. You know about Minas-Rio going to its 26.5 million. Obviously, that's linked to the licensing process, and we think there are things we can do to get it to around 30 million tonnes at the right time with very small capital increment. So there's a whole raft of projects that we've got and we can see across the portfolio that are being nurtured through either innovation or basic technical changes that we think can deliver very good payback and very -- return to well above to the 15%. In terms of major projects, I think we made a comment 1 or 2 meetings ago, we prefer not to have one big project opened at any one time. You might be at the start or in the tail, so you will have some overlaps, but that's a preference. And in our case, clearly Quellaveco is the one that's moving towards a commitment, probably the earliest. But I think again, keeping the balance sheet in the right place, making sure you got a good balance of opportunities, I think, is the key to continually improving the business. And I think we've got a lot of those opportunities that we're still scratching at it in terms of where we go to from here. That's why Stephen is making it clear that $2.5 billion is the pitch number. There may be opportunities to do some really good stuff for a little bit more, make sure we've got the development balances right. We haven't starved the business, although we've made tough calls. What we want to make sure is we've got everybody balanced in the right place and we got the flexibility to be productive and get the productivity number over 200%."

But I also acknowledge that the South African question is the question. So in terms of South Africa, we're doing all the things we said we'd do. On the corporate structures, we're simplifying them. We're working on all of our overheads and our costs across the business, and we've reduced those significantly. We've managed and sold assets that are either small scale or not long term, really not a fit. That's the 5 assets we've got in process at the moment. We're doing that type of work. We're improving the businesses, a lot more still to be done. And that's where we're going to remain focused.

So what we said is we like the assets we have. We're going to continue to improve them. And at some point, there'll be a dialogue on the positioning and approach on the way forward. I'm not sure where that will land. In the meantime, we like the businesses. The guys are doing a great job in restructuring. We're going to continue driving it and hopefully continue to generate cash and with Chris and the guys working hard in platinum. We'll continue to improve it. I think the other point that's really important is if you look at the U.S., they're still arguing about the election. There's nothing new in countries going through leadership the bets to have lots of noise. Unfortunately, South Africa tends to be more noisier than most given it's 20 years into a constitution. So we knew they'd be noisy. It is noisy. It's unlikely we'll get someone on the other side post the electoral piece of the leadership piece, probably in November, Norman. And we'll continue doing the things we said we do. Okay."

There's no mention in the presentation really of the idea of core Anglo anymore. So would it be fair to assume that pursuing asset sales activity is no longer a priority for the management team? Related to that, how do we think about the South African bulks piece within the group? There have been praise articles in SA about Anglo potentially considering a partial exit or an exit of its South African bulks businesses. With no core Anglo in the presentation, should we assume that, that's not something that you're working on? Following on from that, is an exit or a partial exit or some kind of restructuring in SA dependent on the political outcome? Or can you do something in SA without having a more business-friendly leader of the ANC in place, if you want to call it that? And then the last point, can you do anything in SA until we get a resolution on the charter as it relates to transfers of mining rights? We know that there's been topics in the press about Anglo platinum maybe not being able to execute on asset sales as quickly as they'd like because of political interference?"

Look, thanks for that. Firstly, in terms of the business, what we've said is that the 37 assets that we have today are assets we'd be happy to operate for the longer term, generating cash, good returns that we can continue to recruiting businesses. So we don't have any active processes. But one thing I will say is that any business has to make sure that it's got the right portfolio. You're always considering your positions over time, and we've landed pretty closely to what we originally defined as the target portfolio back in 2014. Clearly, niobium and phosphates. It's the only material asset we would have liked to have kept. But at the end of the day, the price we got I think Philippe was fairly happy with what we delivered in terms of value. So no active processes, and we're not out there trying to sell. We're drawing the line, and we'll operate. But it doesn't mean we won't continue to improve and make some sales on the basis of improving the portfolio as we should proper capital managers. In terms of the SA bulks, as I've said, we like Kumba. The work the guys have done has been fantastic. We're happy to operate the asset. We remain open to where we go in the future. And that conversation, there's always one that we're in and we'll be in over the next 12 to 18 months, whatever it might be. But if nothing changes and we're happy to be where we are, that's where we'll be. I don't want to go any further than that because a bit hard speculating on what we don't know, and the politics will change over the next 12 months. Like all these things, politics is something you take into account, but it's not the only issue. There are a range of things that we'll take into account. So at this stage, we're open, we're operating, we're improving, and we'll make those decisions probably during the course of '18 as you would expect we would in making sure that we've got the portfolio right. Politics, yes, it will make a difference but not to the extent that it's the only factor. There a range of factors and in every country we operate. We take a whole range of factors into account in making decisions to allocate capital. So it ultimately comes down to our capital allocation and delivery returns. If we can make money, if we can operate, then we're happy to be there. So they're really the key points. We've done the work, we've improved the business, we still got a way to go. Every jurisdiction remains under scrutiny. Every dollar we spend in capital remains important, including South African dollars. Okay?"

You currently have a quite significant net cash in South Africa, I think. You have had it for some time. Now it's especially big. And this big net debt -- sorry, net cash, looks especially noticeable in the context of increased political risks. I understand that it helps to balance out net debt for the group. But ultimately, the only thing you can do with this cash is pay it out as dividends, right? So why it's still sitting there? And second question is actually about diamond market outlook. The rough diamond market had been performing reasonably well or even pretty well, which stands I think in contrast with somewhat unimpressive performance in the Polish market with prices stagnating and very mixed signals in terms of demand from jewelry and midstream. What do you see here in terms of outlook for the second half, in terms of outlook for 2018? Is there a risk that the situation in the rough diamond market could deteriorate sharply as it -- or you haven't before with diamonds? Or you think it's just not on the cards?"

So debt dividends in South Australian cash as opposed -- they're all sort of linked as the question was there. So now not changing our long-term targets at this point in terms of the sort of stated target we've had in terms of debt-to-EBITDA ratio. So 1 to 1.5x through the cycle. That doesn't mean, though, where we have periods of higher prices, we should be really right towards the low end or below the low end so that when you do get back to long-term cyclical prices, you're back in that range. And that's just where we happen to be in the journey at the moment. So I'm going to make much of it over the next 18 months, particularly in terms of getting that as low as we possibly can. You touched on the sort of the split balance sheet. So while the 0.8 looks very attractive from a rest of the world point of view, we're below 2. But still, on a long-term price scenario, that would probably create back towards 2, and we'd like to be below 2 from a rest of the world point of view. So we're just nicely, neatly in that range at the moment. The South African cash has built up partly because of the operations in the pricing particularly on bulks but also because we suspended the dividend. And so what you'll see even in this half as some -- so I think Kumba's dividend was about USD 500 million equivalent, just over half of that effectively close to us. Half of that will flow to minorities. And so you'll see a little bit of a self-correction of that, particularly as we continue the payout ratio journey in the 6-month periods ahead. So we're not rushing out to do anything other than run the business as usual, and you'll see some of those things sort of correct themselves over time."

But again, there are all considerations we think about in terms of the long-term portfolio mix. On diamonds, Bruce, I'm not going to ask him to say a word because he's in the middle of the site as we speak. So we're always a bit cautious in making any comments about the market. If I could just go back to what we've said in the last couple of months. The U.S. has been a great place. It's a little noisy at the moment, I think, on a general economic perspective. And as a consequence, diamonds may or may not be impacted by that. China has been pretty good. I think we've just got to remain cautious. I think we said this year will be about clearing our stock. We did that pretty fairly successfully early in the year. And we're just going to continue to take a careful approach with the way we price our products, taking very careful notice of the Sightholders feedback. We're in the middle of that process. So my comment goes back among cautious, careful. We want to make sure that we're matching our sales to what -- that's what appropriate in the market."

In fact, in the coal business, we've been flat for 4 years now. So that remains our objective, particularly in high-inflation environments, to be able to do better than the local inflation rate. So that remains our objective. It's never linear or without a few bumps. So what we're saying is we've picked, I think, the lower-hanging fruit. We've made some really hard changes with the processes we put in place. The operating model actually drives a continuous improvement. So we want to continue to do that and see if we can keep ahead of inflation plus some, and that's a sort of probably a good guideline for how we're thinking about delivering cost and volume improvement because they do come hand-in-hand. So that's where we are. So looking to do better than inflation across any of our jurisdictions is probably the sort of guide that we're looking to achieve or better. And to get to that 170 to 200 requires us to -- that would help us deliver that number over the next 2 years. That gives you a guide."

And I think again, particularly in platinum in the processing facility, that does take a while to flow itself through. Offsetting that, we had some positive working capital moves in diamonds. Their stock levels are probably a little bit lower given the sales they had in the first half, and we might rebuild that a little bit in the second. So a number of moving parts.

I think it's a great competitive discipline internally as well in terms of how we think about cash allocation and whether it's to shareholders, to dividends or to capital projects. Now in time, we'll have a look at various forms of returns to shareholders. Right now, I think a simple dividend suits us well, and we'll look at those options. How are we going to evaluate it? It'll depend a little bit the phase you're in, the capital projects and the growth opportunities that may come through that pipeline. So it's hard to give you a hard and fast rule. Ultimately, the theory is grand, and everyone has got a similar slide. It's how you then apply that it over time and how you demonstrate that discipline.

So welcome, ladies and gentlemen. There aren't many women in the audience, I've got to say. They've got a lot -- we've all got a lot more work to do on diversity.
Firstly, I would like to acknowledge my colleagues in the audience. The feedback we've had from people generally is that they appreciate the interaction and the ability to chat to people regarding the results. So we'll continue to make the guys who really do know what's happening in the business and other the guys driving the change. From the presentation of results, we'd like to keep things fairly crisp and clear. Stephen will cover the detail behind the numbers in his presentation. So after I do my very short business summary, he'll take on the detail and I'll do a wrap at the end just to make a couple of other points and do a little bit on a forward-looking basis. So that's the format. We've structured it so that we can be fairly crisp through the presentation to give you an opportunity to ask questions. So with that, let's kick away and get straight into things.
Again, I know you will see the numbers. The key points that I thought needed to be emphasized in our conversations is obviously starting with the delivering on commitments mantra that we've talked to over the last 4 years. And certainly from our point of view, absolutely critical in terms of getting the right behaviors across the organization. 
In the operating performance, the self-help focus has been a key driver in improving margins. Yes, more recently, prices helped. But if you look at last year, in particular, price are actually lower than they were in '15, yet there was a $4 billion cash flow turnaround. So there's been a big contribution from the self-help side. We continue to improve productivities, and that supported the 9% increase in volume on a period-to-period basis. As a consequence, EBITDA of $4.1 billion is probably around the range that people were forecasting. Free cash flow of $2.7 billion has been the important number from our perspective, more than all of 2016. Yes, prices helped, but half of that improvement has been on the self-help work. And you'll see the $600 million of cost and volume improvement that we've achieved in the first half as well. So we're on track to achieve the $1 billion. 
The balance sheet, good position. It's allowed -- or the net debt 6 months earlier and $800 million blow us below the actual full year target. There's obviously a lag and early resumption of the dividend, which we're very pleased to be able to talk to today as well.
In terms of the portfolio, the continuing work on sales of the smallest scale lower margin assets that don't fit the portfolio have continued with the announcement of the thermal coal sales -- the domestic thermal coal sales and the platinum assets during the first 6 months. And obviously the ramping up of both Minas-Rio and Gahcho Kué has obviously helped the support and improving production outcome as well. 
In terms of positioning for the future, we'll pick up those points in the second half of the presentation. So I won't dwell too much on the points that we have made there on the slide.
Most importantly, for us, doesn't matter what we do operationally in terms of improvement in business getting cost down. If you're not managing safety, environment and those issues that can create major issues across the group, we've made better progress in the second quarter of the year, very disappointing first quarter on the safety front. Unfortunately though, we still reported 3 fatalities. In the end, it's not simply about the numbers. It's about the tragedies that go behind that. So we still got work to do on the safety front. I'm encouraged that the performance in the second quarter, on a total injury frequency rate, was better, but still more work to be done and a lot more work to be done as we continue the improvement program.
On the environment side, we had a pipeline spill at Los Bronces that was quick -- cleaned up very quickly. We had a drilling incident. And in coal, more -- an incident associated with some of the flooding that we saw, both in South Africa and Australia in fact. But overall, much better control, and the results have been encouraging. We're not yet done to 0. But certainly in terms of where we started, we've made good progress, and we'll keep driving the focus on planning, execution and focus on the detail that ultimately ensures that we're driving productivity in costs as well.
In terms of production, we're up 9%, as I said, period-on-period. Across the group, the focus on the implementation of the operating model and the performance improvements that go with that remains a key focus. The operating model is not something you can do in 6 months. It's a long-term change program with 3 years into its implementation, and there are some very obvious benefits we're seeing in the portfolio. From my point of view, some honorable mentions in terms of the performance over the period. Certainly, De Beers is very solid. The Gahcho Kué ramp-up is going well. Mogalakwena in platinum continues to improve, and we certainly see more potential as we get into the detail of drawing glass and the other technical issues. Sishen done extremely well. I think Timbers work off the foundations that Norman started. I think Seamus, Timber and the team have done a great job in continuing to build and improve the performance. 
And the only real disappointment in the half was nickel. We started pulling in the first quarter, good recovery. Second quarter, more to be done. I still think there's a chance they might give the guidance a nudge, but we're being prudent, I think, in suggesting that it's a bit touch and go at the moment. So overall, a pretty strong sets of results, more to come.
For us, productivity, that is how much production each person is contributing, up almost 70% from where we started with the changed programs. If you look at the portfolio of changes we've made and the underlying cost efficiencies or if you look at how that's impacted on the numbers, we've gone from 162,000 to 95,000. We're forecasting with the sales that we've announced to guide in the way, these 7,000 people. The contribution in portfolio change and restructuring and efficiency improvements is about 50-50, about 50% portfolio, 50% efficiency work. We still think there's a lot more to be done on the efficiency front. And so for us, certainly, the targets remain aggressive in continuing to improve. But obviously, we've done the bulk with the portfolio change and we don't have any active processes in place at the current time.
As an aside, when you look at our underlying cost structures, we've actually improved our energy consumption against our products by around 30% over the same 4-year period. So again, partly portfolio, partly efficiency work, and that's contributed to the real cost reduction in excess of 30%. We'll show you that it's about 23% in the numbers, but continuing and important focal point for our cost improvement work.
On the margins, again, a real focal point for us. Obviously, we can impact from the cost side, but also the change in marketing strategy was quite important in terms of improving our margins. People are aware that we've seen against the benchmarks. We set ourselves back in '13. We're up 4% on realized prices. So they might have a material contribution to that margin improvement. As I've said earlier, the see-through margin, and just to explain see-through margin, we take out the diamond trading work and the purchase of concentrates so that people can see our margin as you would against our industrial competitors. Really making sure people understand what we're focused on in terms of the industrial business, and these are the margins that we've reported. So the 21% to 26% reflects that adjustment in terms of the underlying numbers, so you can see what we're doing. 26% to 34%, we actually had a lower price realized in '16. So that improvement in margin was in our hands. And the 34% to 40%, about 50% our contribution with our efficiency work and about 50% price.
So for us, a real focal point, and I'll pick that up and compare it to our competitors, not so much to make any other statements than to say, look, we had a lot of work to do. We've improved. And from our point of view, we think we're in the game with a lot more to come in terms of the underlying improvements that we think we can deliver across the portfolio.
So with that, I will hand across to Stephen. So good news about Stephen is he's not an Arsenal support, and I think we've got him thinking very hard about Chelsea."

I'll keep posted on the football team front.So listen, thanks, Mark, and it's a real pleasure to present my first set of Anglo American results.

So listen, thanks, Mark, and it's a real pleasure to present my first set of Anglo American results. So thanks for having me.
There's a couple of themes that I want to touch on through today's presentation. So firstly, clearly, a good set of operating and financial results reflects strongly in the numbers. The strength of the underlying cash flows, he is driven by price, but also from the cost out and the efficiency delivery and from project delivery as well. Clearly, a continued focus on the balance sheet and continuing to drive net debt down as we've reset and strengthened our financial position. Ongoing discipline around capital allocation, and that will continue. And pleasingly, restoration of the dividend.
But there's one overriding theme that I want to leave you unless we talk through the slides, and that is that we've still got work to do, I think both on the balance sheet front and on the cost out front. As I work through these slides, I'll expand on some of the numbers, but I'll also try to just give you sort of a fiber of my thinking both on the numbers and how we'll take things forward across the different areas.
So let's look at the numbers. EBITDA of $4.1 billion, as Mark said, up 68% on the prior period, resulting in EPS of $1.19 per share. I'll touch on CapEx in more detail a little bit later, but clearly, lower in the first half. I'll talk through the first half, second half split. And we have lowered our guidance for the full year down from $2.5 billion down to $2.3 billion. 
Attributable free cash flow, $2.7 billion. All of that meant we reduced our debt down to $6.2 billion. So down $2.3 billion in the half, significantly below the $7 billion target that we've set ourselves for the end of this calendar year.
So self-help. Obviously, the self-help continued in terms of EBITDA improvement through the half and brings the total gains over the last -- since 2013 to $3.7 billion. So across the last 4 or 5 years. In the current half, you can see we did have the benefit of higher prices, offset a little bit by inflation and exchange rates. From a price point of view, the standout clearly was met coal. So realized about $194, $195 per tonne across the half, offset a little bit by currencies, in particular, the strengthening of the rand. Great news is we're on track to meet the $1 billion target. So another -- so $600 million realized in the first half, $400 million to go in the second half.
Most of you are aware, I've spent the first couple of months when I joined Anglo getting out and about across quite a number of the operations and praise to the teams. They welcomed me, and they're willing to spend a lot of time with me. But one of my big impressions now is that there is still a huge opportunity in this business to continue to drive efficiency gains, get better at what we do, and it's going to be, I think, exciting as we take on that challenge in the years ahead.
So let's look at the $600 million that we delivered and the $1 billion challenge. So $600 million in the first half, a great start. A couple of points to note. Obviously, De Beers and Los Bronces did well in terms of cost position and sort of setting themselves up also for the second half of the year. Sishen was probably the standout. As Mark mentioned in terms of adopting the operating model over a period of time, adapting to the new mine plan, you saw that reflected in their announcement earlier in the week. So really, really great, really great drive of improvement. I think the exciting thing there is a lot of that happened towards the end of the first half, and again, I think there's a great journey ahead for that operation.
We still have got work to do. If it was easy, we would've already done it, and it's one of those things where you keep delivering cost out and efficiency improvements. The expectation is that it will just carry on, and that's an easy thing to deliver. But I can assure you the team is working exceptionally hard to try to hit that $1 billion target.
As we look beyond 2017, we'll come back to you towards the end of this calendar year in terms of how we're going to set the targets again for 2018 as we continue that journey.
So if you prove in EBITDA obviously, and earnings clearly shows the benefit, as Mark mentioned, from the work done over the last couple of years in terms of portfolio, marketing margins and cost-efficiency improvements. One thing I would just like to touch on is effective tax rate for the year. So for those of you trying to balance your balance sheets and get the numbers right when you hit the bottom line, guidance for the full year at 28% to 30% across the full year. So if you can plug that one in.
So let's then have a quick look at CapEx. So CapEx of $800 million for the first half reflects a couple of things. Obviously, capital discipline about how and when we're spending money. When we do spend it, we're starting to see some of the same benefits that you're seeing from the operating side of the business flow into the capital side and capital spend. And that should be no surprise because a lot of our capital spend in the half has been around staying business and stripping capital. And in a lot of cases, it's some of the same fleet and the same setup that's doing that work. So you're starting to see some of that flow through into the capital spend numbers as well.
In terms of the first half and second half split, every mining company I've had the pleasure of working with has exactly the same issue in terms of first half and second half. It's probably a little more exaggerated this time around for a couple of reasons. One is we had a lot of wet weather in South Africa and through the first quarter. We also then had some geotech issues at Grosvenor and then Cyclone Debbie, which also impacted on our ability to spend some of the capital that we were planning in the first half. So the second half will be higher. $1.5 billion is what we're guiding on top of the $0.8 billion, and that would bring us in the $2.3 billion, as I say, some $200 million below our original guidance.
As we look forward to 2018, we've guided to $2.5 billion. I'd ask for your patience a little bit. We're sort of dusting off both how we're allocating capital, how we evaluate capital spend, and we're obviously at the start of planning for 2018. So we'll come back and give you some updated guidance there. But there's 2 things that I'm really looking at as we start to set the capital budgets for 2018. Obviously, are we spending what we spend well? And that's got to really drive through every single capital dollar that we do spend. 
The second one, I'll ask my Anglo colleagues to put their heads over their ears is, if they can, and you may be surprised at this, but I was spending enough, particularly in terms of the projects that are going to deliver that next round of innovation and change and efficiency in the business. And so we need to challenge ourselves both not to spend money, but to make sure when we spend it, we spend it in the right path.
This is clearly one of Mr. Cutifani's absolute favorite slides. So you know he loves to talk about return on capital employed, and return on capital employed 18% versus the 8% this time last year. Clearly, it shows the work that the team has done and delivered over the last couple of years. 
Attributable free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Again, remember, this is the half. We delivered $2.5 billion of free cash flow for the whole year last year, so we're significantly stepped up. And yes, it is partly priced, but it's also partly self-help as we've shown.
So let's look at the balance sheet. A key focus for the group over the last 2 years has been getting the balance sheet back into shape, and the journey clearly has continued this half. So net debt, down to $6.2 billion. Again, well ahead of our year-end target. But we still have work to do and particularly in respect to our debt portfolio. So our debt portfolio is relatively short in its average life compared to our long-life quality assets that we have in that portfolio. So similar to what we did back in March. You should expect us to just gradually work on that over time as we extend out the maturity profile.
In terms of ratios, net debt-to-EBITDA at 0.8x, below our longer-term guidance of 1x to 1.5x through the cycle. Gearing, 19%. Again, strongly supports and works with the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and certainly puts us well in positioning in terms of our peers through the industry as well.
We will be running a more conservative balance sheet than what you've seen the company run in the past, and that's particularly the -- with volatility in metal prices as well and learn the lessons from the past. We have and are still coming off a period of higher-than-average long-term bulk prices, particularly in iron ore and coal. So what you should expect to see and what you have seen is that we will take the balance sheet to a much lower level than what does long term through the cycle targets imply. And I've got absolutely no qualms at all in continuing to take the debt lower over the next 18 months. And I think with prices where they are, we have a fantastic opportunity to continue to do that.
So dividends. Obviously, it's a real pleasure in your first results presentation to reinstate the dividend. And while I can't take full credit for the dividend, one of the first things I did when I joined the company was make sure I got my name on the authorized signature list for the bank accounts. So that when the checks go out, it can be my name on it and not René's. So watch out for that in the mail. Clearly, we have exceeded our targets, whether it be balance sheet, cash flow, ratios, et cetera, and that really set us up to make for what was a fairly straightforward discussion at the board. So for the half, a 40% payout ratio on the half, that's $0.48 per share, $600 million back to shareholders. So a really great start as we have come back into this period. As we look forward in terms of policy, again, a 40% payout ratio based on underlying earnings will be paid on that basis each half.
We will consider additional return to shareholders, and I'll touch on that in terms of how we're thinking about cash and allocation. But right now, we've got other priorities in terms of continuing the balance sheet journey in particular. So it will be a nice problem to have when we get there. Right now, we'll continue the balance sheet journey.
So just to wrap up before I hand back to Mark, just a couple of thoughts on how we're thinking about cash flow and capital allocation. A couple of smiles in the audience, obviously, a number of companies have similar sort of slides. Left-hand side, the theory. Right-hand side, the actual numbers for the half, and we'll sort of continue to report on this basis as we go forward.
So again, great cash flow generation in the half, and you'll be used to seeing the $2.7 billion. But we've adjusted that prior -- to make it prior to discretionary capital. So $2.8 billion prior to that discretionary capital. Have we spent that money? Obviously, nearly all of it was allocated to reduction in debt in terms of that balance sheet priority. And that's consistent with our commitment that Anglo American made in terms of getting the balance sheet right, then obviously with the dividend, reinstating the dividend before we consider spending money and allocating capital to other things.
So you can see in there, the $2.3 billion is the reduction in debt, a few other balance sheet bits and bobs. And obviously the dividend that we've declared now, that $600 million will drop into that red sort of category into the second half of the full year. Again, you can see very limited allocation to discretionary capital studies, exploration, et cetera. And again, to me, that sits really well in terms of where our priorities were for the half and where they will be for the remainder -- for the balance of this year.
So again, just to leave you on one thought, I think we do have quite a lot of compelling opportunities when the -- within the portfolio and a lot of compelling projects within the portfolio. And we'll consider those in time as we allocate that cash. But it does -- it is important to realize those projects have to compete with additional returns to shareholders, and we'll clearly consider that as we think about our cash flow allocation. 
Mark, thank you"

Firstly, with all the work that's being done, it is a more efficient business. It has required a lot of work, probably coming off a lower base than any of us would've liked. But today, 46% less assets in terms of people, similarly reduced. About half of that changed, as I said, this portfolio and half the actual restructuring, downsizing and efficiency work to be done. That obviously has improved our competitive position, but still a long way to go, in our view. But at the same time, with all of that change and all of those changes occurring and the portfolio reductions, our production is actually up 6%. So the generating more cash and higher returns have been about fundamental change across the business, a $4.4 billion turnaround in the cash flow and obviously an improvement in return which, for us, is an important number. And if I can say it this way, the focus on ROCE is absolutely critical because the way you get that cash flow is all about how you allocate capital to make sure you're delivering efficiency. It changes the mind set in the organization. And I think the most important thing that I can say about what we've done from this perspective has been focused on changing mindsets, and I'll make a point at the end of the presentation that driving that cultural strength has to be around the numbers you tell people are important. And I think we're making good progress, but still a long way to go.
In terms of the portfolio, you've seen this slide before. I won't dwell too much on the slide before. From us, a lot of the hard work was done in '14 and '15, but we've continued to work on improving the portfolio and making sure that the assets we have today, when you look forward, are assets that can be competitive, that can generate cash, can generate returns and continue to improve the underlying performance of the business. And that's where we've been coming from.
Again, in making the point on margins, this is where we were back in 2015 compared to our 3 major peers. Again, we're showing the comparison not to make any comment about others. I think everyone's doing hard work and doing good work, but more to make a comment about what we've tried to do in the business. 26% to 34% from '15 to '16 was achieved with a lower-priced deck in 2016. That was about self-help, and I think that's an important point to make. And for 2017, the first half, we're at 40%. Again, we know there's a lot more to be done, but that focus on margin, which is why the marketing side is so important, it's not simply about costs. It's about efficiency. It's about making sure the assets are working to their potential. And from our point of view, marketing's contribution has been important in terms of that prices. So that's what we focus on because that's what drives cash flow and returns in terms of the capital that we've deployed across the business.
Again, just to reinforce the strategic approach and the conversations that we had, it's about assets. It's about the quality of the assets. And so when I show revenue by product in terms of commodities, it's not about deliberately positioning in one commodity over and over. None of us have been terribly successful in forecasting commodity prices, certainly in the short term and even in the longer term. It's a bit of a fraud guide. What we're focused on is the quality of the assets we have. And as a consequence, we've got a quite nicely diversified portfolio in terms of the assets we have and the positions we have.
From a geographic point of view, same story. The geographic diversity we have in the portfolio is a function of where we have quality assets. And yes, partly, it's still a work in progress, but the portfolio, as a consequence of the decisions we've made on selling assets and in where we've allocated our capital in building new projects is, as a consequence, rebalancing the portfolio as you can see there today. And with South Africa, about 25% of their capital employed. The balance is starting to look quite sensible. In the end, it will be a function of the quality of the assets. So it will change over time as a natural consequence of focusing our capital where we think we can deliver the best returns.
On South Africa itself, from our point of view, we remain, I think, committed to the assets that we think can deliver the long-term returns in the business. If I talk about Mining Charter 3, I think the important point to make is that, for Mining Charters 1 and 2, we've delivered all the requirements plus some in terms of transformation and all of the other objective measures that used to judge whether you've actually transformed the business. And as an aside, Anglo American has been the most transformative company in the last 24 years in South Africa. We represented 61% of the GAC back in 1987. Today, we're about 67%. The 90% change in our configuration in relation to the GAC has been about the companies that have been demerged or spun off in South Africa that represents massive transformation on a scale no one else has matched across the country. Today, in the assets that we operate in South Africa, approximately 40% of the ownership of those assets in direct South African hands. And when we take South African ownership, mostly pension funds and others who own Anglo American, their ownership is 62%. We are committed to transformation and making sure that we've got the balance right for both South Africa and our shareholders.
Today, the document that we have that has been presented is an unworkable document. Without saying anything else, I think it's important that we come together with the government and work through and find a solution that works for everyone. There's no point shrinking the pie to 0. We have to create a larger pie and make sure that all benefit. But from our point of view, that's where the focus needs to be and certainly, we're part -- and part of the industry in making sure that conversation goes forward the right way. From our point of view, we've been doing a lot of work on restructuring. The corporate structure simplification, overheads, improving the business as we will continue to focus on the efficiencies of the operations. And certainly, from our point of view, making sure that we're delivering the best performance we can in terms of the assets that we operate in the country.
For us, over time, clearly, in terms of capital allocation, we have a number of opportunities, many of them outside South Africa. So that's where the capital will go. And as a consequence, you will continue to see an adjustment of our -- the relative capital employed across the business. But it's a function of the assets and where the opportunities are. For us, wherever we allocate capital, it's about value, value for shareholders and for us. That's where the focus will remain, and that's where we'll consider having positioned ourselves in any jurisdiction across the globe.
More specifically across the commodity positions we have. Clearly, in copper in De Beers, we have very good positions. I think the prognosis in terms of market dynamics is very strong. We've got great assets. We're certainly well positioned to take advantage of those markets with very good assets that we have. And so a very strong and very much gets the green light in terms of allocating capital carefully into those areas where we think returns are certainly available to us.
In PGMs, I see how buffalo restless here from South Africa. Hi, Chris. Chris and the guys has done a fantastic job in restructuring the business, focusing the portfolio on those assets that we believe can deliver returns through any price scenario in the market. There's still a lot more work to be done. And Chris I know has spent quite a bit of time talking about the cost-reduction strategy for Amandelbult and the ongoing improvements he wants to deliver in Mogalakwena. And you also have to remember that we've got very good margins in our processing operations and leaving reasonable capital returns, he wants to do better. But in terms of the portfolio, the best portfolio in the industry. And certainly from our point of view on these prices, we want to make sure that portfolio can deliver better than the 15% return, and that's what Chris and the guys are working on and they have come long way. 
In iron ore and coal, Seamus has done a great job with the bulks team right across the board. We've been absolutely thrilled with the progress that's being made. We've had to think very carefully about the market positions we take. High-quality assets, very good cost structures in coal and mid to mid-third quartile cost in iron ore, but with a great quality product. So how do we think about maximizing our margins in the markets in which we operate? And so a lot of thought has gone into us positioning to make sure we can maintain the margins and improve our returns. And I think we're well underway to showing how far we go, and we still think we've got a lot of improvement to go. And I think, credit to Seamus and the guys, a few challenges in the first half at Grosvenor. They've continued to improve. And certainly, the last month has been very encouraging. But with that asset, another leg that I think will make a material contribution to the business. I'm very excited with the potential we see particularly in the last month. So a lot of work to be done, thinking very careful about our capital allocation, and it will all be about making sure we can generate cash flow and returns.
So finally, just making -- or taking all of those pieces and summarizing the key points. Again, from a portfolio perspective, it's about the quality of the assets. The portfolio upgrading to support sustainable cash flow and returns is the mantra that we work to within the business. It's about cash flow and returns. And those assets are the assets we see the best potential today, tomorrow and into the future. And everything is focused on improving those positions and making sure those positions are sustainable. We see a lot of smaller scale, small scale capital opportunities to improve the business. Stephen's point about making sure that we get the expenditures right. We've been tough. The guys have done a great job in managing and improving the efficiencies of the capital. We're going to continue that focus, but at the same time, make sure that we're seeing the best opportunities to actually grow the performance of the business. And we've also got larger scale opportunities that will be very carefully considered in terms of the way we allocate capital, and I'll pick it up that in my last bullet point.
In terms of capability, you can't make money in this business if you don't have the engine running to its potential. We've made significant improvements, but we're still not near the potential the assets have. That's the challenge to the team. There's a lot of work done on the cultural change across the organization. The focus on capital efficiencies is key. We acknowledge or I acknowledge the team for the performance improvement they've delivered, but we're also the first to say we still got a long way to go. 
Innovation then becomes a second phase for us in terms of improvement. We still see more from an operations point of view, but the technical stuff that Tony and the team have been working on, on energy, water, mining methods and step changes across the business I think are critical. And for those that have taken the time to dial into the future smart stuff can see how the thinking is starting to evolve across those areas. Again, marketing remains an important part of the business in helping us improve our returns or margins and driving the returns. And certainly, we've made great progress, and we could still see a lot more opportunities in terms of improvement.
On the return side, balance sheet flexibility is being restored. Stephen, I think, made a very important point about keeping our balance sheet flexible, so that we're always thinking about right place to put money to drive the business to improve performance. And what you tend to do if you let yourself get out of whack on the balance sheet is you then start making short-term decisions around what you should spend and what you shouldn't spend. We don't want to get back into that trap. So for us, very important. For us, the bad cash flow and returns absolutely critical. The syndication comment, we've been talking about syndication of major projects ever since we got ourselves in a position where we were building 5 major projects at the onetime, and we got caught in stressing the balance sheet. So I wanted to make the point, the lesson has been learned. We've studied the oil and gas business and other businesses and how they effectively manage a portfolio and risk on those major projects. So for us, the Quellaveco is very much about getting the syndication and our profile, right, because there are always things you don't know, you don't know that could touch in here. So I think, most importantly, we've taken the lessons of the industry in the last 5 years in particular, applying them, always learning, but we certainly see that the improvement in the operation reflects the focus on what we think are the critical issues. And if I make one final point and in many ways, it's the elevator test or the elevator message that I'd like to leave with you. In our business, we talk about 3 things in measuring whether we're doing the right thing for shareholders: Are we generating cash flow, free cash flow that supports the future development of the business and delivers real returns to shareholders? So it's about free cash flow. Secondly, how did you get that cash flow? And the best way to measure your efficiency in delivering those cash flows is your returns on capital. So that conversation from the first day, return on capital employed remains a mantra for us. Absolutely critical. Third point, how do you grow those cash flows? How do you improve the business? How do you make sure the business is sustainable? So safety, environment, the social development work you've got to do, people, the talent people you have, competitive costs and capital allocation. Absolutely the critical elements to make sure cash flow and returns are sustainable, and we can grow off the foundations we've created. That's how we're thinking.

What we've got to do irrespective of what happens is make 15% or better return at these prices and lower, and that's what Chris and the guys are focused on.

So we've had to look at -- and you get the normal tooling problems with equipment. So the guys have had to adjust their practices to the conditions they found, and they have reset and also did a lot of work on the equipment and changed their operating practices. And so we were averaging around 80,000 tonnes per week in the period up to that middle of June, Seamus? And then on a look-forward basis, the last 4 weeks, we're certainly north of 150,000, hitting closer to 200,000 tonnes a week, so that's 4 weeks. I wouldn't book that yet. I think there's still more learnings that the guys will pick up. The geotechnical conditions haven't improved markedly. I think the practices have improved, and I think that's important. Seamus was thrilled to have his technical adviser, Stephen Pearce, to a site visit a couple of weeks ago. And Stephen had lots of suggestions, all of which have been ignored.

That's the really important point to make in terms of margins that most haven't picked up. So thanks for that. Gahcho Kué. I think it'd be fair to say, Bruce, that what we found so far is that whilst the quality has been a little bit lower than we anticipated, the actual carats per tonne have been more than we thought. And therefore, the revenues per tonne have been on or better than anticipated in terms of the current mix. So we think that the news is fine with -- the production ramp ups, they're going very well, so they've had good few months. So I think you've always got to be a bit careful, particularly in the upper levels of the ore body. But the revenue per tonne is holding up okay, a little bit down on quality but better carat. So, so far, so good in terms of the revenue. But again, I think we just got to be a bit very careful. It's still very early Meeno. We're certainly not worried by what we've seen so far. It would be within the scope of what we'd expect. On Los Bronces, it is a tight pit. You're right. Duncan and the teams are working with a very tight pit room, and until we can get that further opened up, things will remain tight. I think the key with Los Bronces is to again establish that pit room and continue to work with CODELCO in finding the best way to work together across the pillar so that we both get a positive outcome. The relationship with CODELCO is very good, very open both ways. I think we've mended all the fences plus some, so I think it's a good relationship. The team has got a lot of work to do. So I think it's still going to be tied certainly for the balance of this year, and I think the key will be that relationship with CODELCO to get a bit more flexibly. On the positive side, we see a great improvement next year, which will be obviously a positive for the operation. But physically, it's -- we're working with more of a constraints space, okay?"

So those basic numbers tell you that we still got 20% to 30% underlying productivity across the business that we want to chase.

Automation is only a small subset of our broader program, and we're really concentrating in 3 main areas. One is the ore body, getting much better tagging of the mineralogy and the properties of the ore body. And we're generally doing that now with hyperspectral imaging. So it's basically processes that will ultimately replace SA. If we don't flow that through into our processing plants, what we're really trying to do is become much more precise in the way we target the minerals entering our processing. We're working basically, taking this tagging and then working on flotation in particular, the way we cyclone cross-particle flotation. And I think a lot of the industry rules around flotation, and recoveries you actually get are about to be rewritten. An example of that is some of the new crushes we're developing with partners in Germany, break rock in a very different manner than we've ever been used to. It tends to break along the particle boundaries rather than just smash everything. And I think it'll actually set us up for very different chemical recoveries, and we'll see step changes coming out. So I found this much more interesting than the balance sheet. The day we get you guys into this head space, I actually thought made it. But we are putting quite a full presentation on our innovation out in Australia in a couple of weeks' time.

Obviously, debt costs are relatively low at this point in the cycle, so that don't provide a huge sort of shelter in any event. So yes, listen, I am really comfortable in taking the balance sheet debt down low. You'd be aware we still have a little bit of a split balance sheet to work through, so I wouldn't see that happening in a hurry in terms of getting to a net cash position. But we'll balance up, sort of feeding into your other questions to Mark, the number of projects that we're committing to, the amount of money that they commit to over periods of time, the balance sheet, the liquidity, and obviously absolute debt levels and the debt portfolio and maturity profile.

The one thing that we believe in our diamond portfolio is we've got a great endowment that we haven't fully tested. So what can we do more at Orapa, Jwaneng longer term, Venetia? Gahcho Kué is still too early to make a call in the future. But those endowments are quite significant, and we haven't done a lot of testing beyond where we are today. The most significant one that we think is not working towards its potential is Orapa. And so Bruce is thinking very hard about how he can get more out of that in the right way and working with Tony and the team on stepping that out with incremental improvements in the operations. And so we've got a few of those. Some of those will take up a little longer. But certainly, we think that's where the big opportunities are around those major assets where we haven't really tested those endowments. Secondly, in copper. Collahuasi and Los Bronces both have lots of potential. Los Bronces is going to take a little more time, and I think will require some -- a little bit more flexibility around the mine as I talked to -- and certainly with our friends next door. If we can help each other, we'd be a bit more flexibility. There's an opportunity there. I think the technology stuff there in copper is really important. So we currently got our pilot plants operating on cross-flotation with crushing, cross-flotation and the dewatering so that we can materially reduce our water consumption, we'll reduce our energy probably 20%. Those opportunities in copper are quite significant. And the reason why they're important is water allows you to produce more because that's the scarce resource. They're are 2 opportunities in Collahuasi and Los Bronces. I think it's around technology, and Tony and Duncan are teaming up in that work. In platinum, Chris's incremental options on Mogalakwena still look very good. If you remember, he put money aside to do debottlenecking to get to 400,000 ounces. He didn't need the money to get to 400,000. He's done a fantastic job with the team debottlenecking, just doing simple things smarter. He's still got some money there to do a little bit of sensible debottlenecking given it's $1,000 an ounce margin. It's a great place to be. He's already highlighted this week his intentions on Amandelbult to try and take $200 to $300 an ounce out. He's already building a chrome plant that he's got less than a 12-month payback risk on the delivery of the chrome plant. So lots of opportunity to do things smarter in platinum. I could talk about the Grosvenor debottlenecking with the processing plant. Let's make sure we get the asset running to potential. It was only going to operate 5 days a week. We can get it to 7 days so we're still going to work in the coal prep plant. That's a great incremental contribution to the business. You know about Minas-Rio going to its 26.5 million. Obviously, that's linked to the licensing process, and we think there are things we can do to get it to around 30 million tonnes at the right time with very small capital increment. So there's a whole raft of projects that we've got and we can see across the portfolio that are being nurtured through either innovation or basic technical changes that we think can deliver very good payback and very -- return to well above to the 15%. In terms of major projects, I think we made a comment 1 or 2 meetings ago, we prefer not to have one big project opened at any one time. You might be at the start or in the tail, so you will have some overlaps, but that's a preference. And in our case, clearly Quellaveco is the one that's moving towards a commitment, probably the earliest. But I think again, keeping the balance sheet in the right place, making sure you got a good balance of opportunities, I think, is the key to continually improving the business. And I think we've got a lot of those opportunities that we're still scratching at it in terms of where we go to from here. That's why Stephen is making it clear that $2.5 billion is the pitch number. There may be opportunities to do some really good stuff for a little bit more, make sure we've got the development balances right. We haven't starved the business, although we've made tough calls. What we want to make sure is we've got everybody balanced in the right place and we got the flexibility to be productive and get the productivity number over 200%."

Cash tax will be a little bit lower in the second half as well. Kind of offsetting that, we will have obviously the $600 million dividend that flows to our shareholders. But also, obviously with Kumba paying the dividend, we get some of that cash but so do the minorities. So you'll see some of that sort of self-correct a little bit in the second half.

The underlying performance, you can do the numbers, and we would agree with you. We think we look a bit cheap. Hopefully, yes. People will give us more credit. But I also acknowledge that the South African question is the question. So in terms of South Africa, we're doing all the things we said we'd do. On the corporate structures, we're simplifying them. We're working on all of our overheads and our costs across the business, and we've reduced those significantly. We've managed and sold assets that are either small scale or not long term, really not a fit. That's the 5 assets we've got in process at the moment. We're doing that type of work. We're improving the businesses, a lot more still to be done. And that's where we're going to remain focused. I've said, and I think I've said this last time, we don't expect to land a longer-term position on South Africa this year because I think there'll be so much noise around the leadership debate that it'll be really difficult to get anyone to focus and align with us on the pieces going forward. So what we said is we like the assets we have. We're going to continue to improve them. And at some point, there'll be a dialogue on the positioning and approach on the way forward. I'm not sure where that will land. In the meantime, we like the businesses. The guys are doing a great job in restructuring. We're going to keep driving it and hopefully continue to generate cash and with Chris and the guys working hard in platinum. We'll continue to improve it. I think the other point that's really important is if you look at the U.S., they're still arguing about the election. There's nothing new in countries going through leadership debates, they have lots of noise. Unfortunately, South Africa tends to be more noisier than most given it's 20 years into a constitution. So we knew they'd be noisy. It is noisy. It's unlikely we'll get someone on the other side post the electoral piece of the leadership piece, probably in November, Norman. And we'll continue doing the things we said we do. Okay."

There's no mention in the presentation really of the idea of core Anglo anymore. So would it be fair to assume that pursuing asset sales activity is no longer a priority for the management team? Related to that, how do we think about the South African bulks piece within the group? There have been praise articles in SA about Anglo potentially considering a partial exit or an exit of its South African bulks businesses. With no core Anglo in the presentation, should we assume that, that's not something that you're working on? Following on from that, is an exit or a partial exit or some kind of restructuring in SA dependent on the political outcome? Or can you do something in SA without having a more business-friendly leader of the ANC in place, if you want to call it that? And then the last point, can you do anything in SA until we get a resolution on the charter as it relates to transfers of mining rights? We know that there's been topics in the press about Anglo platinum maybe not being able to execute on asset sales as quickly as they'd like because of political interference?"

Look, thanks for that. Firstly, in terms of the business, what we've said is that the 37 assets that we have today are assets we'd be happy to operate for the longer term, generating cash, good returns that we can continue to recruiting businesses. So we don't have any active processes. But one thing I will say is that any business has to make sure that it's got the right portfolio. You're always considering your positions over time, and we've landed pretty closely to what we originally defined as the target portfolio back in 2014. Clearly, niobium and phosphates. It's the only material asset we would have liked to have kept. But at the end of the day, the price we got I think Philippe was fairly happy with what we delivered in terms of value. So no active processes, and we're not out there trying to sell. We're drawing the line, and we'll operate. But it doesn't mean we won't continue to improve and make some sales on the basis of improving the portfolio as we should proper capital managers. In terms of the SA bulks, as I've said, we like Kumba. The work the guys have done has been fantastic. We're happy to operate the asset. We remain open to where we go in the future. And that conversation, there's always one that we're in and we'll be in over the next 12 to 18 months, whatever it might be. But if nothing changes and we're happy to be where we are, that's where we'll be. I don't want to go any further than that because a bit hard speculating on what we don't know, and the politics will change over the next 12 months. Like all these things, politics is something you take into account, but it's not the only issue. There are a range of things that we'll take into account. So at this stage, we're open, we're operating, we're improving, and we'll make those decisions probably during the course of '18 as you would expect we would in making sure that we've got the portfolio right. Politics, yes, it will make a difference but not to the extent that it's the only factor. There a range of factors and in every country we operate. We take a whole range of factors into account in making decisions to allocate capital. So it ultimately comes down to our capital allocation and delivery returns. If we can make money, if we can operate, then we're happy to be there. So they're really the key points. We've doubled the work, we've improved the business, we still got a way to go. Every jurisdiction remains under scrutiny. Every dollar we spend in capital remains important, including South African dollars. Okay?"

You currently have a quite significant net cash in South Africa, I think. You have had it for some time. Now it's especially big. And this big net debt -- sorry, net cash, looks especially noticeable in the context of increased political risks. I understand that it helps to balance out net debt for the group. But ultimately, the only thing you can do with this cash is pay it out as dividends, right? So why it's still sitting there? And second question is actually about diamond market outlook. The rough diamond market had been performing reasonably well or even pretty well, which stands I think in contrast with somewhat unimpressive performance in the Polish market with prices stagnating and very mixed signals in terms of demand from jewelry and midstream. What do you see here in terms of outlook for the second half, in terms of outlook for 2018? Is there a risk that the situation in the rough diamond market could deteriorate sharply as it -- or you haven't before with diamonds? Or you think it's just not on the cards?"

So debt dividends in South Australian cash as opposed -- they're all sort of linked as the question was there. So now not changing our long-term targets at this point in terms of the sort of stated target we've had in terms of debt-to-EBITDA ratio. So 1x to 1.5x through the cycle. That doesn't mean, though, where we have periods of higher prices, we should be really right towards the low end or below the low end so that when you do get back to long-term cyclical prices, you're back in that range. And that's just where we happen to be in the journey at the moment. So I'm going to make much of it over the next 18 months, particularly in terms of getting that as low as we possibly can. You touched on the sort of the split balance sheet. So while the 0.8 looks very attractive from a rest of the world point of view, we're below 2. But still, on a long-term price scenario, that would probably create back towards 2, and we'd like to be below 2 from a rest of the world point of view. So we're just nicely, neatly in that range at the moment. The South African cash has built up partly because of the operations in the pricing particularly on bulks but also because we suspended the dividend. And so what you'll see even in this half as some -- so I think Kumba's dividend was about USD 500 million equivalent, just over half of that effectively close to us. Half of that will flow to minorities. And so you'll see a little bit of a self-correction of that, particularly as we continue the payout ratio journey in the 6-month periods ahead. So we're not rushing out to do anything other than run the business as usual, and you'll see some of those things sort of correct themselves over time."

But again, there are all considerations we think about in terms of the long-term portfolio mix. On diamonds, Bruce, I'm not going to ask him to say a word because he's in the middle of the site as we speak. So we're always a bit cautious in making any comments about the market. If I could just go back to what we've said in the last couple of months. The U.S. has been a great place. It's a little noisy at the moment, I think, on a general economic perspective. And as a consequence, diamonds may or may not be impacted by that. China has been pretty good. I think we've just got to remain cautious. I think we said this year will be about clearing our stock. We did that pretty fairly successfully early in the year. And we're just going to continue to take a careful approach with the way we price our products, taking very careful notice of the Sightholders feedback. We're in the middle of that process.

First of all, with FY '18 CapEx. Are you hinting that, that's going to creep up? Is that the way we should interpret the comments today that you actually have some great opportunities to deliver kind of good returns on slightly high CapEx? The second thing is, again, I'm slightly confused around sort of the -- what you're talking about in terms of cost savings. Because you say $1 billion is a stretched target, but in the same breath, you started saying that there's huge potential across the portfolio. So just -- we've -- cost saving, should we -- can you more than offset underlying inflation? Or are you just going to be offsetting mining inflation?

In fact, in the coal business, we've been flat for 4 years now. So that remains our objective, particularly in high-inflation environments, to be able to do better than the local inflation rate. So that remains our objective. It's never linear or without a few bumps. So what we're saying is we've picked, I think, the lower-hanging fruit. We've made some really hard changes with the processes we put in place. The operating model actually drives a continuous improvement. So we want to continue to do that and see if we can keep ahead of inflation plus some, and that's a sort of probably a good guideline for how we're thinking about delivering cost and volume improvement because they do come hand-in-hand. So that's where we are. So looking to do better than inflation across any of our jurisdictions is probably the sort of guide that we're looking to achieve or better.

And I think again, particularly in platinum in the processing facility, that does take a while to flow itself through. Offsetting that, we had some positive working capital moves in diamonds. Their stock levels are probably a little bit lower given the sales they had in the first half, and we might rebuild that a little bit in the second. So a number of moving parts.

I think it's a great competitive discipline internally as well in terms of how we think about cash allocation and whether it's to shareholders, to dividends or to capital projects. Now in time, we'll have a look at various forms of returns to shareholders. Right now, I think a simple dividend suits us well, and we'll look at those options. How are we going to evaluate it? It'll depend a little bit the phase you're in, the capital projects and the growth opportunities that may come through that pipeline. So it's hard to give you a hard and fast rule. Ultimately, the theory is grand, and everyone has got a similar slide. It's how you then apply that it over time and how you demonstrate that discipline.

So welcome, ladies and gentlemen. There aren't many women in the audience, I've got to say. They've got a lot -- we've all got a lot more work to do on diversity.
Firstly, I would like to acknowledge my colleagues in the audience. The feedback we've had from people generally is that they appreciate the interaction and the ability to chat to people regarding the results. So we'll continue to make the guys who really do know what's happening in the business and other the guys driving the change. From the presentation of results, we'd like to keep things fairly crisp and clear. Stephen will cover the detail behind the numbers in his presentation. So after I do my very short business summary, he'll take on the detail and I'll do a wrap at the end just to make a couple of other points and do a little bit on a forward-looking basis. So that's the format. We've structured it so that we can be fairly crisp through the presentation to give you an opportunity to ask questions. So with that, let's kick away and get straight into things.
Again, I know you will see the numbers. The key points that I thought needed to be emphasized in our conversations is obviously starting with the delivering on commitments mantra that we've talked to over the last 4 years. And certainly from our point of view, absolutely critical in terms of getting the right behaviors across the organization. 
In the operating performance, the self-help focus has been a key driver in improving margins. Yes, more recently, prices helped. But if you look at last year, in particular, price are actually lower than they were in '15, yet there was a $4 billion cash flow turnaround. So there's been a big contribution from the self-help side. We continue to improve productivities, and that supported the 9% increase in volume on a period-to-period basis. As a consequence, EBITDA of $4.1 billion is probably around the range that people were forecasting. Free cash flow of $2.7 billion has been the important number from our perspective, more than all of 2016. Yes, prices helped, but half of that improvement has been on the self-help work. And you'll see the $600 million of cost and volume improvement that we've achieved in the first half as well. So we're on track to achieve the $1 billion. 
The balance sheet, good position. It's allowed -- or the net debt 6 months earlier and $800 million blow us below the actual full year target. There's obviously a lag and early resumption of the dividend, which we're very pleased to be able to talk to today as well.
In terms of the portfolio, the continuing work on sales of the smallest scale lower margin assets that don't fit the portfolio have continued with the announcement of the thermal coal sales -- the domestic thermal coal sales and the platinum assets during the first 6 months. And obviously the ramping up of both Minas-Rio and Gahcho Kué has obviously helped the support and improving production outcome as well. 
In terms of positioning for the future, we'll pick up those points in the second half of the presentation. So I won't dwell too much on the points that we have made there on the slide.
Most importantly, for us, doesn't matter what we do operationally in terms of improvement in business getting cost down. If you're not managing safety, environment and those issues that can create major issues across the group, we've made better progress in the second quarter of the year, very disappointing first quarter on the safety front. Unfortunately though, we still reported 3 fatalities. In the end, it's not simply about the numbers. It's about the tragedies that go behind that. So we still got work to do on the safety front. I'm encouraged that the performance in the second quarter, on a total injury frequency rate, was better, but still more work to be done and a lot more work to be done as we continue the improvement program.
On the environment side, we had a pipeline spill at Los Bronces that was quick -- cleaned up very quickly. We had a drilling incident. And in coal, more -- an incident associated with some of the flooding that we saw, both in South Africa and Australia in fact. But overall, much better control, and the results have been encouraging. We're not yet done to 0. But certainly in terms of where we started, we've made good progress, and we'll keep driving the focus on planning, execution and focus on the detail that ultimately ensures that we're driving productivity in costs as well.
In terms of production, we're up 9%, as I said, period-on-period. Across the group, the focus on the implementation of the operating model and the performance improvements that go with that remains a key focus. The operating model is not something you can do in 6 months. It's a long-term change program with 3 years into its implementation, and there are some very obvious benefits we're seeing in the portfolio. From my point of view, some honorable mentions in terms of the performance over the period. Certainly, De Beers is very solid. The Gahcho Kué ramp-up is going well. Mogalakwena in platinum continues to improve, and we certainly see more potential as we get into the detail of drawing glass and the other technical issues. Sishen done extremely well. I think Timbers work off the foundations that Norman started. I think Seamus, Timber and the team have done a great job in continuing to build and improve the performance. 
And the only real disappointment in the half was nickel. We started pulling in the first quarter, good recovery. Second quarter, more to be done. I still think there's a chance they might give the guidance a nudge, but we're being prudent, I think, in suggesting that it's a bit touch and go at the moment. So overall, a pretty strong sets of results, more to come.
For us, productivity, that is how much production each person is contributing, up almost 70% from where we started with the changed programs. If you look at the portfolio of changes we've made and the underlying cost efficiencies or if you look at how that's impacted on the numbers, we've gone from 162,000 to 95,000. We're forecasting with the sales that we've announced to guide in the way, these 7,000 people. The contribution in portfolio change and restructuring and efficiency improvements is about 50-50, about 50% portfolio, 50% efficiency work. We still think there's a lot more to be done on the efficiency front. And so for us, certainly, the targets remain aggressive in continuing to improve. But obviously, we've done the bulk with the portfolio change and we don't have any active processes in place at the current time.
As an aside, when you look at our underlying cost structures, we've actually improved our energy consumption against our products by around 30% over the same 4-year period. So again, partly portfolio, partly efficiency work, and that's contributed to the real cost reduction in excess of 30%. We'll show you that it's about 23% in the numbers, but continuing and important focal point for our cost improvement work.
On the margins, again, a real focal point for us. Obviously, we can impact from the cost side, but also the change in marketing strategy was quite important in terms of improving our margins. People are aware that we've seen against the benchmarks. We set ourselves back in '13. We're up 4% on realized prices. So they might have a material contribution to that margin improvement. As I've said earlier, the see-through margin, and just to explain see-through margin, we take out the diamond trading work and the purchase of concentrates so that people can see our margin as you would against our industrial competitors. Really making sure people understand what we're focused on in terms of the industrial business, and these are the margins that we've reported. So the 21% to 26% reflects that adjustment in terms of the underlying numbers, so you can see what we're doing. 26% to 34%, we actually had a lower price realized in '16. So that improvement in margin was in our hands. And the 34% to 40%, about 50% our contribution with our efficiency work and about 50% price.
So for us, a real focal point, and I'll pick that up and compare it to our competitors, not so much to make any other statements than to say, look, we had a lot of work to do. We've improved. And from our point of view, we think we're in the game with a lot more to come in terms of the underlying improvements that we think we can deliver across the portfolio.
So with that, I will hand across to Stephen. So good news about Stephen is he's not an Arsenal support, and I think we've got him thinking very hard about Chelsea."

So listen, thanks, Mark, and it's a real pleasure to present my first set of Anglo American results. So thanks for having me.
There's a couple of themes that I want to touch on through today's presentation. So firstly, clearly, a good set of operating and financial results reflects strongly in the numbers. The strength of the underlying cash flows, he is driven by price, but also from the cost out and the efficiency delivery and from project delivery as well. Clearly, a continued focus on the balance sheet and continuing to drive net debt down as we've reset and strengthened our financial position. Ongoing discipline around capital allocation, and that will continue. And pleasingly, restoration of the dividend.
But there's one overriding theme that I want to leave you unless we talk through the slides, and that is that we've still got work to do, I think both on the balance sheet front and on the cost out front. As I work through these slides, I'll expand on some of the numbers, but I'll also try to just give you sort of a fiber of my thinking both on the numbers and how we'll take things forward across the different areas.
So let's look at the numbers. EBITDA of $4.1 billion, as Mark said, up 68% on the prior period, resulting in EPS of $1.19 per share. I'll touch on CapEx in more detail a little bit later, but clearly, lower in the first half. I'll talk through the first half, second half split. And we have lowered our guidance for the full year down from $2.5 billion down to $2.3 billion. 
Attributable free cash flow, $2.7 billion. All of that meant we reduced our debt down to $6.2 billion. So down $2.3 billion in the half, significantly below the $7 billion target that we've set ourselves for the end of this calendar year.
So self-help. Obviously, the self-help continued in terms of EBITDA improvement through the half and brings the total gains over the last -- since 2013 to $3.7 billion. So across the last 4 or 5 years. In the current half, you can see we did have the benefit of higher prices, offset a little bit by inflation and exchange rates. From a price point of view, the standout clearly was met coal. So realized about $194, $195 per tonne across the half, offset a little bit by currencies, in particular, the strengthening of the rand. Great news is we're on track to meet the $1 billion target. So another -- so $600 million realized in the first half, $400 million to go in the second half.
Most of you are aware, I've spent the first couple of months when I joined Anglo getting out and about across quite a number of the operations and praise to the teams. They welcomed me, and they're willing to spend a lot of time with me. But one of my big impressions now is that there is still a huge opportunity in this business to continue to drive efficiency gains, get better at what we do, and it's going to be, I think, exciting as we take on that challenge in the years ahead.
So let's look at the $600 million that we delivered and the $1 billion challenge. So $600 million in the first half, a great start. A couple of points to note. Obviously, De Beers and Los Bronces did well in terms of cost position and sort of setting themselves up also for the second half of the year. Sishen was probably the standout. As Mark mentioned in terms of adopting the operating model over a period of time, adapting to the new mine plan, you saw that reflected in their announcement earlier in the week. So really, really great, really great drive of improvement. I think the exciting thing there is a lot of that happened towards the end of the first half, and again, I think there's a great journey ahead for that operation.
We still have got work to do. If it was easy, we would've already done it, and it's one of those things where you keep delivering cost out and efficiency improvements. The expectation is that it will just carry on, and that's an easy thing to deliver. But I can assure you the team is working exceptionally hard to try to hit that $1 billion target.
As we look beyond 2017, we'll come back to you towards the end of this calendar year in terms of how we're going to set the targets again for 2018 as we continue that journey.
So if you prove in EBITDA obviously, and earnings clearly shows the benefit, as Mark mentioned, from the work done over the last couple of years in terms of portfolio, marketing margins and cost-efficiency improvements. One thing I would just like to touch on is effective tax rate for the year. So for those of you trying to balance your balance sheets and get the numbers right when you hit the bottom line, guidance for the full year at 28% to 30% across the full year. So if you can plug that one in.
So let's then have a quick look at CapEx. So CapEx of $800 million for the first half reflects a couple of things. Obviously, capital discipline about how and when we're spending money. When we do spend it, we're starting to see some of the same benefits that you're seeing from the operating side of the business flow into the capital side and capital spend. And that should be no surprise because a lot of our capital spend in the half has been around staying business and stripping capital. And in a lot of cases, it's some of the same fleet and the same setup that's doing that work. So you're starting to see some of that flow through into the capital spend numbers as well.
In terms of the first half and second half split, every mining company I've had the pleasure of working with has exactly the same issue in terms of first half and second half. It's probably a little more exaggerated this time around for a couple of reasons. One is we had a lot of wet weather in South Africa and through the first quarter. We also then had some geotech issues at Grosvenor and then Cyclone Debbie, which also impacted on our ability to spend some of the capital that we were planning in the first half. So the second half will be higher. $1.5 billion is what we're guiding on top of the $0.8 billion, and that would bring us in the $2.3 billion, as I say, some $200 million below our original guidance.
As we look forward to 2018, we've guided to $2.5 billion. I'd ask for your patience a little bit. We're sort of dusting off both how we're allocating capital, how we evaluate capital spend, and we're obviously at the start of planning for 2018. So we'll come back and give you some updated guidance there. But there's 2 things that I'm really looking at as we start to set the capital budgets for 2018. Obviously, are we spending what we spend well? And that's got to really drive through every single capital dollar that we do spend. 
The second one, I'll ask my Anglo colleagues to put their heads over their ears is, if they can, and you may be surprised at this, but I was spending enough, particularly in terms of the projects that are going to deliver that next round of innovation and change and efficiency in the business. And so we need to challenge ourselves both not to spend money, but to make sure when we spend it, we spend it in the right path.
This is clearly one of Mr. Cutifani's absolute favorite slides. So you know he loves to talk about return on capital employed, and return on capital employed 18% versus the 8% this time last year. Clearly, it shows the work that the team has done and delivered over the last couple of years. 
Attributable free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Again, remember, this is the half. We delivered $2.5 billion of free cash flow for the whole year last year, so we're significantly stepped up. And yes, it is partly priced, but it's also partly self-help as we've shown.
So let's look at the balance sheet. A key focus for the group over the last 2 years has been getting the balance sheet back into shape, and the journey clearly has continued this half. So net debt, down to $6.2 billion. Again, well ahead of our year-end target. But we still have work to do and particularly in respect to our debt portfolio. So our debt portfolio is relatively short in its average life compared to our long-life quality assets that we have in that portfolio. So similar to what we did back in March. You should expect us to just gradually work on that over time as we extend out the maturity profile.
In terms of ratios, net debt-to-EBITDA at 0.8x, below our longer-term guidance of 1x to 1.5x through the cycle. Gearing, 19%. Again, strongly supports and works with the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and certainly puts us well in positioning in terms of our peers through the industry as well.
We will be running a more conservative balance sheet than what you've seen the company run in the past, and that's particularly the -- with volatility in metal prices as well and learn the lessons from the past. We have and are still coming off a period of higher-than-average long-term bulk prices, particularly in iron ore and coal. So what you should expect to see and what you have seen is that we will take the balance sheet to a much lower level than what does long term through the cycle targets imply. And I've got absolutely no qualms at all in continuing to take the debt lower over the next 18 months. And I think with prices where they are, we have a fantastic opportunity to continue to do that.
So dividends. Obviously, it's a real pleasure in your first results presentation to reinstate the dividend. And while I can't take full credit for the dividend, one of the first things I did when I joined the company was make sure I got my name on the authorized signature list for the bank accounts. So that when the checks go out, it can be my name on it and not René's. So watch out for that in the mail. Clearly, we have exceeded our targets, whether it be balance sheet, cash flow, ratios, et cetera, and that really set us up to make for what was a fairly straightforward discussion at the board. So for the half, a 40% payout ratio on the half, that's $0.48 per share, $600 million back to shareholders. So a really great start as we have come back into this period. As we look forward in terms of policy, again, a 40% payout ratio based on underlying earnings will be paid on that basis each half.
We will consider additional return to shareholders, and I'll touch on that in terms of how we're thinking about cash and allocation. But right now, we've got other priorities in terms of continuing the balance sheet journey in particular. So it will be a nice problem to have when we get there. Right now, we'll continue the balance sheet journey.
So just to wrap up before I hand back to Mark, just a couple of thoughts on how we're thinking about cash flow and capital allocation. A couple of smiles in the audience, obviously, a number of companies have similar sort of slides. Left-hand side, the theory. Right-hand side, the actual numbers for the half, and we'll sort of continue to report on this basis as we go forward.
So again, great cash flow generation in the half, and you'll be used to seeing the $2.7 billion. But we've adjusted that prior -- to make it prior to discretionary capital. So $2.8 billion prior to that discretionary capital. Have we spent that money? Obviously, nearly all of it was allocated to reduction in debt in terms of that balance sheet priority. And that's consistent with our commitment that Anglo American made in terms of getting the balance sheet right, then obviously with the dividend, reinstating the dividend before we consider spending money and allocating capital to other things.
So you can see in there, the $2.3 billion is the reduction in debt, a few other balance sheet bits and bobs. And obviously the dividend that we've declared now, that $600 million will drop into that red sort of category into the second half of the full year. Again, you can see very limited allocation to discretionary capital studies, exploration, et cetera. And again, to me, that sits really well in terms of where our priorities were for the half and where they will be for the remainder -- for the balance of this year.
So again, just to leave you on one thought, I think we do have quite a lot of compelling opportunities when the -- within the portfolio and a lot of compelling projects within the portfolio. And we'll consider those in time as we allocate that cash. But it does -- it is important to realize those projects have to compete with additional returns to shareholders, and we'll clearly consider that as we think about our cash flow allocation. 
Mark, thank you"

It has required a lot of work, probably coming off a lower base than any of us would've liked. B",2556,"Thanks, Steve. Okay. So in terms of where we started, I guess, a 1-slide recap. Firstly, with all the work that's being done, it is a more efficient business. It has required a lot of work, probably coming off a lower base than any of us would've liked. But today, 46% less assets in terms of people, similarly reduced. About half of that changed, as I said, this portfolio and half the actual restructuring, downsizing and efficiency work to be done. That obviously has improved our competitive position, but still a long way to go, in our view. But at the same time, with all of that change and all of those changes occurring and the portfolio reductions, our production is actually up 6%. So the generating more cash and higher returns have been about fundamental change across the business, a $4.4 billion turnaround in the cash flow and obviously an improvement in return which, for us, is an important number. And if I can say it this way, the focus on ROCE is absolutely critical because the way you get that cash flow is all about how you allocate capital to make sure you're delivering efficiency. It changes the mind set in the organization. And I think the most important thing that I can say about what we've done from this perspective has been focused on changing mindsets, and I'll make a point at the end of the presentation that driving that cultural strength has to be around the numbers you tell people are important. And I think we're making good progress, but still a long way to go.
In terms of the portfolio, you've seen this slide before. I won't dwell too much on the slide before. From us, a lot of the hard work was done in '14 and '15, but we've continued to work on improving the portfolio and making sure that the assets we have today, when you look forward, are assets that can be competitive, that can generate cash, can generate returns and continue to improve the underlying performance of the business. And that's where we've been coming from.
Again, in making the point on margins, this is where we were back in 2015 compared to our 3 major peers. Again, we're showing the comparison not to make any comment about others. I think everyone's doing hard work and doing good work, but more to make a comment about what we've tried to do in the business. 26% to 34% from '15 to '16 was achieved with a lower-priced deck in 2016. That was about self-help, and I think that's an important point to make. And for 2017, the first half, we're at 40%. Again, we know there's a lot more to be done, but that focus on margin, which is why the marketing side is so important, it's not simply about costs. It's about efficiency. It's about making sure the assets are working to their potential. And from our point of view, marketing's contribution has been important in terms of that prices. So that's what we focus on because that's what drives cash flow and returns in terms of the capital that we've deployed across the business.
Again, just to reinforce the strategic approach and the conversations that we had, it's about assets. It's about the quality of the assets. And so when I show revenue by product in terms of commodities, it's not about deliberately positioning in one commodity over and over. None of us have been terribly successful in forecasting commodity prices, certainly in the short term and even in the longer term. It's a bit of a fraud guide. What we're focused on is the quality of the assets we have. And as a consequence, we've got a quite nicely diversified portfolio in terms of the assets we have and the positions we have.
From a geographic point of view, same story. The geographic diversity we have in the portfolio is a function of where we have quality assets. And yes, partly, it's still a work in progress, but the portfolio, as a consequence of the decisions we've made on selling assets and in where we've allocated our capital in building new projects is, as a consequence, rebalancing the portfolio as you can see there today. And with South Africa, about 25% of their capital employed. The balance is starting to look quite sensible. In the end, it will be a function of the quality of the assets. So it will change over time as a natural consequence of focusing our capital where we think we can deliver the best returns.
On South Africa itself, from our point of view, we remain, I think, committed to the assets that we think can deliver the long-term returns in the business. If I talk about Mining Charter 3, I think the important point to make is that, for Mining Charters 1 and 2, we've delivered all the requirements plus some in terms of transformation and all of the other objective measures that used to judge whether you've actually transformed the business. And as an aside, Anglo American has been the most transformative company in the last 24 years in South Africa. We represented 61% of the GAC back in 1987. Today, we're about 67%. The 90% change in our configuration in relation to the GAC has been about the companies that have been demerged or spun off in South Africa that represents massive transformation on a scale no one else has matched across the country. Today, in the assets that we operate in South Africa, approximately 40% of the ownership of those assets in direct South African hands. And when we take South African ownership, mostly pension funds and others who own Anglo American, their ownership is 62%. We are committed to transformation and making sure that we've got the balance right for both South Africa and our shareholders.
Today, the document that we have that has been presented is an unworkable document. Without saying anything else, I think it's important that we come together with the government and work through and find a solution that works for everyone. There's no point shrinking the pie to 0. We have to create a larger pie and make sure that all benefit. But from our point of view, that's where the focus needs to be and certainly, we're part -- and part of the industry in making sure that conversation goes forward the right way. From our point of view, we've been doing a lot of work on restructuring. The corporate structure simplification, overheads, improving the business as we will continue to focus on the efficiencies of the operations. And certainly, from our point of view, making sure that we're delivering the best performance we can in terms of the assets that we operate in the country.
For us, over time, clearly, in terms of capital allocation, we have a number of opportunities, many of them outside South Africa. So that's where the capital will go. And as a consequence, you will continue to see an adjustment of our -- the relative capital employed across the business. But it's a function of the assets and where the opportunities are. For us, wherever we allocate capital, it's about value, value for shareholders and for us. That's where the focus will remain, and that's where we'll consider having positioned ourselves in any jurisdiction across the globe.
More specifically across the commodity positions we have. Clearly, in copper in De Beers, we have very good positions. I think the prognosis in terms of market dynamics is very strong. We've got great assets. We're certainly well positioned to take advantage of those markets with very good assets that we have. And so a very strong and very much gets the green light in terms of allocating capital carefully into those areas where we think returns are certainly available to us.
In PGMs, I see how buffalo restless here from South Africa. Hi, Chris. Chris and the guys has done a fantastic job in restructuring the business, focusing the portfolio on those assets that we believe can deliver returns through any price scenario in the market. There's still a lot more work to be done. And Chris I know has spent quite a bit of time talking about the cost-reduction strategy for Amandelbult and the ongoing improvements he wants to deliver in Mogalakwena. And you also have to remember that we've got very good margins in our processing operations and leaving reasonable capital returns, he wants to do better. But in terms of the portfolio, the best portfolio in the industry. And certainly from our point of view on these prices, we want to make sure that portfolio can deliver better than the 15% return, and that's what Chris and the guys are working on and they have come long way. 
In iron ore and coal, Seamus has done a great job with the bulks team right across the board. We've been absolutely thrilled with the progress that's being made. We've had to think very carefully about the market positions we take. High-quality assets, very good cost structures in coal and mid to mid-third quartile cost in iron ore, but with a great quality product. So how do we think about maximizing our margins in the markets in which we operate? And so a lot of thought has gone into us positioning to make sure we can maintain the margins and improve our returns. And I think we're well underway to showing how far we go, and we still think we've got a lot of improvement to go. And I think, credit to Seamus and the guys, a few challenges in the first half at Grosvenor. They've continued to improve. And certainly, the last month has been very encouraging. But with that asset, another leg that I think will make a material contribution to the business. I'm very excited with the potential we see particularly in the last month. So a lot of work to be done, thinking very careful about our capital allocation, and it will all be about making sure we can generate cash flow and returns.
So finally, just making -- or taking all of those pieces and summarizing the key points. Again, from a portfolio perspective, it's about the quality of the assets. The portfolio upgrading to support sustainable cash flow and returns is the mantra that we work to within the business. It's about cash flow and returns. And those assets are the assets we see the best potential today, tomorrow and into the future. And everything is focused on improving those positions and making sure those positions are sustainable. We see a lot of smaller scale, small scale capital opportunities to improve the business. Stephen's point about making sure that we get the expenditures right. We've been tough. The guys have done a great job in managing and improving the efficiencies of the capital. We're going to continue that focus, but at the same time, make sure that we're seeing the best opportunities to actually grow the performance of the business. And we've also got larger scale opportunities that will be very carefully considered in terms of the way we allocate capital, and I'll pick it up that in my last bullet point.
In terms of capability, you can't make money in this business if you don't have the engine running to its potential. We've made significant improvements, but we're still not near the potential the assets have. That's the challenge to the team. There's a lot of work done on the cultural change across the organization. The focus on capital efficiencies is key. We acknowledge or I acknowledge the team for the performance improvement they've delivered, but we're also the first to say we still got a long way to go. 
Innovation then becomes a second phase for us in terms of improvement. We still see more from an operations point of view, but the technical stuff that Tony and the team have been working on, on energy, water, mining methods and step changes across the business I think are critical. And for those that have taken the time to dial into the future smart stuff can see how the thinking is starting to evolve across those areas. Again, marketing remains an important part of the business in helping us improve our returns or margins and driving the returns. And certainly, we've made great progress, and we could still see a lot more opportunities in terms of improvement.
On the return side, balance sheet flexibility is being restored. Stephen, I think, made a very important point about keeping our balance sheet flexible, so that we're always thinking about right place to put money to drive the business to improve performance. And what you tend to do if you let yourself get out of whack on the balance sheet is you then start making short-term decisions around what you should spend and what you shouldn't spend. We don't want to get back into that trap. So for us, very important. For us, the bad cash flow and returns absolutely critical. The syndication comment, we've been talking about syndication of major projects ever since we got ourselves in a position where we were building 5 major projects at the onetime, and we got caught in stressing the balance sheet. So I wanted to make the point, the lesson has been learned. We've studied the oil and gas business and other businesses and how they effectively manage a portfolio and risk on those major projects. So for us, the Quellaveco is very much about getting the syndication and our profile, right, because there are always things you don't know, you don't know that could touch in here. So I think, most importantly, we've taken the lessons of the industry in the last 5 years in particular, applying them, always learning, but we certainly see that the improvement in the operation reflects the focus on what we think are the critical issues. And if I make one final point and in many ways, it's the elevator test or the elevator message that I'd like to leave with you. In our business, we talk about 3 things in measuring whether we're doing the right thing for shareholders: Are we generating cash flow, free cash flow that supports the future development of the business and delivers real returns to shareholders? So it's about free cash flow. Secondly, how did you get that cash flow? And the best way to measure your efficiency in delivering those cash flows is your returns on capital. So that conversation from the first day, return on capital employed remains a mantra for us. Absolutely critical. Third point, how do you grow those cash flows? How do you improve the business? How do you make sure the business is sustainable? So safety, environment, the social development work you've got to do, people, the talent people you have, competitive costs and capital allocation. Absolutely the critical elements to make sure cash flow and returns are sustainable, and we can grow off the foundations we've created. That's how we're thinking. That's how we're approaching the business. Very happy to take questions with that.
Well, I'll start from the right and work across."

What we've got to do irrespective of what happens is make 15% or better return at these prices and lower, and that's what Chris and the guys are focused on.

So the guys have had to adjust their practices to the conditions they found, and they have reset and also did a lot of work on the equipment and changed their operating practices. And so we were averaging around 80,000 tonnes per week in the period up to that middle of June, Seamus? And then on a look-forward basis, the last 4 weeks, we're certainly north of 150,000, hitting closer to 200,000 tonnes a week, so that's 4 weeks. I wouldn't book that yet. I think there's still more learnings that the guys will pick up. The geotechnical conditions haven't improved markedly. I think the practices have improved, and I think that's important.

I think it'd be fair to say, Bruce, that what we found so far is that whilst the quality has been a little bit lower than we anticipated, the actual carats per tonne have been more than we thought. And therefore, the revenues per tonne have been on or better than anticipated in terms of the current mix. So we think that the news is fine with -- the production ramp ups, they're going very well, so they've had good few months. So I think you've always got to be a bit careful, particularly in the upper levels of the ore body. But the revenue per tonne is holding up okay, a little bit down on quality but better carat. So, so far, so good in terms of the revenue. But again, I think we just got to be a bit very careful. It's still very early Meeno. We're certainly not worried by what we've seen so far. It would be within the scope of what we'd expect. On Los Bronces, it is a tight pit. You're right. Duncan and the teams are working with a very tight pit room, and until we can get that further opened up, things will remain tight. I think the key with Los Bronces is to again establish that pit room and continue to work with CODELCO in finding the best way to work together across the pillar so that we both get a positive outcome. The relationship with CODELCO is very good, very open both ways. I think we've mended all the fences plus some, so I think it's a good relationship. The team has got a lot of work to do. So I think it's still going to be tied certainly for the balance of this year, and I think the key will be that relationship with CODELCO to get a bit more flexibly. On the positive side, we see a great improvement next year, which will be obviously a positive for the operation. But physically, it's -- we're working with more of a constraints space, okay?"

And our average truck hours are probably only a bit over 5,000 hours, where we would like to see truck hours across the organization pushing 6,000 on average. There's always some structural issues. So those basic numbers tell you that we still got 20% to 30% underlying productivity across the business that we want to chase. Clearly, we've picked and worked on the areas that we thought we could impact the quickest, but there's still a lot more stuff up across the portfolio. So I'd like to see that index hopped over 200 in the next couple of years, and so that'll give you sense of what we're going to try to achieve in terms of the people side. Energy improvements will continue. The real opportunity, I think, though is beyond the daily stuff, and it's in the technology. Tony, did want to say something about how you see technology framing up? And what sort of time frames are we looking at in improvement?"

Automation is only a small subset of our broader program, and we're really concentrating in 3 main areas. One is the ore body, getting much better tagging of the mineralogy and the properties of the ore body. And we're generally doing that now with hyperspectral imaging. So it's basically processes that will ultimately replace SA. If we don't flow that through into our processing plants, what we're really trying to do is become much more precise in the way we target the minerals entering our processing. We're working basically, taking this tagging and then working on flotation in particular, the way we cyclone cross-particle flotation. And I think a lot of the industry rules around flotation, and recoveries you actually get are about to be rewritten. An example of that is some of the new crushes we're developing with partners in Germany, break rock in a very different manner than we've ever been used to. It tends to break along the particle boundaries rather than just smash everything. And I think it'll actually set us up for very different chemical recoveries, and we'll see step changes coming out. So I found this much more interesting than the balance sheet. The day we get you guys into this head space, I actually thought made it. But we are putting quite a full presentation on our innovation out in Australia in a couple of weeks' time. So I think if you can pay some interest in that, you'll get a lot clearer idea of where we're going."

And then secondly for Stephen. Is an EBITDA margin business of 40% with the CapEx as low as it is right now and the balance sheet now at below 1x net debt-to-EBITDA, I guess, from a conceptual level as well, is there -- is it ever appropriate to run a business like this at net cash?

Obviously, debt costs are relatively low at this point in the cycle, so that don't provide a huge sort of shelter in any event. So yes, listen, I am really comfortable in taking the balance sheet debt down low. You'd be aware we still have a little bit of a split balance sheet to work through, so I wouldn't see that happening in a hurry in terms of getting to a net cash position. But we'll balance up, sort of feeding into your other questions to Mark, the number of projects that we're committing to, the amount of money that they commit to over periods of time, the balance sheet, the liquidity, and obviously absolute debt levels and the debt portfolio and maturity profile. So we'll piece all of those things together and how we're then setting up the capital structure for the company going forward."

The one thing that we believe in our diamond portfolio is we've got a great endowment that we haven't fully tested. So what can we do more at Orapa, Jwaneng longer term, Venetia? Gahcho Kué is still too early to make a call in the future. But those endowments are quite significant, and we haven't done a lot of testing beyond where we are today. The most significant one that we think is not working towards its potential is Orapa. And so Bruce is thinking very hard about how he can get more out of that in the right way and working with Tony and the team on stepping that out with incremental improvements in the operations. And so we've got a few of those. Some of those will take up a little longer. But certainly, we think that's where the big opportunities are around those major assets where we haven't really tested those endowments. Secondly, in copper. Collahuasi and Los Bronces both have lots of potential. Los Bronces is going to take a little more time, and I think will require some -- a little bit more flexibility around the mine as I talked to -- and certainly with our friends next door. If we can help each other, we'd be a bit more flexibility. There's an opportunity there. I think the technology stuff there in copper is really important. So we currently got our pilot plants operating on cross-flotation with crushing, cross-flotation and the dewatering so that we can materially reduce our water consumption, we'll reduce our energy probably 20%. Those opportunities in copper are quite significant. And the reason why they're important is water allows you to produce more because that's the scarce resource. There are 2 opportunities in Collahuasi and Los Bronces. I think it's around technology, and Tony and Duncan are teaming up in that work. In platinum, Chris's incremental options on Mogalakwena still look very good. If you remember, he put money aside to do debottlenecking to get to 400,000 ounces. He didn't need the money to get to 400,000. He's done a fantastic job with the team debottlenecking, just doing simple things smarter. He's still got some money there to do a little bit of sensible debottlenecking given it's $1,000 an ounce margin. It's a great place to be. He's already highlighted this week his intentions on Amandelbult to try and take $200 to $300 an ounce out. He's already building a chrome plant that he's got less than a 12-month payback risk on the delivery of the chrome plant. So lots of opportunity to do things smarter in platinum. I could talk about the Grosvenor debottlenecking with the processing plant. Let's make sure we get the asset running to potential. It was only going to operate 5 days a week. We can get it to 7 days so we're still going to work in the coal prep plant. That's a great incremental contribution to the business. You know about Minas-Rio going to its 26.5 million. Obviously, that's linked to the licensing process, and we think there are things we can do to get it to around 30 million tonnes at the right time with very small capital increment. So there's a whole raft of projects that we've got and we can see across the portfolio that are being nurtured through either innovation or basic technical changes that we think can deliver very good payback and very -- return to well above to the 15%. In terms of major projects, I think we made a comment 1 or 2 meetings ago, we prefer not to have one big project opened at any one time. You might be at the start or in the tail, so you will have some overlaps, but that's a preference. And in our case, clearly Quellaveco is the one that's moving towards a commitment, probably the earliest. But I think again, keeping the balance sheet in the right place, making sure you got a good balance of opportunities, I think, is the key to continually improving the business. And I think we've got a lot of those opportunities that we're still scratching at it in terms of where we go to from here. That's why Stephen is making it clear that $2.5 billion is the pitch number. There may be opportunities to do some really good stuff for a little bit more, make sure we've got the development balances right. We haven't starved the business, although we've made tough calls. What we want to make sure is we've got everybody balanced in the right place and we got the flexibility to be productive and get the productivity number over 200%."

I've said, and I think I've said this last time, we don't expect to land a longer-term position on South Africa this year because I think there'll be so much noise around the leadership debate that it'll be really difficult to get anyone to focus and align with us on the pieces going forward. So what we said is we like the assets we have. We're going to continue to improve them. And at some point, there'll be a dialogue on the positioning and approach on the way forward. I'm not sure where that will land. In the meantime, we like the businesses. The guys are doing a great job in restructuring. We're going to keep driving it and hopefully continue to generate cash and with Chris and the guys working hard in platinum. We'll continue to improve it. I think the other point that's really important is if you look at the U.S., they're still arguing about the election. There's nothing new in countries going through leadership debates, they have lots of noise. Unfortunately, South Africa tends to be more noisier than most given its 20 years into a constitution. So we knew they'd be noisy. It is noisy. It's unlikely we'll get someone on the other side post the electoral piece of the leadership piece, probably in November, Norman. And we'll continue doing the things we said we do. Okay."

There's no mention in the presentation really of the idea of core Anglo anymore. So would it be fair to assume that pursuing asset sales activity is no longer a priority for the management team? Related to that, how do we think about the South African bulks piece within the group? There have been praise articles in SA about Anglo potentially considering a partial exit or an exit of its South African bulks businesses. With no core Anglo in the presentation, should we assume that, that's not something that you're working on? Following on from that, is an exit or a partial exit or some kind of restructuring in SA dependent on the political outcome? Or can you do something in SA without having a more business-friendly leader of the ANC in place, if you want to call it that? And then the last point, can you do anything in SA until we get a resolution on the charter as it relates to transfers of mining rights? We know that there's been topics in the press about Anglo platinum maybe not being able to execute on asset sales as quickly as they'd like because of political interference?"

Look, thanks for that. Firstly, in terms of the business, what we've said is that the 37 assets that we have today are assets we'd be happy to operate for the longer term, generating cash, good returns that we can continue to recruiting businesses. So we don't have any active processes. But one thing I will say is that any business has to make sure that it's got the right portfolio. You're always considering your positions over time, and we've landed pretty closely to what we originally defined as the target portfolio back in 2014. Clearly, niobium and phosphates. It's the only material asset we would have liked to have kept. But at the end of the day, the price we got I think Philippe was fairly happy with what we delivered in terms of value. So no active processes, and we're not out there trying to sell. We're drawing the line, and we'll operate. But it doesn't mean we won't continue to improve and make some sales on the basis of improving the portfolio as we should proper capital managers. In terms of the SA bulks, as I've said, we like Kumba. The work the guys have done has been fantastic. We're happy to operate the asset. We remain open to where we go in the future. And that conversation, there's always one that we're in and we'll be in over the next 12 to 18 months, whatever it might be. But if nothing changes and we're happy to be where we are, that's where we'll be. I don't want to go any further than that because a bit hard speculating on what we don't know, and the politics will change over the next 12 months. Like all these things, politics is something you take into account, but it's not the only issue. There are a range of things that we'll take into account. So at this stage, we're open, we're operating, we're improving, and we'll make those decisions probably during the course of '18 as you would expect we would in making sure that we've got the portfolio right. Politics, yes, it will make a difference but not to the extent that it's the only factor. There a range of factors and in every country we operate. We take a whole range of factors into account in making decisions to allocate capital. So it ultimately comes down to our capital allocation and delivery returns. If we can make money, if we can operate, then we're happy to be there. So they're really the key points. We've doubled the work, we've improved the business, we still got a way to go. Every jurisdiction remains under scrutiny. Every dollar we spend in capital remains important, including South African dollars. Okay?"

We understand now that deleveraging is still business in progress, so your goal into reducing down debt further.

Do you have any number in mind in terms of your leverage versus your through the cycle profitability in terms of [indiscernible] of gearing or whatever where you want to be? Second question. You currently have a quite significant net cash in South Africa, I think. You have had it for some time. Now it's especially big. And this big net debt -- sorry, net cash, looks especially noticeable in the context of increased political risks. I understand that it helps to balance out net debt for the group. But ultimately, the only thing you can do with this cash is pay it out as dividends, right? So why it's still sitting there? And second question is actually about diamond market outlook. The rough diamond market had been performing reasonably well or even pretty well, which stands I think in contrast with somewhat unimpressive performance in the Polish market with prices stagnating and very mixed signals in terms of demand from jewelry and midstream. What do you see here in terms of outlook for the second half, in terms of outlook for 2018? Is there a risk that the situation in the rough diamond market could deteriorate sharply as it -- or you haven't before with diamonds? Or you think it's just not on the cards?"

So debt dividends in South Australian cash as opposed -- they're all sort of linked as the question was there. So now not changing our long-term targets at this point in terms of the sort of stated target we've had in terms of debt-to-EBITDA ratio. So 1x to 1.5x through the cycle. That doesn't mean, though, where we have periods of higher prices, we should be really right towards the low end or below the low end so that when you do get back to long-term cyclical prices, you're back in that range. And that's just where we happen to be in the journey at the moment. So I'm going to make much of it over the next 18 months, particularly in terms of getting that as low as we possibly can. You touched on the sort of the split balance sheet. So while the 0.8 looks very attractive from a rest of the world point of view, we're below 2. But still, on a long-term price scenario, that would probably create back towards 2, and we'd like to be below 2 from a rest of the world point of view. So we're just nicely, neatly in that range at the moment. The South African cash has built up partly because of the operations in the pricing particularly on bulks but also because we suspended the dividend. And so what you'll see even in this half as some -- so I think Kumba's dividend was about USD 500 million equivalent, just over half of that effectively close to us. Half of that will flow to minorities. And so you'll see a little bit of a self-correction of that, particularly as we continue the payout ratio journey in the 6-month periods ahead. So we're not rushing out to do anything other than run the business as usual, and you'll see some of those things sort of correct themselves over time."

It does self-correct a lot quicker than people probably realize, so it's just a matter of correcting over time. But again, there are all considerations we think about in terms of the long-term portfolio mix. On diamonds, Bruce, I'm not going to ask him to say a word because he's in the middle of the site as we speak. So we're always a bit cautious in making any comments about the market. If I could just go back to what we've said in the last couple of months. The U.S. has been a great place. It's a little noisy at the moment, I think, on a general economic perspective. And as a consequence, diamonds may or may not be impacted by that. China has been pretty good. I think we've just got to remain cautious. I think we said this year will be about clearing our stock. We did that pretty fairly successfully early in the year. And we're just going to continue to take a careful approach with the way we price our products, taking very careful notice of the Sightholders feedback. We're in the middle of that process. So my comment goes back among cautious, careful. We want to make sure that we're matching our sales to what -- that's what appropriate in the market."

The second thing is, again, I'm slightly confused around sort of the -- what you're talking about in terms of cost savings.

In fact, in the coal business, we've been flat for 4 years now. So that remains our objective, particularly in high-inflation environments, to be able to do better than the local inflation rate. So that remains our objective. It's never linear or without a few bumps. So what we're saying is we've picked, I think, the lower-hanging fruit. We've made some really hard changes with the processes we put in place. The operating model actually drives a continuous improvement. So we want to continue to do that and see if we can keep ahead of inflation plus some, and that's a sort of probably a good guideline for how we're thinking about delivering cost and volume improvement because they do come hand-in-hand. So that's where we are. So looking to do better than inflation across any of our jurisdictions is probably the sort of guide that we're looking to achieve or better. And to get to that 170 to 200 requires us to -- that would help us deliver that number over the next 2 years. That gives you a guide."

And I think again, particularly in platinum in the processing facility, that does take a while to flow itself through. Offsetting that, we had some positive working capital moves in diamonds. Their stock levels are probably a little bit lower given the sales they had in the first half, and we might rebuild that a little bit in the second. So a number of moving parts.

I think it's a great competitive discipline internally as well in terms of how we think about cash allocation and whether it's to shareholders, to dividends or to capital projects. Now in time, we'll have a look at various forms of returns to shareholders. Right now, I think a simple dividend suits us well, and we'll look at those options. How are we going to evaluate it? It'll depend a little bit the phase you're in, the capital projects and the growth opportunities that may come through that pipeline. So it's hard to give you a hard and fast rule. Ultimately, the theory is grand, and everyone has got a similar slide. It's how you then apply that it over time and how you demonstrate that discipline.
