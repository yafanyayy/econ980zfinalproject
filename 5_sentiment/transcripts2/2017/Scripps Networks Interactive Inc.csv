Simply put, 2016 was a remarkable year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Our strong networks and content have never been in more demand for accessible over a variety of distribution platforms, devices or in more geographies than they are today. We're the leading lifestyle content company in the world, and it shows in our financial performance. 
For a quick recap. In 2016, we reported record revenue, which increased 13% to $3.4 billion. Our consolidated advertising revenue increased 17% to $2.4 billion. In U.S. networks advertising revenue increased nearly 10%, surpassing $2 billion for the first time ever. We also reported adjusted segment profit of $1.4 billion, reaching a new milestone. Let me just say that this stand out performance is a direct result of our relentless focus on operational execution and the deliberate investments that we've made in content and our international businesses and at Scripps Lifestyle Studios. 
Our success wouldn't be possible without our incredibly employees around the world, and I want to thank them for dedication, their collaboration and creative spirit that they bring to the forefront every day. You know in the swiftly transforming and competitive media landscape, its strong brands built on appealing content that win. That's why we stick with our simple but highly effective game plan, that is: first, to strengthen and grow our core business; second, to expand our reach to new markets and emerging platform; and third, to maximize monetization with our advertising and distribution partners. 
We're building the foundation for our future by continually investing in our brands and content to make them even stronger. We already delivered the best lifestyle content across multiple platforms and geographies and we're building reach and engagement every single day. This shows that we air around the globe are consistent, relevant, family-friendly, and they promotes co-viewing where families engage in our content together. At the time when some networks are rebranded, reimaged or realigned to meet consumer's changing preferences, we stay true to the content that has made us a world-renowned producer of quality lifestyle content. Our focus has always been to create and own compelling lifestyle content for home, food and travel enthusiasts. The result is our brands have one of the most loyal and consistent viewer bases in the media industry. 
Our strategy to strengthen our brands is working. In 2016, all 6 of our U.S. networks were up in total day in the C-3 viewing window, the key metric for our advertisers. I'm proud that our family of networks was the only U.S. media group to have all of its networks improve in this time slot. And some other past years, the vast majority of our C-3 viewing was life. For powerhouse brand, HGTV, 2016 was its highest-rated and most-watched year ever, surpassing last year's record-breaking ratings by 6%. HGTV finished the year ranked third among all cable networks for adults 18-plus, the highest-ranking for this audience and network history.
Leveraging on our long-standing commitment to developing and owning all of our content regardless of platform, our second strategic building block is to expand our reach to new markets on emerging platforms. These results are demonstration that we're delivering on that commitment with higher demand than ever for our unique lifestyle content. Internationally, we're reaching new audiences and connecting them with our core brands. 
At TVN in Poland, we are clearly delivering the content that consumers crave. When we purchased TVN in 2015, it was already a leading media company with talented employees and highly regarded and very experienced leadership team. But with the infusion of our lifestyle formats over the last several quarters, we've been able to create even greater value at TVN than before. We're also leveraging TVN's production capabilities to create value in our U.S. networks business with Kathleen Finch working with the Polish production teams, the commission of lower cost and high-quality long and short form content in the United States and there are lots more opportunities to come there in the future. 
In January of this year, we successfully launched HGTV in Poland. Now in the early weeks of its launch, HGTV's ratings continue to exceed even our own high expectations. The network is already the #2 lifestyle network in Poland, just behind our on TVN style. And we believe HGTV Poland is destined for major long-term success. This launch was a key milestone in our international business. The first full HGTV launch in Europe and our largest HGTV international launch to date. I want to congratulate the entire international and TVN teams who worked tirelessly to make this happen. 
Earlier this month, we announced a long-term commercial partnership with German broadcaster, to launch branded programming blocks beginning this spring. This agreement brings HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel and DIY Network to millions of viewers in Europe. We're excited to bring our lifestyle brands who a previously untapped audience to expand our footprint into one of Europe's most dynamic markets. We'll continue to look for opportunities to grow our portfolio of strong brands and networks outside the United States. 
Now in addition to new markets, we're striving to ensure that we take full advantage of newer platforms to reach audiences. We're once this business was a linear network company. We're now a fully fledged lifestyle content company that leverages video across all platforms. We always want to deliver high-quality, multi format content, and integrate advertising into our storytelling and digital content provides a great opportunity to do that. 
Since its launch in 2015, Scripps Lifestyle Studios focused on increasing social media and online engagement as a meaningful contributor to our growing digital businesses. Burton is going to share some of the results coming out of the Scripps Lifestyle Studios shortly. However, monetizing our content on digital platforms is not just a strategic priority for the future, but something we're delivering on today. Our agility and our ownership of our own content makes as uniquely positioned among media companies to seize that opportunity. 
The engaging brands that we bring to life and televisions, on computers, on phones or tablets, are unlike any other. Whether we interact with audiences on the television screen or through mobile or social platforms, we're committed to providing the right content to the right audience at the right time. 
Finally, among our strategic pillars. We remain strongly focus on building deeper, more valuable partnerships our advertisers and distributors. As I said earlier, content is the key to our success. Creating great content is the best method to accumulate and monetize sustainable returns. Importantly, because we own our own content, we can more effectively utilize our programming across all platforms, a tremendous value proposition to our advertising and distribution partners. 
For advertisers, our content delivers enough scale in highly engaged audience. We work closely with our advertising partners to provide an effective, economical and reliable way for their messaging to reach their customers. Our viewers are engaged even during commercials. They're watching live constantly. This is a clear distinction of how we've been able to outpace the industry for advertising revenue growth. 
For our distributors. Well, we deliver clear value both on price and popularity. Our viewing audience is loyal and they look for our strong networks in their programming packages. The record results that we reported today underscore the strength of our strategy and content. We continue to be focused on delivering sustainable long-term growth, driven by the strength of our inspiring brands and content and growing our reach across different platform and geographies. I know we have the right strategic priorities and team to continue increasing shareholder value and returns. 
2016 was a great year. And Lori is going to provide some details on our full year outlook in a few minutes, which will underscore why I'm so confident that 2017 will be another strong year of sustainable growth. I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive. 
Now let me turn it over to Burton who will share some details on our operating results. Burton?"

Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our networks delivered some notable achievements last year, including 3 of our U.S. networks: HGTV, DIY Network and Cooking Channel had their best ratings performance in network history. And for the 10th",841,"All right. Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our networks delivered some notable achievements last year, including 3 of our U.S. networks: HGTV, DIY Network and Cooking Channel had their best ratings performance in network history. And for the 10th consecutive year, HGTV was the #1 cable network among upscale women. The fact that we resonate so well with upscale audiences is a key differentiation for our networks. Advertisers want to reach female, household decision-makers and our brands deliver that audience better than anyone in cable. 
Our rating success in 2016 wasn't limited to the U.S. as TVN posted the highest ratings improvement of the big 3 media groups in Poland. And we continue to expand our brands into new markets around the world where we're seeing some good results. We ended 2016 with a strong fourth quarter performance. HGTV tied 2015 to deliver its best fourth quarter ever for adult sales prime ratings, driven by premiers of hit shows like Fixer Upper, Brothers Take New Orleans and Beachfront Bargain Hunt, HGTV led the way for engaging and entertaining lifestyle programming. 
We saw a positive ratings traction at Food Network in December with sales prime ratings increasing 2% for adults and 4% for women. Shows such as Holiday Baking Championship and Cake Wars Christmas, helped drive that improvement. To follow that up. In January, Food Network posted ratings gains for women 25 to 54, marking the network's highest delivery for that key demographic since August 2014. 
Travel Channel continues to deliver positive results, benefiting from our recent programming investments. Ratings improved for women 25 to 54 for the fourth consecutive quarter. Travel Channel also grew its ratings 14% for the important millennial demographic compared to the previous quarter. Popular shows like Expedition Unknown, is our foods delicious destinations and Mysteries at the Museum are some of Travel Channel programming highlights. Travel Channel's programming, which takes its inspiration from virtual and active travelers and their passion for travel, continues to make consistent progress and we're pleased with its performance in 2016. 
At DIY Network, the fourth quarter mark the network's fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings increased 11% for adults 25 to 54 and 27% for women 25 to 54 versus a year ago. Cooking Channel once again delivered its highest-rated and most-watched quarter in the network's history for sales prime among both adults and women 25 to 54. Impressions delivery also was up at Cooking Channel, improving 17% versus prior year. 
And a Great American Country, the fourth quarter marked the network's fourth consecutive quarter for double digit growth with ratings up 42% and impressions up 35%. 
Consistent with our strategy to expand the availability of our content, Scripps Lifestyle Studios has worked diligently to ensure that we're reaching viewers on the digital platforms that they love. In the fourth quarter, Scripps Lifestyle Studios achieved approximately 2.4 billion video views across all-digital platforms. These include our owned and operated websites, social media networks like Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and Pinterest, as well as TV Everywhere apps. On average, we had 790 million video views each month in the fourth quarter, representing an 89% improvement over the third quarter of 2016. 
For the entire year, Scripps Lifestyle Studios delivered more than 5 billion total video views, surpassing 2015 video views by nearly 700%. Overall, Scripps Lifestyle Studios produced about 5,000 new content videos, and that's equivalent to approximately 125 programming hours. 
While a good portion of this growth came from our social media platforms, TV Everywhere also experienced significant growth in 2016. Growth, which has continued into 2017. In January alone, visitors were up 22% from December, hitting 2 million for the month. And 2017 is off to a good start for the entire Scripps Lifestyle Studios team as there were 805 million video views across all digital platforms in January, and that's up 6% from December. 
Now turning to our international networks. We had some notable achievements in the last several months. At TVN, the network group delivered another successful quarter with audience levels and ratings continuing to grow. In the fourth quarter, ratings for TVN group improved 5% in the key 16 to 49 commercial audience. You've heard us talk about how we plan to utilize TVN's premier production facilities to develop some of our original formats. 
During the quarter, a TVN-produced episode of House Hunters International aired in the U.S. resulting in a pickup of future episodes to be produced through the TVN Studios. And as Ken mentioned, TVN is a valuable partner for producing cost-effective digital content as well. UKTV experienced record breaking growth in commercial audience is 27 -- '16 [ph] as their share of commercial impact were 8% [ph] against record growth in 2015. 2016 really was a great year for our company and 2017 is off to a good start. We're optimistic about the opportunities available for our lifestyle content both in the U.S. and around the world. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance."
6469353,416183195,1137385,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2017",2017-02-21,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Since Ken already reviewed our record full year results, I'll focus my comments on the quarterly consolidated numbers, discuss our operating segment performance as well as provide guidance for 2017 and then open",1167,"Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Since Ken already reviewed our record full year results, I'll focus my comments on the quarterly consolidated numbers, discuss our operating segment performance as well as provide guidance for 2017 and then open it up for your Q&A.
Consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter increased 4% to $889 million. This increase was driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with overall ratings and impressions growth as well as growth in our international business. The revenue growth, along with a slight increase in programming expense, growth consolidated adjusted segment profit up 3%. Our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased to $1.02 compared with $1.35 in the prior year. This was largely due to: gainful foreign currency transactions in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with losses in 2016, and favorable tax settlements in 2015 compared with unfavorable ones this year. In total, the EPS impact from the year-over-year swings in foreign currency and tax settlements was $0.51 per diluted share. 
Also, excluded from our fourth quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share, but included in our reported earnings per share number was a $0.54 per share noncash goodwill and related intangible asset write-down. These are related to the international acquisitions of TCI and the Asian Food Channel. Also, impacting the number was a $0.07 per share noncash investment write-down. 
Now looking at our operating segments. Our U.S. networks revenue increased 4%. This improvement was driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle networks, partially offset by the expected and temporary decline in distribution revenue. Advertising revenues increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, due to CPM pricing increases combined with ratings improvement. Center pricing was stronger during the quarter with CPM up high teen [ph] year-over-year and up mid to high 20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were retail, food, consumer packaged goods, auto and pharma. These categories are consistent with historical performance for the fourth quarter. However, the order is slightly different with food coming in at #2 due to the strength seen in retail. 
The strength in scatter combined has continued into the first quarter of 2017, scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing is up mid- to high-teens year-over-year and up low- to mid-20s over the broadcast upfront. Another positive data point for the current year is ours recently completed 2017 calendar upfront. We realized a double-digit CPM growth rate, consistent with the rate increases we generated in the broadcast upfront. And we sold a similar amount of inventory compared with 2015. Distribution revenues for the U.S. networks decreased 3%, contributing to this expected decrease was the previously reported rate equalization impacting 2016, industry subscriber decline and our strategic decision not to renew certain SVOD agreements during the year. These declines were partially offset by negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top and non-linear distribution platform. 
As a result of the increase in revenues, coupled with strong cost control, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. networks increased 5% compared with the prior year quarter. For the international segment. The majority of the revenues are generated by TVN. In local currency, the revenues increased 3% compared with the same time a year ago. This was negatively impacted by the soft ad market in the fourth quarter. On a reported basis. International networks revenue increased 2% to $165 million. International adjusted segment profit increased 2% to $41 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of FX, segment profit would have more than doubled from the prior year quarter. 
In addition to our international consolidated international business, significant portion of our international business is recorded in equity income. These investments include: UKTV, Food Network, HGTV and DIY Network in Canada and some TVN minority investments. These international properties now comprise a majority of our equity income and in total, equity and earnings of affiliates of $16 million, up from $11 million in the prior year. On the balance sheet. I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the fourth quarter had approximately 2.6x gross leverage, down from 2.8x at the end of last quarter and down to 3.2x at the end of 2015. 
Additionally in the fourth quarter, we retired the last of TVN's high interest-bearing debt. As we look at 2017, we expect to realize a significant reduction in interest expense, which I'll cover in the guidance. Also, last week, we announced for the seventh consecutive year, an increase in our dividends raising at 20% to $1.20 per share annually. 
Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, including programming, reduce our leverage and invest strategically through M&A both domestically and internationally. We'll also continue to evaluate the opportunity to repurchase our shares under the existing board authorize programs, which has 1.5 billion remaining. 
And finally, before opening it up for questions, I will provide our full year 2017 guidance. [indiscernible][indiscernible]  All guidance is based on total company adjusted results. As a result of the healthy demand for our networks in viewers and advertisers alike both in the U.S. and internationally, we expect 2017 revenue growth to be approximately 6%. Additionally, within its anticipated revenue growth, we expect to generate positive distribution revenue growth beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and we expect the distribution revenue rate -- growth rate will increase during the year. 
On the expense side. The cost services rate of growth is expected to moderate and be in the mid-single digit level for the full year. However, based on current premier schedules in terms of quarterly pacing, we should realize high single-digit percentage growth in the first half of the year and the slowdown in the second half. 
For SG&A expenses and consistent with our long-term strategic focus to deliver content that is consumed on a variety of platforms, devices, and distribution platforms, we plan to invest an incremental $30 million to $40 million in various growth initiatives. These include short form, mogul and millennial-focused content for digital platform, related marketing programs, technology and data collection and analytics. As a result of our anticipated revenue growth, partially offset by increasing support costs, we expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 3%. Excluding the incremental investment of future growth, we would expect adjusted segment profit increased approximately 6% for 2017 and consistent with our revenue growth. 
We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $155 million to $160 million. This includes purchase price amortization, which we will include for the full year reported numbers going forward. We expect interest expense to be approximately $100 million. And finally, we expect our tax rate to be in the 30% to 32% range for the year. Overall, we expect to deliver strong growth in 2017 as we continue to make important investment and high-quality content, data and multi-platform opportunity. And with that, we will open up the call for your questions."

I don't want to use -- I don't necessarily want to classify it as an escape in this day and age, beautiful homes, beautiful food, beautiful travel locations. There's a certain elegance to the simplicity of what we do. Having said that, what's really been beneficial to us as the evolution of different platforms and different opportunities have come along, they're bringing us new ways to utilize our content. And honestly, when Burton and folks like I, were sitting around and thinking about these network and brands 20 years ago, we didn't necessarily realize it we'd be able to recycle this content in so many different ways. And that's brought as new revenue opportunities. Now having said all of that, it's much harder to do than it looks. And I give Burton and Kathleen Finch and all of the people in the content side both linear and digital, and Jim on the international side a lot of credit with focus and consistency. And then I think it helps that we've had a good track record with our advertisers. They know that when they give us their valuable advertising dollars, they're going to get results. And I think the same in our distribution partners. So a little bit of a long-winded answer, but it gives me just a chance to talk about, I think, why we have had consistent revenue and audience ratings delivery that we've had. And as you heard from Lori and Burton, we're expecting that again in 2017."

And then if there are tier on their services for their digital networks around those peers. We're talking to everybody else who's consider launching a virtual MVPD. And our thoughts on this is that really, the dynamics should be consistent with viewing on regular MVPDs. The live nature of our content and the viewing of our content is really no accident. We program our networks so that once you tune in, there's a similarity in the kinds of programs that you see, that makes it almost like on-demand, except that you don't have to do any work. You sit back and just watch the shows that will over you and you enjoy them as Ken said in his previous answer. That dynamic continuous in virtual MVPD platforms. And no matter what the size of the bundle is, and in terms of scripted entertainment versus what we do, there's a lot of scripted entertainment out there. There is really a more focused amount of really high-quality lifestyle content in categories, home, food and travel. And we're the place to go for that. So we think we are in a very good position when it comes to any kinds of virtual MVPDs or smaller packages. Remember, we are essentially a skinny bundle already. We're a bundle of lifestyle networks that work well together. And that's why we've been getting distribution on all these virtual MVPDs that have been announced."

One, just given the weak a little bit. When you reported last quarter and indicate the -- I think it was high-teens to mid-20s scatter pricing, it improved when you look at the high 20s that you [indiscernible] this quarter. So since you reported November, December must have improved quite a bit. And then I look at the scatter pricing over the upfront. This quarter and I think, what low to mid 20s. So it seems that it improved a bit November, December and it's come down a bit obviously, strong numbers throughout. But does that really makes sense? Is there any story to tell behind the ebbs and flows of the scatter market?"

So I think it ebbs and flows regardless of what you do. But I think we continue to sell those high rates and it's nice to have that layer of upfront in there, an underlying foundation for that. So I don't know if there's much to read into it, Doug, except that it continues to be strong. Another point I can look at is our options on the cancellations on our options are like practically nil or very consistent with past years, very low. So again that tells you the strength of our brand and for advertisers willing to spend their dollars with us."

And so when we're looking at these incremental investments, we see a real upside now that I think we have more confidence than probably ever before and the Scripps Lifestyle Studios is a very good example. So I view this really as investing in what we're already seeing and the experience from what advertisers are expecting. And that's not only more credibility in the results. And I also mean in data collection and in ratings. But also on the digital side as we're packaging whether its dream home giveaway, whether it's 30 and 60 second spots with social media combined with mobile media, a need to continue to invest and put some money on the table. I mean, if you look at the overall, Doug, say, you can -- why not more? Why just $30 million or $40 million? And I think it's now, Doug, to the point at our maturation where we're very comfortable with this kind of money each year, is a good investment in the future of a multi-platform kind of delivery system. And it -- we don't have all the answers yet. I don't think anybody does. But what we're seeing is we collect more data, we get more information, more upside.

So this initial data investment is a way to be able to get our arms around it. In terms of the creation of short-form digital content. We make the vast majority of that in-house very inexpensively. So a relatively small amount of dollars goes a very long way in creating some hundreds and hundreds of assets. So I think what we're doing is being very good about capitalizing on the success that we've seen over the last year with our Scripps Lifestyle Studios. But doing it in a measured way. And I expect that we'll continue to see this investment. But we also expect to see some payoff from it in terms of continued growth in digital advertising dollars."

In addition, after day 3, we do dynamic ad insertion in our own TV Everywhere apps and obviously, in our own owned and operated websites and social media platforms. That all gets measured because we have all the data from those platforms.

To your point, I mean, we now feel like were, I think in very good shape because of the growth that we've seen in millennials in all of our categories, and of course, this is coming predominantly from social media. But you've heard me refer to this before. There's a certain lifestyle change. I don't want to say it's 30 years of age. But let's talk about the home category. We're seeing engagement among millennials who, as they age over the past several years, have grown into our linear television viewing. What's been interesting about that, Mike, is they have continued to use social media and engagement in a way that our traditional audience in the past hasn't. So it's a new type of viewer coming in. And to Vasilys question earlier about life viewing, what we're finding in nonfiction viewing, there's a lot more engagement. There's a lot more of live -- did you see this? Which home do you think they're going to choose? By the way, on Chopped, I know they're going to -- this is the missing ingredient, whereas scripted, there's less of an opportunity while the actual show is going on to interact. So I think in the next 2 years, in your time window, we're going to see more emphasis on the engagement part of it, more on the information part of it. Are you watching the show? What are you -- where do they get that particular sink in the kitchen? Where did this come from? Dream Home Giveaway, which we just wrapped up, which will be another record-breaking Dream Home no doubt as far as entries and level of participation. This is something we've seen grow year, after year, after year. And that's the amount of information that people are taking out of these shows. So I think if you look out 2 years, I'm very encouraged about where we're positioned and how we're taking our content to these new platforms and how consumers are going to use it. It gets back to, we just got to be there when they're there. Because if not, another brand or another entity might. So it's hard to just run to stay in place, if you will. But that's kind of the next 2 years. It's doing what we're doing and then making sure these new consumers and new viewers are really getting the experience, if you will, from our content that they're expecting."

You also disclosed 150 million approximately digital revenues, I don't know if those map exactly, but if they do, it was about a $30 CPM, if I'm asked right, which seems to make sense. But you also said 800 or so billion -- million impressions delivered in January. So if I were to annualize that, that's up like double over the year and that's the run rate stays where it is. So I think about that right in terms of how revenue might grow just from those couple of facts and figures on the digital side? And then Lori, the sort of related follow-up is obviously, that maps to some degree to the $30 million or $40 million you've been talking about. But just more broadly, for talking about doubling impressions, how does that scale in terms of is that more content required to drive those extra impressions? Is there growth in sort of more unique viewers? How do you double impressions like that from the investment side?"

And the reason is because our digital ad revenue isn't all video revenue. We still get a substantial portion of our digital ad revenue from display advertising from our websites and the mobile access to those websites. So your math can't be calculated quite the way you did. That said, the reason we're doing so much investing in terms of time, energy and resources into digital video is because of the tremendous growth that we're seeing in the audience consumption of it and the advertiser demand. So over time, we do see a shift to more of our ad revenue on the digital side coming from those video ad impressions and a smaller percentages coming from display. And I think, Todd, that would be true across the industry. So that's what we're setting ourselves up for. And then in terms of just the number of impressions. This is a really interesting process that our Scripps Lifestyle Studios is engaged in and has been for the year or so that we've been actively involved in this. It is not necessarily true that we have to make ever more hundreds and hundreds of digital videos every month. And the reason for that is, our goal is to create a dynamic where our audiences share those videos to a much -- at a much higher rate. So that actually over time, we may be able to get more and more views with fewer videos as we learn the ones that drive the most sharing. So that's what we're in the process of doing. And we like where we are right now with 300 to 400 new digital videos a month, driving these kinds of impressions. But I'm not sure it'll always stay that way. We're in the learning process right now. So I hope it gives some greater color to what we're trying to do here and the learning process that's underway. Lori?"

We continue to look at opportunities internationally to expand our brands. And we look at those opportunities as they arise. And then I would say, more bolt-on around the digital space, millennial space on the domestic and international front. So those continue to be opportunities again, I think valuations became problematic, but that doesn't mean we don't invest. And of course, we do, do some investing in early-stage companies to participate in that way. As far as credit ratings, we like investment-grade. So we continue to monitor that. I think if you look, if you listen to the comments, we're getting -- we're delevering. We're getting into that comfortable range that gives us a lot more flexibility to be opportunistic when it comes to M&A. And also do some organic growth through the P&L. So again, I think our debt levels are getting in a very comfortable range and we will continue to look at opportunities even returning it to shareholders over time. But I would say our priority of course, is always looking for things that actually produce growth and returns over the long-term versus the short-term."

It's fairly comparable with last year. So in our guidance right now, I would say FX-comparable with last year. But if that changes, we'll have a negative or positive impact on our earnings depending on which way the FX goes. I think, if I recall correctly, FX might be a little -- might be a little more expensive versus -- well, less expensive than the dollar than it was last year, but not substantially different."

The best example that we've had in the last few years was House Hunters, which we went from regular sort of order 200s of them every year because we certainly reap the benefits of that programming investment in increased advertising revenue. That's doesn't come along very often. So I would say basically the number of hours we're at is about where we're going to be."

Thank you, Dylan, and good morning, everyone. Very happy that you're able to be with us today. Simply put, 2016 was a remarkable year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Our strong networks and content have never been in more demand or accessible",1357,"All right. Thank you, Dylan, and good morning, everyone. Very happy that you're able to be with us today. Simply put, 2016 was a remarkable year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Our strong networks and content have never been in more demand or accessible over a variety of distribution platforms, devices or in more geographies than they are today. We're the leading lifestyle content company in the world, and it shows in our financial performance.
For a quick recap, in 2016, we reported record revenue, which increased 13% to $3.4 billion. Our consolidated advertising revenue increased 17% to $2.4 billion. And U.S. networks advertising revenue increased nearly 10%, surpassing $2 billion for the first time ever. We also reported adjusted segment profit of $1.4 billion, reaching a new milestone. Let me just say that this standout performance is a direct result of our relentless focus on operational execution and the deliberate investments that we've made in content, in our international businesses and at Scripps Lifestyle Studios.
Our success wouldn't be possible without our incredible employees around the world, and I want to thank them for their dedication, their collaboration and creative spirit that they bring to the forefront every day. In the swiftly transforming and competitive media landscape, its strong brands built on appealing content that win. That's why we stick with our simple but highly effective game plan, that is: first, to strengthen and grow our core business; second, to expand our reach to new markets and emerging platforms; and third, to maximize monetization with our advertising and distribution partners.
We're building the foundation for our future by continually investing in our brands and content to make them even stronger. We already delivered the best lifestyle content across multiple platforms and geographies, and we're building reach and engagement every single day. This shows that we air around the globe are consistent, relevant, family-friendly, and they promote co-viewing where families engage in our content together. At a time when some networks are rebranded, reimaged or realigned to meet consumers' changing preferences, we stay true to the content that has made us a world-renowned producer of quality lifestyle content. Our focus has always been to create and own compelling lifestyle content for home, food and travel enthusiasts. The result is our brands have one of the most loyal and consistent viewer bases in the media industry.
Our strategy to strengthen our brands is working. In 2016, all 6 of our U.S. networks were up in total day in the C3 viewing window, the key metric for our advertisers. I'm proud that our family of networks was the only U.S. media group to have all of its networks improve in this time slot. And some other past years, the vast majority of our C3 viewing was live. For powerhouse brand, HGTV, 2016 was its highest-rated and most-watched year ever, surpassing last year's record-breaking ratings by 6%. HGTV finished the year ranked third among all cable networks for adults 18-plus, the highest-ranking for this audience and network history.
Leveraging on our long-standing commitment to developing and owning all of our content regardless of platform, our second strategic building block is to expand our reach to new markets on emerging platforms. These results are a demonstration that we're delivering on that commitment with higher demand than ever for our unique lifestyle content. Internationally, we're reaching new audiences and connecting them with our core brands.
At TVN in Poland, we are clearly delivering the content that consumers crave. When we purchased TVN in 2015, it was already a leading media company with talented employees in a highly regarded and very experienced leadership team. But with the infusion of our lifestyle formats over the last several quarters, we've been able to create even greater value at TVN than before. We're also leveraging TVN's production capabilities to create value in our U.S. networks business, with Kathleen Finch working with the Polish production teams, the commission of lower cost and high-quality long and short form content in the United States, and there are lots more opportunities to come there in the future.
In January of this year, we successfully launched HGTV in Poland. Now in the early weeks of its launch, HGTV's ratings continue to exceed even our own high expectations. The network is already the #2 lifestyle network in Poland, just behind our own TVN style. And we believe HGTV Poland is destined for major long-term success. This launch was a key milestone in our international business, the first full HGTV launch in Europe and our largest HGTV international launch to date. I want to congratulate the entire international and TVN teams who worked tirelessly to make this happen.
Earlier this month, we announced a long-term commercial partnership with German broadcaster, ProSieben, to launch branded programming blocks beginning this spring. This agreement brings HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel and DIY Network to millions of new viewers in Europe. We're excited to bring our lifestyle brands to a previously untapped audience and expand our footprint into one of Europe's most dynamic markets. We'll continue to look for opportunities to grow our portfolio of strong brands and networks outside the United States.
Now in addition to new markets, we're striving to ensure that we take full advantage of newer platforms to reach audiences. We're once this business who was a linear network company. We're now a fully fledged lifestyle content company that leverages video across all platforms. We always want to deliver high-quality, multi-format content and integrate advertising into our storytelling, and digital content provides a great opportunity to do that.
Since its launch in 2015, Scripps Lifestyle Studios focused on increasing social media and online engagement as a meaningful contributor to our growing digital businesses. Burton is going to share some of the results coming out of the Scripps Lifestyle Studios shortly. However, monetizing our content on digital platforms is not just a strategic priority for the future but something we're delivering on today. Our agility and our ownership of our own content makes us uniquely positioned among media companies to seize that opportunity.
The engaging brands that we bring to life on televisions, on computers, on phones or tablets are unlike any other. Whether we interact with audiences on the television screen or through mobile or social platforms, we're committed to providing the right content to the right audience at the right time.
Finally, among our strategic pillars. We remain strongly focused on building deeper, more valuable partnerships with our advertisers and distributors. As I said earlier, content is the key to our success. Creating great content is the best method to accumulate and monetize sustainable returns. Importantly, because we own our own content, we can more effectively utilize our programming across all platforms, a tremendous value proposition to our advertising and distribution partners.
For advertisers, our content delivers enough scale in highly engaged audience. We work closely with our advertising partners to provide an effective, economical and reliable way for their messaging to reach their customers. Our viewers are engaged even during commercials. They're watching live constantly. This is a clear distinction of how we've been able to outpace the industry for advertising revenue growth.
For our distributors, well, we deliver clear value, both on price and popularity. Our viewing audience is loyal, and they look for our strong networks in their programming packages. The record results that we reported today underscore the strength of our strategy and content. We continue to be focused on delivering sustainable long-term growth driven by the strength of our inspiring brands and content and growing our reach across different platforms and geographies. I know we have the right strategic priorities and team to continue increasing shareholder value and returns.
2016 was a great year. And Lori is going to provide some details on our full year outlook in a few minutes, which will underscore why I'm so confident that 2017 will be another strong year of sustainable growth. I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.
Now let me turn it over to Burton who will share some details on our operating results. Burton?"

Our networks delivered some notable achievements last year, including 3 of our U.S. networks: HGTV, DIY Network and Cooking Channel had their best ratings performance in network history. And for the 10th",838,"All right. Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our networks delivered some notable achievements last year, including 3 of our U.S. networks: HGTV, DIY Network and Cooking Channel had their best ratings performance in network history. And for the 10th consecutive year, HGTV was the #1 cable network among upscale women. The fact that we resonate so well with upscale audiences is a key differentiation for our networks. Advertisers want to reach female household decision-makers, and our brands deliver that audience better than anyone in cable.
Our ratings success in 2016 wasn't limited to the U.S. as TVN posted the highest ratings improvement of the big 3 media groups in Poland. And we continue to expand our brands into new markets around the world where we're seeing some good results. We ended 2016 with a strong fourth quarter performance. HGTV tied 2015 to deliver its best fourth quarter ever for adult sales prime ratings. Driven by premiers of hit shows like Fixer Upper, Brothers Take New Orleans and Beachfront Bargain Hunt, HGTV led the way for engaging and entertaining lifestyle programming.
We saw a positive ratings traction at Food Network in December with sales prime ratings increasing 2% for adults and 4% for women. Shows such as Holiday Baking Championship and Cake Wars: Christmas helped drive that improvement. To follow that up. In January, Food Network posted ratings gains for women 25 to 54, marking the network's highest delivery for that key demographic since August 2014.
Travel Channel continues to deliver positive results, benefiting from our recent programming investments. Ratings improved for women 25 to 54 for the fourth consecutive quarter. Travel Channel also grew its ratings 14% for the important millennial demographic compared to the previous quarter. Popular shows like Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods, Delicious Destinations and Mysteries at the Museum are some of Travel Channel's fourth quarter programming highlights. Travel Channel's programming, which takes its inspiration from virtual and active travelers and their passion for travel, continues to make consistent progress, and we are pleased with its performance in 2016.
At DIY Network, the fourth quarter marked the network's fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings increased 11% for adults 25 to 54 and 27% for women 25 to 54 versus a year ago. Cooking Channel once again delivered its highest-rated and most-watched quarter in the network's history for sales prime among both adults and women 25 to 54. Impressions delivery also was up at Cooking Channel, improving 17% versus prior year.
And a Great American Country, the fourth quarter marked the network's fourth consecutive quarter for double-digit growth with ratings up 42% and impressions up 35%.
Consistent with our strategy to expand the availability of our content, Scripps Lifestyle Studios has worked diligently to ensure that we're reaching viewers on the digital platforms that they love. In the fourth quarter, Scripps Lifestyle Studios achieved approximately 2.4 billion video views across all digital platforms. These include our owned and operated websites, social media networks like Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and Pinterest, as well as TV Everywhere apps. On average, we had 790 million video views each month in the fourth quarter, representing an 89% improvement over the third quarter of 2016.
For the entire year, Scripps Lifestyle Studios delivered more than 5 billion total video views, surpassing 2015 video views by nearly 700%. Overall, Scripps Lifestyle Studios produced about 5,000 new content videos, and that's equivalent to approximately 125 programming hours.
While a good portion of this growth came from our social media platforms, TV Everywhere also experienced significant growth in 2016, growth which has continued into 2017. In January alone, visitors were up 22% from December, hitting 2 million for the month. And 2017 is off to a good start for the entire Scripps Lifestyle Studios team as there were 805 million video views across all digital platforms in January, and that's up 6% from December.
Now turning to our international networks, we had some notable achievements in the last several months. At TVN, the network group delivered another successful quarter with audience levels and ratings continuing to grow. In the fourth quarter, ratings for TVN group improved 5% in the key 16 to 49 commercial audience. You've heard us talk about how we plan to utilize TVN's premier production facilities to develop some of our original formats. During the quarter, a TVN-produced episode of House Hunters International aired in the U.S., resulting in a pickup of future episodes to be produced through the TVN studios. And as Ken mentioned, TVN is a valuable partner for producing cost-effective digital content as well.
UKTV experienced record-breaking growth in commercial audiences for 2016 as their share of commercial impact grew 8% against record growth in 2015.
2016 really was a great year for our company, and 2017 is off to a good start. We're optimistic about the opportunities available for our lifestyle content both in the U.S. and around the world.
And now I'll turn it over to Lori who will review the company's financial performance."

Since Ken already reviewed our record full year results, I'll focus my comments on the quarterly consolidated numbers, discuss our operating segment performance as well as provide guidance for 2017, and then ope",1172,"Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Since Ken already reviewed our record full year results, I'll focus my comments on the quarterly consolidated numbers, discuss our operating segment performance as well as provide guidance for 2017, and then open it up for your Q&A.
Consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter increased 4% to $889 million. This increase was driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with overall ratings and impressions growth as well as growth in our international businesses. The revenue growth, along with a slight increase in programming expense, drove consolidated adjusted segment profit up 3%. Our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased to $1.02 compared with $1.35 in the prior year. This was largely due to gains on foreign currency transactions in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with losses in 2016 and favorable tax settlements in 2015 compared with unfavorable ones this year. In total, the EPS impact from the year-over-year swings in foreign currency and tax settlements was $0.51 per diluted share.
Also excluded from our fourth quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share but included in our reported earnings per share number was a $0.54 per share noncash goodwill and related intangible asset write-downs. These are related to the international acquisitions of TCI and the Asian Food Channel. Also impacting the number was a $0.07 per share noncash investment write-down.
Now looking at our operating segments, our U.S. networks revenue increased 4%. This improvement was driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle networks, partially offset by the expected and temporary decline in distribution revenues. Advertising revenues increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to CPM pricing increases combined with ratings improvement. Scatter pricing was stronger during the quarter with CPM up high teens year-over-year and up mid- to high 20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were retail, food, consumer packaged goods, auto and pharma. These categories are consistent with historical performance for the fourth quarter. However, the order is slightly different with food coming in at #2 due to the strength seen in retail. The strength of scatter has combined -- had continued into the first quarter of 2017. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing is up mid- to high-teens year-over-year and up low- to mid-20s over the broadcast upfront.
Another positive data point for the current year is our recently completed 2017 calendar upfront. We realized low double-digit CPM growth rate, consistent with the rate increases we generated in the broadcast upfront. And we sold a similar amount of inventory compared with 2015. Distribution revenues for the U.S. networks decreased 3%. Contributing to this expected decrease was the previously reported rate equalization impacting 2016, industry subscriber declines and our strategic decision not to renew certain SVOD agreements during the year. These declines were partially offset by negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top and nonlinear distribution platforms.
As a result of the increase in revenues, coupled with strong cost control, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. networks increased 5% compared with the prior year quarter.
For the international segment, the majority of the revenues are generated by TVN. In local currency, the revenues increased 3% compared with the same time a year ago. This was negatively impacted by the soft ad market in the fourth quarter. On a reported basis, international networks revenues increased 2% to $165 million. International adjusted segment profit increased 2% to $41 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of FX, segment profit would have more than doubled from the prior year quarter.
In addition to our international -- consolidated international business, a significant portion of our international business is reported in equity income. These investments include UKTV, Food Network, HGTV and DIY Networks in Canada and some TVN minority investments. These international properties now comprise a majority of our equity income. And in total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $16 million, up from $11 million in the prior year.
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the fourth quarter at approximately 2.6x gross leverage, down from 2.8x at the end of last quarter and down from 3.2x at the end of 2015.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we retired the last of TVN's high interest-bearing debt. As we look at 2017, we expect to realize a significant reduction in interest expense, which I'll cover in the guidance. Also last week, we announced for the seventh consecutive year, an increase in our dividends, raising it 20% or $1.20 per share annually.
Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, including programming, reduce our leverage and invest strategically through M&A both domestically and internationally. We will also continue to evaluate the opportunity to repurchase our shares under the existing board authorize repurchase program, which has $1.5 billion remaining.
And finally, before opening it up for questions, I will provide our full year 2017 guidance. All guidance is based on total company adjusted results. As a result of the healthy demand for our networks in viewers and advertisers alike, both in the U.S. and internationally, we expect 2017 revenue growth to be approximately 6%. Additionally, within its anticipated revenue growth, we expect to generate positive distribution revenue growth beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and we expect the distribution revenue rate -- growth rate will increase during the year.
On the expense side. The cost of services rate of growth is expected to moderate and be in the mid-single-digit level for the full year. However, based on current premier schedules in terms of quarterly pacing, we should realize high single-digit percentage growth in the first half of the year and a slowdown in the second half.
For SG&A expenses and consistent with our long-term strategic focus to deliver content that is consumed on a variety of platforms, devices and distribution platforms, we plan to invest an incremental $30 million to $40 million in various growth initiatives. These include short-form mobile and millennial-focused content for digital platform, related marketing programs, technology and data collection and analytics. As a result of our anticipated revenue growth, partially offset by increased support costs, we expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 3%. Excluding the incremental investment and future growth, we would expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 6% for 2017 and consistent with our revenue growth.
We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $155 million to $160 million. This includes purchase price amortization, which we will include for the full year reported numbers going forward.
We expect interest expense to be approximately $100 million. And finally, we expect our tax rate to be in the 30% to 32% range for the year.
Overall, we expect to deliver strong growth in 2017 as we continue to make important investments and high-quality content, data and multi-platform opportunities.
And with that, we will open up the call for your questions."

It's a great question and a fun question to ask -- answer. 2 words come to mind for me, and it's focus and consistency. I think, over the years, we have built this trust level with consumers with our brands. There are no surprises. They know what they get when they come to us. And we're also providing a very comfortable environment. I don't want to use -- I don't necessarily want to classify it as an escape as in this day and age, but beautiful homes, beautiful food, beautiful travel locations. There's a certain elegance to the simplicity of what we do. Having said that, what's really been beneficial to us as the evolution of different platforms and different opportunities have come along, they're bringing us new ways to utilize our content. Then honestly, when Burton and folks like I, were sitting around and thinking about this network and these brands 20 years ago, we didn't necessarily realize that we'd be able to recycle this content in so many different ways. And that's brought us new revenue opportunities. Now having said all of that, it's much harder to do than it looks. And I give Burton and Kathleen Finch and all of the people on the content side, both linear and digital, and Jim on the international side a lot of credit with focus and consistency. And then I think it helps that we've had a good track record with our advertisers. They know that when they give us their valuable advertising dollars, they're going to get results. And I think the same on our distribution partners. So a little bit of a long-winded answer, but it gives me just a chance to talk about, I think, why we have had the consistent revenue and audience ratings delivery that we've had. And as you heard from Lori and Burton, we're expecting that again in 2017."

We have been fortunate through our distribution team in getting distribution on all the virtual MVPDs that have been announced, whether broad bundles or skinnier bundles, certainly for our broadly distributed networks. And then if there are tiers and those services are digital networks around those tiers, we're talking to everybody else who's considering launching a virtual MVPD. And our thought on this is that, really, the dynamics should be consistent with viewing on regular MVPDs. The live nature of our content and the viewing of our content is really no accident. We program our networks, so that once you tune in, there's a similarity in the kinds of programs you see that makes it almost like on demand, except you don't have to do any work. You sit back and just watch the shows that roll over you and you enjoy them, as Ken said in his previous answer. That dynamic continuous in virtual MVPD platforms and no matter what the size of the bundle is. And in terms of scripted entertainment versus what we do, there's a lot of scripted entertainment out there. There is really a more focused amount of really high-quality lifestyle content in categories, home, food and travel. And we're the place to go for that. So we think we are in a very good position when it comes to any kinds of virtual MVPDs or smaller packages. Remember, we are essentially a skinny bundle already. We're a bundle of lifestyle networks that work well together. And that's why we've been getting distribution on all these virtual MVPDs that have been announced."

And so when we're looking at these incremental investments, we see a real upside now that I think we have more confidence and probably than ever before, and the Scripps Lifestyle Studios is a very good example. So I view this really as investing in what we're already seeing and the experience from what advertisers are expecting. And that's not only more credibility in the results, and I also mean in data collection and in ratings. But also on the digital side as we're packaging whether it's Dream Home Giveaway, whether it's 30 and 60 second spots with social media combined with mobile media, a need to continue to invest and put some money on the table. I mean, if you look at the overall, Doug, say, you can -- why not more? Why just $30 million or $40 million? And I think it's now, Doug, to the point at our maturation where we're very comfortable that this kind of money each year is a good investment in the future of a multi-platform kind of delivery system. And it -- we don't have all the answers yet. I don't think anybody does. But what we're seeing is we collect more data, we get more information, more upside.

We think that if we unlock some of the value in people's, in our audiences' buying interest and actual buying habits that, that creates value for advertisers and we can capitalize on that. So this initial data investment is a way to be able to get our arms around it. In terms of the creation of short-form digital content, we make the vast majority of that in-house very inexpensively. So a relatively small amount of dollars goes a very long way in creating some hundreds and hundreds of assets. So I think what we're doing is being very good about capitalizing -- in capitalizing on the success that we've seen over the last year with our Scripps Lifestyle Studios, but doing it in a measured way. And I expect that we'll continue to see this investment. But we also expect to see some payoff from it in terms of continued growth in digital advertising dollars."

To your point, I mean, we're -- we right now feel like we're, I think, in a very good shape because of the growth that we've seen in millennials in all of our categories, and of course, this is coming predominantly from social media. But you've heard me refer to this before. There's a certain lifestyle change. I don't want to say it's 30 years of age. But let's talk about the home category. We're seeing engagement among millennials who, as they age over the past several years, have grown into our linear television viewing. What's been interesting about that, Mike, is they have continued to use social media and engagement in a way that our traditional audience in the past hasn't. So it's a new type of viewer coming in. And to Vasily's question earlier about live viewing, what we're finding in nonfiction viewing, there's a lot more engagement. There's a lot more of live, did you see this? Which home do you think they're going to choose? By the way, on Chopped, I know they're going to -- this is the missing ingredient, whereas scripted, there's less of an opportunity while the actual show is going on to interact. So I think in the next 2 years, in your time window, we're going to see more emphasis on the engagement part of it, more on the information part of it. Are you watching the show? What are you -- where did I get that particular sink in the kitchen? Where did this come from? Dream Home Giveaway, which we just wrapped up, which will be another record-breaking Dream Home, no doubt, as far as entries and level of participation. This is something we've seen grow year after year after year. And that's the amount of information that people are taking out of these shows. So I think if you look out 2 years, I'm very encouraged about where we're positioned and how we're taking our content to these new platforms and how consumers are going to use it. It gets back to, we just got to be there when they're there. Because if not, another brand or another entity might. So it's hard to just run to stay in place, if you will. But that's kind of the next 2 years.

So probably for Burton, on the revenue side, just taking some figures from your press release, I think you talked about over 5 billion impressions delivered last year. You also disclosed 150 million approximately of digital revenues. I don't know if those map exactly. But if they do, it was about a $30 CPM, if I'm asked right, which seems to make sense. But you also said 800 or so billion -- million impressions delivered in January. So if I were to annualize that, that's up like double over the year, and that's if the run rate stays where it is. So am I thinking about that right in terms of how revenue might grow just from those couple of facts and figures on the digital side? And then Lori, the sort of related follow-up is, obviously, that maps some degree to the $30 million or $40 million you've been talking about. But just more broadly, if we're talking about doubling impressions, how does that scale in terms of is that more content required to drive those extra impressions? Or is it growth in sort of more unique viewers? How do you double impressions like that from the investment side?"

And the reason is because our digital ad revenue isn't all video revenue. We still get a substantial portion of our digital ad revenue from display advertising from our websites and the mobile access to those websites. So your math can't be calculated quite the way you did. That said, the reason we're doing so much investing in terms of time, energy and resources into digital video is because of the tremendous growth that we're seeing in the audience consumption of it and the advertiser demand. So over time, we do see a shift to more of our ad revenue on the digital side coming from those video ad impressions and a smaller percentage coming from display. And I think, Todd, that would be true across the industry. So that's what we're setting ourselves up for. And then in terms of just the number of impressions, this is a really interesting process that our Scripps Lifestyle Studios is engaged in and has been for the year or so that we've been actively involved in this. It is not necessarily true that we have to make ever more hundreds and hundreds of digital videos every month. And the reason for that is our goal is to create a dynamic where our audiences share those videos to a -- at a much higher rate. So that actually, over time, we may be able to get more and more views with fewer videos as we learn the ones that drive the most sharing. So that's what we're in the process of doing. And we like where we are right now with 300 to 400 new digital videos a month, driving these kinds of impressions. But I'm not sure it'll always stay that way. We're in the learning process right now. So I hope that gives some greater color to what we're trying to do here and the learning process that's underway.

Some of that is embedded in that $30 million to $40 million, but it's not all of the money just tied to this social video viral play.

The best example that we've had in the last few years was House Hunters, which we went from a regular sort of order to hundreds of them every year because we certainly reap the benefits of that programming investment in increased advertising revenue.

Our strong networks and content have never been in more demand or accessible over",1355,"All right. Thank you, Dylan, and good morning, everyone. Very happy you're able to be with us today. Simply put, 2016 was a remarkable year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Our strong networks and content have never been in more demand or accessible over a variety of distribution platforms, devices or in more geographies than they are today. We're the leading lifestyle content company in the world, and it shows in our financial performance.
For a quick recap, in 2016, we reported record revenue, which increased 13% to $3.4 billion. Our consolidated advertising revenue increased 17% to $2.4 billion. And U.S. networks advertising revenue increased nearly 10%, surpassing $2 billion for the first time ever. We also reported adjusted segment profit of $1.4 billion, reaching a new milestone. Let me just say that this standout performance is a direct result of our relentless focus on operational execution and the deliberate investments that we've made in content, in our international businesses and at Scripps Lifestyle Studios.
Our success wouldn't be possible without our incredible employees around the world, and I want to thank them for their dedication, their collaboration and creative spirit that they bring to the forefront every day. In the swiftly transforming and competitive media landscape, it's strong brands built on appealing content that win. That's why we stick with our simple but highly effective game plan, that is: first, to strengthen and grow our core business; second, to expand our reach to new markets and emerging platforms; and third, to maximize monetization with our advertising and distribution partners.
We're building the foundation for our future by continually investing in our brands and content to make them even stronger. We already deliver the best lifestyle content across multiple platforms and geographies, and we're building reach and engagement every single day. The shows that we air around the globe are consistent, relevant, family-friendly, and they promote co-viewing where families engage in our content together. At a time when some networks are rebranded, reimaged or realigned to meet consumers' changing preferences, we stay true to the content that has made us a world-renowned producer of quality lifestyle content. Our focus has always been to create and own compelling lifestyle content for home, food and travel enthusiasts. The result is our brands have one of the most loyal and consistent viewer bases in the media industry.
Our strategy to strengthen our brands is working. In 2016, all 6 of our U.S. networks were up in total day in the C3 viewing window, the key metric for our advertisers. I'm proud that our family of networks was the only U.S. media group to have all of its networks improve in this time slot. And, similar to past years, the vast majority of our C3 viewing was live. 
For powerhouse brand HGTV, 2016 was its highest-rated and most-watched year ever, surpassing last year's record-breaking ratings by 6%. HGTV finished the year ranked third among all cable networks for adults 18-plus, the highest ranking for this audience in network history.
Leveraging on our long-standing commitment to developing and owning all of our content regardless of platform, our second strategic building block is to expand our reach to new markets on emerging platforms. These results are a demonstration that we're delivering on that commitment with higher demand than ever for our unique lifestyle content. Internationally, we're reaching new audiences and connecting them with our core brands.
At TVN in Poland, we are clearly delivering the content that consumers crave. When we purchased TVN in 2015, it was already a leading media company with talented employees and a highly regarded and very experienced leadership team. But with the infusion of our lifestyle formats over the last several quarters, we've been able to create even greater value at TVN than before. We're also leveraging TVN's production capabilities to create value in our U.S. networks business, with Kathleen Finch working with the Polish production teams to commission lower cost and high-quality long and short form content for the United States, and there are lots more opportunities to come there in the future.
In January of this year, we successfully launched HGTV in Poland. Now in the early weeks of its launch, HGTV's ratings continue to exceed even our own high expectations. The network is already the #2 lifestyle network in Poland, just behind our own TVN Style. And we believe HGTV Poland is destined for major long-term success. This launch was a key milestone in our international business, the first full HGTV launch in Europe and our largest HGTV international launch to date. I want to congratulate the entire international and TVN teams who worked tirelessly to make this happen.
Earlier this month, we announced a long-term commercial partnership with German broadcaster ProSieben to launch branded programming blocks beginning this spring. This agreement brings HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel and DIY Network to millions of new viewers in Europe. We're excited to bring our lifestyle brands to a previously untapped audience and expand our footprint into one of Europe's most dynamic markets. We'll continue to look for opportunities to grow our portfolio of strong brands and networks outside the United States.
Now in addition to new markets, we're striving to ensure that we take full advantage of newer platforms to reach audiences. Where once this business was a linear network company, we're now a fully fledged lifestyle content company that leverages video across all platforms. We always want to deliver high-quality, multi-format content and integrate advertising into our storytelling, and digital content provides a great opportunity to do that.
Since its launch in 2015, Scripps Lifestyle Studios' focus on increasing social media and online engagement is a meaningful contributor to our growing digital businesses. Burton is going to share some of the results coming out of the Scripps Lifestyle Studios shortly. However, monetizing our content on digital platforms is not just a strategic priority for the future but something we're delivering on today. Our agility and our ownership of our own content makes us uniquely positioned among media companies to seize that opportunity.
The engaging brands that we bring to life on televisions, on computers, on phones or tablets are unlike any other. Whether we interact with audiences on the television screen or through mobile or social platforms, we're committed to providing the right content to the right audience at the right time.
Finally, among our strategic pillars, we remain strongly focused on building deeper, more valuable partnerships with our advertisers and distributors. As I said earlier, content is the key to our success. Creating great content is the best method to accumulate and monetize sustainable returns. Importantly, because we own our own content, we can more effectively utilize our programming across all platforms, a tremendous value proposition to our advertising and distribution partners.
For advertisers, our content delivers an upscale and highly engaged audience. We work closely with our advertising partners to provide an effective, economical and reliable way for their messaging to reach their customers. Our viewers are engaged even during commercials. They're watching live constantly. This is a clear distinction of how we've been able to outpace the industry for advertising revenue growth.
For our distributors, well, we deliver clear value, both on price and popularity. Our viewing audience is loyal, and they look for our strong networks in their programming packages. The record results that we reported today underscore the strength of our strategy and content. We continue to be focused on delivering sustainable long-term growth driven by the strength of our inspiring brands and content and growing our reach across different platforms and geographies. I know we have the right strategic priorities and team to continue increasing shareholder value and returns.
2016 was a great year. And Lori is going to provide some details on our full year outlook in a few minutes, which will underscore why I'm so confident that 2017 will be another strong year of sustainable growth. I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.
Now let me turn it over to Burton, who will share some details on our operating results. Burton?"

And for th",839,"All right. Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our networks delivered some notable achievements last year, including 3 of our U.S. networks: -- HGTV, DIY Network and Cooking Channel -- had their best ratings performance in network history. And for the 10th consecutive year, HGTV was the #1 cable network among upscale women. The fact that we resonate so well with upscale audiences is a key differentiation for our networks. Advertisers want to reach female household decision-makers, and our brands deliver that audience better than anyone in cable.
Our ratings success in 2016 wasn't limited to the U.S., as TVN posted the highest ratings improvement of the big 3 media groups in Poland. And we continue to expand our brands into new markets around the world where we're seeing some good results. 
We ended 2016 with a strong fourth quarter performance. HGTV tied 2015 to deliver its best fourth quarter ever for adult sales prime ratings. Driven by premiers of hit shows like Fixer Upper, Brothers Take New Orleans and Beachfront Bargain Hunt, HGTV led the way for engaging and entertaining lifestyle programming.
We saw positive ratings traction at Food Network in December with sales prime ratings increasing 2% for adults and 4% for women. Shows such as Holiday Baking Championship and Cake Wars: Christmas helped drive that improvement. To follow that up, in January, Food Network posted ratings gains for women 25 to 54, marking the network's highest delivery for that key demographic since August 2014.
Travel Channel continues to deliver positive results, benefiting from our recent programming investments. Ratings improved for women 25 to 54 for the fourth consecutive quarter. Travel Channel also grew its ratings 14% for the important millennial demographic compared to the previous quarter. Popular shows like Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods, Delicious Destinations and Mysteries at the Museum are some of Travel Channel's fourth quarter programming highlights. Travel Channel's programming, which takes its inspiration from virtual and active travelers and their passion for travel, continues to make consistent progress, and we are pleased with its performance in 2016.
At DIY Network, the fourth quarter marked the network's fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings increased 11% for adults 25 to 54 and 27% for women 25 to 54 versus a year ago. Cooking Channel once again delivered its highest-rated and most-watched quarter in the network's history for sales prime among both adults and women 25 to 54. Impressions delivery also was up at Cooking Channel, improving 17% versus prior year.
And at Great American Country, the fourth quarter marked the network's fourth consecutive quarter for double-digit growth with ratings up 42% and impressions up 35%.
Consistent with our strategy to expand the availability of our content, Scripps Lifestyle Studios has worked diligently to ensure that we're reaching viewers on the digital platforms that they love. In the fourth quarter, Scripps Lifestyle Studios achieved approximately 2.4 billion video views across all digital platforms. These include our owned and operated websites, social media networks like Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and Pinterest, as well as TV Everywhere apps. On average, we had 790 million video views each month in the fourth quarter, representing an 89% improvement over the third quarter of 2016.
For the entire year, Scripps Lifestyle Studios delivered more than 5 billion total video views, surpassing 2015 video views by nearly 700%. Overall, Scripps Lifestyle Studios produced about 5,000 new content videos, and that's equivalent to approximately 125 programming hours.
While a good portion of this growth came from our social media platforms, TV Everywhere also experienced significant growth in 2016, growth which has continued into 2017. In January alone, visitors were up 22% from December, hitting 2 million for the month. And 2017 is off to a good start for the entire Scripps Lifestyle Studios team as there were 805 million video views across all digital platforms in January, and that's up 6% from December.
Now turning to our international networks, we had some notable achievements in the last several months. At TVN, the network group delivered another successful quarter with audience levels and ratings continuing to grow. In the fourth quarter, ratings for TVN Group improved 5% in the key 16 to 49 commercial audience. You've heard us talk about how we plan to utilize TVN's premier production facilities to develop some of our original formats. During the quarter, a TVN-produced episode of House Hunters International aired in the U.S., resulting in a pickup of future episodes to be produced through the TVN studios. And as Ken mentioned, TVN is a valuable partner for producing cost-effective digital content as well.
UKTV experienced record-breaking growth in commercial audiences for 2016 as their share of commercial impact grew 8% against record growth in 2015.
2016 really was a great year for our company, and 2017 is off to a good start. We're optimistic about the opportunities available for our lifestyle content both in the U.S. and around the world.
And now I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance."
6469353,416183195,1137695,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2017",2017-02-21,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Since Ken already reviewed our record full year results, I'll focus my comments on the quarterly consolidated numbers, discuss our operating segment performance, as well as provide guidance for 2017, and then op",1172,"Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. Since Ken already reviewed our record full year results, I'll focus my comments on the quarterly consolidated numbers, discuss our operating segment performance, as well as provide guidance for 2017, and then open it up for your Q&A.
Consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter increased 4% to $889 million. This increase was driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with overall ratings and impressions growth, as well as growth in our international businesses. The revenue growth, along with a slight increase in programming expense, drove consolidated adjusted segment profit up 3%. Our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased to $1.02 compared with $1.35 in the prior year. This was largely due to gains on foreign currency transactions in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with losses in 2016 and favorable tax settlements in 2015 compared with unfavorable ones this year. In total, the EPS impact from the year-over-year swings in foreign currency and tax settlements was $0.51 per diluted share.
Also excluded from our fourth quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share but included in our reported earnings per share number was a $0.54 per share noncash goodwill and related intangible asset write-down. These are related to the international acquisitions of TCI and the Asian Food Channel. Also impacting the number was a $0.07 per share noncash investment write-down.
Now looking at our operating segments, our U.S. networks revenue increased 4%. This improvement was driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle networks, partially offset by the expected and temporary decline in distribution revenues. Advertising revenues increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to CPM pricing increases combined with ratings improvement. Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter with CPMs up high teens year-over-year and up mid- to high 20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were retail, food, consumer packaged goods, auto and pharma. These categories are consistent with historical performance for the fourth quarter. However, the order is slightly different, with food coming in at #2 due to the strength seen in retail. The strength of scatter has combined -- has continued into the first quarter of 2017. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing is up mid- to high-teens year-over-year and up low- to mid-20s over the broadcast upfronts.
Another positive data point for the current year is our recently completed 2017 calendar upfront. We realized low double-digit CPM growth rate, consistent with the rate increases we generated in the broadcast upfront. And we sold a similar amount of inventory compared with 2015. Distribution revenues for the U.S. networks decreased 3%. Contributing to this expected decrease was the previously reported rate equalization impacting 2016, industry subscriber declines and our strategic decision not to renew certain SVOD agreements during the year. These declines were partially offset by negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top and nonlinear distribution platforms.
As a result of the increase in revenues, coupled with strong cost control, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. networks increased 5% compared with the prior year quarter.
For the international segment, the majority of the revenues are generated by TVN. In local currency, the revenues increased 3% compared with the same time a year ago. This was negatively impacted by the soft ad market in the fourth quarter. On a reported basis, international networks revenues increased 2% to $165 million. International adjusted segment profit increased 2% to $41 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of FX, segment profit would have more than doubled from the prior year quarter.
In addition to our international -- consolidated international business, a significant portion of our international business is reported in equity income. These investments include UKTV, Food Network, HGTV and DIY Networks in Canada and some TVN minority investments. These international properties now comprise the majority of our equity income, and in total equity and earnings of affiliates was $16 million, up from $11 million in the prior year.
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the fourth quarter at approximately 2.6x gross leverage, down from 2.8x at the end of last quarter and down from 3.2x at the end of 2015.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter we retired the last of TVN's high interest-bearing debt. As we look at 2017, we expect to realize a significant reduction in interest expense, which I'll cover in the guidance. Also last week, we announced for the seventh consecutive year an increase in our dividend, raising it 20% to $1.20 per share annually.
Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, including programming, reduce our leverage and invest strategically through M&A both domestically and internationally. We will also continue to evaluate the opportunity to repurchase our shares under the existing board authorized repurchase program, which has $1.5 billion remaining.
And finally, before opening it up for questions, I will provide our full year 2017 guidance. All guidance is based on total company adjusted results. As a result of the healthy demand for our networks in viewers and advertisers alike, both in the U.S. and internationally, we expect 2017 revenue growth to be approximately 6%. Additionally, within its anticipated revenue growth, we expect to generate positive distribution revenue growth beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and we expect the distribution revenue rate -- growth rate will increase during the year.
On the expense side. The cost of services rate of growth is expected to moderate and be in the mid-single-digit level for the full year. However, based on current premier schedules in terms of quarterly pacing, we should realize high single-digit percentage growth in the first half of the year and a slowdown in the second half.
For SG&A expenses and consistent with our long-term strategic focus to deliver content that is consumed on a variety of platforms, devices and distribution platforms, we plan to invest an incremental $30 million to $40 million in various growth initiatives. These include short-form mobile and millennial-focused content for digital platforms, related marketing programs, technology and data collection and analytics. As a result of our anticipated revenue growth, partially offset by increased support costs, we expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 3%. Excluding the incremental investment and future growth, we would expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 6% for 2017 and consistent with our revenue growth.
We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $155 million to $160 million. This includes purchase price amortization, which we will include for the full year reported numbers going forward.
We expect interest expense to be approximately $100 million. And finally, we expect our tax rate to be in the 30% to 32% range for the year.
Overall, we expect to deliver strong growth in 2017 as we continue to make important investments in high-quality content, data and multi-platform opportunities.
And with that, we will open up the call for your questions."

It's a great question and a fun question to ask -- answer. 2 words come to mind for me, and it's focus and consistency. I think over the years we have built this trust level with consumers with our brands. There are no surprises. They know what they get when they come to us. And we're also providing a very comfortable environment. I don't want to use -- I don't necessarily want to classify it as escapism in this day and age, but beautiful homes, beautiful food, beautiful travel locations. There's a certain elegance to the simplicity of what we do. 
Having said that, what's really been beneficial to us, as the evolution of different platforms and different opportunities have come along, they're bringing us new ways to utilize our content. Then honestly, when Burton and folks like I were sitting around thinking about this network and these brands 20 years ago, we didn't necessarily realize that we'd be able to recycle this content in so many different ways. And that's brought us new revenue opportunities. 
Now having said all of that, it's much harder to do than it looks. And I give Burton and Kathleen Finch and all the people on the content side, both linear and digital, and Jim on the international side a lot of credit with focus and consistency. 
And then I think it helps that we've had a good track record with our advertisers. They know that when they give us their valuable advertising dollars, they're going to get results. And I think the same on our distribution partners. 
So a little bit of a long-winded answer, but it gives me just a chance to talk about, I think, why we have had the consistent revenue and audience ratings delivery that we've had. And as you heard from Lori and Burton, we're expecting that again in 2017."

We have been fortunate through our distribution team in getting distribution on all the virtual MVPDs that have been announced, whether broad bundles or skinnier bundles, certainly for our broadly distributed networks. And then there are tiers on those services. Our digital networks are on those tiers. We're talking to everybody else who's considering launching a virtual MVPD. 
And our thought on this is that really the dynamics should be consistent with viewing on regular MVPDs. The live nature of our content and the viewing of our content is really no accident. We program our networks so that once you tune in, there's a similarity in the kinds of programs you see that makes it almost like on demand, except you don't have to do any work. You sit back and just watch the shows that roll over you and you enjoy them, as Ken said in his previous answer. That dynamic continuous in virtual MVPD platforms no matter what the size of the bundle is. 
And in terms of scripted entertainment versus what we do, there's a lot of scripted entertainment out there. There is really a more focused amount of really high-quality lifestyle content in categories of home, food and travel, and we're the place to go for that. So we think we are in a very good position when it comes to any kinds of virtual MVPDs or smaller packages. 
Remember, we are essentially a skinny bundle already. We're a bundle of lifestyle networks that work well together. And that's why we've been getting distribution on all these virtual MVPDs that have been announced."

Is there any story to tell behind the ebbs and flows of the scatter market?"

And so when we're looking at these incremental investments, we see a real upside now that I think we have more confidence in probably than ever before, and the Scripps Lifestyle Studios is a very good example. So I view this really as investing in what we're already seeing and experience from what advertisers are expecting. And that's not only more credibility in the results, and I also mean in data collection and in ratings, but also on the digital side as we're packaging, whether it's Dream Home Giveaway, whether it's 30- and 60-second spots with social media combined with mobile media, a need to continue to invest and put some money on the table. I mean, if you look at the overall, Doug, you can say, ""Gee, Ken, why not more? Why just $30 million or $40 million?"" 
And I think it's now, Doug, to the point in our maturation where we're very comfortable at this kind of money each year, is a good investment in the future of a multi-platform kind of delivery system.

So this initial data investment is a way to be able to get our arms around it. 
In terms of the creation of short-form digital content, we make the vast majority of that in-house very inexpensively. So a relatively small amount of dollars goes a very long way in creating some hundreds and hundreds of assets. So I think what we're doing is being very good about capitalizing  on the success that we've seen over the last year with our Scripps Lifestyle Studios but doing it in a measured way. And I expect that we'll continue to see this investment. But we also expect to see some payoff from it in terms of continued growth in digital advertising dollars."

Obviously, if somebody is viewing our content through, say, TV Everywhere, our feed, for example, through TV Everywhere, if you're not viewing on a television, that isn't measured. But the good news is the bulk of the TV Everywhere viewing that we referred to is through connected devices on the television, and so that viewing does get measured. 
In addition, after day 3, we do dynamic ad insertion in our own TV Everywhere apps and obviously in our own owned and operated websites and social media platforms. That all gets measured because we have all the data from those platforms. 
So because of the live viewing and because of what's going on in terms of the increase of our short-form digital viewing and because of TV Everywhere viewing being mainly through connected devices, I would say there's not a vast amount for us that's slipping through the cracks.

I don't want to come off as evasive, but it's an answer I've been giving for a number of years, and that's that should just be where they are. To your point, I mean, we're -- we right now feel like we're, I think, in very good shape because of the growth that we've seen in millennials in all of our categories. And of course this is coming predominantly from social media. But you've heard me refer to this before. There's a certain lifestyle change, I don't want to say it's 30 years of age, but let's talk about the home category. We're seeing engagement among millennials who, as they've aged over the past several years, have grown into our linear television viewing. What's been interesting about that, Mike, is they have continued to use social media and engagement in a way that our traditional audience in the past hasn't. So it's a new type of viewer coming in. 
And to Vasily's question earlier about live viewing, what we're finding, in nonfiction viewing there's a lot more engagement. There's a lot more of live, ""Did you see this? Which home do you think they're going to choose? "" ""By the way, on Chopped, I know they're going to -- this is the missing ingredient."" Whereas scripted, there's less of an opportunity while the actual show is going on to interact. So I think in the next 2 years, in your time window, we're going to see more emphasis on the engagement part of it, more on the information part of it. ""Are you watching the show? What are you -- where did they get that particular sink in the kitchen? Where did this come from?""
Dream Home Giveaway, which we just wrapped up, which will be another record-breaking Dream Home, no doubt, as far as entries and level of participation, this is something we've seen grow year after year after year, and that's the amount of information that people are taking out of these shows. 
So I think if you look out 2 years, I'm very encouraged about where we're positioned and how we're taking our content to these new platforms and how consumers are going to use it. It gets back to, we've just got to be there when they're there, because if not, another brand or another entity might. So it's hard to just run to stay in place, if you will. But that's kind of the next 2 years. It's doing what we're doing and then making sure these new consumers and new viewers are really getting the experience, if you will, from our content that they're expecting."

So probably for Burton, on the revenue side, just taking some figures from your press release, I think you talked about over 5 billion impressions delivered last year. You also disclosed $150 million approximately of digital revenues. I don't know if those map exactly, but if they do, it's about a $30 CPM, if my math is right, which seems to make sense. 
But you also said 800 or so billion -- million impressions delivered in January. So if I were to annualize that, that's up like double over the year, and that's if the run rate stays where it is. So am I thinking about that right in terms of how revenue might grow just from those couple facts and figures on the digital side? 
And then, Lori, the sort of related follow-up is, obviously that maps some degree to the $30 million or $40 million we're been talking about. But just more broadly, if we're talking about doubling impressions, how does that scale in terms of, is that more content required to drive those extra impressions? Or is it growth in sort of more unique viewers? How do you double impressions like that from the investment side?"

And the reason is because our digital ad revenue isn't all video revenue. We still get a substantial portion of our digital ad revenue from display advertising from our websites and the mobile access to those websites. So your math can't be calculated quite the way you did. That said, the reason we're doing so much investing in terms of time, energy and resources into digital video is because of the tremendous growth that we're seeing in the audience consumption of it and the advertiser demand. So over time, we do see a shift to more of our ad revenue on the digital side coming from those video ad impressions and a smaller percentage coming from display. And I think, Todd, that would be true across the industry. So that's what we're setting ourselves up for. 
And then in terms of just the number of impressions, this is a really interesting process that our Scripps Lifestyle Studios is engaged in and has been for the year or so that we've been actively involved in this. It is not necessarily true that we have to make ever more hundreds and hundreds of digital videos every month. And the reason for that is our goal is to create a dynamic where our audiences share those videos to a -- at a much higher rate so that actually, over time, we may be able to get more and more views with fewer videos as we learn the ones that drive the most sharing. 
So that's what we're in the process of doing. And we like where we are right now with 300 to 400 new digital videos a month driving these kinds of impressions. But I'm not sure it'll always stay that way. We're in a learning process right now. So I hope that gives some greater color to what we're trying to do here and the learning process that's underway.

Thank you, Dylan, and good morning, everyone. Very happy you're able to be with us today. Simply put, 2016 was a remarkable year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Our strong networks and content have never been in more demand or accessible over",1354,"All right. Thank you, Dylan, and good morning, everyone. Very happy you're able to be with us today. Simply put, 2016 was a remarkable year for Scripps Networks Interactive. Our strong networks and content have never been in more demand or accessible over a variety of distribution platforms, devices or in more geographies than they are today. We're the leading lifestyle content company in the world, and it shows in our financial performance.
For a quick recap, in 2016, we reported record revenue, which increased 13% to $3.4 billion. Our consolidated advertising revenue increased 17% to $2.4 billion. And U.S. networks advertising revenue increased nearly 10%, surpassing $2 billion for the first time ever. We also reported adjusted segment profit of $1.4 billion, reaching a new milestone. Let me just say that this standout performance is a direct result of our relentless focus on operational execution and the deliberate investments that we've made in content, in our international businesses and at Scripps Lifestyle Studios.
Our success wouldn't be possible without our incredible employees around the world, and I want to thank them for their dedication, their collaboration and creative spirit that they bring to the forefront every day. In the swiftly transforming and competitive media landscape, it's strong brands built on appealing content that win. That's why we stick with our simple but highly effective game plan, that is: first, to strengthen and grow our core business; second, to expand our reach to new markets and emerging platforms; and third, to maximize monetization with our advertising and distribution partners.
We're building the foundation for our future by continually investing in our brands and content to make them even stronger. We already deliver the best lifestyle content across multiple platforms and geographies, and we're building reach and engagement every single day. The shows that we air around the globe are consistent, relevant, family-friendly, and they promote co-viewing where families engage in our content together. At a time when some networks are rebranded, reimaged or realigned to meet consumers' changing preferences, we stay true to the content that has made us a world-renowned producer of quality lifestyle content. Our focus has always been to create and own compelling lifestyle content for home, food and travel enthusiasts. The result is our brands have one of the most loyal and consistent viewer bases in the media industry.
Our strategy to strengthen our brands is working. In 2016, all 6 of our U.S. networks were up in total day in the C3 viewing window, the key metric for our advertisers. I'm proud that our family of networks was the only U.S. media group to have all of its networks improve in this time slot. And similar to past years, the vast majority of our C3 viewing was live. 
For powerhouse brand HGTV, 2016 was its highest-rated and most-watched year ever, surpassing last year's record-breaking ratings by 6%. HGTV finished the year ranked third among all cable networks for adults 18-plus, the highest ranking for this audience in network history.
Leveraging on our long-standing commitment to developing and owning all of our content regardless of platform, our second strategic building block is to expand our reach to new markets on emerging platforms. These results are a demonstration that we're delivering on that commitment with higher demand than ever for our unique lifestyle content. Internationally, we're reaching new audiences and connecting them with our core brands.
At TVN in Poland, we are clearly delivering the content that consumers crave. When we purchased TVN in 2015, it was already a leading media company with talented employees and a highly regarded and very experienced leadership team. But with the infusion of our lifestyle formats over the last several quarters, we've been able to create even greater value at TVN than before. We're also leveraging TVN's production capabilities to create value in our U.S. networks business, with Kathleen Finch working with the Polish production teams to commission lower cost and high-quality long and short form content for the United States, and there are lots more opportunities to come there in the future.
In January of this year, we successfully launched HGTV in Poland. Now in the early weeks of its launch, HGTV's ratings continue to exceed even our own high expectations. The network is already the #2 lifestyle network in Poland, just behind our own TVN Style. And we believe HGTV Poland is destined for major long-term success. This launch was a key milestone in our international business, the first full HGTV launch in Europe and our largest HGTV international launch to date. I want to congratulate the entire international and TVN teams who worked tirelessly to make this happen.
Earlier this month, we announced a long-term commercial partnership with German broadcaster ProSieben to launch branded programming blocks beginning this spring. This agreement brings HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel and DIY Network to millions of new viewers in Europe. We're excited to bring our lifestyle brands to a previously untapped audience and expand our footprint into one of Europe's most dynamic markets. We'll continue to look for opportunities to grow our portfolio of strong brands and networks outside the United States.
Now in addition to new markets, we're striving to ensure that we take full advantage of newer platforms to reach audiences. Where once this business was a linear network company, we're now a fully-fledged lifestyle content company that leverages video across all platforms. We always want to deliver high-quality, multi-format content and integrate advertising into our storytelling, and digital content provides a great opportunity to do that.
Since its launch in 2015, Scripps Lifestyle Studios' focus on increasing social media and online engagement is a meaningful contributor to our growing digital businesses. Burton is going to share some of the results coming out of the Scripps Lifestyle Studios shortly. However, monetizing our content on digital platforms is not just a strategic priority for the future but something we're delivering on today. Our agility and our ownership of our own content makes us uniquely positioned among media companies to seize that opportunity.
The engaging brands that we bring to life on televisions, on computers, on phones or tablets are unlike any other. Whether we interact with audiences on the television screen or through mobile or social platforms, we're committed to providing the right content to the right audience at the right time.
Finally, among our strategic pillars, we remain strongly focused on building deeper, more valuable partnerships with our advertisers and distributors. As I said earlier, content is the key to our success. Creating great content is the best method to accumulate and monetize sustainable returns. Importantly, because we own our own content, we can more effectively utilize our programming across all platforms, a tremendous value proposition to our advertising and distribution partners.
For advertisers, our content delivers an upscale and highly engaged audience. We work closely with our advertising partners to provide an effective, economical and reliable way for their messaging to reach their customers. Our viewers are engaged even during commercials. They're watching live constantly. This is a clear distinction of how we've been able to outpace the industry for advertising revenue growth.
For our distributors, well, we deliver clear value, both on price and popularity. Our viewing audience is loyal, and they look for our strong networks in their programming packages. The record results that we reported today underscore the strength of our strategy and content. We continue to be focused on delivering sustainable long-term growth driven by the strength of our inspiring brands and content and growing our reach across different platforms and geographies. I know we have the right strategic priorities and team to continue increasing shareholder value and returns.
2016 was a great year. And Lori is going to provide some details on our full year outlook in a few minutes, which will underscore why I'm so confident that 2017 will be another strong year of sustainable growth. I want to thank you for your interest in Scripps Networks Interactive.
Now let me turn it over to Burton, who will share some details on our operating results. Burton?"

Our networks delivered some notable achievements last year, including 3 of our U.S. networks: -- HGTV, DIY Network and Cooking Channel -- had their best ratings performance in network history. And for th",839,"All right. Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our networks delivered some notable achievements last year, including 3 of our U.S. networks: -- HGTV, DIY Network and Cooking Channel -- had their best ratings performance in network history. And for the 10th consecutive year, HGTV was the #1 cable network among upscale women. The fact that we resonate so well with upscale audiences is a key differentiation for our networks. Advertisers want to reach female household decision-makers, and our brands deliver that audience better than anyone in cable.
Our ratings success in 2016 wasn't limited to the U.S., as TVN posted the highest ratings improvement of the big 3 media groups in Poland. And we continue to expand our brands into new markets around the world where we're seeing some good results. 
We ended 2016 with a strong fourth quarter performance. HGTV tied 2015 to deliver its best fourth quarter ever for adult sales prime ratings. Driven by premiers of hit shows like Fixer Upper, Brothers Take New Orleans and Beachfront Bargain Hunt, HGTV led the way for engaging and entertaining lifestyle programming.
We saw positive ratings traction at Food Network in December with sales prime ratings increasing 2% for adults and 4% for women. Shows such as Holiday Baking Championship and Cake Wars: Christmas helped drive that improvement. To follow that up, in January, Food Network posted ratings gains for women 25 to 54, marking the network's highest delivery for that key demographic since August 2014.
Travel Channel continues to deliver positive results, benefiting from our recent programming investments. Ratings improved for women 25 to 54 for the fourth consecutive quarter. Travel Channel also grew its ratings 14% for the important millennial demographic compared to the previous quarter. Popular shows like Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods, Delicious Destinations and Mysteries at the Museum are some of Travel Channel's fourth quarter programming highlights. Travel Channel's programming, which takes its inspiration from virtual and active travelers and their passion for travel, continues to make consistent progress, and we are pleased with its performance in 2016.
At DIY Network, the fourth quarter marked the network's fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sales prime ratings increased 11% for adults 25 to 54 and 27% for women 25 to 54 versus a year ago. Cooking Channel once again delivered its highest-rated and most-watched quarter in the network's history for sales prime among both adults and women 25 to 54. Impressions delivery also was up at Cooking Channel, improving 17% versus prior year.
And at Great American Country, the fourth quarter marked the network's fourth consecutive quarter for double-digit growth with ratings up 42% and impressions up 35%.
Consistent with our strategy to expand the availability of our content, Scripps Lifestyle Studios has worked diligently to ensure that we're reaching viewers on the digital platforms that they love. In the fourth quarter, Scripps Lifestyle Studios achieved approximately 2.4 billion video views across all digital platforms. These include our owned and operated websites, social media networks like Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and Pinterest as well as TV Everywhere apps. On average, we had 790 million video views each month in the fourth quarter, representing an 89% improvement over the third quarter of 2016.
For the entire year, Scripps Lifestyle Studios delivered more than 5 billion total video views, surpassing 2015 video views by nearly 700%. Overall, Scripps Lifestyle Studios produced about 5,000 new content videos, and that's equivalent to approximately 125 programming hours.
While a good portion of this growth came from our social media platforms, TV Everywhere also experienced significant growth in 2016, growth which has continued into 2017. In January alone, visitors were up 22% from December, hitting 2 million for the month. And 2017 is off to a good start for the entire Scripps Lifestyle Studios team as there were 805 million video views across all digital platforms in January, and that's up 6% from December.
Now turning to our international networks, we had some notable achievements in the last several months. At TVN, the network group delivered another successful quarter with audience levels and ratings continuing to grow. In the fourth quarter, ratings for TVN Group improved 5% in the key 16 to 49 commercial audience. You've heard us talk about how we plan to utilize TVN's premier production facilities to develop some of our original formats. During the quarter, a TVN-produced episode of House Hunters International aired in the U.S., resulting in a pickup of future episodes to be produced through the TVN studios. And as Ken mentioned, TVN is a valuable partner for producing cost-effective digital content as well.
UKTV experienced record-breaking growth in commercial audiences for 2016 as their share of commercial impact grew 8% against record growth in 2015.
2016 really was a great year for our company, and 2017 is off to a good start. We're optimistic about the opportunities available for our lifestyle content both in the U.S. and around the world.
And now I'll turn it over to Lori, who will review the company's financial performance."
6469353,416183195,1137886,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2017",2017-02-21,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone.

Since Ken already reviewed our record full year results, I'll focus my comments on the quarterly consolidated numbers, discuss our operating segment performance, as well as provide guidance for 2017, and then open it up for your Q&A.
Consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter increased 4% to $889 million. This increase was driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, coupled with overall ratings and impressions growth as well as growth in our international businesses. The revenue growth, along with a slight increase in programming expense, drove consolidated adjusted segment profit up 3%. Our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased to $1.02 compared with $1.35 in the prior year. This was largely due to gains on foreign currency transactions in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with losses in 2016 and favorable tax settlements in 2015 compared with unfavorable ones this year. In total, the EPS impact from the year-over-year swings in foreign currency and tax settlements was $0.51 per diluted share.
Also excluded from our fourth quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share but included in our reported earnings per share number was a $0.54 per share noncash goodwill and related intangible asset write-down. These are related to the international acquisitions of TCI and the Asian Food Channel. Also impacting the number was a $0.07 per share noncash investment write-down.
Now looking at our operating segments, our U.S. networks revenue increased 4%. This improvement was driven by strong advertising demand for our lifestyle networks, partially offset by the expected and temporary decline in distribution revenues. Advertising revenues increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to CPM pricing increases combined with ratings improvement. Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter with CPMs up high teens year-over-year and up mid- to high 20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising categories during the quarter were retail, food, consumer packaged goods, auto and pharma. These categories are consistent with historical performance for the fourth quarter. However, the order is slightly different, with food coming in at #2 due to the strength seen in retail. The strength of scatter has combined -- has continued into the first quarter of 2017. Scatter-versus-scatter CPM pricing is up mid- to high-teens year-over-year and up low- to mid-20s over the broadcast upfronts.
Another positive data point for the current year is our recently completed 2017 calendar upfront. We realized low double-digit CPM growth rate, consistent with the rate increases we generated in the broadcast upfront. And we sold a similar amount of inventory compared with 2015. Distribution revenues for the U.S. networks decreased 3%. Contributing to this expected decrease was the previously reported rate equalization impacting 2016, industry subscriber declines and our strategic decision not to renew certain SVOD agreements during the year. These declines were partially offset by negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top and nonlinear distribution platforms.
As a result of the increase in revenues, coupled with strong cost control, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. networks increased 5% compared with the prior year quarter.
For the international segment, the majority of the revenues are generated by TVN. In local currency, the revenues increased 3% compared with the same time a year ago. This was negatively impacted by the soft ad market in the fourth quarter. On a reported basis, international networks revenues increased 2% to $165 million. International adjusted segment profit increased 2% to $41 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of FX, segment profit would have more than doubled from the prior year quarter.
In addition to our international -- consolidated international business, a significant portion of our international business is reported in equity income. These investments include UKTV, Food Network, HGTV and DIY Networks in Canada and some TVN minority investments. These international properties now comprise the majority of our equity income, and in total equity and earnings of affiliates was $16 million, up from $11 million in the prior year.
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the fourth quarter at approximately 2.6x gross leverage, down from 2.8x at the end of last quarter and down from 3.2x at the end of 2015.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter we retired the last of TVN's high interest-bearing debt. As we look at 2017, we expect to realize a significant reduction in interest expense, which I'll cover in the guidance. Also last week, we announced for the seventh consecutive year an increase in our dividend, raising it 20% to $1.20 per share annually.
Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. We plan to use operating cash flow to fund organic growth, including programming, reduce our leverage and invest strategically through M&A both domestically and internationally. We will also continue to evaluate the opportunity to repurchase our shares under the existing board authorized repurchase program, which has $1.5 billion remaining.
And finally, before opening it up for questions, I will provide our full year 2017 guidance. All guidance is based on total company adjusted results. As a result of the healthy demand for our networks in viewers and advertisers alike, both in the U.S. and internationally, we expect 2017 revenue growth to be approximately 6%. Additionally, within its anticipated revenue growth, we expect to generate positive distribution revenue growth beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and we expect the distribution revenue rate -- growth rate will increase during the year.
On the expense side. The cost of services rate of growth is expected to moderate and be in the mid-single-digit level for the full year. However, based on current premier schedules in terms of quarterly pacing, we should realize high single-digit percentage growth in the first half of the year and a slowdown in the second half.
For SG&A expenses and consistent with our long-term strategic focus to deliver content that is consumed on a variety of platforms, devices and distribution platforms, we plan to invest an incremental $30 million to $40 million in various growth initiatives. These include short-form mobile and millennial-focused content for digital platforms, related marketing programs, technology and data collection and analytics. As a result of our anticipated revenue growth, partially offset by increased support costs, we expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 3%. Excluding the incremental investment and future growth, we would expect adjusted segment profit to increase approximately 6% for 2017 and consistent with our revenue growth.
We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $155 million to $160 million. This includes purchase price amortization, which we will include for the full year reported numbers going forward.
We expect interest expense to be approximately $100 million. And finally, we expect our tax rate to be in the 30% to 32% range for the year.
Overall, we expect to deliver strong growth in 2017 as we continue to make important investments in high-quality content, data and multi-platform opportunities.
And with that, we will open up the call for your questions."

I don't want to use -- I don't necessarily want to classify it as escapism in this day and age, but beautiful homes, beautiful food, beautiful travel locations. There's a certain elegance to the simplicity of what we do. Having said that, what's really been beneficial to us, as the evolution of different platforms and different opportunities have come along, they're bringing us new ways to utilize our content. Then honestly, when Burton and folks like I were sitting around thinking about this network and these brands 20 years ago, we didn't necessarily realize that we'd be able to recycle this content in so many different ways. And that's brought us new revenue opportunities. Now having said all of that, it's much harder to do than it looks. And I give Burton and Kathleen Finch and all the people on the content side, both linear and digital, and Jim on the international side a lot of credit with focus and consistency. And then I think it helps that we've had a good track record with our advertisers. They know that when they give us their valuable advertising dollars, they're going to get results. And I think the same on our distribution partners. So a little bit of a long-winded answer, but it gives me just a chance to talk about, I think, why we have had the consistent revenue and audience ratings delivery that we've had.

We have been fortunate through our distribution team in getting distribution on all the virtual MVPDs that have been announced, whether broad bundles or skinnier bundles, certainly for our broadly distributed networks. And then there are tiers on those services. Our digital networks are on those tiers. We're talking to everybody else who's considering launching a virtual MVPD. And our thought on this is that really the dynamics should be consistent with viewing on regular MVPDs. The live nature of our content and the viewing of our content is really no accident. We program our networks so that once you tune in, there's a similarity in the kinds of programs you see that makes it almost like on demand, except you don't have to do any work. You sit back and just watch the shows that roll over you and you enjoy them, as Ken said in his previous answer. That dynamic continuous in virtual MVPD platforms no matter what the size of the bundle is. And in terms of scripted entertainment versus what we do, there's a lot of scripted entertainment out there. There is really a more focused amount of really high-quality lifestyle content in categories of home, food and travel, and we're the place to go for that. So we think we are in a very good position when it comes to any kinds of virtual MVPDs or smaller packages. Remember, we are essentially a skinny bundle already. We're a bundle of lifestyle networks that work well together. And that's why we've been getting distribution on all these virtual MVPDs that have been announced."

So since you reported, November/December must have improved quite a bit. And then I look at the scatter pricing over the upfront this quarter, and I think, what, low to mid-20s. So it seems that it improved quite a bit November/December and then it's come down a bit. Obviously strong numbers throughout. But does that really make sense? Is there any story to tell behind the ebbs and flows of the scatter market?"

And so when we're looking at these incremental investments, we see a real upside now that I think we have more confidence in probably than ever before, and the Scripps Lifestyle Studios is a very good example. So I view this really as investing in what we're already seeing and experience from what advertisers are expecting. And that's not only more credibility in the results, and I also mean in data collection and in ratings, but also on the digital side as we're packaging, whether it's Dream Home Giveaway, whether it's 30- and 60-second spots with social media combined with mobile media, a need to continue to invest and put some money on the table. I mean, if you look at the overall, Doug, you can say, ""Gee, Ken, why not more? Why just $30 million or $40 million?"" And I think it's now, Doug, to the point in our maturation where we're very comfortable at this kind of money each year, is a good investment in the future of a multi-platform kind of delivery system. And it -- we don't have all the answers yet. I don't think anybody does. But what we're seeing is we collect more data, we get more information, more upside.

So this initial data investment is a way to be able to get our arms around it. In terms of the creation of short-form digital content, we make the vast majority of that in-house very inexpensively. So a relatively small amount of dollars goes a very long way in creating some hundreds and hundreds of assets. So I think what we're doing is being very good about capitalizing on the success that we've seen over the last year with our Scripps Lifestyle Studios but doing it in a measured way. And I expect that we'll continue to see this investment. But we also expect to see some payoff from it in terms of continued growth in digital advertising dollars."

But the good news is the bulk of the TV Everywhere viewing that we referred to is through connected devices on the television, and so that viewing does get measured. In addition, after day 3, we do dynamic ad insertion in our own TV Everywhere apps and obviously in our own owned and operated websites and social media platforms. That all gets measured because we have all the data from those platforms. So because of the live viewing and because of what's going on in terms of the increase of our short-form digital viewing and because of TV Everywhere viewing being mainly through connected devices, I would say there's not a vast amount for us that's slipping through the cracks.

To your point, I mean, we're -- we right now feel like we're, I think, in very good shape because of the growth that we've seen in millennials in all of our categories. And of course this is coming predominantly from social media. But you've heard me refer to this before. There's a certain lifestyle change, I don't want to say it's 30 years of age, but let's talk about the home category. We're seeing engagement among millennials who, as they've aged over the past several years, have grown into our linear television viewing. What's been interesting about that, Mike, is they have continued to use social media and engagement in a way that our traditional audience in the past hasn't. So it's a new type of viewer coming in. And to Vasily's question earlier about live viewing, what we're finding, in nonfiction viewing there's a lot more engagement. There's a lot more of live, ""Did you see this? Which home do you think they're going to choose?"" By the way, on Chopped, I know they're going to -- this is the missing ingredient."" Whereas scripted, there's less of an opportunity while the actual show is going on to interact. So I think in the next 2 years, in your time window, we're going to see more emphasis on the engagement part of it, more on the information part of it. ""Are you watching the show? What are you -- where did they get that particular sink in the kitchen? Where did this come from?"" Dream Home Giveaway, which we just wrapped up, which will be another record-breaking Dream Home, no doubt, as far as entries and level of participation, this is something we've seen grow year after year after year, and that's the amount of information that people are taking out of these shows. So I think if you look out 2 years, I'm very encouraged about where we're positioned and how we're taking our content to these new platforms and how consumers are going to use it. It gets back to, we've just got to be there when they're there, because if not, another brand or another entity might. So it's hard to just run to stay in place, if you will. But that's kind of the next 2 years. It's doing what we're doing and then making sure these new consumers and new viewers are really getting the experience, if you will, from our content that they're expecting."

So probably for Burton, on the revenue side, just taking some figures from your press release, I think you talked about over 5 billion impressions delivered last year. You also disclosed $150 million approximately of digital revenues. I don't know if those map exactly, but if they do, it's about a $30 CPM, if my math is right, which seems to make sense. But you also said 800 or so billion -- million impressions delivered in January. So if I were to annualize that, that's up like double over the year, and that's if the run rate stays where it is. So am I thinking about that right in terms of how revenue might grow just from those couple facts and figures on the digital side? And then, Lori, the sort of related follow-up is, obviously that maps some degree to the $30 million or $40 million we're been talking about. But just more broadly, if we're talking about doubling impressions, how does that scale in terms of, is that more content required to drive those extra impressions?

And the reason is because our digital ad revenue isn't all video revenue. We still get a substantial portion of our digital ad revenue from display advertising from our websites and the mobile access to those websites. So your math can't be calculated quite the way you did. That said, the reason we're doing so much investing in terms of time, energy and resources into digital video is because of the tremendous growth that we're seeing in the audience consumption of it and the advertiser demand. So over time, we do see a shift to more of our ad revenue on the digital side coming from those video ad impressions and a smaller percentage coming from display. And I think, Todd, that would be true across the industry. So that's what we're setting ourselves up for. And then in terms of just the number of impressions, this is a really interesting process that our Scripps Lifestyle Studios is engaged in and has been for the year or so that we've been actively involved in this. It is not necessarily true that we have to make ever more hundreds and hundreds of digital videos every month. And the reason for that is our goal is to create a dynamic where our audiences share those videos to a -- at a much higher rate so that actually, over time, we may be able to get more and more views with fewer videos as we learn the ones that drive the most sharing. So that's what we're in the process of doing. And we like where we are right now with 300 to 400 new digital videos a month driving these kinds of impressions. But I'm not sure it'll always stay that way. We're in a learning process right now. So I hope that gives some greater color to what we're trying to do here and the learning process that's underway.

We continue to look at opportunities internationally to expand our brands, and we look at those opportunities as they arise. And then I would say more bolt-on around the digital space, millennial space on the domestic and international fronts. So those continue to be opportunities. Again, I think valuation has become problematic, but that doesn't mean we don't invest. And of course, we do, do some investing in early-stage companies to participate in that way. As far as credit ratings, we like investment grade, so we continue to monitor that. I think if you looked in your -- listened to the comments, we're getting -- we're delevering. We're getting into that comfortable range that gives us a lot more flexibility to be opportunistic when it comes to M&A and also do some organic growth through the P&L. So again, I think our debt levels are getting in a very comfortable range, and we will continue to look at opportunities, even returning it to shareholders over time.

It's fairly comparable with last year. So in our guidance right now I would say FX comparable with last year. But if that changes, that will have a negative or positive impact on our earnings, depending on which way the FX goes.

The best example that we've had in the last few years was House Hunters, which we went from a regular sort of order to hundreds of them every year because we certainly reap the benefits of that programming investment in increased advertising revenue. That doesn't come along very often. So I would say basically the number of hours we're at is about where we're going to be."

Good morning, everyone. Always happy you're able to be with us today.

Good morning, everyone. Always happy you're able to be with us today. 
The momentum we saw in 2016 has continued into 2017 as we further implement our strategy of strengthening our core businesses, building our reach but most importantly, monetizing our audiences. In the first quarter of this year, total operating revenue grew 5%. Adjusted segment profit increased 6%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $1.53. 
Our unwavering focus on building deep and enduring connections with upscale consumers everywhere through compelling lifestyle content of the Home, Food and Travel categories and our ability to monetize that relationship with advertisers and distributors is really what drives our consistent performance. Our proven strategy for creating compelling programming, focusing on ideas, information and inspiration has uniquely positioned Scripps Networks Interactive in the minds of viewers, advertisers and platforms alike. 
23 years ago, we created a cable network company. Now in 2017, we are a comprehensive lifestyle content business that relentlessly pursues deeper engagement with consumers everywhere regardless of device or geography. Our lifestyle-leading brands are at the heart of Scripps Networks Interactive. And I'm happy to say that we continue to deliver great performance in our core businesses. Our networks continue to resonate with consumers now more than ever. 
We have seen consistent strength in ratings, and we're continuing to strengthen our core business through investment in programming and we can see that pay off in our results. But as I've said, we're now more than just a television company. Three announcements that we made just this week underpin our strategic focus on expanding our reach through new platforms and technologies. For example, yesterday, Hulu announced that our networks will be included on their virtual MVPD product offering. Now since our network group is not among Hulu's investors, that is one clear illustration of the value distribution partners place on the audience that we deliver and the value that we offer to businesses seeking to establish themselves with a mainstream audience. The addition of Hulu means that our networks will be available on almost every one of our virtual MVPD skinny-bundle offers announced so far. 
We're also excited to partner with each of these companies as we bring our highly sought-after brands to new audiences through these streaming platforms. Yesterday, we also announced that we acquired next-generation food media company, Spoon University. Spoon use a company created by millennials for millennials, and we expect this acquisition to help build our content, community and brand as we accelerate our digital strategy and reach with younger audiences. 
And just this morning, we announced that we've expanded our relationship with Snapchat, enabling us to create original, short-form show concepts specifically for that platform. Food Networks' launch on Snapchat's Discover platform in January 2015 was fundamental to our development as a digital content company, helping us to become much more agile. 
Our digital content division, Scripps Lifestyle Studios, has become the one-stop shop for all digital content, leading the way for digital and video integration. We've demonstrated incredible video and social growth over the last year as well. The Lifestyle Studios generated nearly 2.9 billion video views. That's an increase of about 450% over the first quarter of 2016, really a remarkable achievement and just one example of our determination to expand our reach across all devices. 
Regardless of whether consumers are watching the Property Brothers on television on HGTV or seeing Andrew Zimmern on Facebook or peeking behind the scenes of Iron Chef on their mobile phone, we're always looking to make sure we deliver a consistent and rewarding experience. 
We've created a highly differentiated environment within the current media landscape. Our networks provide an opportunistic environment where consumers are open receiving advertising messages and importantly, act on those messages. This translates to strong financial results, with our network group consistently delivering advertising growth. The use as seen from our recent very successful upfront presentations, environment matters. The environment we cultivate for our distributors, combined with the growing strength of our brands, satisfies the viewing desires of their customers and creates value for the distribution's business model. For those reasons, our networks have become essential to the leading multichannel providers. As well as reaching agreements with virtual MVPD player such Hulu, we continue to make significant progress and deals more traditional platforms. For example, over the last several months, we've executed long-term renewals with a number of our distribution partners and have now renegotiated nearly 80% of our subscriber base for the next several years. We're not just focused on creating engaging viewing environments in the United States but also throughout the world. TVN continues to deliver solid growth across its portfolio, increasing revenue, audience levels and market share. HGTV in Poland continues to outperform even our own high expectations and provides a platform to debut in more European markets over the coming years. We actively engage in partnership discussions with some of the biggest media groups in key markets about launching networks or branded blocks of content. Our success in countries such as Poland really reinforces our value to those potential partners. 
With important launches of our networks also come out in markets, including Germany and Italy, we're clearly demonstrating our commitment to expanding our geographic reach. Let me close by restating that over 20 years ago, we started to create and own lifestyle programming, focusing on ideas, information and inspiration, or as Burton Jablin said when he coined it, the 3 Is. It's created a unique viewing environment. We set out to ensure this content was available wherever and whenever viewers want to consume it. At the last it continues to pay off on linear television, on digital platforms and internationally. It's a strategy that deserve this very well. We continue to optimize our business across all areas as we focus on enhancing shareholder value for the long term. Today's results are another demonstration of that commitment. 
Now let me turn it over to Burton, who'll review some of our first quarter operating results. Martin?"

Scripps Networks Interactive continues to perform at a high level, benefiting from our continued investment and focus on delivering engaging contents across all brands. Following up on the theme that Ken spoke about,2012 approach to delivering a differentiated and engaging environment was highlighted in a recent study conducted by Nielsen. The results of the study indicated advertising messages were viewed 22% more favorably in our lifestyle environment than for general entertainment, reality, sports or news. Nielsen also determined that viewers were on average 94% more engaged with the commercial view on our lifestyle -- in our lifestyle environment than in the other genres. Compared with sports programming, lifestyle performed 150% better, and against news programming, 172%. Those results demonstrate that environment really matters. The engaging environment we create, coupled with the popularity of our must-have lifestyle brands, continues to pay off in our quarterly results. 
In the first quarter of 2017, under a devolving landscape, 5 of our 6 U.S. networks posted year-over-year gains for adults 25-54 in sales prime rating. In addition, 5 of our 6 networks grew or were in line for key total day ratings.
When it comes to home, viewers look to us for how to buy it, build it, share it and love it. At HGTV, the network delivered its second highest-rated quarter ever. HGTV was ranked as the #1 network for women in both sales prime and weekend time period with solid delivery from hit series Fixer Upper, Flip or Flop and Property Brothers, helping to drive to the quarter. Our programming team have a knack for building on what works, and so we franchised our successful shows Flip or Flop to include several new couples in new cities. Flip or Flop Vegas premiered April 7 to strong viewership and ratings and has continued to deliver rating success each week since. 
Our creative teams also have another new hit on their hands with Hometown, which premiered in the first quarter as the second highest-rated show on HGTV for adults 25-54 sales time, behind only our hit, Fixer Upper. In April, the positive momentum from these premieres helped positioned HGTV as the #1 cable network for women 25-54 and the #6 network for adults 25-54. HGTV also finished April as the #1 cable network in weekends. 
The demand for Food content continues to grow. And for Food Network, our programming has never been more relevant to the lives of consumers. In the first quarter of 2017, Food Networks' ratings were even with 2016 for adults 25-54 while improving 4% among both women 25-54 and women 18-49. Leading shows in the quarter were Worst Cooks in America and Kids Baking Championship. 
Returning to Food Network. For the first time in more than 3 years is the icon of cooking shows, Iron Chef. In its premiere episode on April 16, Iron Chef Gauntlet was the highest-rated Scripps Networks show that week, and follow-up episodes continue to generate high marks for the network. 
Travel Channel finished the quarter with adult 25-54 ratings, up 9% for sales prime, making it the highest-rated quarter since the first quarter of 2014. Travel Channel continues to build momentum off a successful programming slate, which includes premieres of Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, Mysteries at the Museum, and Bizarre Foods, Delicious Destinations. 
DIY Network continues to deliver ratings growth across its key demos with ratings up 4% for adults 25-54. Key shows included Texas Flip and Move, Building Alaska and Homes and Homes. At Cooking Channel, the network again delivered its highest rating quarter ever for adults sales prime, including 18% year-over-year. Driving the growth were original series [indiscernible] Dinner at Tiffany's and Food Fact or Fiction. 
Great American Country is a great complement to the Scripps lifestyle portfolio with content that powers our audience's passion for outdoor pursuits. In the first quarter of 2017, the network posted its highest rating since 2007, marking 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth. 
Our strategy to deliver consistent, engaging and quality content 7 nights a week continues to pay off. With premieres every night of the week, viewers will always have a reason to return to our networks. 
Scripps Lifestyle Studios continues to lead engagement and broaden our reach on dozens of digital and mobile platforms. In the first quarter of 2017, Scripps Lifestyle Studios averaged more than 430 million monthly unique visitors across multiple platforms. The team produced more than 1,000 videos in the first quarter of this year. As Ken mentioned, video views in the quarter were up to almost 3 billion, and we continue to see significant growth as we move into the second quarter. 
We continue to look for new ways to engage younger audiences. The agreement we announced today with Snapchat will enable us to bring original short-form food and home-related shows to the platform. This partnership allows us to further bridge our television brands to digital and create unique content tailored for the next generation of food and home enthusiasts. 
Our TV Everywhere apps are showing significant growth in both video plays as well as user visits. Video plays in the first quarter increased more than 360%, and average monthly visits include 42% compared to 2016. The base is small, but we're pleased with the momentum TV Everywhere is showing. 
In April, after generating more than 1 billion views, Food Network ranked #1 among Tubular Labs' food and drink category, topping TasteMade, Delish and BuzzFeed's Tasty. Our All-Star promotions team came together to create the ultimate seaside getaway for the 2017 HGTV Dream Home Giveaway. The annual sweepstakes received an all-time high of 131 million entries in the first quarter. 
Internationally, our brands continue to deliver. The first quarter was another strong quarter for TVN with ratings for the group improving nearly 6% with its key 16-49 year old audience compared to the first quarter of 2016. TVN, the main network, achieved a market share of nearly 13%, making it the most-watched television station in Poland for persons 16-49. TVN 24 was the most-watched 24-hour news channel in Poland, and TVN Style was the #1 lifestyle channel during the quarter. HGTV in Poland continues to build momentum as more and more audiences tune into its lifestyle programming. After launching earlier this week, HGTV is the #2 lifestyle network in the country among women 16-49, second only to TVN Style. 
For its just completed fiscal year, UKTV delivered record financial results, growing revenue 8% and EBITDA 11%, both in local currency. The multichannel broadcaster also grew its share of viewing 10% over the prior year. We remain focused on growing our footprint in new markets. Most recently, we announced that Food Network will launch in Italy on May 8. This will be the first dedicated multiplatform food and entertainment channel in the country and will offer a mix of local original productions and our flagship shows. This launch in a key growth market for our company represents a significant milestone in our ongoing global expansion. Quarter-after-quarter, Scripps Networks Interactive delivers consistent and improving operating results. We're pleased with our performance today in 2017. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Lori, who'll review and detail our financial performance for the first quarter of 2017."
6469353,424185681,1189671,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I'll focus my comment today on the quarterly consolidated numbers and discuss our operating segment performance. Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 5% to $855 million compared with the prior",984,"Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I'll focus my comment today on the quarterly consolidated numbers and discuss our operating segment performance. 
Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 5% to $855 million compared with the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, distribution revenue growth and growth in our international businesses. As a result of our revenue growth, coupled with the modest increase in expenses due to timing, consolidated adjusted segment profit improved 6%. The growth in adjusted segment profit, coupled with lower depreciation, amortization and interest expense as well as increase in foreign exchange transaction gain, increased our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.53 compared with $1.29 in the prior year quarter. 
Looking at our operating segment. Our U.S. networks' revenue increased 5%. This improvement was driven by growth in advertising demand for our lifestyle network and the expected increase in distribution revenue. U.S. advertising revenue increased 5% [ph] year-over-year in the first quarter due to CPM pricing increases, partially offset by an increase and overall decrease in impressions and a pricing mix shift away from higher-priced scatter inventory compared with the first quarter of 2016. 
Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPMs up mid- to high-teens year-over-year and up high-teens to mid-20% over the broadcast upfront. our top 5 advertising category during the quarter was food, retail, consumer package goods, financial and pharma. These categories are consistent with historical performance for the first quarter, except for pharma, which improved over 2016. 
The healthy demand for scatter has continued into the second quarter of 2017, although quarter-over-quarter DCM pricing increases have tempered somewhat in the first month of the quarter, especially compared to the strong CPM increases realized in the second quarter of last year. 
Presently against tough comp, scatter-over-scatter CPM growth is running in the low single to low double-digit range, and scatter over up CPM growth is running in the mid- to high-teens range. Additionally, we are presently seeing an unprecedented strong second wave of scatter demand in the quarter. During the period of scattered inventory and demand is lower. 
This wave of demand that would and should drive CPM pricing higher than what we are currently experiencing for the second quarter. Also included in our overall advertising revenue is our growing digital advertising business, which improved the healthy 12% over the first quarter of last year. This growth was partially offset by revenue decreases related to the strategic decision to discontinue our Netflix relationship and refocus our digital assets from Hulu.com to other more economically attractive digital efforts. 
Including these setbacks, our overall digital revenue increased 4% compared with the prior year first quarter. Distribution revenue to the U.S. networks increased 4.5%. Contributing to this anticipated increase where negotiated rate increases and redistribution related to the over-the-top virtual MVPD platform. These increases were partially offset by industry subscriber decline. As a result of the increase in revenue, coupled with a modest increase in spending due to timing, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. networks increased 6% compared for the prior year quarter.
Looking ahead, we expect spending to increase in the second and third quarter, increasing in the midteens compared with the prior year for both quarters. Driving this growth will be increase in programming related to [indiscernible] schedule coupled with higher SG&A spending related to the strategic growth various initiatives we spoke about during our February earnings call. 
For the international segment, the majority of our revenue was generated by TVN. In local currency, TVN revenue increased 4% compared with the same time a year ago. On a reported basis, international networks revenues increased 3.5% to $125.5 million. Driven by the revenue growth and relatively flat expenses, international adjusted segment profit increased to $15.5 million compared with the $10 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
In addition to our consolidated international business, a significant portion of our international business is recorded in equity income. These investments include UKTV and our partnership with [indiscernible] in Canada for Food Networks, Cooking Channel, HGTV and DIY Network, along with some TVN minority investment. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $20 million, down from $26 million in the prior year quarter. Driving the year-over-year decrease was the sale of FOX Sports South in the first quarter of 2016 and decreased contribution from the a TVN minority investment. These declines were partially offset by a double-digit percentage growth at UKTV. Additionally, subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2017, we announced the sale of a minority investment in [indiscernible] a nonstrategic asset for $54 million. This minority asset was not a material contributor to equity and earnings of affiliates. 
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the first quarter approximately 2.3x gross leverage, down from 2.6x at the end of the fourth quarter due to our strong free cash flow generation. Our capital allocation priority remain consistent, and we plan to use capital and operating cash flow to fund organic growth, including programming, new capabilities and multiplatform business model as well as investor strategically to M&A both domestically and internationally and to reduce our leverage. We will also continue to evaluate the opportunity to repurchase our sales under the existing board authorization, which has $1.5 billion remaining. 
Finally, there is no change in our previously issued full year guidance. As I indicated earlier, based on current programming schedules and strategic growth initiatives spending, we expect to see increased expenses in the second and third quarters. This will drive overall expense growth in the low to the double-digit range in each quarter compared with the prior year. Overall, we continue to expect to deliver solid growth in 2017 as we make important investments in high-quality content, data and multiplatform opportunities. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Ken."

So before we take Q&A in just a couple of minutes, I wanted to step back for a moment, offer a couple of observations, if I may. It's very clear that this is an industry that's undergoing significant change as consumer behavior continues to evolve. The companies, in my opinion, that will be successful for the long term are those that can optimize their business to take full advantage of the opportunities that technology and behavioral transformation offer us. Fortunately, adapting and changing is something that Scripps Networks Interactive really has at its very core. We've had it since day one. That's why I'm so confident in the long-term vision of this company. For example, the steps that we've taken just in the last few days are a demonstration of how we take a set of cable TV networks and ownership of our content and created a global lifestyle content business. It's a business that's taking active steps to grow, to respond to demand and build the brightest possible future. 
As we mentioned previously, yesterday, Hulu announced that our networks will be on their live TV service from launch, making us the only cable network group not owned by Hulu shareholders to be included. That's a ringing endorsement of our brands and the value that they bring to advertisers and distributors. And just a few hours later, we announced the acquisition of Spoon University, a next-generation food media company founded by 2 millennials who actually grew up watching Food Network. I guess it's the demonstration of our commitment to really never sit still and always find ways to stay relevant with our audiences. 
And then this morning, we announced our expanded relationships with Snapchat, with a commitment to create shows on their platform to build on the successful food and home franchises we built on our TV networks. That's an indication of the way we have revolutionized our processes to become a number production house that can take advantage of audience and advertising opportunities within hours, not months. So around the globe, we're growing, we're developing. Our linear networks are entering new markets and capturing audiences every month. Our social teams are creating more videos and content than ever before. And we've gone from 10s of millions of views per quarter to almost 3 billion. 
Change is not easy, but at Scripps Networks Interactive, we regard it as a necessity. That's why the fundamentals of our business are so strong. That's why we continue to grow and that's why I continue, as such, resounding faith in the long-term success of this business. 
So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your question this morning. Operator?"

It was really about getting bigger by thinking smaller, and it's the lessons we never forgotten. So now we're a successful cable networks but very successful brands, how can we partner, how can we, as Burton says, go beyond our core audiences to younger audiences that are not necessarily on linear television. And the real way to do it is to partner with Snapchat, with Facebook, on and on and on. And we think it'll pay off in the long term. And I think sometimes we just don't get the credit for some of the expanding beyond the core linear television business because it doesn't show immediate payoff on the bottom line. But I'm hopeful like ideas of the cable networks that certainly were beneficial to the growth of the W. Scripps Co. Some of these small investments and small partnerships we're making now will benefit SNI over the long term. And Lori, you want to take Laura's question about ratings?"

So the first quarter was a little bit, I will call it an anomaly, but I don't think we team up much live viewing in a quarter unless you come up with something like the Olympics or some big events.

I mean, these are things that affect us. We don't pay a lot of attention to competition, but there was a big hit NBC this year on Tuesday nights called This is Us, airing against one of our biggest hits, Fixer Upper. And we did see an impact there. Now once This is Us went out of premiere, we saw Fixer Upper do just fine. So again, these were specific things. News viewing comparison to first quarter last year, not fundamentally huge with HGTV at all.

But I wouldn't say we're not looking for, like, huge jump from quarter-to-quarter. We just think it's going to gain some strength.

John, let's start with your first question relative to advertising categories endemics, et cetera. So you have to separate a little bit -- a lot of what's going on in retail as far as real estate in stores from advertising budgets. Because quite honestly, if you look at our categories and endemics, we haven't seen much of a change. I'm looking across the table at Lori to make sure that we're in total agreement. I don't have the information in front of me. But Lori, in the categories in consumer products, et cetera, autos, financial is pretty consistent from what we've seen from fourth quarter to first quarter and even trending beyond that. Having said that and, John, I think the structure that we always layer the endemics end. If you go back several years ago, it was a bigger percentage, if you will, of our overall advertising. Fortunately, as we've grown, it becomes smaller. But I have to say, it's really helpful to have that. Because when you have the home improvements, when you have the consumer products that are tilted towards the home and food categories, it's part of the reason that we, I think, are consistent as we are in the advertising market. But I think the easy answer is, there's not a significant change that we're seeing at this point depending on where retail goes and store closings and all those kinds of thing. But if anything, some of that money, in a couple of instance, we've actually had seen shift to advertising where there's maybe more advertising dollars freed up and less around retail locations. And I think -- and talking to Steve Gelati, that's a trend we expect to see continuing. That's why, John, we're expending more into the digital areas as well and trying to get the bigger piece of that advertising budget. Lori, you want to take John's second question?

And the second, I'll just put right on the floor, the second is a more strategic question maybe for Burton or Ken. Burton, you talked about the differentiated engaging environment for advertising and how important that was for you. That seems to contrast to me actually directly with what some of your peers are saying when you think about maybe something like this open AP interface, which seems to be sort of this aggregating the sale of audience from the surrounding context and environment and basically could argue just commoditizing the audience. Just interested your point of view with that trend to end here what you think about the compare and contrast there, and how you think selling your context net audience insulates you and gives you an advantage as the industry grows up and down the ratings goes ups and down?"

But when you're a company like ours that from the beginning has been in specific categories where we target specific audiences in those categories upscale, educated audience, audiences who have a tendency to do what they view, as we always say, we take advantage of that differentiation. In the world of other kinds of content, that is less differentiated, whether it's scripted content or other kinds of reality programs where it's not clear what the differences between one network and another in terms of their focus. That becomes harder and easier to commoditize, as you put it. And then on the digital side, we see the same bifurcation going on, programmatic buying, which we do. We engage in it to make sure we're filling all of our inventory. But the real interesting area for us are the what we call high touch digital advertising deals where we really do work with marketers to create really, specific, hopefully, 360-degree cross-platform buys that capitalize on the specificity of our audience, the targeted nature of our content and the environment we create. So both exist in this world, there's no question. In some places, we play in both worlds, particularly digitally. But we think that differentiation is a real advantage for us. And the more the rest of the market commoditizes, we think we haven't even more of an advantage by being targeted."

We went from probably low double-digit increases in scatter-versus-scatter in Q1 of last year until we were almost high-teens to 20% year-over-year. So we really saw that scatter pricing take a huge bump in the second quarter. So it wasn't overall. It was really -- I was meaning to highlight that the scatter pricing marketplace really got extremely hot in the second quarter of last year. As for as unprecedented wave, I was talking with Steve Gelati just yesterday, I usually, by this time, maybe going into the upfront.

In the first quarter of this year, total operating revenue grew 5%. Adjusted segment profit increased 6%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $1.53. 
Our unwavering focus on building deep and enduring connections with upscale consumers everywhere through compelling lifestyle content in the Home, Food and Travel categories and our ability to monetize that relationship with advertisers and distributors is really what drives our consistent performance. Our proven strategy for creating compelling programming, focusing on ideas, information and inspiration has uniquely positioned Scripps Networks Interactive in the minds of viewers, advertisers and platforms alike. 
23 years ago, we created a cable network company. Now in 2017, we are a comprehensive lifestyle content business that relentlessly pursues deeper engagement with consumers everywhere regardless of device or geography. Our lifestyle-leading brands are at the heart of Scripps Networks Interactive. And I'm happy to say that we continue to deliver great performance in our core businesses. Our networks continue to resonate with consumers now more than ever. 
We have seen consistent strength in ratings, and we're continuing to strengthen our core business through investment in programming and we can see that pay off in our results. But as I've said, we're now more than just a television company. Three announcements that we made just this week underpin our strategic focus on expanding our reach through new platforms and technologies. For example, yesterday, Hulu announced that our networks will be included on their virtual MVPD product offering. Now since our network group is not among Hulu's investors, that is one clear illustration of the value distribution partners place on the audience that we deliver and the value that we offer to businesses seeking to establish themselves with a mainstream audience. The addition of Hulu means that our networks will be available on almost every one of the virtual MVPD skinny-bundle offers announced so far. 
We're also excited to partner with each of these companies as we bring our highly sought-after brands to new audiences through these streaming platforms. Yesterday, we also announced that we acquired next-generation food media company, Spoon University. Spoon University is a company created by millennials for millennials, and we expect this acquisition to help us build our content, community and brand as we accelerate our digital strategy and reach with younger audiences. 
And just this morning, we announced that we've expanded our relationship with Snapchat, enabling us to create original, short-form show concepts specifically for that platform. Food Networks' launch on Snapchat's Discover platform in January 2015 was fundamental to our development as a digital content company, helping us to become much more agile. 
Our digital content division, Scripps Lifestyle Studios, has become the one-stop shop for all digital content, leading the way for digital and video integration. We've demonstrated incredible video and social growth over the last year as well. The Lifestyle Studios generated nearly 2.9 billion video views. That's an increase of about 450% over the first quarter of 2016, really a remarkable achievement and just one example of our determination to expand our reach across all devices. 
Regardless of whether consumers are watching the Property Brothers on television on HGTV or seeing Andrew Zimmern on Facebook or peeking behind the scenes of Iron Chef Gauntlet on their mobile phone, we're always looking to make sure we deliver a consistent and rewarding experience. 
We've created a highly differentiated environment within the current media landscape. Our networks provide an optimistic environment where consumers are open to receiving advertising messages and importantly, act on those messages. This translates to strong financial results, with our network group consistently delivering advertising growth. To use a scene from our recent very successful upfront presentations, environment matters. The environment we cultivate for our distributors, combined with the growing strength of our brands, satisfies the viewing desires of their customers and creates value for the distribution's business model. For those reasons, our networks have become essential to the leading multichannel providers. As well as reaching agreements with virtual MVD players such Hulu, we continue to make significant progress and deals with more traditional platforms. For example, over the last several months, we've executed long-term renewals with a number of our distribution partners and have now renegotiated nearly 80% of our subscriber base for the next several years. We're not just focused on creating engaging viewing environments in the United States but also throughout the world. TVN continues to deliver solid growth across its portfolio, increasing revenue, audience levels and market share. HGTV in Poland continues to outperform even our own high expectations and provides a platform to debut in more European markets over the coming years. We're actively engaged in partnership discussions with some of the biggest media groups in key markets about launching networks or branded blocks of content. Our success in countries such as Poland really reinforces our value to those potential partners. 
With important launches of our networks also come up in markets, including Germany and Italy, we're clearly demonstrating our commitment to expanding our geographic reach. Let me close by restating that over 20 years ago, we started to create and own lifestyle programming, focusing on ideas, information and inspiration, or as Burton Jablin said when he coined it, the 3 Is. It's created a unique viewing environment. We set out to ensure this content was available wherever and whenever viewers wanted to consume it. At the last it continues to pay off on linear television, on digital platforms and internationally. It's a strategy that has served us very well. We continue to optimize our business across all areas as we focus on enhancing shareholder value for the long term. Today's results are another demonstration of that commitment. 
Now let me turn it over to Burton, who'll review some of our first quarter operating results. Burton?"

Scripps Networks Interactive continues to perform at a high level, benefiting from our continued investment and focus on delivering engaging contents across all brands. Following up on the theme that Ken spoke about, our approach to delivering a differentiated and engaging environment was highlighted in a recent study conducted by Nielsen. The results of the study indicated advertising messages were viewed 22% more favorably in our lifestyle environment than for general entertainment, reality, sports or news. Nielsen also determined that viewers were on average 94% more engaged with the commercial view on our lifestyle -- in our lifestyle environment than in the other genres. Compared with sports programming, lifestyle performed 150% better, and against news programming, 172%. Those results demonstrate that environment really matters. The engaging environment we create, coupled with the popularity of our must-have lifestyle brands, continues to pay off in our quarterly results. 
In the first quarter of 2017, amid an evolving landscape, 5 of our 6 U.S. networks posted year-over-year gains for adults 25-54 in sales prime rating. In addition, 5 of our 6 networks grew or were in line for key total day ratings.
When it comes to home, viewers look to us for how to buy it, build it, share it and love it. At HGTV, the network delivered its second highest-rated quarter ever. HGTV was ranked as the #1 network for women in both sales prime and weekend time periods with solid delivery from hit series Fixer Upper, Flip or Flop and Property Brothers, helping to drive the quarter. Our programming teams have a knack for building on what works, and so we franchised our successful shows Flip or Flop to include several new couples in new cities. Flip or Flop Vegas premiered April 7 to strong viewership and ratings and has continued to deliver rating success each week since. 
Our creative teams also have another new hit on their hands with Hometown, which premiered in the first quarter as the second highest-rated show on HGTV for adults 25-54 sales prime, behind only our hit, Fixer Upper. In April, the positive momentum from these premieres helped position HGTV as the #1 cable network for women 25-54 and the #6 network for adults 25-54. HGTV also finished April as the #1 cable network in weekends. 
The demand for Food content continues to grow. And for Food Network, our programming has never been more relevant to the lives of consumers. In the first quarter of 2017, Food Networks' ratings were even with 2016 for adults 25-54 while improving 4% among both women 25-54 and women 18-49. Leading shows in the quarter were Worst Cooks in America and Kids Baking Championship. 
Returning to Food Network. For the first time in more than 3 years is the icon of cooking shows, Iron Chef. In its premiere episode on April 16, Iron Chef Gauntlet was the highest-rated Scripps Networks show that week, and follow-up episodes continue to generate high marks for the network. 
Travel Channel finished the quarter with adult 25-54 ratings, up 9% for sales prime, making it the highest-rated quarter since the first quarter of 2014. Travel Channel continues to build momentum off a successful programming slate, which includes premieres of Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, Mysteries at the Museum, and Bizarre Foods, Delicious Destinations. 
DIY Network continues to deliver ratings growth across its key demos with ratings up 4% for adults 25-54. Key shows included Texas Flip and Move, Building Alaska and Homes and Homes. At Cooking Channel, the network again delivered its highest rated quarter ever for adults sales prime, improving 18% year-over-year. Driving the growth were original series Carnival Eats, Dinner at Tiffany's and Food Fact or Fiction. 
Great American Country is a great complement to the Scripps lifestyle portfolio with content that powers our audience's passion for outdoor pursuits. In the first quarter of 2017, the network posted its highest rating since 2007, marking 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth. 
Our strategy to deliver consistent, engaging and quality content 7 nights a week continues to pay off. With premieres every night of the week, viewers will always had a reason to return to our networks. 
Scripps Lifestyle Studios continues to lead engagement and broaden our reach on dozens of digital and mobile platforms. In the first quarter of 2017, Scripps Lifestyle Studios averaged more than 430 million monthly unique visitors across multiple platforms. The team produced more than 1,000 videos in the first quarter of this year. As Ken mentioned, video views in the quarter were up to almost 3 billion, and we continue to see significant growth as we move into the second quarter. 
We continue to look for new ways to engage younger audiences. The agreement we announced today with Snapchat will enable us to bring original short-form food and home-related shows to the platform. This partnership allows us to further bridge our television brands to digital and create unique content tailored for the next generation of food and home enthusiasts. 
Our TV Everywhere apps are showing significant growth in both video plays as well as user visits. Video plays in the first quarter increased more than 360%, and average monthly visits improved 42% compared to 2016. The base is small, but we're pleased with the momentum TV Everywhere is showing. 
In April, after generating more than 1 billion views, Food Network ranked #1 among Tubular Labs' food and drink category, topping TasteMade, Delish and BuzzFeed's Tasty. Our All-Star promotions team came together to create the ultimate seaside getaway for the 2017 HGTV Dream Home Giveaway. The annual sweepstakes received an all-time high of 131 million entries in the first quarter. 
Internationally, our brands continue to deliver. The first quarter was another strong quarter for TVN with ratings for the group improving nearly 6% with its key 16-49 year old audience compared to the first quarter of 2016. TVN, the main network, achieved a market share of nearly 13%, making it the most-watched television station in Poland for persons 16-49. TVN 24 was the most-watched 24-hour news channel in Poland, and TVN Style was the #1 lifestyle channel during the quarter. HGTV in Poland continues to build momentum as more and more audiences tune into its lifestyle programming. After launching earlier this week, HGTV is the #2 lifestyle network in the country among women 16-49, second only to TVN Style. 
For its just completed fiscal year, UKTV delivered record financial results, growing revenue 8% and EBITDA 11%, both in local currency. The multichannel broadcaster also grew its share of viewing 10% over the prior year. We remain focused on growing our footprint in new markets. Most recently, we announced that Food Network will launch in Italy on May 8. This will be the first dedicated multiplatform food and entertainment channel in the country and will offer a mix of local original productions and our flagship shows. This launch in a key growth market for our company represents a significant milestone in our ongoing global expansion. Quarter-after-quarter, Scripps Networks Interactive delivers consistent and improving operating results. We're pleased with our performance today in 2017. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Lori, who'll review and detail our financial performance for the first quarter of 2017."
6469353,424185681,1190545,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I'll focus my comments today on the quarterly consolidated numbers and discuss our operating segment performance. Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 5% to $855 million compared with the prior",984,"Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I'll focus my comments today on the quarterly consolidated numbers and discuss our operating segment performance. 
Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 5% to $855 million compared with the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, distribution revenue growth and growth in our international businesses. As a result of our revenue growth, coupled with a modest increase in expenses due to timing, consolidated adjusted segment profit improved 6%. The growth in adjusted segment profit, coupled with lower depreciation, amortization and interest expense as well as increase in foreign exchange transaction gains, increased our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.53 compared with $1.29 in the prior year quarter. 
Looking at our operating segment. Our U.S. networks' revenue increased 5%. This improvement was driven by growth in advertising demand for our lifestyle networks and the expected increase in distribution revenue. U.S. advertising revenue increased 5% year-over-year in the first quarter due to CPM pricing increases, partially offset by an increase -- an overall decrease in impressions and a pricing mix shift away from higher-priced scatter inventory compared with the first quarter of 2016. 
Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPMs up mid- to high-teens year-over-year and up high-teens to mid-20% over the broadcast upfront. our top 5 advertising category during the quarter were food, retail, consumer package goods, financial and pharma. These categories are consistent with the historical performance for the first quarter, except for pharma, which improved over 2016. 
The healthy demand for scatter has continued into the second quarter of 2017, although quarter-over-quarter CPM pricing increases have tempered somewhat in the first month of the quarter, especially compared with the strong CPM increases realized in the second quarter of last year. 
Presently against tough comp, scatter-over-scatter CPM growth is running in the low single to low double-digit range, and scatter over upfront CPM growth is running in the mid- to high-teens range. Additionally, we are presently seeing an unprecedented strong second wave of scatter demand in the quarter during a period where scatter inventory and demand is normally lower. 
This wave of demand that would and should drive CPM pricing higher than what we are currently experiencing for the second quarter. Also included in our overall advertising revenue is our growing digital advertising business, which improved a healthy 12% over the first quarter of last year. This growth was partially offset by revenue decreases related to the strategic decision to discontinue our Netflix relationship and refocus our digital assets from Hulu.com to other more economically attractive digital efforts. 
Including these impacts, our overall digital revenue increased 4% compared with the prior year first quarter. Distribution revenue to the U.S. networks increased 4.5%. Contributing to this anticipated increase were negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top virtual MVPD platforms. These increases were partially offset by industry subscriber decline. As a result of the increase in revenue, coupled with a modest increase in spending due to timing, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. networks increased 6% compared with the prior year quarter.
Looking ahead, we expect spending to increase in the second and third quarter, increasing in the midteens compared with the prior year for both quarters. Driving this growth will be increases in programming related to our premiere schedule coupled with higher SG&A spending related to the various strategic growth initiatives we spoke about during our February earnings call. 
For the international segment, the majority of the revenues are generated by TVN. In local currency, TVN revenue increased 4% compared with the same time a year ago. On a reported basis, international networks revenues increased 3.5% to $125.5 million. Driven by the revenue growth and relatively flat expenses, international adjusted segment profit increased to $15.5 million compared with $10 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
In addition to our consolidated international business, a significant portion of our international business is reported in equity income. These investments include UKTV and our partnership with Corus in Canada for Food Networks, Cooking Channel, HGTV and DIY Network, along with some TVN minority investments. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $20 million, down from $26 million in the prior year quarter. Driving the year-over-year decrease was the sale of FOX Sports South in the first quarter of 2016 and decreased contribution from a TVN minority investment. These declines were partially offset by a double-digit percentage growth at UKTV. Additionally, subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2017, we announced the sale of a minority investment in Onet, a nonstrategic asset for $54 million. This minority asset was not a material contributor to equity and earnings of affiliates. 
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the first quarter approximately 2.3x gross leverage, down from 2.6x at the end of the fourth quarter due to our strong free cash flow generation. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent, and we plan to use capital and operating cash flow to fund organic growth, including programming, new capabilities and multiplatform business models as well as invest strategically through M&A both domestically and internationally and to reduce our leverage. We will also continue to evaluate the opportunity to repurchase our sales under the existing board authorization, which has $1.5 billion remaining. 
Finally, there is no change in our previously issued full year guidance. As I indicated earlier, based on current programming schedules and strategic growth initiative spending, we expect to see increased expenses in the second and third quarters. This will drive overall expense growth in the low to double-digit range in each quarter compared with the prior year. Overall, we continue to expect to deliver solid growth in 2017 as we make important investments in high-quality content, data and multiplatform opportunities. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Ken."

So before we take Q&A in just a couple of minutes, I wanted to step back for a moment, offer a couple of observations, if I may. It's very clear that this is an industry that's undergoing significant change as consumer behavior continues to evolve. The companies, in my opinion, that will be successful for the long term are those that can optimize their business to take full advantage of the opportunities that technology and behavioral transformation offer us. Fortunately, adapting and changing is something that Scripps Networks Interactive really has at its very core. We've had it since day one. That's why I'm so confident in the long-term vision of this company. For example, the steps that we've taken just in the last few days are a demonstration of how we've taken a set of cable TV networks and ownership of our content and created a global lifestyle content business. It's a business that's taking active steps to grow, to respond to demand and build the brightest possible future. 
As we mentioned previously, yesterday, Hulu announced that our networks would be on their live TV service from launch, making us the only cable network group not owned by Hulu shareholders to be included. That's a ringing endorsement of our brands and the value that they bring to advertisers and distributors. And just a few hours later, we announced the acquisition of Spoon University, a next-generation food media company founded by 2 millennials who actually grew up watching Food Network. I guess it's the demonstration of our commitment to really never sit still and always find ways to stay relevant with our audiences. 
And then this morning, we announced our expanded relationship with Snapchat, with a commitment to create shows on their platform to build on the successful food and home franchises we built on our TV networks. That's an indication of the way we have revolutionized our processes to become a #1 production house that can take advantage of audience and advertising opportunities within hours, not months. So around the globe, we're growing, we're developing. Our linear networks are entering new markets and capturing audiences every month. Our social teams are creating more videos and content than ever before. And we've gone from 10s of millions of views per quarter to almost 3 billion. 
Change is not easy, but at Scripps Networks Interactive, we regard it as a necessity. That's why the fundamentals of our business are so strong. That's why we continue to grow and that's why I continue to have such a resounding faith in the long-term success of this business. 
So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions this morning. Operator?"

In the case of Snapchat, I have to say it's been a great partnership thus far. Just in the last 12 months, we've doubled our audience on Snapchat. By now expanding into the home category, we actually see this as a partnership that is going to lead to profitability. And we don't really share a lot of the financial arrangements that we have. But I have to say that we've been very impressed with not only what we've been able to do on Snapchat but some of the anecdotal stuff that's coming from that.

So in that context, we're expanding our reach to younger audiences through Snapchat, most recently with Spoon U. And this is a process that you'll see us continue because we want to get younger people who are interested in the food category when they're young, under one of our services, maybe move them to other of our platforms. So it's part of a broader strategy."

You could remember a time when I was out begging people to give us $100 for a cable network spot because the value just wasn't there. And if you look at a lot of things that we were doing to E.W. Scripps eons ago with these little cable networks and these little investments, we had these big newspapers and television stations and all this cash flow, it was really about getting bigger by thinking smaller, and it's a lesson we've never forgotten. So now with successful cable networks but very successful brands, how can we partner, how can we, as Burton says, go beyond our core audiences to younger audiences that are not necessarily on linear television. And the real way to do it is to partner with Snapchat, with Facebook, on and on and on. And we think it'll pay off in the long term. And I think sometimes we just don't get the credit for some of the expanding beyond the core linear television business because it doesn't show immediate payoff on the bottom line. But I'm hopeful like the little ideas of the cable networks that certainly were beneficial to the growth of the E.W. Scripps Company, some of these small investments and small partnerships we're making now will benefit SNI over the long term. And Lori, you want to take Laura's question about ratings?"

It's still #1 with women 25-54, upscale women, in particular, upscale audiences. So when we analyze it, we see the specific things that Ken mentioned. And then there's one more. I mean, these are things that affect us. We don't pay a lot of attention to competition, but there was a big hit on NBC this year on Tuesday nights called This is Us, airing against one of our biggest hits, Fixer Upper. And we did see an impact there. Now once This is Us went out of premiere, we saw Fixer Upper do just fine. So again, these were specific things. News viewing in comparison to first quarter last year, not fundamental issues with HGTV at all. And I was just with our team this week talking about all the great new premieres they have coming on in the second quarter and for the rest of the year. I've just complete confidence in HGTV going forward."

And then for Lori, on the distribution side. I think you had previously said that you expect distribution growth to continue to grow throughout the year. So it sounds to me like some of the softness in industry subs is really not affecting your expectations for distribution growth in the 2Q and beyond. So is it just the case that the rate increases from your renewals are offsetting any softness in subs? And should we broadly continue to expect distribution revenue to accelerate with each successive quarters throughout the year?"

But that's what we saw and that's what we continue to see in the second quarter. On the distribution side, we, like we said in the opening comments, we are being impacted like everyone else with the distribution erosion that's continuing. We're not seeing it escalate. It's been pretty constant with what we saw last year. And yes, our pricing increases are helping to abate and offset that. And we do expect to continue to see increases throughout the year. But I wouldn't say we're not looking for, like, huge jumps from quarter-to-quarter. We just think it's going to gain some strength. But like the rest of the industry, we continue to watch the sub numbers.

John, let's start with your first question relative to advertising categories, endemics, et cetera. So you have to separate a little bit -- a lot of what's going on in retail as far as real estate in stores from advertising budgets. Because quite honestly, if you look at our categories and our endemics, we haven't seen much of a change. I'm looking across the table at Lori to make sure that we're in total agreement. I don't have the information in front of me. But Lori, in the categories in consumer products, et cetera, autos, financial is pretty consistent from what we've seen from fourth quarter to first quarter and even trending beyond that. Having said that and, John, I think the fact that we always layer the endemics in. If you go back several years ago, it was a bigger percentage, if you will, of our overall advertising fortunately, as we've grown, it has become smaller. But I have to say, it's really helpful to have that. Because when you have the home improvements, when you have the consumer products that are tilted towards the home and food categories, it's part of the reason that we, I think, are as consistent as we are in the advertising market. But I think the easy answer is, there's not a significant change that we're seeing at this point depending on where retail goes and store closings and all those kinds of things. But if anything, some of that money, in a couple of instances, we've actually had seen shift to advertising where there's maybe more advertising dollars freed up and less around retail locations. And I think -- and talking to Steve Gelati, that's a trend we expect to see continuing. That's why, John, we're expanding more into the digital areas as well in trying to get a bigger piece of that advertising budget. Lori, you want to take John's second question?

But when you're a company like ours that from the beginning has been in specific categories where we target specific audiences in those categories upscale, educated audience, audiences who have a tendency to do what they view, as we always say, we take advantage of that differentiation. In the world of other kinds of content, that is less differentiated, whether it's scripted content or other kinds of reality programs where it's not clear what the difference is between one network and another in terms of their focus. That becomes harder and easier to commoditize, as you put it. And then on the digital side, we see the same bifurcation going on, programmatic buying, which we do. We engage in it to make sure we're filling all of our inventory. But the real interesting area for us are the what we call high touch digital advertising deals where we really do work with marketers to create really, specific, hopefully, 360-degree cross-platform buys that capitalize on the specificity of our audience, the targeted nature of our content and the environment we create. So both exist in this world, there's no question. And in some places, we play in both worlds, particularly digitally. But we think the differentiation is a real advantage for us. And the more the rest of the market commoditizes, we think we have even more of an advantage by being targeted."

Again, not capabilities to go direct-to-consumer, a lot of our peers are doing that, but just capable is that you need to do that. So we're making some investments and we've talked about that. We continue to be opportunistic on the M&A side, both internationally on the digital front, Hulu being a good example of that. But on the digital side, it's not paying huge capital outlays that we see in the foreseeable future. And we continue to look out there.

It was really -- I was meaning to highlight that the scatter pricing marketplace really got extremely hot in the second quarter of last year. As for as that unprecedented wave, I was talking with Steve Gelati just yesterday, usually, by this time, and maybe as you're going into the upfront, you see a lot less activity going on, but he has got charts that show that demand, they're still knocking on the door, they're still looking to buy scatter that's usually moderating by now. He is seeing just an opposite trend, which is why we're trying to give some color to why we gave that pretty wide range that was, somebody asked a question about earlier, is that we're seeing that's probably going to tighten up and we might see some lift in strength to that. So since we won't talk to you for a few months we want to give you that color."

We had Fine Living in already, it's more home-targeted network. The exciting thing about this one, in particular, that we were able to secure a low channel position, which is extremely important in that market with channel 33. And with both of these flagship networks in place, we'll also be able to do more cross-promotion, there's been a tremendous amount of advertiser interest there. So as we look at each of these markets, Ben, for the second part of your question, we look to see, is there a high pay TV penetration, for example, in this case the answer is, no, it's much more of a broadcast network. Is there an opportunity for us to get in and get some valued real estate in order to bring in the kind of viewership which you need in a broadcast environment,  and the case was, yes. So very exciting in Italy. We also have a strong HGTV digital terrestrial presence here in Poland. And as we grow in these markets and the experience in the U.K. as well, we're able to segment our investments into sort of the digital pay television, environment, digital terrestrial, over-the-top like with the player here in Poland. And I think the key is just to change that mix supporting to where that market is, and that's been our strategy. And one other comment, the underlying thing which makes it such an exciting opportunity is that we own the content, we have a tremendous amount of output coming from the U.S. including the formats, and so we can replicate that success both with locally produced content and the content coming from the U.S."

Good morning, everyone. Always happy you're able to be with us today.

Good morning, everyone. Always happy you're able to be with us today. 
The momentum we saw in 2016 has continued into 2017 as we further implement our strategy of strengthening our core businesses, building our reach but most importantly, monetizing our audiences. In the first quarter of this year, total operating revenue grew 5%. Adjusted segment profit increased 6%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $1.53. 
Our unwavering focus on building deep and enduring connections with upscale consumers everywhere through compelling lifestyle content in the Home, Food and Travel categories and our ability to monetize that relationship with advertisers and distributors is really what drives our consistent performance. Our proven strategy for creating compelling programming, focusing on ideas, information and inspiration has uniquely positioned Scripps Networks Interactive in the minds of viewers, advertisers and platforms alike. 
23 years ago, we created a cable network company. Now in 2017, we are a comprehensive lifestyle content business that relentlessly pursues deeper engagement with consumers everywhere regardless of device or geography. Our lifestyle-leading brands are at the heart of Scripps Networks Interactive. And I'm happy to say that we continue to deliver great performance in our core businesses. Our networks continue to resonate with consumers now more than ever. 
We have seen consistent strength in ratings, and we're continuing to strengthen our core business through investment in programming and we can see that pay off in our results. But as I've said, we're now more than just a television company. Three announcements that we made just this week underpin our strategic focus on expanding our reach through new platforms and technologies. For example, yesterday, Hulu announced that our networks will be included on their virtual MVPD product offering. Now since our network group is not among Hulu's investors, that is one clear illustration of the value distribution partners place on the audience that we deliver and the value that we offer to businesses seeking to establish themselves with a mainstream audience. The addition of Hulu means that our networks will be available on almost every one of the virtual MVPD skinny-bundle offers announced so far. 
We're also excited to partner with each of these companies as we bring our highly sought-after brands to new audiences through these streaming platforms. Yesterday, we also announced that we acquired next-generation food media company, Spoon University. Spoon U is a company created by millennials for millennials, and we expect this acquisition to help us build our content, community and brand as we accelerate our digital strategy and reach with younger audiences. 
And just this morning, we announced that we've expanded our relationship with Snapchat, enabling us to create original, short-form show concepts specifically for that platform. Food Networks' launch on Snapchat's Discover platform in January 2015 was fundamental to our development as a digital content company, helping us to become much more agile. 
Our digital content division, Scripps Lifestyle Studios, has become the one-stop shop for all digital content, leading the way for digital and video integration. We've demonstrated incredible video and social growth over the last year as well. The Lifestyle Studios generated nearly 2.9 billion video views. That's an increase of about 450% over the first quarter of 2016, really a remarkable achievement and just one example of our determination to expand our reach across all devices. 
Regardless of whether consumers are watching the Property Brothers on television on HGTV or seeing Andrew Zimmern on Facebook or peeking behind the scenes of Iron Chef Gauntlet on their mobile phone, we're always looking to make sure we deliver a consistent and rewarding experience. 
We've created a highly differentiated environment within the current media landscape. Our networks provide an optimistic environment where consumers are open to receiving advertising messages and importantly, act on those messages. This translates to strong financial results, with our network group consistently delivering advertising growth. To use a theme from our recent very successful upfront presentations, environment matters. The environment we cultivate for our distributors, combined with the growing strength of our brands, satisfies the viewing desires of their customers and creates value for the distribution's business model. For those reasons, our networks have become essential to the leading multichannel providers. As well as reaching agreements with virtual MVD players such Hulu, we continue to make significant progress and deals with more traditional platforms. For example, over the last several months, we've executed long-term renewals with a number of our distribution partners and have now renegotiated nearly 80% of our subscriber base for the next several years. We're not just focused on creating engaging viewing environments in the United States but also throughout the world. TVN continues to deliver solid growth across its portfolio, increasing revenue, audience levels and market share. HGTV in Poland continues to outperform even our own high expectations and provides a platform to debut in more European markets over the coming years. We're actively engaged in partnership discussions with some of the biggest media groups in key markets about launching networks or branded blocks of content. Our success in countries such as Poland really reinforces our value to those potential partners. 
With important launches of our networks also come up in markets, including Germany and Italy, we're clearly demonstrating our commitment to expanding our geographic reach. Let me close by restating that over 20 years ago, we started to create and own lifestyle programming, focusing on ideas, information and inspiration, or as Burton Jablin said when he coined it, the 3 Is. It's created a unique viewing environment. We set out to ensure this content was available wherever and whenever viewers wanted to consume it. That philosophy continues to pay off on linear television, on digital platforms and internationally. It's a strategy that has served us very well. We continue to optimize our business across all areas as we focus on enhancing shareholder value for the long term. Today's results are another demonstration of that commitment. 
Now let me turn it over to Burton, who'll review some of our first quarter operating results. Burton?"

Scripps Networks Interactive continues to perform at a high level, benefiting from our continued investment and focus on delivering engaging content across all brands. Following up on the theme that Ken spoke about, our approach to delivering a differentiated and engaging environment was highlighted in a recent study conducted by Nielsen. The results of the study indicated advertising messages were viewed 22% more favorably in our lifestyle environment than for general entertainment, reality, sports or news. Nielsen also determined that viewers were on average 94% more engaged with the commercial view on our lifestyle -- in our lifestyle environment than in the other genres. Compared with sports programming, lifestyle performed 150% better, and against news programming, 172%. Those results demonstrate that environment really matters. The engaging environment we create, coupled with the popularity of our must-have lifestyle brands, continues to pay off in our quarterly results. 
In the first quarter of 2017, amid an evolving landscape, 5 of our 6 U.S. networks posted year-over-year gains for adults 25-54 in sales prime rating. In addition, 5 of our 6 networks grew or were in line for key total day ratings.
When it comes to home, viewers look to us for how to buy it, build it, share it and love it. At HGTV, the network delivered its second highest-rated quarter ever. HGTV was ranked as the #1 network for women in both sales prime and weekend time periods with solid delivery from hit series Fixer Upper, Flip or Flop and Property Brothers, helping to drive the quarter. Our programming teams have a knack for building on what works, and so we franchised our successful shows Flip or Flop to include several new couples in new cities. Flip or Flop Vegas premiered April 7 to strong viewership and ratings and has continued to deliver rating success each week since. 
Our creative teams also have another new hit on their hands with Hometown, which premiered in the first quarter as the second highest-rated show on HGTV for adults 25-54 sales prime, behind only our hit, Fixer Upper. In April, the positive momentum from these premieres helped position HGTV as the #1 cable network for women 25-54 and the #6 network for adults 25-54. HGTV also finished April as the #1 cable network in weekends. 
The demand for Food content continues to grow. And for Food Network, our programming has never been more relevant to the lives of consumers. In the first quarter of 2017, Food Network's ratings were even with 2016 for adults 25-54 while improving 4% among both women 25-54 and women 18-49. Leading shows in the quarter were Worst Cooks in America and Kids Baking Championship. 
Returning to Food Network. For the first time in more than 3 years is the icon of cooking shows, Iron Chef. In its premiere episode on April 16, Iron Chef Gauntlet was the highest-rated Scripps Networks show that week, and follow-up episodes continue to generate high marks for the network. 
Travel Channel finished the quarter with adult 25-54 ratings, up 9% for sales prime, making it the highest-rated quarter since the first quarter of 2014. Travel Channel continues to build momentum off a successful programming slate, which includes premieres of Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, Mysteries at the Museum, and Bizarre Foods, Delicious Destinations. 
DIY Network continues to deliver ratings growth across its key demos with ratings up 4% for adults 25-54. Key shows included Texas Flip and Move, Building Alaska and Homes and Homes. At Cooking Channel, the network again delivered its highest rated quarter ever for adults sales prime, improving 18% year-over-year. Driving the growth were original series Carnival Eats, Dinner at Tiffany's and Food Fact or Fiction. 
Great American Country is a great complement to the Scripps lifestyle portfolio with content that powers our audience's passion for outdoor pursuits. In the first quarter of 2017, the network posted its highest rating since 2007, marking 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth. 
Our strategy to deliver consistent, engaging and quality content 7 nights a week continues to pay off. With premieres every night of the week, viewers will always have a reason to return to our networks. 
Scripps Lifestyle Studios continues to lead engagement and broaden our reach on dozens of digital and mobile platforms. In the first quarter of 2017, Scripps Lifestyle Studios averaged more than 430 million monthly unique visitors across multiple platforms. The team produced more than 1,000 videos in the first quarter of this year. As Ken mentioned, video views in the quarter were up to almost 3 billion, and we continue to see significant growth as we move into the second quarter. 
We continue to look for new ways to engage younger audiences. The agreement we announced today with Snapchat will enable us to bring original short-form food and home-related shows to the platform. This partnership allows us to further bridge our television brands to digital and create unique content tailored for the next generation of food and home enthusiasts. 
Our TV Everywhere apps are showing significant growth in both video plays as well as user visits. Video plays in the first quarter increased more than 360%, and average monthly visits improved 42% compared to 2016. The base is small, but we're pleased with the momentum TV Everywhere is showing. 
In April, after generating more than 1 billion views, Food Network ranked #1 among Tubular Labs' food and drink category, topping TasteMade, Delish and BuzzFeed's Tasty. Our All-Star promotions team came together to create the ultimate seaside getaway for the 2017 HGTV Dream Home Giveaway. The annual sweepstakes received an all-time high of 131 million entries in the first quarter. 
Internationally, our brands continued to deliver. The first quarter was another strong quarter for TVN with ratings for the group improving nearly 6% with its key 16-49 year old audience compared to the first quarter of 2016. TVN, the main network, achieved a market share of nearly 13%, making it the most-watched television station in Poland for persons 16-49. TVN 24 was the most-watched 24-hour news channel in Poland, and TVN Style was the #1 lifestyle channel during the quarter. HGTV in Poland continues to build momentum as more and more audiences tune in to its lifestyle programming. After launching earlier this week, HGTV is the #2 lifestyle network in the country among women 16-49, second only to TVN Style. 
For its just completed fiscal year, UKTV delivered record financial results, growing revenue 8% and EBITDA 11%, both in local currency. The multichannel broadcaster also grew its share of viewing 10% over the prior year. We remain focused on growing our footprint in new markets. Most recently, we announced that Food Network will launch in Italy on May 8. This will be the first dedicated multiplatform food and entertainment channel in the country and will offer a mix of local original productions and our flagship shows. This launch in a key growth market for our company represents a significant milestone in our ongoing global expansion. Quarter-after-quarter, Scripps Networks Interactive delivers consistent and improving operating results. We're pleased with our performance to date in 2017. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Lori, who'll review and detail our financial performance for the first quarter of 2017."

I'll focus my comments today on the quarterly consolidated numbers and discuss our operating segment performance. Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 5% to $855 million compared with the prior",984,"Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I'll focus my comments today on the quarterly consolidated numbers and discuss our operating segment performance. 
Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 5% to $855 million compared with the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, distribution revenue growth and growth in our international businesses. As a result of our revenue growth, coupled with a modest increase in expenses due to timing, consolidated adjusted segment profit improved 6%. The growth in adjusted segment profit, coupled with lower depreciation, amortization and interest expense as well as increase in foreign exchange transaction gains, increased our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.53 compared with $1.29 in the prior year quarter. 
Looking at our operating segment. Our U.S. networks' revenue increased 5%. This improvement was driven by growth in advertising demand for our lifestyle networks and the expected increase in distribution revenue. U.S. advertising revenue increased 5% year-over-year in the first quarter due to CPM pricing increases, partially offset by an increase -- an overall decrease in impressions and a pricing mix shift away from higher-priced scatter inventory compared with the first quarter of 2016. 
Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPMs up mid- to high-teens year-over-year and up high-teens to mid-20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising category during the quarter were food, retail, consumer package goods, financial and pharma. These categories are consistent with the historical performance for the first quarter, except for pharma, which improved over 2016. 
The healthy demand for scatter has continued into the second quarter of 2017, although quarter-over-quarter CPM pricing increases have tempered somewhat in the first month of the quarter, especially compared with the strong CPM increases realized in the second quarter of last year. 
Presently, against tough comp, scatter-over-scatter CPM growth is running in the low single to low double-digit range, and scatter over upfront CPM growth is running in the mid- to high-teens range. Additionally, we are presently seeing an unprecedented strong second wave of scatter demand in the quarter during a period where scatter inventory and demand is normally lower. 
This wave of demand both would and should drive CPM pricing higher than what we are currently experiencing for the second quarter. Also included in our overall advertising revenue is our growing digital advertising business, which improved a healthy 12% over the first quarter of last year. This growth was partially offset by revenue decreases related to the strategic decision to discontinue our Netflix relationship and refocus our digital assets from Hulu.com to other more economically attractive digital efforts. 
Including these impacts, our overall digital revenue increased 4% compared with the prior year first quarter. Distribution revenue to the U.S. networks increased 4.5%. Contributing to this anticipated increase were negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top virtual MVPD platforms. These increases were partially offset by industry subscriber decline. As a result of the increase in revenue, coupled with a modest increase in spending due to timing, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. networks increased 6% compared with the prior year quarter.
Looking ahead, we expect spending to increase in the second and third quarters, increasing in the mid-teens compared with the prior year for both quarters. Driving this growth will be increases in programming related to our premiere schedule coupled with higher SG&A spending related to the various strategic growth initiatives we spoke about during our February earnings call. 
For the international segment, the majority of the revenues are generated by TVN. In local currency, TVN revenue increased 4% compared with the same time a year ago. On a reported basis, international networks revenues increased 3.5% to $125.5 million. Driven by the revenue growth and relatively flat expenses, international adjusted segment profit increased to $15.5 million compared with $10 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
In addition to our consolidated international business, a significant portion of our international business is reported in equity income. These investments include UKTV and our partnership with Corus in Canada for Food Networks, Cooking Channel, HGTV and DIY Network, along with some TVN minority investments. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $20 million, down from $26 million in the prior year quarter. Driving the year-over-year decrease was the sale of FOX Sports South in the first quarter of 2016 and decreased contribution from a TVN minority investment. These declines were partially offset by a double-digit percentage growth at UKTV. Additionally, subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2017, we announced the sale of a minority investment in Onet, a nonstrategic asset, for $54 million. This minority asset was not a material contributor to equity and earnings of affiliates. 
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the first quarter approximately 2.3x gross leverage, down from 2.6x at the end of the fourth quarter due to our strong free cash flow generation. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent, and we plan to use capital and operating cash flow to fund organic growth, including programming, new capabilities and multiplatform business models as well as invest strategically through M&A both domestically and internationally and to reduce our leverage. We will also continue to evaluate the opportunity to repurchase our sales under the existing board authorization, which has $1.5 billion remaining. 
Finally, there is no change in our previously issued full year guidance. As I indicated earlier, based on current programming schedules and strategic growth initiative spending, we expect to see increased expenses in the second and third quarters. This will drive overall expense growth in the low to double-digit range in each quarter compared with the prior year. Overall, we continue to expect to deliver solid growth in 2017 as we make important investments in high-quality content, data and multiplatform opportunities. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Ken."

So before we take Q&A in just a couple of minutes, I wanted to step back for a moment, offer a couple of observations, if I may. It's very clear that this is an industry that's undergoing significant change as consumer behavior continues to evolve. The companies, in my opinion, that will be successful for the long term are those that can optimize their business to take full advantage of the opportunities that technology and behavioral transformation offer us. Fortunately, adapting and changing is something that Scripps Networks Interactive really has at its very core. We've had it since day one. That's why I'm so confident in the long-term vision of this company. For example, the steps that we've taken just in the last few days are a demonstration of how we've taken a set of cable TV networks and ownership of our content and created a global lifestyle content business. It's a business that's taking active steps to grow, to respond to demand and build the brightest possible future. 
As we mentioned previously, yesterday, Hulu announced that our networks would be on their live TV service from launch, making us the only cable network group not owned by Hulu shareholders to be included. That's a ringing endorsement of our brands and the value that they bring to advertisers and distributors. And just a few hours later, we announced the acquisition of Spoon University, a next-generation food media company founded by 2 millennials who actually grew up watching Food Network. I guess it's the demonstration of our commitment to really never sit still and always find ways to stay relevant with our audiences. 
And then this morning, we announced our expanded relationship with Snapchat, with a commitment to create shows on their platform to build on the successful food and home franchises we built on our TV networks. That's an indication of the way we have revolutionized our processes to become a nimble production house that can take advantage of audience and advertising opportunities within hours, not months. So around the globe, we're growing, we're developing. Our linear networks are entering new markets and capturing audiences every month. Our social teams are creating more videos and content than ever before. And we've gone from 10s of millions of views per quarter to almost 3 billion. 
Change is not easy, but at Scripps Networks Interactive, we regard it as a necessity. That's why the fundamentals of our business are so strong. That's why we continue to grow and that's why I continue to have such a resounding faith in the long-term success of this business. 
So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions this morning. Operator?"

In the case of Snapchat, I have to say it's been a great partnership thus far. Just in the last 12 months, we've doubled our audience on Snapchat. By now expanding into the home category, we actually see this as a partnership that is going to lead to profitability. And we don't really share a lot of the financial arrangements that we have.

So in that context, we're expanding our reach to younger audiences through Snapchat, most recently with Spoon U. And this is a process that you'll see us continue because we want to get younger people who are interested in the food category when they're young, under one of our services, maybe move them to other of our platforms.

You could remember a time when I was out begging people to give us $100 for a cable network spot because the value just wasn't there. And if you look at a lot of things that we were doing to E.W. Scripps eons ago with these little cable networks and these little investments, we had these big newspapers and television stations and all this cash flow, it was really about getting bigger by thinking smaller, and it's a lesson we've never forgotten. So now with successful cable networks but very successful brands, how can we partner, how can we, as Burton says, go beyond our core audiences to younger audiences that are not necessarily on linear television. And the real way to do it is to partner with Snapchat, with Facebook, on and on and on. And we think it'll pay off in the long term. And I think sometimes we just don't get the credit for some of the expanding beyond the core linear television business because it doesn't show immediate payoff on the bottom line. But I'm hopeful like the little ideas of the cable networks that certainly were beneficial to the growth of the E.W. Scripps Company, some of these small investments and small partnerships we're making now will benefit SNI over the long term. And Lori, you want to take Laura's question about ratings?"

So the first quarter was a little bit, I won't call it an anomaly, but I don't think we've seen that much live viewing in a quarter unless you come up with something like the Olympics or some big events. So we were fighting some headwinds in first quarter. But look, you've been in this business long enough when you have incredible quarters, it's a ratings business that goes up and down.

It's still #1 with women 25-54, upscale women, in particular, upscale audiences. So when we analyze it, we see the specific things that Ken mentioned. And then there's one more. I mean, these are things that affect us. We don't pay a lot of attention to competition, but there was a big hit on NBC this year on Tuesday nights called This is Us, airing against one of our biggest hits, Fixer Upper. And we did see an impact there. Now once This is Us went out of premiere, we saw Fixer Upper do just fine. So again, these were specific things. News viewing in comparison to first quarter last year, not fundamental issues with HGTV at all. And I was just with our team this week talking about all the great new premieres they have coming on in the second quarter and for the rest of the year. I've just complete confidence in HGTV going forward."

John, let's start with your first question relative to advertising categories, endemics, et cetera. So you have to separate a little bit -- a lot of what's going on in retail as far as real estate in stores from advertising budgets. Because quite honestly, if you look at our categories and our endemics, we haven't seen much of a change. I'm looking across the table at Lori to make sure that we're in total agreement. I don't have the information in front of me. But Lori, in the categories in consumer products, et cetera, autos, financial is pretty consistent from what we've seen from fourth quarter to first quarter and even trending beyond that. Having said that and, John, I think the fact that we always layer the endemics in. If you go back several years ago, it was a bigger percentage, if you will, of our overall advertising fortunately, as we've grown, it has become smaller. But I have to say, it's really helpful to have that. Because when you have the home improvements, when you have the consumer products that are tilted towards the home and food categories, it's part of the reason that we, I think, are as consistent as we are in the advertising market. But I think the easy answer is, there's not a significant change that we're seeing at this point depending on where retail goes and store closings and all those kinds of things. But if anything, some of that money, in a couple of instances, we've actually had seen shift to advertising where there's maybe more advertising dollars freed up and less around retail locations. And I think -- and talking to Steve Gelati, that's a trend we expect to see continuing. That's why, John, we're expanding more into the digital areas as well in trying to get a bigger piece of that advertising budget. Lori, you want to take John's second question?

I would leave all opportunities open in the future. But these partnerships, it's best for us to monetize with streaming services that are already doing the heavy lifting to get out there. Having said that, the ability to go directly to consumer, if you will, I think long term still has a lot of appreciation on our part and potentially a lot of payoff. We're going to keep our options open. But it's just safe to say that's not something that we think is in our imminent future."

I guess I know I'm going to get asked, so I'll ask you, how to help us get confident relative to your revenue guidance for the year compared to sort of first quarter in especially advertising results and  growth rates? I think you guys are still expecting, I guess, an acceleration of year-over-year growth throughout the year based on, I think, on your guidance. Correct me if I'm wrong. And so I guess, give you the chance to help us understand why you have that confidence given what seems to be going on with pricing environment and mix shifts and things like that? And the second, I'll just put it at while I've got the floor, the second, sort of more strategic question, maybe Burton or Ken. Burton, you talked about the differentiated engaging environment for advertising, and how important that was to you. That seems a contrast to me, actually directly with what some of your peers are saying when you think about maybe something like this open AP interface, which seems to be sort of disaggregating the sale of audience from the surrounding context and environment and basically you could argue just commoditizing the audience, and just interesting contrast to your point of view with that trend and here what you think about the compare and contrast there, and how you think selling your context net audience insulates you and gives you an advantage as the industry goes up and down, the ratings goes ups and down?"

But when you're a company like ours that from the beginning has been in specific categories where we target specific audiences in those categories upscale, educated audience, audiences who have a tendency to do what they view, as we always say, we take advantage of that differentiation. In the world of other kinds of content, that is less differentiated, whether it's scripted content or other kinds of reality programs where it's not clear what the difference is between one network and another in terms of their focus. That becomes harder and easier to commoditize, as you put it. And then on the digital side, we see the same bifurcation going on, you have programmatic buying, which we do. We engage in it to make sure we're filling all of our inventory. But the real interesting area for us are the what we call high touch digital advertising deals where we really do work with marketers to create really, specific, hopefully, 360-degree cross-platform buys that capitalize on the specificity of our audience, the targeted nature of our content and the environment we create. So both exist in this world, there's no question. And in some places, we play in both worlds, particularly digitally. But we think the differentiation is a real advantage for us. And the more the rest of the market commoditizes, we think we have even more of an advantage by being targeted."

And I think I'll come back to what I said in the scripted comments and that is, we of course, look to deploy that capital organically to help grow the business, starting with our programming, looking at these multiplatform opportunities that we've been talking about today and as well as new capabilities. Again, not capabilities to go direct-to-consumer, a lot of our peers are doing that, but just capabilities that you need to do that. So we're making some investments and we've talked about that. We continue to be opportunistic on the M&A side, both internationally on the digital front, Hulu being a good example of that. But on the digital side, it's not being huge capital outlays that we see in the foreseeable future. And we continue to look out there. So I think we've always said that we will be opportunistic, but we will also be balanced and think about returning capital to shareholders if we don't have better uses for that. So I think just based on your question, you can see we've gotten in a much more comfortable leveraged position, I'm sure, as we always do, we will be talking to our board about this in our board meeting.

It really was about the year-over-year scatter pricing increases we saw in elevation and a widening of the gap. We went from probably low double-digit increases in scatter-versus-scatter in Q1 of last year until we were almost high-teens to 20% year-over-year. So we really saw that scatter pricing take a huge bump in the second quarter. So it wasn't overall. It was really -- I was meaning to highlight that the scatter pricing marketplace really got extremely hot in the second quarter of last year. As for as that unprecedented wave, I was talking with Steve Gelati just yesterday, usually, by this time, and maybe as you're going into the upfront, you see a lot less activity going on, but he has got charts that show that demand, they're still knocking on the door, they're still looking to buy scatter that's usually moderating by now. He is seeing just an opposite trend, which is why we're trying to give some color to why we gave that pretty wide range that was, somebody asked a question about earlier, is that we're seeing that's probably going to tighten up and we might see some lift in strength to that.

So as we look at each of these markets, to answer the second part of your question, we look to see, is there a high pay TV penetration, for example, in this case of Italy the answer is, no, it's much more of a broadcast network. Is there an opportunity for us to get in and get some valued real estate in order to bring in the kind of viewership which you need in a broadcast environment,  and the case was, yes. So very exciting in Italy. We also have a strong HGTV digital terrestrial presence here in Poland. And as we grow in these markets and the experience in the U.K. as well, we're able to segment our investments into sort of the digital pay television, environment, digital terrestrial, over-the-top like with the player here in Poland.

Good morning, everyone. Always happy you're able to be with us today. The momentum we saw in 2016 has continued into 2017 as we further implement our strategy of strengthening our core businesses, building our reach but most importa",1010,"Okay. Thanks, Dylan. Good morning, everyone. Always happy you're able to be with us today. 
The momentum we saw in 2016 has continued into 2017 as we further implement our strategy of strengthening our core businesses, building our reach but most importantly, monetizing our audiences. In the first quarter of this year, total operating revenue grew 5%. Adjusted segment profit increased 6%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $1.53. 
Our unwavering focus on building deep and enduring connections with upscale consumers everywhere through compelling lifestyle content in the Home, Food and Travel categories and our ability to monetize that relationship with advertisers and distributors is really what drives our consistent performance. Our proven strategy for creating compelling programming, focusing on ideas, information and inspiration has uniquely positioned Scripps Networks Interactive in the minds of viewers, advertisers and platforms alike. 
23 years ago, we created a cable network company. Now in 2017, we are a comprehensive lifestyle content business that relentlessly pursues deeper engagement with consumers everywhere regardless of device or geography. Our lifestyle-leading brands are at the heart of Scripps Networks Interactive. And I'm happy to say that we continue to deliver great performance in our core businesses. Our networks continue to resonate with consumers now more than ever. 
We have seen consistent strength in ratings, and we're continuing to strengthen our core business through investment in programming and we can see that pay off in our results. But as I've said, we're now more than just a television company. Three announcements that we made just this week underpin our strategic focus on expanding our reach through new platforms and technologies. For example, yesterday, Hulu announced that our networks will be included on their virtual MVPD product offering. Now since our network group is not among Hulu's investors, that is one clear illustration of the value distribution partners place on the audience that we deliver and the value that we offer to businesses seeking to establish themselves with a mainstream audience. The addition of Hulu means that our networks will be available on almost every one of the virtual MVPD skinny-bundle offers announced so far. 
We're also excited to partner with each of these companies as we bring our highly sought-after brands to new audiences through these streaming platforms. Yesterday, we also announced that we acquired next-generation food media company, Spoon University. Spoon U is a company created by millennials for millennials, and we expect this acquisition to help us build our content, community and brand as we accelerate our digital strategy and reach with younger audiences. 
And just this morning, we announced that we've expanded our relationship with Snapchat, enabling us to create original, short-form show concepts specifically for that platform. Food Networks' launch on Snapchat's Discover platform in January 2015 was fundamental to our development as a digital content company, helping us to become much more agile. 
Our digital content division, Scripps Lifestyle Studios, has become the one-stop shop for all digital content, leading the way for digital and video integration. We've demonstrated incredible video and social growth over the last year as well. The Lifestyle Studios generated nearly 2.9 billion video views. That's an increase of about 450% over the first quarter of 2016, really a remarkable achievement and just one example of our determination to expand our reach across all devices. 
Regardless of whether consumers are watching the Property Brothers on television on HGTV or seeing Andrew Zimmern on Facebook or peeking behind the scenes of Iron Chef Gauntlet on their mobile phone, we're always looking to make sure we deliver a consistent and rewarding experience. 
We've created a highly differentiated environment within the current media landscape. Our networks provide an optimistic environment where consumers are open to receiving advertising messages and importantly, act on those messages. This translates to strong financial results, with our network group consistently delivering advertising growth. To use a theme from our recent very successful upfront presentations, environment matters. The environment we cultivate for our distributors, combined with the growing strength of our brands, satisfies the viewing desires of their customers and creates value for the distribution's business model. For those reasons, our networks have become essential to the leading multichannel providers. As well as reaching agreements with virtual MVD players such Hulu, we continue to make significant progress and deals with more traditional platforms. For example, over the last several months, we've executed long-term renewals with a number of our distribution partners and have now renegotiated nearly 80% of our subscriber base for the next several years. We're not just focused on creating engaging viewing environments in the United States but also throughout the world. TVN continues to deliver solid growth across its portfolio, increasing revenue, audience levels and market share. HGTV in Poland continues to outperform even our own high expectations and provides a platform to debut in more European markets over the coming years. We're actively engaged in partnership discussions with some of the biggest media groups in key markets about launching networks or branded blocks of content. Our success in countries such as Poland really reinforces our value to those potential partners. 
With important launches of our networks also come up in markets, including Germany and Italy, we're clearly demonstrating our commitment to expanding our geographic reach. Let me close by restating that over 20 years ago, we started to create and own lifestyle programming, focusing on ideas, information and inspiration, or as Burton Jablin said when he coined it, the 3 Is. It's created a unique viewing environment. We set out to ensure this content was available wherever and whenever viewers wanted to consume it. That philosophy continues to pay off on linear television, on digital platforms and internationally. It's a strategy that has served us very well. We continue to optimize our business across all areas as we focus on enhancing shareholder value for the long term. Today's results are another demonstration of that commitment. 
Now let me turn it over to Burton, who'll review some of our first quarter operating results. Burton?"

Scripps Networks Interactive continues to perform at a high level, benefiting from our continued investment and focus on delivering engaging content across all brands. Following up on the theme that Ken spoke about, our approach to delivering a differentiated and engaging environment was highlighted in a recent study conducted by Nielsen. The results of the study indicated advertising messages were viewed 22% more favorably in our lifestyle environment than for general entertainment, reality, sports or news. Nielsen also determined that viewers were on average 94% more engaged with the commercial view on our lifestyle -- in our lifestyle environment than in the other genres. Compared with sports programming, lifestyle performed 150% better, and against news programming, 172%. Those results demonstrate that environment really matters. The engaging environment we create, coupled with the popularity of our must-have lifestyle brands, continues to pay off in our quarterly results. 
In the first quarter of 2017, amid an evolving landscape, 5 of our 6 U.S. networks posted year-over-year gains for adults 25-54 in sales prime rating. In addition, 5 of our 6 networks grew or were in line for key total day ratings.
When it comes to home, viewers look to us for how to buy it, build it, share it and love it. At HGTV, the network delivered its second highest-rated quarter ever. HGTV was ranked as the #1 network for women in both sales prime and weekend time periods with solid delivery from hit series Fixer Upper, Flip or Flop and Property Brothers, helping to drive the quarter. Our programming teams have a knack for building on what works, and so we franchised our successful shows Flip or Flop to include several new couples in new cities. Flip or Flop Vegas premiered April 7 to strong viewership and ratings and has continued to deliver rating success each week since. 
Our creative teams also have another new hit on their hands with Hometown, which premiered in the first quarter as the second highest-rated show on HGTV for adults 25-54 sales prime, behind only our hit, Fixer Upper. In April, the positive momentum from these premieres helped position HGTV as the #1 cable network for women 25-54 and the #6 network for adults 25-54. HGTV also finished April as the #1 cable network in weekends. 
The demand for Food content continues to grow. And for Food Network, our programming has never been more relevant to the lives of consumers. In the first quarter of 2017, Food Network's ratings were even with 2016 for adults 25-54 while improving 4% among both women 25-54 and women 18-49. Leading shows in the quarter were Worst Cooks in America and Kids Baking Championship. 
Returning to Food Network. For the first time in more than 3 years is the icon of cooking shows, Iron Chef. In its premiere episode on April 16, Iron Chef Gauntlet was the highest-rated Scripps Networks show that week, and follow-up episodes continue to generate high marks for the network. 
Travel Channel finished the quarter with adult 25-54 ratings, up 9% for sales prime, making it the highest-rated quarter since the first quarter of 2014. Travel Channel continues to build momentum off a successful programming slate, which includes premieres of Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, Mysteries at the Museum, and Bizarre Foods, Delicious Destinations. 
DIY Network continues to deliver ratings growth across its key demos with ratings up 4% for adults 25-54. Key shows included Texas Flip and Move, Building Alaska and Homes and Homes. At Cooking Channel, the network again delivered its highest rated quarter ever for adults sales prime, improving 18% year-over-year. Driving the growth were original series Carnival Eats, Dinner at Tiffany's and Food Fact or Fiction. 
Great American Country is a great complement to the Scripps lifestyle portfolio with content that powers our audience's passion for outdoor pursuits. In the first quarter of 2017, the network posted its highest rating since 2007, marking 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth. 
Our strategy to deliver consistent, engaging and quality content 7 nights a week continues to pay off. With premieres every night of the week, viewers will always have a reason to return to our networks. 
Scripps Lifestyle Studios continues to lead engagement and broaden our reach on dozens of digital and mobile platforms. In the first quarter of 2017, Scripps Lifestyle Studios averaged more than 430 million monthly unique visitors across multiple platforms. The team produced more than 1,000 videos in the first quarter of this year. As Ken mentioned, video views in the quarter were up to almost 3 billion, and we continue to see significant growth as we move into the second quarter. 
We continue to look for new ways to engage younger audiences. The agreement we announced today with Snapchat will enable us to bring original short-form food and home-related shows to the platform. This partnership allows us to further bridge our television brands to digital and create unique content tailored for the next generation of food and home enthusiasts. 
Our TV Everywhere apps are showing significant growth in both video plays as well as user visits. Video plays in the first quarter increased more than 360%, and average monthly visits improved 42% compared to 2016. The base is small, but we're pleased with the momentum TV Everywhere is showing. 
In April, after generating more than 1 billion views, Food Network ranked #1 among Tubular Labs' food and drink category, topping TasteMade, Delish and BuzzFeed's Tasty. Our All-Star promotions team came together to create the ultimate seaside getaway for the 2017 HGTV Dream Home Giveaway. The annual sweepstakes received an all-time high of 131 million entries in the first quarter. 
Internationally, our brands continued to deliver. The first quarter was another strong quarter for TVN with ratings for the group improving nearly 6% with its key 16-49 year old audience compared to the first quarter of 2016. TVN, the main network, achieved a market share of nearly 13%, making it the most-watched television station in Poland for persons 16-49. TVN 24 was the most-watched 24-hour news channel in Poland, and TVN Style was the #1 lifestyle channel during the quarter. HGTV in Poland continues to build momentum as more and more audiences tune in to its lifestyle programming. After launching earlier this week, HGTV is the #2 lifestyle network in the country among women 16-49, second only to TVN Style. 
For its just completed fiscal year, UKTV delivered record financial results, growing revenue 8% and EBITDA 11%, both in local currency. The multichannel broadcaster also grew its share of viewing 10% over the prior year. We remain focused on growing our footprint in new markets. Most recently, we announced that Food Network will launch in Italy on May 8. This will be the first dedicated multiplatform food and entertainment channel in the country and will offer a mix of local original productions and our flagship shows. This launch in a key growth market for our company represents a significant milestone in our ongoing global expansion. Quarter-after-quarter, Scripps Networks Interactive delivers consistent and improving operating results. We're pleased with our performance to date in 2017. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Lori, who'll review and detail our financial performance for the first quarter of 2017."
6469353,424185681,1195119,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I'll focus my comments today on the quarterly consolidated numbers and discuss our operating segment performance. Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 5% to $855 million compared with the prior",984,"Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I'll focus my comments today on the quarterly consolidated numbers and discuss our operating segment performance. 
Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 5% to $855 million compared with the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, distribution revenue growth and growth in our international businesses. As a result of our revenue growth, coupled with a modest increase in expenses due to timing, consolidated adjusted segment profit improved 6%. The growth in adjusted segment profit, coupled with lower depreciation, amortization and interest expense as well as increase in foreign exchange transaction gains, increased our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.53 compared with $1.29 in the prior year quarter. 
Looking at our operating segment. Our U.S. networks' revenue increased 5%. This improvement was driven by growth in advertising demand for our lifestyle networks and the expected increase in distribution revenue. U.S. advertising revenue increased 5% year-over-year in the first quarter due to CPM pricing increases, partially offset by an increase -- an overall decrease in impressions and a pricing mix shift away from higher-priced scatter inventory compared with the first quarter of 2016. 
Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPMs up mid- to high-teens year-over-year and up high-teens to mid-20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising category during the quarter were food, retail, consumer package goods, financial and pharma. These categories are consistent with the historical performance for the first quarter, except for pharma, which improved over 2016. 
The healthy demand for scatter has continued into the second quarter of 2017, although quarter-over-quarter CPM pricing increases have tempered somewhat in the first month of the quarter, especially compared with the strong CPM increases realized in the second quarter of last year. 
Presently, against tough comp, scatter-over-scatter CPM growth is running in the low single to low double-digit range, and scatter over upfront CPM growth is running in the mid- to high-teens range. Additionally, we are presently seeing an unprecedented strong second wave of scatter demand in the quarter during a period where scatter inventory and demand is normally lower. 
This wave of demand both would and should drive CPM pricing higher than what we are currently experiencing for the second quarter. Also included in our overall advertising revenue is our growing digital advertising business, which improved a healthy 12% over the first quarter of last year. This growth was partially offset by revenue decreases related to the strategic decision to discontinue our Netflix relationship and refocus our digital assets from Hulu.com to other more economically attractive digital efforts. 
Including these impacts, our overall digital revenue increased 4% compared with the prior year first quarter. Distribution revenue to the U.S. networks increased 4.5%. Contributing to this anticipated increase were negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top virtual MVPD platforms. These increases were partially offset by industry subscriber decline. As a result of the increase in revenue, coupled with a modest increase in spending due to timing, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. networks increased 6% compared with the prior year quarter.
Looking ahead, we expect spending to increase in the second and third quarters, increasing in the mid-teens compared with the prior year for both quarters. Driving this growth will be increases in programming related to our premiere schedule coupled with higher SG&A spending related to the various strategic growth initiatives we spoke about during our February earnings call. 
For the international segment, the majority of the revenues are generated by TVN. In local currency, TVN revenue increased 4% compared with the same time a year ago. On a reported basis, international networks revenues increased 3.5% to $125.5 million. Driven by the revenue growth and relatively flat expenses, international adjusted segment profit increased to $15.5 million compared with $10 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
In addition to our consolidated international business, a significant portion of our international business is reported in equity income. These investments include UKTV and our partnership with Corus in Canada for Food Networks, Cooking Channel, HGTV and DIY Network, along with some TVN minority investments. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $20 million, down from $26 million in the prior year quarter. Driving the year-over-year decrease was the sale of FOX Sports South in the first quarter of 2016 and decreased contribution from a TVN minority investment. These declines were partially offset by a double-digit percentage growth at UKTV. Additionally, subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2017, we announced the sale of a minority investment in Onet, a nonstrategic asset, for $54 million. This minority asset was not a material contributor to equity and earnings of affiliates. 
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the first quarter approximately 2.3x gross leverage, down from 2.6x at the end of the fourth quarter due to our strong free cash flow generation. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent, and we plan to use capital and operating cash flow to fund organic growth, including programming, new capabilities and multiplatform business models as well as invest strategically through M&A both domestically and internationally and to reduce our leverage. We will also continue to evaluate the opportunity to repurchase our sales under the existing board authorization, which has $1.5 billion remaining. 
Finally, there is no change in our previously issued full year guidance. As I indicated earlier, based on current programming schedules and strategic growth initiative spending, we expect to see increased expenses in the second and third quarters. This will drive overall expense growth in the low to double-digit range in each quarter compared with the prior year. Overall, we continue to expect to deliver solid growth in 2017 as we make important investments in high-quality content, data and multiplatform opportunities. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Ken."

So before we take Q&A in just a couple of minutes, I wanted to step back for a moment, offer a couple of observations, if I may. It's very clear that this is an industry that's undergoing significant change as consumer behavior continues to evolve. The companies, in my opinion, that will be successful for the long term are those that can optimize their business to take full advantage of the opportunities that technology and behavioral transformation offer us. Fortunately, adapting and changing is something that Scripps Networks Interactive really has at its very core. We've had it since day one. That's why I'm so confident in the long-term vision of this company. For example, the steps that we've taken just in the last few days are a demonstration of how we've taken a set of cable TV networks and ownership of our content and created a global lifestyle content business. It's a business that's taking active steps to grow, to respond to demand and build the brightest possible future. 
As we mentioned previously, yesterday, Hulu announced that our networks would be on their live TV service from launch, making us the only cable network group not owned by Hulu shareholders to be included. That's a ringing endorsement of our brands and the value that they bring to advertisers and distributors. And just a few hours later, we announced the acquisition of Spoon University, a next-generation food media company founded by 2 millennials who actually grew up watching Food Network. I guess it's the demonstration of our commitment to really never sit still and always find ways to stay relevant with our audiences. 
And then this morning, we announced our expanded relationship with Snapchat, with a commitment to create shows on their platform to build on the successful food and home franchises we built on our TV networks. That's an indication of the way we have revolutionized our processes to become a nimble production house that can take advantage of audience and advertising opportunities within hours, not months. So around the globe, we're growing, we're developing. Our linear networks are entering new markets and capturing audiences every month. Our social teams are creating more videos and content than ever before. And we've gone from 10s of millions of views per quarter to almost 3 billion. 
Change is not easy, but at Scripps Networks Interactive, we regard it as a necessity. That's why the fundamentals of our business are so strong. That's why we continue to grow and that's why I continue to have such a resounding faith in the long-term success of this business. 
So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions this morning. Operator?"

By now expanding into the home category, we actually see this as a partnership that is going to lead to profitability. And we don't really share a lot of the financial arrangements that we have.

So in that context, we're expanding our reach to younger audiences through Snapchat, most recently with Spoon U. And this is a process that you'll see us continue because we want to get younger people who are interested in the food category when they're young, under one of our services, maybe move them to other of our platforms. So it's part of a broader strategy."

You could remember a time when I was out begging people to give us $100 for a cable network spot because the value just wasn't there. And if you look at a lot of things that we were doing to E.W. Scripps eons ago with these little cable networks and these little investments, we had these big newspapers and television stations and all this cash flow, it was really about getting bigger by thinking smaller, and it's a lesson we've never forgotten. So now with successful cable networks but very successful brands, how can we partner, how can we, as Burton says, go beyond our core audiences to younger audiences that are not necessarily on linear television. And the real way to do it is to partner with Snapchat, with Facebook, on and on and on. And we think it'll pay off in the long term. And I think sometimes we just don't get the credit for some of the expanding beyond the core linear television business because it doesn't show immediate payoff on the bottom line. But I'm hopeful like the little ideas of the cable networks that certainly were beneficial to the growth of the E.W. Scripps Company, some of these small investments and small partnerships we're making now will benefit SNI over the long term. And Lori, you want to take Laura's question about ratings?"

So, overall, Easter did not have a noticeable impact on our results."

First quarter this year, I mean, not only the amount of live news viewing, but it was a really, really interesting sports quarter, if you will, from a standpoint of the amount of engagement with sports viewing. So the first quarter was a little bit, I won't call it an anomaly, but I don't think we've seen that much live viewing in a quarter unless you come up with something like the Olympics or some big events. So we were fighting some headwinds in first quarter. But look, you've been in this business long enough when you have incredible quarters, it's a ratings business that goes up and down.

It's still #1 with women 25-54, upscale women, in particular, upscale audiences. So when we analyze it, we see the specific things that Ken mentioned. And then there's one more. I mean, these are things that affect us. We don't pay a lot of attention to competition, but there was a big hit on NBC this year on Tuesday nights called This is Us, airing against one of our biggest hits, Fixer Upper. And we did see an impact there. Now once This is Us went out of premiere, we saw Fixer Upper do just fine. So again, these were specific things. News viewing in comparison to first quarter last year, not fundamental issues with HGTV at all. And I was just with our team this week talking about all the great new premieres they have coming on in the second quarter and for the rest of the year. I've just complete confidence in HGTV going forward."

And then for Lori, on the distribution side. I think you had previously said that you expect distribution growth to continue to grow throughout the year. So it sounds to me like some of the softness in industry subs is really not affecting your expectations for distribution growth in the 2Q and beyond. So is it just the case that the rate increases from your renewals are offsetting any softness in subs? And should we broadly continue to expect distribution revenue to accelerate with each successive quarter throughout the year?"

On the distribution side, we, like we said in the opening comments, we are being impacted like everyone else with the distribution erosion that's continuing. We're not seeing it escalate. It's been pretty constant with what we saw last year. And yes, our pricing increases are helping to abate and offset that. And we do expect to continue to see increases throughout the year. But I wouldn't say we're not looking for, like, huge jumps from quarter-to-quarter. We just think it's going to gain some strength. But like the rest of the industry, we continue to watch the sub numbers.

John, let's start with your first question relative to advertising categories, endemics, et cetera. So you have to separate a little bit -- a lot of what's going on in retail as far as real estate in stores from advertising budgets. Because quite honestly, if you look at our categories and our endemics, we haven't seen much of a change. I'm looking across the table at Lori to make sure that we're in total agreement. I don't have the information in front of me. But Lori, in the categories in consumer products, et cetera, autos, financial is pretty consistent from what we've seen from fourth quarter to first quarter and even trending beyond that. Having said that and, John, I think the fact that we always layer the endemics in. If you go back several years ago, it was a bigger percentage, if you will, of our overall advertising fortunately, as we've grown, it has become smaller. But I have to say, it's really helpful to have that. Because when you have the home improvements, when you have the consumer products that are tilted towards the home and food categories, it's part of the reason that we, I think, are as consistent as we are in the advertising market. But I think the easy answer is, there's not a significant change that we're seeing at this point depending on where retail goes and store closings and all those kinds of things. But if anything, some of that money, in a couple of instances, we've actually had seen shift to advertising where there's maybe more advertising dollars freed up and less around retail locations. And I think -- and talking to Steve Gelati, that's a trend we expect to see continuing. That's why, John, we're expanding more into the digital areas as well in trying to get a bigger piece of that advertising budget. Lori, you want to take John's second question? I'll come back on the skinny bundle."

But when you're a company like ours that from the beginning has been in specific categories where we target specific audiences in those categories upscale, educated audience, audiences who have a tendency to do what they view, as we always say, we take advantage of that differentiation. In the world of other kinds of content, that is less differentiated, whether it's scripted content or other kinds of reality programs where it's not clear what the difference is between one network and another in terms of their focus. That becomes harder and easier to commoditize, as you put it. And then on the digital side, we see the same bifurcation going on, you have programmatic buying, which we do. We engage in it to make sure we're filling all of our inventory. But the real interesting area for us are the what we call high touch digital advertising deals where we really do work with marketers to create really, specific, hopefully, 360-degree cross-platform buys that capitalize on the specificity of our audience, the targeted nature of our content and the environment we create. So both exist in this world, there's no question. And in some places, we play in both worlds, particularly digitally. But we think the differentiation is a real advantage for us. And the more the rest of the market commoditizes, we think we have even more of an advantage by being targeted."

I think you said the comps, you called out the tough comps in Q2. When I look at your numbers last year, it looks like Q1 was the tougher comp, at least from a revenue perspective. So I thought maybe you could just help us think about the year-over-year comp between Q1 and Q2 as we think about modeling the second quarter ad sales. And then you talked about, it sort of jumped out to me as an unprecedented, I think you used the word, wave of demand. And I know we're not going week-by-week, but maybe you could just give us a little more context around that? Are you suggesting that your sort of scatter guidance or stated as scatter market is conservative? And then just for the broader team, I thought this launch in Italy is interesting, we've seen some real success from some of your U.S. peers who've gotten into that market. Could you talk a little bit more about how you see that opportunity and some of the time line for kind of capturing it and maybe compare what you're doing there to other international launches that you've done, so we can think about the opportunity from a revenue and profitability perspective?"

It really was about the year-over-year scatter pricing increases we saw in elevation and a widening of the gap. We went from probably low double-digit increases in scatter-versus-scatter in Q1 of last year until we were almost high-teens to 20% year-over-year. So we really saw that scatter pricing take a huge bump in the second quarter. So it wasn't overall. It was really -- I was meaning to highlight that the scatter pricing marketplace really got extremely hot in the second quarter of last year. As for as that unprecedented wave, I was talking with Steve Gelati just yesterday, usually, by this time, and maybe as you're going into the upfront, you see a lot less activity going on, but he has got charts that show that demand, they're still knocking on the door, they're still looking to buy scatter that's usually moderating by now. He is seeing just an opposite trend, which is why we're trying to give some color to why we gave that pretty wide range that was, somebody asked a question about earlier, is that we're seeing that's probably going to tighten up and we might see some lift in strength to that. So since we won't talk to you for a few months we want to give you that color."

This is our second digital terrestrial network in Italy with the launch of Food Network. We had Fine Living in the market already, it's more a home-targeted network. The exciting thing about this one, in particular, that we were able to secure a low channel position, which is extremely important in that market with channel 33. And with both of these flagship networks in place, we'll also be able to do more cross-promotion, there's been a tremendous amount of advertiser interest there. So as we look at each of these markets, to answer the second part of your question, we look to see, is there a high pay TV penetration, for example, in this case of Italy the answer is, no, it's much more of a broadcast network. Is there an opportunity for us to get in and get some valued real estate in order to bring in the kind of viewership which you need in a broadcast environment,  and the case was, yes. So very exciting in Italy. We also have a strong HGTV digital terrestrial presence here in Poland. And as we grow in these markets and the experience in the U.K. as well, we're able to segment our investments into sort of the digital pay television, environment, digital terrestrial, over-the-top like with the player here in Poland. And I think the key is just to change that mix supporting to where that market is, and that's been our strategy. And one other comment, the underlying thing which makes it such an exciting opportunity is that we own the content, we have a tremendous amount of output coming from the U.S. including the formats, and so we can replicate that success both with locally produced content and the content coming from the U.S."

Good morning, everyone. Always happy you're able to be with us today. 
The momentum we saw in 2016 has continued into 2017 as we further implement our strategy of strengthening our core businesses, building our reach but most importantly, monetizing our audiences. In the first quarter of this year, total operating revenue grew 5%. Adjusted segment profit increased 6%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $1.53. 
Our unwavering focus on building deep and enduring connections with upscale consumers everywhere through compelling lifestyle content in the Home, Food and Travel categories and our ability to monetize that relationship with advertisers and distributors is really what drives our consistent performance. Our proven strategy for creating compelling programming, focusing on ideas, information and inspiration has uniquely positioned Scripps Networks Interactive in the minds of viewers, advertisers and platforms alike. 
23 years ago, we created a cable network company. Now in 2017, we are a comprehensive lifestyle content business that relentlessly pursues deeper engagement with consumers everywhere regardless of device or geography. Our lifestyle-leading brands are at the heart of Scripps Networks Interactive. And I'm happy to say that we continue to deliver great performance in our core businesses. Our networks continue to resonate with consumers now more than ever. 
We have seen consistent strength in ratings, and we're continuing to strengthen our core business through investment in programming and we can see that pay off in our results. But as I've said, we're now more than just a television company. Three announcements that we made just this week underpin our strategic focus on expanding our reach through new platforms and technologies. For example, yesterday, Hulu announced that our networks will be included on their virtual MVPD product offering. Now since our network group is not among Hulu's investors, that is one clear illustration of the value distribution partners place on the audience that we deliver and the value that we offer to businesses seeking to establish themselves with a mainstream audience. The addition of Hulu means that our networks will be available on almost every one of the virtual MVPD skinny-bundle offers announced so far. 
We're also excited to partner with each of these companies as we bring our highly sought-after brands to new audiences through these streaming platforms. Yesterday, we also announced that we acquired next-generation food media company, Spoon University. Spoon U is a company created by millennials for millennials, and we expect this acquisition to help us build our content, community and brand as we accelerate our digital strategy and reach with younger audiences. 
And just this morning, we announced that we've expanded our relationship with Snapchat, enabling us to create original, short-form show concepts specifically for that platform. Food Networks' launch on Snapchat's Discover platform in January 2015 was fundamental to our development as a digital content company, helping us to become much more agile. 
Our digital content division, Scripps Lifestyle Studios, has become the one-stop shop for all digital content, leading the way for digital and video integration. We've demonstrated incredible video and social growth over the last year as well. The Lifestyle Studios generated nearly 2.9 billion video views. That's an increase of about 450% over the first quarter of 2016, really a remarkable achievement and just one example of our determination to expand our reach across all devices. 
Regardless of whether consumers are watching the Property Brothers on television on HGTV or seeing Andrew Zimmern on Facebook or peeking behind the scenes of Iron Chef Gauntlet on their mobile phone, we're always looking to make sure we deliver a consistent and rewarding experience. 
We've created a highly differentiated environment within the current media landscape. Our networks provide an optimistic environment where consumers are open to receiving advertising messages and importantly, act on those messages. This translates to strong financial results, with our network group consistently delivering advertising growth. To use a theme from our recent very successful upfront presentations, environment matters. The environment we cultivate for our distributors, combined with the growing strength of our brands, satisfies the viewing desires of their customers and creates value for the distribution's business model. For those reasons, our networks have become essential to the leading multichannel providers. As well as reaching agreements with virtual MVD players such Hulu, we continue to make significant progress and deals with more traditional platforms. For example, over the last several months, we've executed long-term renewals with a number of our distribution partners and have now renegotiated nearly 80% of our subscriber base for the next several years. We're not just focused on creating engaging viewing environments in the United States but also throughout the world. TVN continues to deliver solid growth across its portfolio, increasing revenue, audience levels and market share. HGTV in Poland continues to outperform even our own high expectations and provides a platform to debut in more European markets over the coming years. We're actively engaged in partnership discussions with some of the biggest media groups in key markets about launching networks or branded blocks of content. Our success in countries such as Poland really reinforces our value to those potential partners. 
With important launches of our networks also come up in markets, including Germany and Italy, we're clearly demonstrating our commitment to expanding our geographic reach. Let me close by restating that over 20 years ago, we started to create and own lifestyle programming, focusing on ideas, information and inspiration, or as Burton Jablin said when he coined it, the 3 Is. It's created a unique viewing environment. We set out to ensure this content was available wherever and whenever viewers wanted to consume it. That philosophy continues to pay off on linear television, on digital platforms and internationally. It's a strategy that has served us very well. We continue to optimize our business across all areas as we focus on enhancing shareholder value for the long term. Today's results are another demonstration of that commitment. 
Now let me turn it over to Burton, who'll review some of our first quarter operating results. Burton?"

Scripps Networks Interactive continues to perform at a high level, benefiting from our continued investment and focus on delivering engaging content across all brands. Following up on the theme that Ken spoke about, our approach to delivering a differentiated and engaging environment was highlighted in a recent study conducted by Nielsen. The results of the study indicated advertising messages were viewed 22% more favorably in our lifestyle environment than for general entertainment, reality, sports or news. Nielsen also determined that viewers were on average 94% more engaged with the commercial view on our lifestyle -- in our lifestyle environment than in the other genres. Compared with sports programming, lifestyle performed 150% better, and against news programming, 172%. Those results demonstrate that environment really matters. The engaging environment we create, coupled with the popularity of our must-have lifestyle brands, continues to pay off in our quarterly results. 
In the first quarter of 2017, amid an evolving landscape, 5 of our 6 U.S. networks posted year-over-year gains for adults 25-54 in sales prime rating. In addition, 5 of our 6 networks grew or were in line for key total day ratings.
When it comes to home, viewers look to us for how to buy it, build it, share it and love it. At HGTV, the network delivered its second highest-rated quarter ever. HGTV was ranked as the #1 network for women in both sales prime and weekend time periods with solid delivery from hit series Fixer Upper, Flip or Flop and Property Brothers, helping to drive the quarter. Our programming teams have a knack for building on what works, and so we franchised our successful shows Flip or Flop to include several new couples in new cities. Flip or Flop Vegas premiered April 7 to strong viewership and ratings and has continued to deliver rating success each week since. 
Our creative teams also have another new hit on their hands with Hometown, which premiered in the first quarter as the second highest-rated show on HGTV for adults 25-54 sales prime, behind only our hit, Fixer Upper. In April, the positive momentum from these premieres helped position HGTV as the #1 cable network for women 25-54 and the #6 network for adults 25-54. HGTV also finished April as the #1 cable network in weekends. 
The demand for Food content continues to grow. And for Food Network, our programming has never been more relevant to the lives of consumers. In the first quarter of 2017, Food Network's ratings were even with 2016 for adults 25-54 while improving 4% among both women 25-54 and women 18-49. Leading shows in the quarter were Worst Cooks in America and Kids Baking Championship. 
Returning to Food Network. For the first time in more than 3 years is the icon of cooking shows, Iron Chef. In its premiere episode on April 16, Iron Chef Gauntlet was the highest-rated Scripps Networks show that week, and follow-up episodes continue to generate high marks for the network. 
Travel Channel finished the quarter with adult 25-54 ratings, up 9% for sales prime, making it the highest-rated quarter since the first quarter of 2014. Travel Channel continues to build momentum off a successful programming slate, which includes premieres of Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, Mysteries at the Museum, and Bizarre Foods, Delicious Destinations. 
DIY Network continues to deliver ratings growth across its key demos with ratings up 4% for adults 25-54. Key shows included Texas Flip and Move, Building Alaska and Homes and Homes. At Cooking Channel, the network again delivered its highest rated quarter ever for adults sales prime, improving 18% year-over-year. Driving the growth were original series Carnival Eats, Dinner at Tiffany's and Food Fact or Fiction. 
Great American Country is a great complement to the Scripps lifestyle portfolio with content that powers our audience's passion for outdoor pursuits. In the first quarter of 2017, the network posted its highest rating since 2007, marking 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth. 
Our strategy to deliver consistent, engaging and quality content 7 nights a week continues to pay off. With premieres every night of the week, viewers will always have a reason to return to our networks. 
Scripps Lifestyle Studios continues to lead engagement and broaden our reach on dozens of digital and mobile platforms. In the first quarter of 2017, Scripps Lifestyle Studios averaged more than 430 million monthly unique visitors across multiple platforms. The team produced more than 1,000 videos in the first quarter of this year. As Ken mentioned, video views in the quarter were up to almost 3 billion, and we continue to see significant growth as we move into the second quarter. 
We continue to look for new ways to engage younger audiences. The agreement we announced today with Snapchat will enable us to bring original short-form food and home-related shows to the platform. This partnership allows us to further bridge our television brands to digital and create unique content tailored for the next generation of food and home enthusiasts. 
Our TV Everywhere apps are showing significant growth in both video plays as well as user visits. Video plays in the first quarter increased more than 360%, and average monthly visits improved 42% compared to 2016. The base is small, but we're pleased with the momentum TV Everywhere is showing. 
In April, after generating more than 1 billion views, Food Network ranked #1 among Tubular Labs' food and drink category, topping TasteMade, Delish and BuzzFeed's Tasty. Our All-Star promotions team came together to create the ultimate seaside getaway for the 2017 HGTV Dream Home Giveaway. The annual sweepstakes received an all-time high of 131 million entries in the first quarter. 
Internationally, our brands continued to deliver. The first quarter was another strong quarter for TVN with ratings for the group improving nearly 6% with its key 16-49 year old audience compared to the first quarter of 2016. TVN, the main network, achieved a market share of nearly 13%, making it the most-watched television station in Poland for persons 16-49. TVN 24 was the most-watched 24-hour news channel in Poland, and TVN Style was the #1 lifestyle channel during the quarter. HGTV in Poland continues to build momentum as more and more audiences tune in to its lifestyle programming. After launching earlier this week, HGTV is the #2 lifestyle network in the country among women 16-49, second only to TVN Style. 
For its just completed fiscal year, UKTV delivered record financial results, growing revenue 8% and EBITDA 11%, both in local currency. The multichannel broadcaster also grew its share of viewing 10% over the prior year. We remain focused on growing our footprint in new markets. Most recently, we announced that Food Network will launch in Italy on May 8. This will be the first dedicated multiplatform food and entertainment channel in the country and will offer a mix of local original productions and our flagship shows. This launch in a key growth market for our company represents a significant milestone in our ongoing global expansion. Quarter-after-quarter, Scripps Networks Interactive delivers consistent and improving operating results. We're pleased with our performance to date in 2017. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Lori, who'll review and detail our financial performance for the first quarter of 2017."
6469353,424185681,1212926,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I'll focus my comments today on the quarterly consolidated numbers and discuss our operating segment performance. Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 5% to $855 million compared with the prior",984,"Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I'll focus my comments today on the quarterly consolidated numbers and discuss our operating segment performance. 
Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 5% to $855 million compared with the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, distribution revenue growth and growth in our international businesses. As a result of our revenue growth, coupled with a modest increase in expenses due to timing, consolidated adjusted segment profit improved 6%. The growth in adjusted segment profit, coupled with lower depreciation, amortization and interest expense as well as increase in foreign exchange transaction gains, increased our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.53 compared with $1.29 in the prior year quarter. 
Looking at our operating segment. Our U.S. networks' revenue increased 5%. This improvement was driven by growth in advertising demand for our lifestyle networks and the expected increase in distribution revenue. U.S. advertising revenue increased 5% year-over-year in the first quarter due to CPM pricing increases, partially offset by an increase -- an overall decrease in impressions and a pricing mix shift away from higher-priced scatter inventory compared with the first quarter of 2016. 
Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPMs up mid- to high-teens year-over-year and up high-teens to mid-20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising category during the quarter were food, retail, consumer package goods, financial and pharma. These categories are consistent with the historical performance for the first quarter, except for pharma, which improved over 2016. 
The healthy demand for scatter has continued into the second quarter of 2017, although quarter-over-quarter CPM pricing increases have tempered somewhat in the first month of the quarter, especially compared with the strong CPM increases realized in the second quarter of last year. 
Presently, against tough comp, scatter-over-scatter CPM growth is running in the low single to low double-digit range, and scatter over upfront CPM growth is running in the mid- to high-teens range. Additionally, we are presently seeing an unprecedented strong second wave of scatter demand in the quarter during a period where scatter inventory and demand is normally lower. 
This wave of demand both would and should drive CPM pricing higher than what we are currently experiencing for the second quarter. Also included in our overall advertising revenue is our growing digital advertising business, which improved a healthy 12% over the first quarter of last year. This growth was partially offset by revenue decreases related to the strategic decision to discontinue our Netflix relationship and refocus our digital assets from Hulu.com to other more economically attractive digital efforts. 
Including these impacts, our overall digital revenue increased 4% compared with the prior year first quarter. Distribution revenue to the U.S. networks increased 4.5%. Contributing to this anticipated increase were negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top virtual MVPD platforms. These increases were partially offset by industry subscriber decline. As a result of the increase in revenue, coupled with a modest increase in spending due to timing, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. networks increased 6% compared with the prior year quarter.
Looking ahead, we expect spending to increase in the second and third quarters, increasing in the mid-teens compared with the prior year for both quarters. Driving this growth will be increases in programming related to our premiere schedule coupled with higher SG&A spending related to the various strategic growth initiatives we spoke about during our February earnings call. 
For the international segment, the majority of the revenues are generated by TVN. In local currency, TVN revenue increased 4% compared with the same time a year ago. On a reported basis, international networks revenues increased 3.5% to $125.5 million. Driven by the revenue growth and relatively flat expenses, international adjusted segment profit increased to $15.5 million compared with $10 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
In addition to our consolidated international business, a significant portion of our international business is reported in equity income. These investments include UKTV and our partnership with Corus in Canada for Food Networks, Cooking Channel, HGTV and DIY Network, along with some TVN minority investments. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $20 million, down from $26 million in the prior year quarter. Driving the year-over-year decrease was the sale of FOX Sports South in the first quarter of 2016 and decreased contribution from a TVN minority investment. These declines were partially offset by a double-digit percentage growth at UKTV. Additionally, subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2017, we announced the sale of a minority investment in Onet, a nonstrategic asset, for $54 million. This minority asset was not a material contributor to equity and earnings of affiliates. 
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the first quarter approximately 2.3x gross leverage, down from 2.6x at the end of the fourth quarter due to our strong free cash flow generation. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent, and we plan to use capital and operating cash flow to fund organic growth, including programming, new capabilities and multiplatform business models as well as invest strategically through M&A both domestically and internationally and to reduce our leverage. We will also continue to evaluate the opportunity to repurchase our shares under the existing board authorization, which has $1.5 billion remaining. 
Finally, there is no change in our previously issued full year guidance. As I indicated earlier, based on current programming schedules and strategic growth initiative spending, we expect to see increased expenses in the second and third quarters. This will drive overall expense growth in the low to double-digit range in each quarter compared with the prior year. Overall, we continue to expect to deliver solid growth in 2017 as we make important investments in high-quality content, data and multiplatform opportunities. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Ken."

So before we take Q&A in just a couple of minutes, I wanted to step back for a moment, offer a couple of observations, if I may. It's very clear that this is an industry that's undergoing significant change as consumer behavior continues to evolve. The companies, in my opinion, that will be successful for the long term are those that can optimize their business to take full advantage of the opportunities that technology and behavioral transformation offer us. Fortunately, adapting and changing is something that Scripps Networks Interactive really has at its very core. We've had it since day one. That's why I'm so confident in the long-term vision of this company. For example, the steps that we've taken just in the last few days are a demonstration of how we've taken a set of cable TV networks and ownership of our content and created a global lifestyle content business. It's a business that's taking active steps to grow, to respond to demand and build the brightest possible future. 
As we mentioned previously, yesterday, Hulu announced that our networks would be on their live TV service from launch, making us the only cable network group not owned by Hulu shareholders to be included. That's a ringing endorsement of our brands and the value that they bring to advertisers and distributors. And just a few hours later, we announced the acquisition of Spoon University, a next-generation food media company founded by 2 millennials who actually grew up watching Food Network. I guess it's the demonstration of our commitment to really never sit still and always find ways to stay relevant with our audiences. 
And then this morning, we announced our expanded relationship with Snapchat, with a commitment to create shows on their platform to build on the successful food and home franchises we built on our TV networks. That's an indication of the way we have revolutionized our processes to become a nimble production house that can take advantage of audience and advertising opportunities within hours, not months. So around the globe, we're growing, we're developing. Our linear networks are entering new markets and capturing audiences every month. Our social teams are creating more videos and content than ever before. And we've gone from 10s of millions of views per quarter to almost 3 billion. 
Change is not easy, but at Scripps Networks Interactive, we regard it as a necessity. That's why the fundamentals of our business are so strong. That's why we continue to grow and that's why I continue to have such a resounding faith in the long-term success of this business. 
So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions this morning. Operator?"

In the case of Snapchat, I have to say it's been a great partnership thus far. Just in the last 12 months, we've doubled our audience on Snapchat. By now expanding into the home category, we actually see this as a partnership that is going to lead to profitability. And we don't really share a lot of the financial arrangements that we have. But I have to say that we've been very impressed with not only what we've been able to do on Snapchat but some of the anecdotal stuff that's coming from that.

So in that context, we're expanding our reach to younger audiences through Snapchat, most recently with Spoon U. And this is a process that you'll see us continue because we want to get younger people who are interested in the food category when they're young, under one of our services, maybe move them to other of our platforms. So it's part of a broader strategy."

You could remember a time when I was out begging people to give us $100 for a cable network spot because the value just wasn't there. And if you look at a lot of things that we were doing to E.W. Scripps eons ago with these little cable networks and these little investments, we had these big newspapers and television stations and all this cash flow, it was really about getting bigger by thinking smaller, and it's a lesson we've never forgotten. So now with successful cable networks but very successful brands, how can we partner, how can we, as Burton says, go beyond our core audiences to younger audiences that are not necessarily on linear television. And the real way to do it is to partner with Snapchat, with Facebook, on and on and on. And we think it'll pay off in the long term. And I think sometimes we just don't get the credit for some of the expanding beyond the core linear television business because it doesn't show immediate payoff on the bottom line. But I'm hopeful like the little ideas of the cable networks that certainly were beneficial to the growth of the E.W. Scripps Company, some of these small investments and small partnerships we're making now will benefit SNI over the long term. And Lori, you want to take Laura's question about ratings?"

So the first quarter was a little bit, I won't call it an anomaly, but I don't think we've seen that much live viewing in a quarter unless you come up with something like the Olympics or some big events. So we were fighting some headwinds in first quarter. But look, you've been in this business long enough when you have incredible quarters, it's a ratings business that goes up and down.

It's still #1 with women 25-54, upscale women, in particular, upscale audiences. So when we analyze it, we see the specific things that Ken mentioned. And then there's one more. I mean, these are things that affect us. We don't pay a lot of attention to competition, but there was a big hit on NBC this year on Tuesday nights called This is Us, airing against one of our biggest hits, Fixer Upper. And we did see an impact there. Now once This is Us went out of premiere, we saw Fixer Upper do just fine. So again, these were specific things. News viewing in comparison to first quarter last year, not fundamental issues with HGTV at all. And I was just with our team this week talking about all the great new premieres they have coming on in the second quarter and for the rest of the year.

John, let's start with your first question relative to advertising categories, endemics, et cetera. So you have to separate a little bit -- a lot of what's going on in retail as far as real estate in stores from advertising budgets. Because quite honestly, if you look at our categories and our endemics, we haven't seen much of a change. I'm looking across the table at Lori to make sure that we're in total agreement. I don't have the information in front of me. But Lori, in the categories in consumer products, et cetera, autos, financial is pretty consistent from what we've seen from fourth quarter to first quarter and even trending beyond that. Having said that and, John, I think the fact that we always layer the endemics in. If you go back several years ago, it was a bigger percentage, if you will, of our overall advertising fortunately, as we've grown, it has become smaller. But I have to say, it's really helpful to have that. Because when you have the home improvements, when you have the consumer products that are tilted towards the home and food categories, it's part of the reason that we, I think, are as consistent as we are in the advertising market. But I think the easy answer is, there's not a significant change that we're seeing at this point depending on where retail goes and store closings and all those kinds of things. But if anything, some of that money, in a couple of instances, we've actually had seen shift to advertising where there's maybe more advertising dollars freed up and less around retail locations. And I think -- and talking to Steve Gelati, that's a trend we expect to see continuing. That's why, John, we're expanding more into the digital areas as well in trying to get a bigger piece of that advertising budget. Lori, you want to take John's second question? I'll come back on the skinny bundle."

Our point of view is, Hulu is a good example. We're in about just every one of the skinny bundles, and it's not a business that we necessarily want to go up and start out on our own because slicing and dicing a $35 bundle down to whatever price point right now doesn't seem to us to be a target we want to shoot for. I would leave all opportunities open in the future. But these partnerships, it's best for us to monetize with streaming services that are already doing the heavy lifting to get out there. Having said that, the ability to go directly to consumer, if you will, I think long term still has a lot of appreciation on our part and potentially a lot of payoff.

And so I guess, give you the chance to help us understand why you have that confidence given what seems to be going on with pricing environment and mix shifts and things like that? And the second, I'll just put it at while I've got the floor, the second, sort of more strategic question, maybe Burton or Ken. Burton, you talked about the differentiated engaging environment for advertising, and how important that was to you. That seems a contrast to me, actually directly with what some of your peers are saying when you think about maybe something like this open AP interface, which seems to be sort of disaggregating the sale of audience from the surrounding context and environment and basically you could argue just commoditizing the audience, and just interesting contrast to your point of view with that trend and here what you think about the compare and contrast there, and how you think selling your context net audience insulates you and gives you an advantage as the industry goes up and down, the ratings goes ups and down?"

But when you're a company like ours that from the beginning has been in specific categories where we target specific audiences in those categories upscale, educated audience, audiences who have a tendency to do what they view, as we always say, we take advantage of that differentiation. In the world of other kinds of content, that is less differentiated, whether it's scripted content or other kinds of reality programs where it's not clear what the difference is between one network and another in terms of their focus. That becomes harder and easier to commoditize, as you put it. And then on the digital side, we see the same bifurcation going on, you have programmatic buying, which we do. We engage in it to make sure we're filling all of our inventory. But the real interesting area for us are the what we call high touch digital advertising deals where we really do work with marketers to create really, specific, hopefully, 360-degree cross-platform buys that capitalize on the specificity of our audience, the targeted nature of our content and the environment we create. So both exist in this world, there's no question. And in some places, we play in both worlds, particularly digitally. But we think the differentiation is a real advantage for us. And the more the rest of the market commoditizes, we think we have even more of an advantage by being targeted."

And I think I'll come back to what I said in the scripted comments and that is, we of course, look to deploy that capital organically to help grow the business, starting with our programming, looking at these multiplatform opportunities that we've been talking about today and as well as new capabilities. Again, not capabilities to go direct-to-consumer, a lot of our peers are doing that, but just capabilities that you need to do that. So we're making some investments and we've talked about that. We continue to be opportunistic on the M&A side, both internationally on the digital front, Hulu being a good example of that. But on the digital side, it's not being huge capital outlays that we see in the foreseeable future. And we continue to look out there. So I think we've always said that we will be opportunistic, but we will also be balanced and think about returning capital to shareholders if we don't have better uses for that. So I think just based on your question, you can see we've gotten in a much more comfortable leveraged position, I'm sure, as we always do, we will be talking to our board about this in our board meeting.

It really was about the year-over-year scatter pricing increases we saw in elevation and a widening of the gap. We went from probably low double-digit increases in scatter-versus-scatter in Q1 of last year until we were almost high-teens to 20% year-over-year. So we really saw that scatter pricing take a huge bump in the second quarter. So it wasn't overall. It was really -- I was meaning to highlight that the scatter pricing marketplace really got extremely hot in the second quarter of last year. As for as that unprecedented wave, I was talking with Steve Gelati just yesterday, usually, by this time, and maybe as you're going into the upfront, you see a lot less activity going on, but he has got charts that show that demand, they're still knocking on the door, they're still looking to buy scatter that's usually moderating by now. He is seeing just an opposite trend, which is why we're trying to give some color to why we gave that pretty wide range that was, somebody asked a question about earlier, is that we're seeing that's probably going to tighten up and we might see some lift in strength to that.

So as we look at each of these markets, to answer the second part of your question, we look to see, is there a high pay TV penetration, for example, in this case of Italy the answer is, no, it's much more of a broadcast network. Is there an opportunity for us to get in and get some valued real estate in order to bring in the kind of viewership which you need in a broadcast environment,  and the case was, yes.

Good morning, everyone. Always happy you're able to be with us today.

Good morning, everyone. Always happy you're able to be with us today. 
The momentum we saw in 2016 has continued into 2017 as we further implement our strategy of strengthening our core businesses, building our reach but most importantly, monetizing our audiences. In the first quarter of this year, total operating revenue grew 5%. Adjusted segment profit increased 6%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $1.53. 
Our unwavering focus on building deep and enduring connections with upscale consumers everywhere through compelling lifestyle content in the Home, Food and Travel categories and our ability to monetize that relationship with advertisers and distributors is really what drives our consistent performance. Our proven strategy for creating compelling programming, focusing on ideas, information and inspiration has uniquely positioned Scripps Networks Interactive in the minds of viewers, advertisers and platforms alike. 
23 years ago, we created a cable network company. Now in 2017, we are a comprehensive lifestyle content business that relentlessly pursues deeper engagement with consumers everywhere regardless of device or geography. Our lifestyle-leading brands are at the heart of Scripps Networks Interactive. And I'm happy to say that we continue to deliver great performance in our core businesses. Our networks continue to resonate with consumers now more than ever. 
We have seen consistent strength in ratings, and we're continuing to strengthen our core business through investment in programming and we can see that pay off in our results. But as I've said, we're now more than just a television company. Three announcements that we made just this week underpin our strategic focus on expanding our reach through new platforms and technologies. For example, yesterday, Hulu announced that our networks will be included on their virtual MVPD product offering. Now since our network group is not among Hulu's investors, that is one clear illustration of the value distribution partners place on the audience that we deliver and the value that we offer to businesses seeking to establish themselves with a mainstream audience. The addition of Hulu means that our networks will be available on almost every one of the virtual MVPD skinny-bundle offers announced so far. 
We're also excited to partner with each of these companies as we bring our highly sought-after brands to new audiences through these streaming platforms. Yesterday, we also announced that we acquired next-generation food media company, Spoon University. Spoon U is a company created by millennials for millennials, and we expect this acquisition to help us build our content, community and brand as we accelerate our digital strategy and reach with younger audiences. 
And just this morning, we announced that we've expanded our relationship with Snapchat, enabling us to create original, short-form show concepts specifically for that platform. Food Networks' launch on Snapchat's Discover platform in January 2015 was fundamental to our development as a digital content company, helping us to become much more agile. 
Our digital content division, Scripps Lifestyle Studios, has become the one-stop shop for all digital content, leading the way for digital and video integration. We've demonstrated incredible video and social growth over the last year as well. The Lifestyle Studios generated nearly 2.9 billion video views. That's an increase of about 450% over the first quarter of 2016, really a remarkable achievement and just one example of our determination to expand our reach across all devices. 
Regardless of whether consumers are watching the Property Brothers on television on HGTV or seeing Andrew Zimmern on Facebook or peeking behind the scenes of Iron Chef Gauntlet on their mobile phone, we're always looking to make sure we deliver a consistent and rewarding experience. 
We've created a highly differentiated environment within the current media landscape. Our networks provide an optimistic environment where consumers are open to receiving advertising messages and importantly, act on those messages. This translates to strong financial results, with our network group consistently delivering advertising growth. To use a theme from our recent very successful upfront presentations, environment matters. The environment we cultivate for our distributors, combined with the growing strength of our brands, satisfies the viewing desires of their customers and creates value for the distribution's business model. For those reasons, our networks have become essential to the leading multichannel providers. As well as reaching agreements with virtual MVD players such Hulu, we continue to make significant progress and deals with more traditional platforms. For example, over the last several months, we've executed long-term renewals with a number of our distribution partners and have now renegotiated nearly 80% of our subscriber base for the next several years. We're not just focused on creating engaging viewing environments in the United States but also throughout the world. TVN continues to deliver solid growth across its portfolio, increasing revenue, audience levels and market share. HGTV in Poland continues to outperform even our own high expectations and provides a platform to debut in more European markets over the coming years. We're actively engaged in partnership discussions with some of the biggest media groups in key markets about launching networks or branded blocks of content. Our success in countries such as Poland really reinforces our value to those potential partners. 
With important launches of our networks also come up in markets, including Germany and Italy, we're clearly demonstrating our commitment to expanding our geographic reach. Let me close by restating that over 20 years ago, we started to create and own lifestyle programming, focusing on ideas, information and inspiration, or as Burton Jablin said when he coined it, the 3 Is. It's created a unique viewing environment. We set out to ensure this content was available wherever and whenever viewers wanted to consume it. That philosophy continues to pay off on linear television, on digital platforms and internationally. It's a strategy that has served us very well. We continue to optimize our business across all areas as we focus on enhancing shareholder value for the long term. Today's results are another demonstration of that commitment. 
Now let me turn it over to Burton, who'll review some of our first quarter operating results. Burton?"

Scripps Networks Interactive continues to perform at a high level, benefiting from our continued investment and focus on delivering engaging content across all brands. Following up on the theme that Ken spoke about, our approach to delivering a differentiated and engaging environment was highlighted in a recent study conducted by Nielsen. The results of the study indicated advertising messages were viewed 22% more favorably in our lifestyle environment than for general entertainment, reality, sports or news. Nielsen also determined that viewers were on average 94% more engaged with the commercial view on our lifestyle -- in our lifestyle environment than in the other genres. Compared with sports programming, lifestyle performed 150% better, and against news programming, 172%. Those results demonstrate that environment really matters. The engaging environment we create, coupled with the popularity of our must-have lifestyle brands, continues to pay off in our quarterly results. 
In the first quarter of 2017, amid an evolving landscape, 5 of our 6 U.S. networks posted year-over-year gains for adults 25-54 in sales prime rating. In addition, 5 of our 6 networks grew or were in line for key total day ratings.
When it comes to home, viewers look to us for how to buy it, build it, share it and love it. At HGTV, the network delivered its second highest-rated quarter ever. HGTV was ranked as the #1 network for women in both sales prime and weekend time periods with solid delivery from hit series Fixer Upper, Flip or Flop and Property Brothers, helping to drive the quarter. Our programming teams have a knack for building on what works, and so we franchised our successful shows Flip or Flop to include several new couples in new cities. Flip or Flop Vegas premiered April 7 to strong viewership and ratings and has continued to deliver rating success each week since. 
Our creative teams also have another new hit on their hands with Hometown, which premiered in the first quarter as the second highest-rated show on HGTV for adults 25-54 sales prime, behind only our hit, Fixer Upper. In April, the positive momentum from these premieres helped position HGTV as the #1 cable network for women 25-54 and the #6 network for adults 25-54. HGTV also finished April as the #1 cable network in weekends. 
The demand for Food content continues to grow. And for Food Network, our programming has never been more relevant to the lives of consumers. In the first quarter of 2017, Food Network's ratings were even with 2016 for adults 25-54 while improving 4% among both women 25-54 and women 18-49. Leading shows in the quarter were Worst Cooks in America and Kids Baking Championship. 
Returning to Food Network. For the first time in more than 3 years is the icon of cooking shows, Iron Chef. In its premiere episode on April 16, Iron Chef Gauntlet was the highest-rated Scripps Networks show that week, and follow-up episodes continue to generate high marks for the network. 
Travel Channel finished the quarter with adult 25-54 ratings, up 9% for sales prime, making it the highest-rated quarter since the first quarter of 2014. Travel Channel continues to build momentum off a successful programming slate, which includes premieres of Expedition Unknown, Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, Mysteries at the Museum, and Bizarre Foods, Delicious Destinations. 
DIY Network continues to deliver ratings growth across its key demos with ratings up 4% for adults 25-54. Key shows included Texas Flip and Move, Building Alaska and Homes and Homes. At Cooking Channel, the network again delivered its highest rated quarter ever for adults sales prime, improving 18% year-over-year. Driving the growth were original series Carnival Eats, Dinner at Tiffany's and Food Fact or Fiction. 
Great American Country is a great complement to the Scripps lifestyle portfolio with content that powers our audience's passion for outdoor pursuits. In the first quarter of 2017, the network posted its highest rating since 2007, marking 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth. 
Our strategy to deliver consistent, engaging and quality content 7 nights a week continues to pay off. With premieres every night of the week, viewers will always have a reason to return to our networks. 
Scripps Lifestyle Studios continues to lead engagement and broaden our reach on dozens of digital and mobile platforms. In the first quarter of 2017, Scripps Lifestyle Studios averaged more than 430 million monthly unique visitors across multiple platforms. The team produced more than 1,000 videos in the first quarter of this year. As Ken mentioned, video views in the quarter were up to almost 3 billion, and we continue to see significant growth as we move into the second quarter. 
We continue to look for new ways to engage younger audiences. The agreement we announced today with Snapchat will enable us to bring original short-form food and home-related shows to the platform. This partnership allows us to further bridge our television brands to digital and create unique content tailored for the next generation of food and home enthusiasts. 
Our TV Everywhere apps are showing significant growth in both video plays as well as user visits. Video plays in the first quarter increased more than 360%, and average monthly visits improved 42% compared to 2016. The base is small, but we're pleased with the momentum TV Everywhere is showing. 
In April, after generating more than 1 billion views, Food Network ranked #1 among Tubular Labs' food and drink category, topping TasteMade, Delish and BuzzFeed's Tasty. Our All-Star promotions team came together to create the ultimate seaside getaway for the 2017 HGTV Dream Home Giveaway. The annual sweepstakes received an all-time high of 131 million entries in the first quarter. 
Internationally, our brands continued to deliver. The first quarter was another strong quarter for TVN with ratings for the group improving nearly 6% with its key 16-49 year old audience compared to the first quarter of 2016. TVN, the main network, achieved a market share of nearly 13%, making it the most-watched television station in Poland for persons 16-49. TVN 24 was the most-watched 24-hour news channel in Poland, and TVN Style was the #1 lifestyle channel during the quarter. HGTV in Poland continues to build momentum as more and more audiences tune in to its lifestyle programming. After launching earlier this week, HGTV is the #2 lifestyle network in the country among women 16-49, second only to TVN Style. 
For its just completed fiscal year, UKTV delivered record financial results, growing revenue 8% and EBITDA 11%, both in local currency. The multichannel broadcaster also grew its share of viewing 10% over the prior year. We remain focused on growing our footprint in new markets. Most recently, we announced that Food Network will launch in Italy on May 8. This will be the first dedicated multiplatform food and entertainment channel in the country and will offer a mix of local original productions and our flagship shows. This launch in a key growth market for our company represents a significant milestone in our ongoing global expansion. Quarter-after-quarter, Scripps Networks Interactive delivers consistent and improving operating results. We're pleased with our performance to date in 2017. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Lori, who'll review and detail our financial performance for the first quarter of 2017."
6469353,424185681,1212930,"Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I'll focus my comments today on the quarterly consolidated numbers and discuss our operating segment performance. Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 5% to $855 million compared with the prior",984,"Thanks, Burton, and good morning, everyone. I'll focus my comments today on the quarterly consolidated numbers and discuss our operating segment performance. 
Consolidated revenues in the first quarter increased 5% to $855 million compared with the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by the strength of the U.S. advertising market, distribution revenue growth and growth in our international businesses. As a result of our revenue growth, coupled with a modest increase in expenses due to timing, consolidated adjusted segment profit improved 6%. The growth in adjusted segment profit, coupled with lower depreciation, amortization and interest expense as well as increase in foreign exchange transaction gains, increased our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.53 compared with $1.29 in the prior year quarter. 
Looking at our operating segment. Our U.S. networks' revenue increased 5%. This improvement was driven by growth in advertising demand for our lifestyle networks and the expected increase in distribution revenue. U.S. advertising revenue increased 5% year-over-year in the first quarter due to CPM pricing increases, partially offset by an increase -- an overall decrease in impressions and a pricing mix shift away from higher-priced scatter inventory compared with the first quarter of 2016. 
Scatter pricing was strong during the quarter, with CPMs up mid- to high-teens year-over-year and up high-teens to mid-20% over the broadcast upfront. Our top 5 advertising category during the quarter were food, retail, consumer package goods, financial and pharma. These categories are consistent with the historical performance for the first quarter, except for pharma, which improved over 2016. 
The healthy demand for scatter has continued into the second quarter of 2017, although quarter-over-quarter CPM pricing increases have tempered somewhat in the first month of the quarter, especially compared with the strong CPM increases realized in the second quarter of last year. 
Presently, against tough comp, scatter-over-scatter CPM growth is running in the low single to low double-digit range, and scatter over upfront CPM growth is running in the mid- to high-teens range. Additionally, we are presently seeing an unprecedented strong second wave of scatter demand in the quarter during a period where scatter inventory and demand is normally lower. 
This wave of demand both would and should drive CPM pricing higher than what we are currently experiencing for the second quarter. Also included in our overall advertising revenue is our growing digital advertising business, which improved a healthy 12% over the first quarter of last year. This growth was partially offset by revenue decreases related to the strategic decision to discontinue our Netflix relationship and refocus our digital assets from Hulu.com to other more economically attractive digital efforts. 
Including these impacts, our overall digital revenue increased 4% compared with the prior year first quarter. Distribution revenue to the U.S. networks increased 4.5%. Contributing to this anticipated increase were negotiated rate increases and new distribution related to over-the-top virtual MVPD platforms. These increases were partially offset by industry subscriber decline. As a result of the increase in revenue, coupled with a modest increase in spending due to timing, adjusted segment profit for the U.S. networks increased 6% compared with the prior year quarter.
Looking ahead, we expect spending to increase in the second and third quarters, increasing in the mid-teens compared with the prior year for both quarters. Driving this growth will be increases in programming related to our premiere schedule coupled with higher SG&A spending related to the various strategic growth initiatives we spoke about during our February earnings call. 
For the international segment, the majority of the revenues are generated by TVN. In local currency, TVN revenue increased 4% compared with the same time a year ago. On a reported basis, international networks revenues increased 3.5% to $125.5 million. Driven by the revenue growth and relatively flat expenses, international adjusted segment profit increased to $15.5 million compared with $10 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
In addition to our consolidated international business, a significant portion of our international business is reported in equity income. These investments include UKTV and our partnership with Corus in Canada for Food Networks, Cooking Channel, HGTV and DIY Network, along with some TVN minority investments. In total, equity and earnings of affiliates was $20 million, down from $26 million in the prior year quarter. Driving the year-over-year decrease was the sale of FOX Sports South in the first quarter of 2016 and decreased contribution from a TVN minority investment. These declines were partially offset by a double-digit percentage growth at UKTV. Additionally, subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2017, we announced the sale of a minority investment in Onet, a nonstrategic asset, for $54 million. This minority asset was not a material contributor to equity and earnings of affiliates. 
On the balance sheet, I'd like to touch on a couple of items. We finished the first quarter approximately 2.3x gross leverage, down from 2.6x at the end of the fourth quarter due to our strong free cash flow generation. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent, and we plan to use capital and operating cash flow to fund organic growth, including programming, new capabilities and multiplatform business models as well as invest strategically through M&A both domestically and internationally and to reduce our leverage. We will also continue to evaluate the opportunity to repurchase our shares under the existing board authorization, which has $1.5 billion remaining. 
Finally, there is no change in our previously issued full year guidance. As I indicated earlier, based on current programming schedules and strategic growth initiative spending, we expect to see increased expenses in the second and third quarters. This will drive overall expense growth in the low to mid-double-digit range in each quarter compared with the prior year. Overall, we continue to expect to deliver solid growth in 2017 as we make important investments in high-quality content, data and multiplatform opportunities. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Ken."

So before we take Q&A in just a couple of minutes, I wanted to step back for a moment, offer a couple of observations, if I may. It's very clear that this is an industry that's undergoing significant change as consumer behavior continues to evolve. The companies, in my opinion, that will be successful for the long term are those that can optimize their business to take full advantage of the opportunities that technology and behavioral transformation offer us. Fortunately, adapting and changing is something that Scripps Networks Interactive really has at its very core. We've had it since day one. That's why I'm so confident in the long-term vision of this company. For example, the steps that we've taken just in the last few days are a demonstration of how we've taken a set of cable TV networks and ownership of our content and created a global lifestyle content business. It's a business that's taking active steps to grow, to respond to demand and build the brightest possible future. 
As we mentioned previously, yesterday, Hulu announced that our networks would be on their live TV service from launch, making us the only cable network group not owned by Hulu shareholders to be included. That's a ringing endorsement of our brands and the value that they bring to advertisers and distributors. And just a few hours later, we announced the acquisition of Spoon University, a next-generation food media company founded by 2 millennials who actually grew up watching Food Network. I guess it's the demonstration of our commitment to really never sit still and always find ways to stay relevant with our audiences. 
And then this morning, we announced our expanded relationship with Snapchat, with a commitment to create shows on their platform to build on the successful food and home franchises we built on our TV networks. That's an indication of the way we have revolutionized our processes to become a nimble production house that can take advantage of audience and advertising opportunities within hours, not months. So around the globe, we're growing, we're developing. Our linear networks are entering new markets and capturing audiences every month. Our social teams are creating more videos and content than ever before. And we've gone from 10s of millions of views per quarter to almost 3 billion. 
Change is not easy, but at Scripps Networks Interactive, we regard it as a necessity. That's why the fundamentals of our business are so strong. That's why we continue to grow and that's why I continue to have such a resounding faith in the long-term success of this business.

By now expanding into the home category, we actually see this as a partnership that is going to lead to profitability. And we don't really share a lot of the financial arrangements that we have. But I have to say that we've been very impressed with not only what we've been able to do on Snapchat but some of the anecdotal stuff that's coming from that. And I'll leave it at there, although Burton maybe want to comment a little bit beyond that. Burton?"

So in that context, we're expanding our reach to younger audiences through Snapchat, most recently with Spoon U. And this is a process that you'll see us continue because we want to get younger people who are interested in the food category when they're young, under one of our services, maybe move them to other of our platforms.

You could remember a time when I was out begging people to give us $100 for a cable network spot because the value just wasn't there. And if you look at a lot of things that we were doing to E.W. Scripps eons ago with these little cable networks and these little investments, we had these big newspapers and television stations and all this cash flow, it was really about getting bigger by thinking smaller, and it's a lesson we've never forgotten. So now with successful cable networks but very successful brands, how can we partner, how can we, as Burton says, go beyond our core audiences to younger audiences that are not necessarily on linear television. And the real way to do it is to partner with Snapchat, with Facebook, on and on and on. And we think it'll pay off in the long term. And I think sometimes we just don't get the credit for some of the expanding beyond the core linear television business because it doesn't show immediate payoff on the bottom line. But I'm hopeful like the little ideas of the cable networks that certainly were beneficial to the growth of the E.W. Scripps Company, some of these small investments and small partnerships we're making now will benefit SNI over the long term. And Lori, you want to take Laura's question about ratings?"

So the first quarter was a little bit, I won't call it an anomaly, but I don't think we've seen that much live viewing in a quarter unless you come up with something like the Olympics or some big events. So we were fighting some headwinds in first quarter. But look, you've been in this business long enough when you have incredible quarters, it's a ratings business that goes up and down.

I mean, these are things that affect us. We don't pay a lot of attention to competition, but there was a big hit on NBC this year on Tuesday nights called This is Us, airing against one of our biggest hits, Fixer Upper. And we did see an impact there. Now once This is Us went out of premiere, we saw Fixer Upper do just fine. So again, these were specific things. News viewing in comparison to first quarter last year, not fundamental issues with HGTV at all. And I was just with our team this week talking about all the great new premieres they have coming on in the second quarter and for the rest of the year.

And then for Lori, on the distribution side. I think you had previously said that you expect distribution growth to continue to grow throughout the year. So it sounds to me like some of the softness in industry subs is really not affecting your expectations for distribution growth in the 2Q and beyond. So is it just the case that the rate increases from your renewals are offsetting any softness in subs? And should we broadly continue to expect distribution revenue to accelerate with each successive quarter throughout the year?"

But that's what we saw and that's what we continue to see in the second quarter. On the distribution side, we, like we said in the opening comments, we are being impacted like everyone else with the distribution erosion that's continuing. We're not seeing it escalate. It's been pretty constant with what we saw last year. And yes, our pricing increases are helping to abate and offset that. And we do expect to continue to see increases throughout the year. But I wouldn't say we're not looking for, like, huge jumps from quarter-to-quarter. We just think it's going to gain some strength. But like the rest of the industry, we continue to watch the sub numbers.

John, let's start with your first question relative to advertising categories, endemics, et cetera. So you have to separate a little bit -- a lot of what's going on in retail as far as real estate in stores from advertising budgets. Because quite honestly, if you look at our categories and our endemics, we haven't seen much of a change. I'm looking across the table at Lori to make sure that we're in total agreement. I don't have the information in front of me. But Lori, in the categories in consumer products, et cetera, autos, financial is pretty consistent from what we've seen from fourth quarter to first quarter and even trending beyond that. Having said that and, John, I think the fact that we always layer the endemics in. If you go back several years ago, it was a bigger percentage, if you will, of our overall advertising fortunately, as we've grown, it has become smaller. But I have to say, it's really helpful to have that. Because when you have the home improvements, when you have the consumer products that are tilted towards the home and food categories, it's part of the reason that we, I think, are as consistent as we are in the advertising market. But I think the easy answer is, there's not a significant change that we're seeing at this point depending on where retail goes and store closings and all those kinds of things. But if anything, some of that money, in a couple of instances, we've actually had seen shift to advertising where there's maybe more advertising dollars freed up and less around retail locations. And I think -- and talking to Steve Gelati, that's a trend we expect to see continuing. That's why, John, we're expanding more into the digital areas as well in trying to get a bigger piece of that advertising budget. Lori, you want to take John's second question?

I would leave all opportunities open in the future. But these partnerships, it's best for us to monetize with streaming services that are already doing the heavy lifting to get out there.

But when you're a company like ours that from the beginning has been in specific categories where we target specific audiences in those categories upscale, educated audience, audiences who have a tendency to do what they view, as we always say, we take advantage of that differentiation. In the world of other kinds of content, that is less differentiated, whether it's scripted content or other kinds of reality programs where it's not clear what the difference is between one network and another in terms of their focus. That becomes harder and easier to commoditize, as you put it. And then on the digital side, we see the same bifurcation going on, you have programmatic buying, which we do. We engage in it to make sure we're filling all of our inventory. But the real interesting area for us are the what we call high touch digital advertising deals where we really do work with marketers to create really, specific, hopefully, 360-degree cross-platform buys that capitalize on the specificity of our audience, the targeted nature of our content and the environment we create. So both exist in this world, there's no question. And in some places, we play in both worlds, particularly digitally. But we think the differentiation is a real advantage for us. And the more the rest of the market commoditizes, we think we have even more of an advantage by being targeted."

And I think for Henry and his team to continue to put points on the scoreboard just emphasizes both hard work of that group, but the fact of the matter is, our value is recognized by every distribution product that's been rolled out. And also, the fact that Hulu overall in their strategic plan continues to value advertising, which is critically important for us in the deals that we do. So it truly was a win-win, and we couldn't be more pleased that Hulu decided to include us."

And if not, given your leverage is down to the mid-2s, how should we think about the balance sheet and deployment of capital as we get later into the year?"

So I would just say, we would always be interested if someone approached us and pricing and timing made sense. And as you pointed out, our leverages come down, so timing is a lot better than it was probably a year ago for us on that front. And as you said, if not Tribune, what will you do with that capital. And I think I'll come back to what I said in the scripted comments and that is, we of course, look to deploy that capital organically to help grow the business, starting with our programming, looking at these multiplatform opportunities that we've been talking about today and as well as new capabilities. Again, not capabilities to go direct-to-consumer, a lot of our peers are doing that, but just capabilities that you need to do that. So we're making some investments and we've talked about that. We continue to be opportunistic on the M&A side, both internationally on the digital front, Hulu being a good example of that. But on the digital side, it's not being huge capital outlays that we see in the foreseeable future. And we continue to look out there. So I think we've always said that we will be opportunistic, but we will also be balanced and think about returning capital to shareholders if we don't have better uses for that. So I think just based on your question, you can see we've gotten in a much more comfortable leveraged position, I'm sure, as we always do, we will be talking to our board about this in our board meeting. It's a continuous conversation, but we do still have $1.5 billion authorization remaining."

I think you said the comps, you called out the tough comps in Q2. When I look at your numbers last year, it looks like Q1 was the tougher comp, at least from a revenue perspective. So I thought maybe you could just help us think about the year-over-year comp between Q1 and Q2 as we think about modeling the second quarter ad sales. And then you talked about, it sort of jumped out to me as an unprecedented, I think you used the word, wave of demand. And I know we're not going week-by-week, but maybe you could just give us a little more context around that? Are you suggesting that your sort of scatter guidance or stated as scatter market is conservative? And then just for the broader team, I thought this launch in Italy is interesting, we've seen some real success from some of your U.S. peers who've gotten into that market. Could you talk a little bit more about how you see that opportunity and some of the time line for kind of capturing it and maybe compare what you're doing there to other international launches that you've done, so we can think about the opportunity from a revenue and profitability perspective?"

It really was about the year-over-year scatter pricing increases we saw in elevation and a widening of the gap. We went from probably low double-digit increases in scatter-versus-scatter in Q1 of last year until we were almost high-teens to 20% year-over-year. So we really saw that scatter pricing take a huge bump in the second quarter. So it wasn't overall. It was really -- I was meaning to highlight that the scatter pricing marketplace really got extremely hot in the second quarter of last year. As for as that unprecedented wave, I was talking with Steve Gelati just yesterday, usually, by this time, and maybe as you're going into the upfront, you see a lot less activity going on, but he has got charts that show that demand, they're still knocking on the door, they're still looking to buy scatter that's usually moderating by now. He is seeing just an opposite trend, which is why we're trying to give some color to why we gave that pretty wide range that was, somebody asked a question about earlier, is that we're seeing that's probably going to tighten up and we might see some lift in strength to that. So since we won't talk to you for a few months we want to give you that color."

This is our second digital terrestrial network in Italy with the launch of Food Network. We had Fine Living in the market already, it's more a home-targeted network. The exciting thing about this one, in particular, that we were able to secure a low channel position, which is extremely important in that market with channel 33. And with both of these flagship networks in place, we'll also be able to do more cross-promotion, there's been a tremendous amount of advertiser interest there. So as we look at each of these markets, to answer the second part of your question, we look to see, is there a high pay TV penetration, for example, in this case of Italy the answer is, no, it's much more of a broadcast network. Is there an opportunity for us to get in and get some valued real estate in order to bring in the kind of viewership which you need in a broadcast environment,  and the case was, yes. So very exciting in Italy. We also have a strong HGTV digital terrestrial presence here in Poland. And as we grow in these markets and the experience in the U.K. as well, we're able to segment our investments into sort of the digital pay television, environment, digital terrestrial, over-the-top like with the player here in Poland. And I think the key is just to change that mix supporting to where that market is, and that's been our strategy. And one other comment, the underlying thing which makes it such an exciting opportunity is that we own the content, we have a tremendous amount of output coming from the U.S. including the formats, and so we can replicate that success both with locally produced content and the content coming from the U.S."
