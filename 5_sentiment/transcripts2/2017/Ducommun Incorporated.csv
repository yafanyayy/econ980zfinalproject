We'll do things a little bit different today.

We'll do things a little bit different today. I'll begin by providing an overview of recent accomplishments and our current market outlook, then I'm going to hand the call over to our new President and CEO, Steve Oswald, to say a few words. After which, Doug Groves will go over our financial results in detail. 
The first, let me say a few words about Steve. He gives me great pleasure to have Steve take the helm of Ducommun. His appointment follows a thorough search by our Board of Directors to find a dedicated, experienced executive to take the company to the next level in its growth trajectory. Steve has an excellent background in the industry, having previously served in leadership positions at organizations including Capital Safety, United Technology, Hoechst Celanese and GE. Since joining Ducommun, he's been diligently working to become familiar with our management team, business units and our unique manufacturing capabilities and applications. We're proud of all we've accomplished this past year as we strengthened the balance sheet, streamlined our operations and improved our overall operating results. I believe that Steve will now bring a fresh perspective to running Ducommun with the passion, capability and experience needed to drive our long-term financial performance. He will continue our focus on growing the top line, expanding our customer base and leveraging our unique structural and electronics capabilities to enhance shareholder value. The Board and I are very confident in the future of Ducommun in Steve's hands as we turn to a new chapter in our history. I will be staying on as the Chairman to help ensure a smooth transition as Steve guides the company going forward.
Now turning to recent results. Let me just say how pleased we are to report another quarter of strong performance. We paid down an additional $10 million of our debt during the period, which means we eliminated a total of $75 million of indebtedness this year. These payments were driven by strong operating cash flow of $43.3 million and along with the proceeds from some of appropriate divestitures that served to focus the company and improve our long-term margin profile. 
On that note, we again posted strong gross margins of 19.5% in the fourth quarter, at the same time, ended the year with a backlog of approximately $600 million, driven by a nice uptick in the commercial aerospace backlog, which now stands at $318 million. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. I'll begin with our Commercial Aerospace business, certainly a highlight of our operations. As I mentioned, our backlog here again is that record levels that expands an array of platforms serving Boeing, Airbus and several other OEMs. Total commercial aerospace revenue in Q4 was approximately $65 million and full revenue -- and the full year revenue was close to $264 million, up 6% from 2015. We continue to be pleased with our position on the Boeing 737 and 737Max, the 777 and the 787 programs, as well as the Airbus A320, A330 and the A350 platforms. 
As you may have seen, we recently announced that the company has received a multi-year, multimillion-dollar contract from Airbus to produce additional titanium structures for engine support and engine frames on the A320neo. This award increased our content on the neo and illustrates the value-added structural solutions that leverage our titanium expertise, the key area of strategic focus for Ducommun. Our titanium sales are growing fast and are expected to represent almost 50% of our Structures business in the not-too-distant future. We remain on track to expanding our presence in Kansas[ph] facility to support our titanium operations and increased demand that we see in the quarters to come. In fact, we're developing over 25 new applications in 2017 in the titanium area alone, and expect this is significantly influence our future growth trajectory as we continue to invest in titanium to support our customers changing requirements of next-generation aircraft. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Fourth quarter revenue fell slightly to $65 million from our $69 million last year, reflecting our Milltek[ph] divestiture but results were up sequentially from the third quarter's $54 million and our backlog held steady at $257 million versus our $227 million at the end of 2015. Excluding the Miltec impact, military and defense sales actually rose slightly year-over-year, reflecting higher shipments on radar racks and other components on key platform, such as the F-18 and the F-15 programs. We continue to believe that the company is now operating in a baseline rate of approximately $60 million, plus or minus per quarter, for our military programs and foresee the possibility of higher defense spending under the new administration. It's too early to say how things will play out with the budget in Washington, but we are cautiously optimistic about revenue growth within this part of our business going forward. We anticipate higher shipments of radar racks with the F-15 and F-18 in 2017, along with solid missile systems revenue at the same time, we continue to target additional opportunities for innovative solutions as well as platform modifications and upgrades within the defense arena. 
Overall, we believe the [indiscernible] this quarter illustrates the type of operating results we are targeting throughout 2017. However, as a reminder, our first quarter is usually our softest from a top line perspective we did the seasonality, and we expect Q1 for 2017 to be in line with the first quarter of 2016 after adjusting for the divestitures. Gross margins could be down slightly in the 18% range due to the number of programs currently under development that are projected to come online in the second half.
Our improved balance sheet and our margin profile should drive solid earnings as our top line benefits from platform growth and new applications later this year. Given our position on the number of ramping up programs up in 2017, most notably the 737 and A320 and the prospect of slightly higher defense spending, we look forward to another year of strong performance and returns to our shareholders.
We did exactly what we said we would do in 2016 and we're pleased with how well the company is positioned as we begin 2017.
I'm happy to turn the call over to Steve Oswald, Ducommun's new President, Chief Executive Officer.

It's great to be onboard on Ducommun, where I see a lot of potential as I begin my tenure as President and CEO. 
It's been a busy, albeit a short time, since joining the company, I've been focused on operational management, traveling to the many sites, enjoying program rollout plans, and be familiar with every asset of the business. 
While I found an organization of talented individuals who are dedicated, know the aerospace industry extremely well, and are excited about the important role we play on a number of leading platforms. These people, as well as potential, that's why I joined Ducommun and I will lay more of my vision in the months to come for the company. 
As you know, a number of measures are already taken to reinvigorate to focus Ducommun before I arrived. And I want everyone to know we'll continue to follow the path that increases both top line growth and bottom line results. The fact that margins are solid, expenses are down and the balance sheet is strong, we'll provide the flexibility and foundation for us to focus in on innovation, business development, and, of course, having a world-class team on the field. 
As Doug will review in a moment, we posted strong margins and cash flow again this past quarter, and we believe the outlook for 2017 and beyond looks promising. Given our large book of business and attractive applications on many leading aerospace platforms. It's certainly an exciting time to be joining the company. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. 
Doug?"
267761,420256887,1150704,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 06, 2017",2017-03-06,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day to everybody. We'll review the financial results in a little different order today by starting with net income since we had 2 nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter related to the finalization of our Miltec divestiture.",1352,"Thank you, Steve, and good day to everybody. We'll review the financial results in a little different order today by starting with net income since we had 2 nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter related to the finalization of our Miltec divestiture. 
Net income was $2.8 million[ph] or $0.25 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $65.2 million or $5.88 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. The fourth quarter of 2016 included a negative $1.2 million pretax net working capital adjustment, for which there was no related tax benefit, and a $1 million tax adjustment related to the tax basis of Miltec both negatively impacting net income. The effect of these 2 nonrecurring items was $2.2 million after tax or $0.20 per diluted share. 
Aside from these items, the change in net income year-over-year reflects 2 charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, a $57.2 million cash, noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge within our Structural Systems segment; and $22.9 million noncash pretax impairment charge related to an indefinite live tradename within our Electronic Systems segment, partially offset by a higher tax provision this year. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $142.5 million compared to $156.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline year-over-year primarily reflects $17.5 million of lower revenue within the company's industrial end markets are due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility in January of '16, the closure of our Houston operation in December 2015. We also saw a $4.5 million of lower revenue within the company's military and space markets mainly due to the divestiture of our Miltec business last March, but we posted $7.8 million higher revenue within our Commercial Aerospace markets reflecting new awards and increased content. 
Ducommun's backlog improved to some $600 million at year-end, the highest levels since 2012 excluding divested operation and a rise of nearly $34 million from Q3's $566 million. This was a again driven by an increase in our commercial aerospace business, once more illustrating our strong position in an expanding market. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.5% in the fourth quarter versus 14.6% in last year's comparable period. The higher gross margin was primarily due to improved product mix, the company's ongoing supply chain initiatives and improved overall operating performance. 
SG&A fell in Q4 to $18.8 million from $21.2 million in 2015. This reflects our divestitures and cost-cutting initiatives as well as a decrease in compensation and benefit cost. For 2017, we do expect SG&A to run slightly higher at closer to 14.5% of revenue, primarily the result of some nonrecurring executive transition costs. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $9 million or 6.3% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $88.6 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects the 2015 impact from the impairment charges I previously mentioned. Excluding these, the improvement in 2016 reflects higher overall operating performance. Interest expense decreased to $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $2.2 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt as a result of net voluntary principal prepayments on the company's credit facilities. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $3 million or 51.3% compared to a benefit of $25 million or 27.7% in the comparable period last year. The tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 was a result of the onetime nonrecurring items that I noted while discussing our net income, the $1.2 million pretax negative working capital adjustment reduced our pretax income but there was no corresponding tax benefit and the $1 million tax adjustment was related to a true-up in the tax basis on the Miltec divestiture, which is now finalized. Lastly, the higher year-over-year tax rate also reflects the 2015 impairment charges previously mentioned. Going forward, the tax rate for 2017 is expected to be approximately 30% to 31%. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $15.1 million or 10.6% of revenue compared to $11 million or 7.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2015. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $60.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus $61 million last year. The slight decline was primarily due to $2.9 million of lower military and space sales, reflecting program delays, budget changes that impact the deliveries of certain of our platforms. The reduce military revenue was often entirely offset by $2.8 million of higher commercial aerospace sales. Structural Systems operating income for the fourth quarter was $3.2 million or 5.2% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $56 million last year. The increase in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects 2015's $57.2 million goodwill impairment charges I previously mentioned. 
The fourth quarter of 2016 also included the impact of additional investment in new programs, which reduced margins when compared to the third quarter year-to-date figure of 7.2%. Note that due to the ramp-up of platforms and impact of related investments in 2017, we see operating margins for Structural Systems trending in the 5% to 8% range in the very near term. 
Turning to the Electronic System segment. Our Electronic System segment posted revenue of $81.7 million in the fourth quarter versus $95.6 million in the prior year period. These results reflect the $17.5 million decrease across our industrial end markets due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility and closure of our Houston operation as I previously mentioned. In addition, Electronic Systems saw a $1.5 million decline in military and space revenue, reflecting the divestiture of our Miltec operations. These negative factors were partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in commercial aerospace revenue, reflecting added content and with existing customers. 
Electronics Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $9.2 million or 11.3% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $27 million the prior period. The increase in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects 2015's $32.9 million impairment charges I mentioned, slightly offset by the impact of lower revenue in 2016 due to the divestitures and plant closures discussed. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the fourth quarter were $3.4 million or 2.4% of company revenue compared to $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue last year. The decrease in CG&A expenses was primarily due to lower professional fees of $1.7 million and lower compensation and benefit cost of $.5 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $15.8 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $11.6 million in 2015. For the full year, we generated $43.3 million in cash flow from operations compared to $30.5 million in the prior year period, which would exclude the use of $9.8 million for the redemption of the senior notes that were redeemed at year. 
We remain diligent in working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historical seasonal patterns. We also paid down an additional $10 million of debt this quarter, as Tony mentioned, and reduced our debt in total by $75 million in 2016. We expect to pay down approximately $25 million of debt during 2017 as we continued towards our goal of deleveraging to a target of 2.25x to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. 
Capital expenditures were $4.3 million in the quarter, and we expect CapEx to be approximately $22 million to $26 million for 2017 driven by the expansion of Parsons facility and continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year as Tony mentioned. 
In closing, the quarter played out much as we expected and benefited from the many steps taken in 2016 to streamline our operations and focus our core business. As Tony discussed, we expect our Q1 '17 revenue to follow historic seasonal patterns and then grow 2% to 3% sequentially each quarter throughout the year. With our strong cash flow and solid bottom line results, we'll continue to pay down debt as appropriate. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks.

We'll do things a little bit different today. I'll begin by providing an overview of recent accomplishments and our current market outlook, then I'm going to hand the call over to our new President and CEO, Steve Oswald, to say a few words. After which, Doug Groves will go over our financial results in detail. 
But first, let me say a few words about Steve. It gives me great pleasure to have Steve take the helm of Ducommun. His appointment follows a thorough search by our Board of Directors to find a dedicated, experienced executive to take the company to the next level in its growth trajectory. Steve has an excellent background in the industry, having previously served in leadership positions at organizations, including Capital Safety, United Technologies, Hoechst Celanese and GE. Since joining Ducommun, he's been diligently working to become familiar with our management team, business units and our unique manufacturing capabilities and applications. We're proud of all that we've accomplished this past year as we strengthened the balance sheet, streamlined our operations and improved our overall operating results. I believe that Steve will now bring a fresh perspective to running Ducommun with the passion, capability and experience needed to drive our long-term financial performance. He will continue our focus on growing the top line, expanding our customer base and leveraging our unique structural and electronics capabilities to enhance shareholder value. The Board and I are very confident in the future of Ducommun in Steve's hands as we turn to a new chapter in our history. I will be staying on as the Chairman to help ensure a smooth transition as Steve guides the company going forward.
Now turning to our recent results. Let me just say how pleased we are to report another quarter of strong performance. We've paid down an additional $10 million of our debt during the period, which means we eliminated a total of $75 million of indebtedness this year. These payments were driven by strong operating cash flow of $43.3 million and along with the proceeds from some appropriate divestitures that served to focus the company and improve our long-term margin profile. 
On that note, we again posted strong gross margins of 19.5% in the fourth quarter, at the same time, ended the year with a backlog of approximately $600 million, driven by a nice uptick in the commercial aerospace backlog, which now stands at $318 million.
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. I'll begin with our commercial aerospace business, certainly a highlight of our operations. As I mentioned, our backlog here again is at record levels and spans an array of exciting platforms, serving Boeing, Airbus and several other OEMs. Total commercial aerospace revenue in Q4 was approximately $65 million, and full revenue -- and the full year revenue was close to $264 million, up 6% from 2015. We continue to be pleased with our position on the Boeing 737 and the 737 MAX, the 777 and the 787 programs as well as the Airbus A320, A330 and the A350 platforms.
As you may have seen, we recently announced that the company has received a multiyear, multimillion-dollar contract from Airbus to produce additional titanium structures for engine support and engine frames on the A320neo. This award increased our content on the neo and illustrates the value-added structural solutions that leverage our titanium expertise, the key area of strategic focus for Ducommun. Our titanium sales are growing fast and are expected to represent almost 50% of our structures business in the not-too-distant future. We remain on track to expanding our Parsons, Kansas, facility to support our titanium operations and increase demand that we see in the quarters to come. In fact, we're developing over 25 new applications in 2017 in the titanium area alone and expect this to significantly influence our future growth trajectory as we continue to invest in titanium to support our customers' changing requirements on next-generation aircraft. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Fourth quarter revenue fell slightly to $65 million from our $69 million last year, reflecting our Miltec divestiture. But results were up sequentially from the third quarter's $54 million, and our backlog held steady at $257 million versus our $227 million at the end of 2015. Excluding the Miltec impact, Military and Defense sales actually rose slightly year-over-year, reflecting higher shipments on radar racks and other components on key platforms such as the F-18 and the F-15 programs. We continue to believe that the company is now operating at a baseline rate of approximately $60 million, plus or minus, per quarter for our military programs and foresee the possibility of higher defense spending under the new administration. It's too early to say how things will play out with the budget in Washington, but we are cautiously optimistic about revenue growth within this part of our business going forward. We anticipate higher shipments of radar racks for the F-15 and the F-18 in 2017, along with solid missile systems revenue. At the same time, we continue to target additional opportunities for innovative solutions as well as platform modifications and upgrades within the defense arena. 
Overall, we believe the [indiscernible] quarter illustrates the type of operating results we are targeting throughout 2017. However, as a reminder, our first quarter is usually our softest from the top line perspective due to the seasonality, and we expect Q1 for 2017 to be in line with the first quarter of 2016 after adjusting for the divestitures. 
Gross margins could be down slightly in the 18% range due to the number of new programs currently under development that are projected to come online in the second half.
Our improved balance sheet and our margin profile should drive solid earnings as our top line benefits from platform growth and new applications later this year. Given our position on a number of leading programs ramping up in 2017, most notably the 737 and the A320, and the prospect of slightly higher defense spending, we look forward to another year of strong performance and returns to our shareholders.
We did exactly what we said we would do in 2016, and we're pleased with how well the company is positioned as we begin 2017.
With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Steve Oswald, Ducommun's new President, Chief Executive Officer. Steve?"

It's been a busy, albeit short time, since joining the company. And I've been focused on meeting with operational management, traveling to the many sites, enjoying program rollout plans and gradually becoming familiar with every asset of the business. What I found was an organization of talented individuals who are dedicated, know the aerospace industry extremely well and are excited about the important role we play on a number of leading platforms. These people as well as the potential is why I joined Ducommun, and I will lay out more of my vision in the months to come for the company. 
As you know, a number of measures were already taken to reinvigorate and focus Ducommun before I arrived, and I want everyone to know we'll continue to follow a path that increases both top line growth and bottom line results. The fact that margins were solid, expenses were down and the balance sheet is strong will provide the flexibility and foundation for us to focus in on innovation, business development, and of course, having a world-class team on the field. 
As Doug will review in a moment, we posted strong margins and cash flow again this past quarter. And we believe the outlook for 2017 and beyond looks promising, given our large book of business and attractive applications on many leading aerospace platforms. It's certainly an exciting time to be joining the company. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. 
Doug?"
267761,420256887,1150772,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 06, 2017",2017-03-06,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day to everybody. We'll review the financial results in a little different order today by starting with net income since we had 2 nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter related to the finalization of our Miltec divestiture.",1348,"Thank you, Steve, and good day to everybody. We'll review the financial results in a little different order today by starting with net income since we had 2 nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter related to the finalization of our Miltec divestiture. 
Net income was $2.8 million or $0.25 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $65.2 million or $5.88 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. The fourth quarter of 2016 included a negative $1.2 million pretax net working capital adjustment, for which there was no related tax benefit, and a $1 million tax adjustment related to the tax basis of Miltec both negatively impacting net income. The effect of these 2 nonrecurring items was $2.2 million after tax or $0.20 per diluted share. 
Aside from these items, the change in net income year-over-year reflects 2 charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, a $57.2 million noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge within our Structural Systems segment and $32.9 million noncash pretax impairment charge related to an indefinite-lived trade name within our Electronic Systems segment, partially offset by a higher tax provision this year.
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $142.5 million compared to $156.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline year-over-year primarily reflects $17.5 million of lower revenue within the company's industrial end markets due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility in January of '16, the closure of our Houston operation in December 2015. We also saw $4.5 million of lower revenue within the company's military and space markets, mainly due to the divestiture of our Miltec business last March. But we posted $7.8 million higher revenue within our commercial aerospace markets, reflecting new awards and increased content. 
Ducommun's backlog improved to some $600 million at year-end, the highest level since 2012, excluding divested operation, and a rise of nearly $34 million from Q3's $566 million. This was again driven by an increase in our commercial aerospace business, once more illustrating our strong position in an expanding market. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.5% in the fourth quarter versus 14.6% in last year's comparable period. The higher gross margin was primarily due to improved product mix, the company's ongoing supply chain initiatives and improved overall operating performance. 
SG&A fell in Q4 to $18.8 million from $21.2 million in 2015. This reflects our divestitures and cost-cutting initiatives as well as a decrease in compensation and benefit costs. For 2017, we do expect SG&A to run slightly higher or closer to 14.5% of revenue, primarily the result of some nonrecurring executive transition costs. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $9 million or 6.3% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $88.6 million in the prior period. The increase in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects the 2015 impact from the impairment charges I previously mentioned. Excluding these, the improvement in 2016 reflects higher overall operating performance. 
Interest expense decreased to $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $2.2 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt as a result of net voluntary principal prepayments on the company's credit facilities. 
Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $3 million or 51.3% compared to a benefit of $25 million or 27.7% in the comparable period last year. The tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 was a result of the onetime nonrecurring items that I noted while discussing our net income. The $1.2 million pretax negative working capital adjustment reduced our pretax income, but there was no corresponding tax benefit. And the $1 million tax adjustment was related to a true-up in the tax basis on the Miltec divestiture, which is now finalized. Lastly, the higher year-over-year tax rate also reflects the 2015 impairment charges previously mentioned. Going forward, the tax rate for 2017 is expected to be approximately 30% to 31%. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $15.1 million or 10.6% of revenue compared to $11 million or 7.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2015. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $60.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus $61 million last year. The slight decline was primarily due to $2.9 million of lower military and space sales, reflecting program delays, budget changes that impacted deliveries on certain of our platforms. The reduced military revenue was almost entirely offset by $2.8 million of higher commercial aerospace sales. Structural Systems operating income for the fourth quarter was $3.2 million or 5.2% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $56 million last year. The increase in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects 2015's $57.2 million goodwill impairment charges I previously mentioned. The fourth quarter of 2016 also included the impact of additional investment in new programs, which reduced margins when compared to the third quarter year-to-date figure of 7.2%. Note that due to the ramp-up of platforms and impact of related investments in 2017, we see operating margins for Structural Systems trending in the 5% to 8% range in the very near term. 
Turning to the Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $81.7 million in the fourth quarter versus $95.6 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect the $17.5 million decrease across our industrial end markets due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility and closure of our Houston operation as I previously mentioned. In addition, Electronic Systems saw a $1.5 million decline in military and space revenue, reflecting the divestiture of our Miltec operations. These negative factors were partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in commercial aerospace revenue, reflecting added content with existing customers. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $9.2 million or 11.3% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $27 million in the prior period. The increase in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects 2015's $32.9 million impairment charges I previously mentioned, slightly offset by the impact of lower revenue in 2016 due to the divestitures and plant closures discussed. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the fourth quarter were $3.4 million or 2.4% of company revenue compared to $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue last year. The decrease in CG&A expenses was primarily due to lower professional fees of $1.7 million and lower compensation and benefit costs of $0.5 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $15.8 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $11.6 million in 2015. For the full year, we generated $43.3 million in cash flow from operations compared to $30.5 million in the prior-year period, which would exclude the use of $9.8 million for the redemption of the senior notes that were redeemed that year. We remain diligent in working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historical seasonal patterns. 
We also paid down an additional $10 million of debt this quarter, as Tony mentioned, and reduced our debt in total by $75 million in 2016. We expect to pay down approximately $25 million of debt during 2017 as we continued towards our goal of deleveraging to a target of 2.25 to 2.5x debt to EBITDA. 
Capital expenditures were $4.3 million in the quarter, and we expect CapEx to be approximately $22 million to $26 million for 2017, driven by the expansion of our Parsons facility and continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year as Tony mentioned. 
In closing, the quarter played out much as we expected and benefited from the many steps taken in 2016 to streamline our operations and focus our core business. As Tony discussed, we expect our Q1 '17 revenue to follow historic seasonal patterns and then grow 2% to 3% sequentially each quarter throughout the year. With our strong cash flow and solid bottom line results, we'll continue to pay down debt as appropriate. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

I'll begin by providing an overview of recent accomplishments and our current market outlook, then I'm going to hand the call over to our new President and CEO, Steve Oswald, to say a few words. After which, Doug Groves will go over our financial results in detail. 
But first, let me say a few words about Steve. It gives me great pleasure to have Steve take the helm of Ducommun. His appointment follows a thorough search by our Board of Directors to find a dedicated, experienced executive to take the company to the next level in its growth trajectory. Steve has an excellent background in the industry, having previously served in leadership positions at organizations, including Capital Safety, United Technologies, Hoechst Celanese and GE. Since joining Ducommun, he's been diligently working to become familiar with our management team, business units and our unique manufacturing capabilities and applications. We're proud of all that we've accomplished this past year as we strengthened the balance sheet, streamlined our operations and improved our overall operating results. I believe that Steve will now bring a fresh perspective to running Ducommun with the passion, capability and experience needed to drive our long-term financial performance. He will continue our focus on growing the top line, expanding our customer base and leveraging our unique structural and electronics capabilities to enhance shareholder value. The Board and I are very confident in the future of Ducommun in Steve's hands as we turn to a new chapter in our history. I will be staying on as the Chairman to help ensure a smooth transition as Steve guides the company going forward.
Now turning to our recent results. Let me just say how pleased we are to report another quarter of strong performance. We've paid down an additional $10 million of our debt during the period, which means we eliminated a total of $75 million of indebtedness this year. These payments were driven by strong operating cash flow of $43.3 million and along with the proceeds from some appropriate divestitures that served to focus the company and improve our long-term margin profile. 
On that note, we again posted strong gross margins of 19.5% in the fourth quarter, at the same time, ended the year with a backlog of approximately $600 million, driven by a nice uptick in the commercial aerospace backlog, which now stands at $318 million.
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. I'll begin with our commercial aerospace business, certainly a highlight of our operations. As I mentioned, our backlog here again is at record levels and spans an array of exciting platforms, serving Boeing, Airbus and several other OEMs. Total commercial aerospace revenue in Q4 was approximately $65 million, and full revenue -- and the full year revenue was close to $264 million, up 6% from 2015. We continue to be pleased with our position on the Boeing 737 and the 737 MAX, the 777 and the 787 programs as well as the Airbus A320, A330 and the A350 platforms.
As you may have seen, we recently announced that the company has received a multiyear, multimillion-dollar contract from Airbus to produce additional titanium structures for engine support and engine frames on the A320neo. This award increased our content on the neo and illustrates the value-added structural solutions that leverage our titanium expertise, the key area of strategic focus for Ducommun. Our titanium sales are growing fast and are expected to represent almost 50% of our structures business in the not-too-distant future. We remain on track to expanding our Parsons, Kansas, facility to support our titanium operations and increase demand that we see in the quarters to come. In fact, we're developing over 25 new applications in 2017 in the titanium area alone and expect this to significantly influence our future growth trajectory as we continue to invest in titanium to support our customers' changing requirements on next-generation aircraft. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Fourth quarter revenue fell slightly to $65 million from our $69 million last year, reflecting our Miltec divestiture. But results were up sequentially from the third quarter's $54 million, and our backlog held steady at $257 million versus our $227 million at the end of 2015. Excluding the Miltec impact, Military and Defense sales actually rose slightly year-over-year, reflecting higher shipments on radar racks and other components on key platforms such as the F-18 and the F-15 programs. We continue to believe that the company is now operating at a baseline rate of approximately $60 million, plus or minus, per quarter for our military programs and foresee the possibility of higher defense spending under the new administration. It's too early to say how things will play out with the budget in Washington, but we are cautiously optimistic about revenue growth within this part of our business going forward. We anticipate higher shipments of radar racks for the F-15 and the F-18 in 2017, along with solid missile systems revenue. At the same time, we continue to target additional opportunities for innovative solutions as well as platform modifications and upgrades within the defense arena. 
Overall, we believe the [indiscernible] quarter illustrates the type of operating results we are targeting throughout 2017. However, as a reminder, our first quarter is usually our softest from the top line perspective due to the seasonality, and we expect Q1 for 2017 to be in line with the first quarter of 2016 after adjusting for the divestitures. 
Gross margins could be down slightly in the 18% range due to the number of new programs currently under development that are projected to come online in the second half.
Our improved balance sheet and our margin profile should drive solid earnings as our top line benefits from platform growth and new applications later this year. Given our position on a number of leading programs ramping up in 2017, most notably the 737 and the A320, and the prospect of slightly higher defense spending, we look forward to another year of strong performance and returns to our shareholders.
We did exactly what we said we would do in 2016, and we're pleased with how well the company is positioned as we begin 2017.
With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Steve Oswald, Ducommun's new President, Chief Executive Officer. Steve?"

It's been a busy, albeit short time, since joining the company. And I've been focused on meeting with operational management, traveling to the many sites, reviewing program rollout plans and generally becoming familiar with every asset of the business. What I found was an organization of talented individuals who are dedicated, know the aerospace industry extremely well and are excited about the important role we play on a number of leading platforms. These people as well as the potential is why I joined Ducommun, and I will lay out more of my vision in the months to come for the company. 
As you know, a number of measures were already taken to reinvigorate and focus Ducommun before I arrived, and I want everyone to know we'll continue to follow a path that increases both top line growth and bottom line results. The fact that margins were solid, expenses are down and the balance sheet is strong will provide the flexibility and foundation for us to focus in on innovation, business development, and of course, having a world-class team on the field. 
As Doug will review in a moment, we posted strong margins and cash flow again this past quarter. And we believe the outlook for 2017 and beyond looks promising, given our large book of business and attractive applications on many leading aerospace platforms. It's certainly an exciting time to be joining the company. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. 
Doug?"
267761,420256887,1150805,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 06, 2017",2017-03-06,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day to everybody. We'll review the financial results in a little different order today by starting with net income since we had 2 nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter related to the finalization of our Miltec divestiture.",1349,"Thank you, Steve, and good day to everybody. We'll review the financial results in a little different order today by starting with net income since we had 2 nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter related to the finalization of our Miltec divestiture. 
Net income was $2.8 million or $0.25 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $65.2 million or $5.88 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. The fourth quarter of 2016 included a negative $1.2 million pretax net working capital adjustment, for which there was no related tax benefit, and a $1 million tax adjustment related to the tax basis of Miltec both negatively impacting net income. The effect of these 2 nonrecurring items was $2.2 million after tax or $0.20 per diluted share. 
Aside from these items, the change in net income year-over-year reflects 2 charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, a $57.2 million noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge within our Structural Systems segment and $32.9 million noncash pretax impairment charge related to an indefinite live trade name within our Electronic Systems segment, partially offset by a higher tax provision this year.
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $142.5 million compared to $156.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline year-over-year primarily reflects $17.5 million of lower revenue within the company's industrial end markets due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility in January of '16, the closure of our Houston operation in December 2015. We also saw $4.5 million of lower revenue within the company's military and space markets, mainly due to the divestiture of our Miltec business last March. But we posted $7.8 million higher revenue within our commercial aerospace markets, reflecting new awards and increased content. 
Ducommun's backlog improved to some $600 million at year-end, the highest level since 2012, excluding divested operation, and a rise of nearly $34 million from Q3's $566 million. This was again driven by an increase in our commercial aerospace business, once more illustrating our strong position in an expanding market. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.5% in the fourth quarter versus 14.6% in last year's comparable period. The higher gross margin was primarily due to improved product mix, the company's ongoing supply chain initiatives and improved overall operating performance. 
SG&A fell in Q4 to $18.8 million from $21.2 million in 2015. This reflects our divestitures and cost-cutting initiatives as well as a decrease in compensation and benefit costs. For 2017, we do expect SG&A to run slightly higher at closer to 14.5% of revenue, primarily the result of some nonrecurring executive transition costs. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $9 million or 6.3% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $88.6 million in the prior period. The increase in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects the 2015 impact from the impairment charges I previously mentioned. Excluding these, the improvement in 2016 reflects higher overall operating performance. 
Interest expense decreased to $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $2.2 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt as a result of net voluntary principal prepayments on the company's credit facilities. 
Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $3 million or 51.3% compared to a benefit of $25 million or 27.7% in the comparable period last year. The tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 was a result of the onetime nonrecurring items that I noted while discussing our net income. The $1.2 million pretax negative working capital adjustment reduced our pretax income, but there was no corresponding tax benefit. And the $1 million tax adjustment was related to a true-up in the tax basis on the Miltec divestiture, which is now finalized. Lastly, the higher year-over-year tax rate also reflects the 2015 impairment charges previously mentioned. Going forward, the tax rate for 2017 is expected to be approximately 30% to 31%. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $15.1 million or 10.6% of revenue compared to $11 million or 7.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2015. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $60.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus $61 million last year. The slight decline was primarily due to $2.9 million of lower military and space sales, reflecting program delays, budget changes that impacted deliveries on certain of our platforms. The reduced military revenue was almost entirely offset by $2.8 million of higher commercial aerospace sales. Structural Systems operating income for the fourth quarter was $3.2 million or 5.2% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $56 million last year. The increase in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects 2015's $57.2 million goodwill impairment charges I previously mentioned. The fourth quarter of 2016 also included the impact of additional investment in new programs, which reduced margins when compared to the third quarter year-to-date figure of 7.2%. Note that due to the ramp-up of platforms and impact of related investments in 2017, we see operating margins for Structural Systems trending in the 5% to 8% range in the very near term. 
Turning to the Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $81.7 million in the fourth quarter versus $95.6 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect the $17.5 million decrease across our industrial end markets due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility and closure of our Houston operation as I previously mentioned. In addition, Electronic Systems saw a $1.5 million decline in military and space revenue, reflecting the divestiture of our Miltec operations. These negative factors were partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in commercial aerospace revenue, reflecting added content with existing customers. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $9.2 million or 11.3% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $27 million in the prior period. The increase in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects 2015's $32.9 million impairment charges I previously mentioned, slightly offset by the impact of lower revenue in 2016 due to the divestitures and plant closures discussed. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the fourth quarter were $3.4 million or 2.4% of company revenue compared to $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue last year. The decrease in CG&A expenses was primarily due to lower professional fees of $1.7 million and lower compensation and benefit costs of $0.5 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $15.8 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $11.6 million in 2015. For the full year, we generated $43.3 million in cash flow from operations compared to $30.5 million in the prior-year period, which would exclude the use of $9.8 million for the redemption of the senior notes that were redeemed that year. We remain diligent in working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historical seasonal patterns. 
We also paid down an additional $10 million of debt this quarter, as Tony mentioned, and reduced our debt in total by $75 million in 2016. We expect to pay down approximately $25 million of debt during 2017 as we continued towards our goal of deleveraging to a target of 2.25 to 2.5x debt to EBITDA. 
Capital expenditures were $4.3 million in the quarter, and we expect CapEx to be approximately $22 million to $26 million for 2017, driven by the expansion of our Parsons facility and continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year as Tony mentioned. 
In closing, the quarter played out much as we expected and benefited from the many steps taken in 2016 to streamline our operations and focus our core business. As Tony discussed, we expect our Q1 '17 revenue to follow historic seasonal patterns and then grow 2% to 3% sequentially each quarter throughout the year. With our strong cash flow and solid bottom line results, we'll continue to pay down debt as appropriate. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

We'll do things a little bit different today. I'll begin by providing an overview of recent accomplishments and our current market outlook, then I'm going to hand the call over to our new President and CEO, Steve Oswald, to say a few words. After which, Doug Groves will go over our financial results in detail. 
But first, let me say a few words about Steve. It gives me great pleasure to have Steve take the helm of Ducommun. His appointment follows a thorough search by our Board of Directors to find a dedicated, experienced executive to take the company to the next level in its growth trajectory. Steve has an excellent background in the industry, having previously served in leadership positions at organizations, including Capital Safety, United Technologies, Hoechst Celanese and GE. Since joining Ducommun, he's been diligently working to become familiar with our management team, business units and our unique manufacturing capabilities and applications. We're proud of all that we've accomplished this past year as we strengthened the balance sheet, streamlined our operations and improved our overall operating results. I believe that Steve will now bring a fresh perspective to running Ducommun with the passion, capability and experience needed to drive our long-term financial performance. He will continue our focus on growing the top line, expanding our customer base and leveraging our unique structural and electronics capabilities to enhance shareholder value. The Board and I are very confident in the future of Ducommun in Steve's hands as we turn to a new chapter in our history. I will be staying on as the Chairman to help ensure a smooth transition as Steve guides the company going forward.
Now turning to our recent results. Let me just say how pleased we are to report another quarter of strong performance. We've paid down an additional $10 million of our debt during the period, which means we eliminated a total of $75 million of indebtedness this year. These payments were driven by strong operating cash flow of $43.3 million and along with the proceeds from some appropriate divestitures that served to focus the company and improve our long-term margin profile. 
On that note, we again posted strong gross margins of 19.5% in the fourth quarter, at the same time, ended the year with a backlog of approximately $600 million, driven by a nice uptick in the commercial aerospace backlog, which now stands at $318 million.
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. I'll begin with our commercial aerospace business, certainly a highlight of our operations. As I mentioned, our backlog here again is at record levels and spans an array of exciting platforms, serving Boeing, Airbus and several other OEMs. Total commercial aerospace revenue in Q4 was approximately $65 million, and full revenue -- and the full year revenue was close to $264 million, up 6% from 2015. We continue to be pleased with our position on the Boeing 737 and the 737 MAX, the 777 and the 787 programs as well as the Airbus A320, A330 and the A350 platforms.
As you may have seen, we recently announced that the company has received a multiyear, multimillion-dollar contract from Airbus to produce additional titanium structures for engine support and engine frames on the A320neo. This award increased our content on the neo and illustrates the value-added structural solutions that leverage our titanium expertise, the key area of strategic focus for Ducommun. Our titanium sales are growing fast and are expected to represent almost 50% of our structures business in the not-too-distant future. We remain on track to expanding our Parsons, Kansas, facility to support our titanium operations and increase demand that we see in the quarters to come. In fact, we're developing over 25 new applications in 2017 in the titanium area alone and expect this to significantly influence our future growth trajectory as we continue to invest in titanium to support our customers' changing requirements on next-generation aircraft. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Fourth quarter revenue fell slightly to $65 million from our $69 million last year, reflecting our Miltec divestiture. But results were up sequentially from the third quarter's $54 million, and our backlog held steady at $257 million versus our $227 million at the end of 2015. Excluding the Miltec impact, Military and Defense sales actually rose slightly year-over-year, reflecting higher shipments on radar racks and other components on key platforms such as the F-18 and the F-15 programs. We continue to believe that the company is now operating at a baseline rate of approximately $60 million, plus or minus, per quarter for our military programs and foresee the possibility of higher defense spending under the new administration. It's too early to say how things will play out with the budget in Washington, but we are cautiously optimistic about revenue growth within this part of our business going forward. We anticipate higher shipments of radar racks for the F-15 and the F-18 in 2017, along with solid missile systems revenue. At the same time, we continue to target additional opportunities for innovative solutions as well as platform modifications and upgrades within the defense arena. 
Overall, we believe the [indiscernible] quarter illustrates the type of operating results we are targeting throughout 2017. However, as a reminder, our first quarter is usually our softest from the top line perspective due to the seasonality, and we expect Q1 for 2017 to be in line with the first quarter of 2016 after adjusting for the divestitures. 
Gross margins could be down slightly in the 18% range due to the number of new programs currently under development that are projected to come online in the second half.
Our improved balance sheet and our margin profile should drive solid earnings as our top line benefits from platform growth and new applications later this year. Given our position on a number of leading programs ramping up in 2017, most notably the 737 and the A320, and the prospect of slightly higher defense spending, we look forward to another year of strong performance and returns to our shareholders.
We did exactly what we said we would do in 2016, and we're pleased with how well the company is positioned as we begin 2017.
With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Steve Oswald, Ducommun's new President, Chief Executive Officer. Steve?"

It's been a busy, albeit short time, since joining the company. And I've been focused on meeting with operational management, traveling to the many sites, reviewing program rollout plans and generally becoming familiar with every asset of the business. What I found was an organization of talented individuals who are dedicated, know the aerospace industry extremely well and are excited about the important role we play on a number of leading platforms. These people as well as the potential is why I joined Ducommun, and I will lay out more of my vision in the months to come for the company. 
As you know, a number of measures were already taken to reinvigorate and focus Ducommun before I arrived, and I want everyone to know we'll continue to follow a path that increases both top line growth and bottom line results. The fact that margins were solid, expenses are down and the balance sheet is strong will provide the flexibility and foundation for us to focus in on innovation, business development, and of course, having a world-class team on the field. 
As Doug will review in a moment, we posted strong margins and cash flow again this past quarter. And we believe the outlook for 2017 and beyond looks promising, given our large book of business and attractive applications on many leading aerospace platforms. It's certainly an exciting time to be joining the company. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. 
Doug?"
267761,420256887,1152019,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 06, 2017",2017-03-06,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day to everybody. We'll review the financial results in a little different order today by starting with net income since we had 2 nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter related to the finalization of our Miltec divestiture.",1349,"Thank you, Steve, and good day to everybody. We'll review the financial results in a little different order today by starting with net income since we had 2 nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter related to the finalization of our Miltec divestiture. 
Net income was $2.8 million or $0.25 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $65.2 million or $5.88 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. The fourth quarter of 2016 included a negative $1.2 million pretax net working capital adjustment, for which there was no related tax benefit, and a $1 million tax adjustment related to the tax basis of Miltec both negatively impacting net income. The effect of these 2 nonrecurring items was $2.2 million after tax or $0.20 per diluted share. 
Aside from these items, the change in net income year-over-year reflects 2 charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, a $57.2 million noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge within our Structural Systems segment and $32.9 million noncash pretax impairment charge related to an indefinite live trade name within our Electronic Systems segment, partially offset by a higher tax provision this year.
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $142.5 million compared to $156.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline year-over-year primarily reflects $17.5 million of lower revenue within the company's industrial end markets due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility in January of '16, the closure of our Houston operation in December 2015. We also saw $4.5 million of lower revenue within the company's military and space markets, mainly due to the divestiture of our Miltec business last March. But we posted $7.8 million higher revenue within our commercial aerospace markets, reflecting new awards and increased content. 
Ducommun's backlog improved to some $600 million at year-end, the highest level since 2012, excluding divested operation, and a rise of nearly $34 million from Q3's $566 million. This was again driven by an increase in our commercial aerospace business, once more illustrating our strong position in an expanding market. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.5% in the fourth quarter versus 14.6% in last year's comparable period. The higher gross margin was primarily due to improved product mix, the company's ongoing supply chain initiatives and improved overall operating performance. 
SG&A fell in Q4 to $18.8 million from $21.2 million in 2015. This reflects our divestitures and cost-cutting initiatives as well as a decrease in compensation and benefit costs. For 2017, we do expect SG&A to run slightly higher at closer to 14.5% of revenue, primarily the result of some nonrecurring executive transition costs. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $9 million or 6.3% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $88.6 million in the prior period. The increase in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects the 2015 impact from the impairment charges I previously mentioned. Excluding these, the improvement in 2016 reflects higher overall operating performance. 
Interest expense decreased to $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $2.2 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt as a result of net voluntary principal prepayments on the company's credit facilities. 
Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $3 million or 51.3% compared to a benefit of $25 million or 27.7% in the comparable period last year. The tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 was a result of the onetime nonrecurring items that I noted while discussing our net income. The $1.2 million pretax negative working capital adjustment reduced our pretax income, but there was no corresponding tax benefit. And the $1 million tax adjustment was related to a true-up in the tax basis on the Miltec divestiture, which is now finalized. Lastly, the higher year-over-year tax rate also reflects the 2015 impairment charges previously mentioned. Going forward, the tax rate for 2017 is expected to be approximately 30% to 31%. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $15.1 million or 10.6% of revenue compared to $11 million or 7.1% of revenue for the comparable period in 2015. 
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $60.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus $61 million last year. The slight decline was primarily due to $2.9 million of lower military and space sales, reflecting program delays, budget changes that impacted deliveries on certain of our platforms. The reduced military revenue was almost entirely offset by $2.8 million of higher commercial aerospace sales. Structural Systems operating income for the fourth quarter was $3.2 million or 5.2% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $56 million last year. The increase in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects 2015's $57.2 million goodwill impairment charges I previously mentioned. The fourth quarter of 2016 also included the impact of additional investment in new programs, which reduced margins when compared to the third quarter year-to-date figure of 7.2%. Note that due to the ramp-up of platforms and impact of related investments in 2017, we see operating margins for Structural Systems trending in the 5% to 8% range in the very near term. 
Turning to the Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $81.7 million in the fourth quarter versus $95.6 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect the $17.5 million decrease across our industrial end markets due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility and closure of our Houston operation as I previously mentioned. In addition, Electronic Systems saw a $1.5 million decline in military and space revenue, reflecting the divestiture of our Miltec operations. These negative factors were partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in commercial aerospace revenue, reflecting added content with existing customers. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the fourth quarter of $9.2 million or 11.3% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $27 million in the prior period. The increase in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects 2015's $32.9 million impairment charges I previously mentioned, slightly offset by the impact of lower revenue in 2016 due to the divestitures and plant closures discussed. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the fourth quarter were $3.4 million or 2.4% of company revenue compared to $5.6 million or 3.6% of revenue last year. The decrease in CG&A expenses was primarily due to lower professional fees of $1.7 million and lower compensation and benefit costs of $0.5 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $15.8 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $11.6 million in 2015. For the full year, we generated $43.3 million in cash flow from operations compared to $30.5 million in the prior-year period, which would exclude the use of $9.8 million for the redemption of the senior notes that were redeemed that year. We remain diligent in working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historical seasonal patterns. 
We also paid down an additional $10 million of debt this quarter, as Tony mentioned, and reduced our debt in total by $75 million in 2016. We expect to pay down approximately $25 million of debt during 2017 as we continued towards our goal of deleveraging to a target of 2.25 to 2.5x debt to EBITDA. 
Capital expenditures were $4.3 million in the quarter, and we expect CapEx to be approximately $22 million to $26 million for 2017, driven by the expansion of our Parsons facility and continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year as Tony mentioned. 
In closing, the quarter played out much as we expected and benefited from the many steps taken in 2016 to streamline our operations and focus our core business. As Tony discussed, we expect our Q1 '17 revenue to follow historic seasonal patterns and then grow 2% to 3% sequentially each quarter throughout the year. With our strong cash flow and solid bottom line results, we'll continue to pay down debt as appropriate. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

I'll begin by providing an overview of our performance, including some market color. Afterwards some Doug Groves will go over our financial results in detail. We posted revenue of $136 million for the quarter, up slightly year-over-year adjusted for the divestitures. Reflecting a nice rebound in our military business and stable shipments across our large commercial platforms. Even as some of the platform transitions take place. We also generated $13 million in cash flow from operations, which was the best Q1 performance over the last 10 years. And while double that in 2016. The company paid down an additional $5 million of debt in the quarter as well. And with a backlog of $581 million, I believe the company is positioned well for a solid performance this year. But before providing more color on our markets and platforms, let me just step back and talk about the past few months. 
Since joining the company in late January, that's a great deal of time reviewing all aspects of our operations, meeting staff, touring factories accessing financial performance and visiting with our customers. I believe Ducommun has a good portfolio of products and so the broader range of key, aerospace and defense platforms. But we also believe you have a potential to be in much better. Even as we've accomplished a good deal these past 12 months, resulting in a more focused organization and improved cost structure, I see room for higher operating performance including margin expansion going forward. And I like I'm assessing all areas of the organization, for new ways of streamline manufacturing, further increase margins and enhance return on capital. 
I've also hired some key talent to help us achieve our near-term goals, including [indiscernible] our executive as VP of strategy, acquisitions and integration. Previously a senior Director of strategy at United Technologies aerospace and I've known him nearly a decade in several capacities. 
He's a critical thinker and a seasoned executive who will help us develop of vision along myself and the rest of the team to run our business more effectively, as well as lead our acquisition process, as well as also important integration. Our 
priority for the second half of 2017 is initiative design of bolster, our long-term growth trajectory, while strengthening bottom line performance. The overall goal and my overall goal is to build a culture focused on value, driving excellence, cost performance, and most importantly, results. I'll have more to say on this in the coming quarters, as you craft the plan to leverage technology, its applications and its long-standing customer relationships to take advantage of the current attractive economic environment. 
Now let me provide some color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our commercial aerospace business, our overall sales were $60 million, down from roughly $66 million last year. This slight decline versus 2016 was primarily due to ongoing weakness within the regional and business jet markets. Our relatively small portion of operation and includes the wind out of one program particular, which had margins below our expectations. 
Our large commercial fixed line business was stable, reflecting the timing of shipments across the various platforms we serve. We saw strong delivery developing for the 737 and 787 platforms as well as some very nice growth on the Airbus 320 and Airbus 330 aircraft. We ended the quarter with the commercial aerospace backlog over of $310 million, which remains near record levels. And are pleased with the outlook for growth across our core Boeing and Airbus platforms as they transition in next generation aircraft this year. In addition, we remain on track with regards to expanding our portions facility to support our titanium operations and platform requirements. 
This is a major investment for Ducommun and drove our CapEx spending in Q1 to more than double that of last year. We're supporting and driving dozens of new applications this year, which will significantly impact our growth going forward. 
Turning to our military and space sector, we posted first quarter revenue of $63 million, up nearly $6 million from last year, though down slightly Q4 reflecting order timing. The fact that shipments improved year-over-year even net of the divestitures is a very good sign. And we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook going forward. Particularly given the potential for budgeting increases in Washington. We also saw a nice uptick this quarter and sales of radar racks for the F-15 and F-18, along with a rebound in Black Hawk shipments. In addition, while overall defense backlog fell to $244 million from $256 million at the end of Q4, we believe we'll continue to see military revenue around $60 million plus or minus going forward, with some upside potential under the current administration. 
We also believe there is a pent-up demand for many military programs as well as missile-defense programs. This will include general modifications and upgrades, which will potentially be the higher bookings in revenue as the year plays out. 
Overall, I believe the company is on solid financial footing for the rest of 2017, even as we look to bolster top line growth invest for the future and continue to deliver the balance sheet. Our structural and economic capabilities are already resulted into Ducommun being a trusted supplier on some of the worlds top OEM platforms, using our unique titanium composite technology as well as our electronic capabilities. But I believe we can further streamline our production capacity and improve our customer relationships and increase contents on these and other commercial and military aircraft. 
Myself and the whole team much remain and will significant -- similarly focused on being a trusted value-added provider of innovative applications for the end-use markets we serve. Finally, we're committed to driving excellence in all areas and everything we do here at Ducommun for the betterment of our customers employees, suppliers and shareholders. With that, I'll now have Doug to review our financial results in detail. Doug? Thank you."

Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $136.3 million compared to $142.1 million for the first quarter of 2016, adjusting for the divestitures and plant consolidations revenue rose 2% year-over-year. On an ad",1024,"Thank you, Steve. And good day to everyone. Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $136.3 million compared to $142.1 million for the first quarter of 2016, adjusting for the divestitures and plant consolidations revenue rose 2% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, there was a decline year-over-year of $6 million in lower revenue within the company's commercial aerospace markets, primarily due to the wind down of a regional jet program and the transition to new models across the larger airframe platform along with $5.8 million of lower revenue within our industrial markets, which was due to divestiture of our company's Pittsburgh facility in January of 2016, and closure of one of our Tulsa operations last June. The negative impact of such items was partially offset by $5.9 million of higher revenue within 2 comments military and space markets, reflecting stronger deliveries even with a negative impact of our Miltec divestiture your last March. Ducommun's backlog was approximately $581 million at the end of the first quarter, down slightly from year end, primarily reflecting the timing of certain commercial orders. The backlog remains on record levels, as Steve mentioned, and once again, underscores our strong position within the rather healthy aerospace market. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 18.3% in the first quarter versus 19% in last year's comparable period. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix and the continued ramping up production on certain commercial programs within the company's Structural Systems segment. 
SG&A was $20.8 million in the first quarter versus $22.7 million in 2016. This primarily reflects our divestitures as well as cost-cutting initiatives. The first quarter of 2017 also included approximately $1 million of nonrecurring executive transition cost. Operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $4.1 million or 3% of revenue versus $4.3 million, also 3% of revenue in the prior year period. Interest expense decreased to $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $2.4 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt as a result of net voluntary principal prepayments on the company's credit facilities. Net income was $2.1 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared to $13.6 million or $1.21 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016. 
The first quarter of 2016 did include an $18.8 million gain on divestitures, the net effect of which was $12.2 million after-tax or $1.08 per diluted share. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $0.4 million or 15.6% compared to 17 excuse me -- $7.2 million or 34.6%  in the comparable period last year, again reflecting the divestiture gains I just mentioned. The income tax rate for 2017 first quarter was reduced due to a higher than expected tax benefits related to share-based compensation. 
Going forward, the tax rate for 2017 is expected to be approximately 29% to 30%. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 was $11.7 million or 8.6% of revenue compared to 11.1% or 7.8% of revenue for the comparable period in 2016. Now let me return to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $57.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 versus $64 million last year. The decline was primarily due to $7.2 million of lower sales within our commercial aerospace markets, reflecting a wind down of our regional jet program in the ongoing transition of a large aircraft platform. 
This was partially offset by $28 million of higher revenue in our military and space end-use markets. 
Structural systems operating income for the first quarter was $2.6 million or 4.6% of revenue compared to $2.7 million or 4.3% of revenue last year. The first quarter of 2017 included the impact of additional investment we're making in new programs. As noted on last quarter's earnings call, we see operating margins for the structural systems trending in the 5% to 8% range near turn due to the ramp-up of platforms and impact of related investments in 2017. Turning to the Electronic Systems segment got. Our Electronic Systems Segment revenue posted revenue of $78.7 million in the first quarter versus $78.1 million in the prior year period. These results reflect $5.2 million of higher shipments within our military and space end-use markets, partially offset by the impact of divesting our Miltec operation in March 2016. We also saw $1.2 million off higher revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms, but a $5.8 million sales decline within the industrial arena. Again, due to the closure of one of our operations June 2016 and divestitures of our Pittsburgh facility in January 2016. Electronic system posted revenue income for the first quarter of $7.1 million or 9% of revenue, up from $6.4 million or 8.2% in the prior period.
Corporate general  and administrative expense for the first quarter was $5.6 million or -- 4.1% of company revenue compared to $4.8 million or 3.4% of revenue last year. 
The increase was primarily due to higher compensation benefit cost of $1.1 million, partially offset by lower professional fees. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $13.2 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $5.5 million in 2016 and we remain diligent in effective working capital management. We also paid down an additional debt this quarter, as Steve mentioned. And expect to pay down approximately  $25 million of debt during 2017 as we continue towards our goal of deleveraging to a target of 2.25x to 2.5x debt to EBITDA. 
Capital expenditures were $6.8 million in the quarter, and we expect CapEx to be approximately $22 million to $26 million for 2017, primarily due to the expansion of our Parsons facility and continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year. 
In closing, the quarter played out as expected and reflected the various dynamics of our end markets. We continue to expect the revenue will likely grow 2% to 3% sequentially for the next few quarters and with a strong for cash flow, we'll pay down more debt as appropriate. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

I'll begin by providing an overview of our performance, including some market color. Afterwards, I'm going to have Doug Groves go over our financial results in detail. 
We posted revenue of $136 million for the quarter, up slightly year-over-year adjusted for the divestitures. That's reflecting a nice rebound on our military business and stable shipments across our large commercial platforms even as some of the platform transitions take place. We also generated $13 million in cash flow from operations, which was the best Q1 performance over the best 10 -- over the last 10 years and more than double that of 2016. The company did pay down an additional $5 million of debt in the quarter as well. And with a backlog of $581 million, I believe the company is positioned well for a solid performance this year. 
But before providing more color on our markets and platforms, let me just step back and talk about the past few months. Since joining the company in late January, I spent a great deal of time reviewing all aspects of our operations, meeting staff, touring factories, assessing financial performance and visiting with our customers. I believe Ducommun has a good portfolio of products and serves a broad array of key aerospace and defense platforms. But I also believe we have a potential to be much better. Even as we've accomplished a good deal these past 12 months resulting in a more focused organization and improved cost structure, I see room for higher operating performance, including margin expansion going forward. And I like -- I'm assessing all areas of the organization for new ways to streamline manufacturing, further increase margins and enhance return on capital. 
I've also hired some key talent to help us achieve our near-term goals, including bringing on Suman Mookerji, a UTC executive, as VP of Strategy, Acquisitions and Integration. Suman was previously a senior Director of Strategy at United Technologies Aerospace, and I've known him nearly a decade in several capacities. He's a critical thinker and a seasoned executive, who will help us develop a vision, along with myself and the rest of the team, to run our business more effectively as well as lead our acquisition process as well as also the all-important integration. 
My priorities for the second half of 2017 is to execute on initiatives designed to bolster our long-term growth trajectory while strengthening bottom line performance. The overall goal, and my overall goal, is to build a culture focused on value, driving excellence, cost performance and most importantly, results. I'll have more to say on this in the coming quarters as we craft a plan to leverage Ducommun's technology, its applications and its long-standing customer relationships to take advantage of the current attractive economic environment. 
Now let me provide some color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our commercial aerospace business, our overall sales were $60 million, down from roughly $66 million last year. This slight decline versus 2016 was primarily due to ongoing weakness within the regional and business jet markets, a relatively small portion of operation, and includes the wind-down of one program in particular, which had margins below our expectations. 
Our large commercial fixed-line business was stable, reflecting the timing of shipments across the various platforms we serve. We saw strong deliveries to Boeing for the 737 and 787 platforms as well as some very nice growth on the Airbus 320 and Airbus 330 aircraft. We ended the quarter with a commercial aerospace backlog of $310 million, which remains near record levels, and are pleased with the outlook for growth across our core Boeing and Airbus platforms as they transition to next-generation aircraft this year. 
In addition, we remain on track with regards to expanding our Parsons, Canada facility to support our titanium operations and platform requirements. This is a major investment for Ducommun and drove our CapEx spending in Q1 to more than double that of last year. We're supporting and driving dozens of new applications this year, which will significantly impact our growth going forward. 
Turning to our military and space sector. We posted first quarter revenue of $63 million, up nearly $6 million from last year, though down slightly Q4, reflecting order timing. The fact that shipments improved year-over-year even net of the Miltec divestiture is a very good sign. I remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook going forward, particularly given the potential for budget increases in Washington. We also saw a nice uptick this quarter in sales of radar racks for the F-15 and F-18, along with a rebound in Black Hawk shipments. 
In addition, while overall defense backlog fell to $244 million from $256 million at the end of Q4, we believe we'll continue to see military revenue of around $60 million plus or minus going forward with some upside potential under the current administration. We also believe there is a pent-up demand for many military programs as well as missile defense programs. This would include general modifications and upgrades, which will potentially lead to higher bookings in revenue as the year plays out. 
Overall, I believe the company is on solid financial footing for the rest of 2017 even as we look to bolster top line growth, invest for the future and continue to delever the balance sheet. Our structural and economic capabilities have already resulted to Ducommun being a trusted supplier on some of the world's top OEM platforms using our unique titanium composite technology as well as our electronic capabilities. But I believe we can further streamline our production capacity and improve our customer relationships to increase content on these and other commercial and military aircraft. Myself and the whole team must remain, and will, significant -- singularly focused on being a trusted value-added provider of innovative applications for the end use markets we serve. 
Finally, we're committed to driving excellence in all areas and everything we do here at Ducommun for the betterment of our customers, employees, suppliers and shareholders. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug? Thank you."
267761,428560607,1191367,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day to everyone. Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $136.3 million compared to $142.1 million for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusting for the divestitures and plant consolidations, revenue rose 2% year-over-year. On an a",1024,"Thank you, Steve, and good day to everyone. Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $136.3 million compared to $142.1 million for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusting for the divestitures and plant consolidations, revenue rose 2% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, there was a decline year-over-year of $6 million in lower revenue within the company's commercial aerospace markets, primarily due to the wind-down of a regional jet program and the transition to new models across the large airframe platform, along with $5.8 million of lower revenue within our industrial markets, which was due to the divestiture of our -- the company's Pittsburgh facility in January of 2016 and closure of one of our Tulsa operations last June. The negative impact of such items was partially offset by $5.9 million of higher revenue within Ducommun's military and space markets, reflecting stronger deliveries even with the negative impact of our Miltec divestiture last March. 
Ducommun's backlog was approximately $581 million at the end of the first quarter, down slightly from year-end, primarily reflecting the timing of certain commercial orders. The backlog remains near record levels, as Steve mentioned, and once again, underscores our strong position within the rather healthy aerospace market. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 18.3% in the first quarter versus 19% in last year's comparable period. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix and the continued ramping of production on certain commercial programs within the company's Structural Systems segment. 
SG&A was $20.8 million in the first quarter versus $22.7 million in 2016. This primarily reflects our divestitures as well as cost-cutting initiatives. The first quarter of 2017 also included approximately $1 million of nonrecurring executive transition costs. Operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $4.1 million or 3% of revenue versus $4.3 million, also 3% of revenue in the prior year period. Interest expense decreased to $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $2.4 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt as a result of net voluntary principal prepayments on the company's credit facilities. Net income was $2.1 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared to $13.6 million or $1.21 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016. 
The first quarter of 2016 did include an $18.8 million gain on divestitures, the net effect of which was $12.2 million after-tax or $1.08 per diluted share. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $0.4 million or 15.6% compared to 17 -- excuse me, $7.2 million or 34.6% in the comparable period last year, again reflecting the divestiture gains I just mentioned. The income tax rate for 2017 first quarter was reduced due to higher-than-expected tax benefits related to share-based compensation. 
Going forward, the tax rate for 2017 is expected to be approximately 29% to 30%. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 was $11.7 million or 8.6% of revenue compared to 11.1% or 7.8% of revenue for the comparable period in 2016. 
Now let me return to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $57.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 versus $64 million last year. The decline was primarily due to $7.2 million of lower sales within our commercial aerospace markets, reflecting a wind-down of a regional jet program and the ongoing transition of a large aircraft platform. This was partially offset by $0.8 million of higher revenue in our military and space end use markets. 
Structural Systems operating income for the first quarter was $2.6 million or 4.6% of revenue compared to $2.7 million or 4.3% of revenue last year. The first quarter of 2017 included the impact of additional investment we're making in new programs. As noted on last quarter's earnings call, we see operating margins for the Structural Systems trending in the 5% to 8% range near term due to the ramp-up of platforms and impact of related investments in 2017. 
Turning to the Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment revenue posted revenue of $78.7 million in the first quarter versus $78.1 million in the prior year period. These results reflect $5.2 million of higher shipments within our military and space end use markets, partially offset by the impact of divesting our Miltec operation in March 2016. We also saw $1.2 million of higher revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms but a $5.8 million sales decline within the industrial arena, again, due to the closure of one of our Tulsa operations in June 2016 and divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility in January 2016. Electronic System posted revenue income for the first quarter of $7.1 million or 9% of revenue, up from $6.4 million or 8.2% in the prior period.
Corporate, general and administrative expense for the first quarter was $5.6 million or 4% -- 4.1% of company revenue compared to $4.8 million or 3.4% of revenue last year. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation benefit cost of $1.1 million, partially offset by lower professional fees. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $13.2 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $5.5 million in 2016, and we remain diligent in effective working capital management. We also paid down an additional $5 million of debt this quarter, as Steve mentioned, and expect to pay down approximately $25 million of debt during 2017 as we continue towards our goal of deleveraging to a target of 2.25x to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. 
Capital expenditures were $6.8 million in the quarter, and we expect CapEx to be approximately $22 million to $26 million for 2017, primarily due to the expansion of our Parsons facility and continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year. 
In closing, the quarter played out as expected and reflected the various dynamics of our end markets. We continue to expect that revenue will likely grow 2% to 3% sequentially for the next few quarters. And with our strong for cash flow, we'll pay down more debt as appropriate. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

Particular risks facing Ducommun include, among others, the cyclicality of our end use markets, the level of U.S. government defense spending, legal and regulatory risks, management changes, the cost of expansion and acquisitions and competition. These risks and others are described in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, and our forward-looking statements are subject to those risks. Statements made during this call are only as of the time made, and we do not intend to update any statements made in this presentation except if and as required by regulatory authorities. 
This call includes non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures referenced on this call to the most similar GAAP measures. 
We filed our Form 10-Q with the SEC earlier today discussing our results for the quarter ended April 1, 2017. You will find a link to the company's SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, on the company's website under the Investor Relations tab. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Oswald for a review of the operating results. Steve?"
267761,428560607,1191734,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2017 First Quarter Conference Call. I'll begin by providing an overview of our performance, including some market color. Afterwards, I'm going to have Doug Groves go over our financial r",1033,"Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2017 First Quarter Conference Call. I'll begin by providing an overview of our performance, including some market color. Afterwards, I'm going to have Doug Groves go over our financial results in detail. 
We posted revenue of $136 million for the quarter, up slightly year-over-year adjusted for the divestitures. That's reflecting a nice rebound on our military business and stable shipments across our large commercial platforms even as some of the platform transitions take place. We also generated $13 million in cash flow from operations, which was the best Q1 performance over the best 10 -- over the last 10 years and more than double that of 2016. The company did pay down an additional $5 million of debt in the quarter as well. And with a backlog of $581 million, I believe the company is positioned well for a solid performance this year. 
But before providing more color on our markets and platforms, let me just step back and talk about the past few months. Since joining the company in late January, I spent a great deal of time reviewing all aspects of our operations, meeting staff, touring factories, assessing financial performance and visiting with our customers. I believe Ducommun has a good portfolio of products and serves a broad array of key aerospace and defense platforms. But I also believe we have a potential to be much better. Even as we've accomplished a good deal these past 12 months resulting in a more focused organization and improved cost structure. I see room for higher operating performance, including margin expansion going forward. And I like -- I'm assessing all areas of the organization for new ways to streamline manufacturing, further increase margins and enhance return on capital. 
I've also hired some key talent to help us achieve our near-term goals, including bringing on Suman Mookerji, a UTC executive, as VP of Strategy, Acquisitions and Integration. Suman was previously a senior Director of Strategy at United Technologies Aerospace, and I've known him nearly a decade in several capacities. He's a critical thinker and a seasoned executive, who will help us develop a vision, along with myself and the rest of the team, to run our business more effectively as well as lead our acquisition process as well as also the all-important integration. 
My priorities for the second half of 2017 is to execute on initiatives designed to bolster our long-term growth trajectory while strengthening bottom line performance. The overall goal, and my overall goal, is to build a culture focused on value, driving excellence, cost performance and most importantly, results. I'll have more to say on this in the coming quarters as we craft a plan to leverage Ducommun's technology, its applications and its long-standing customer relationships to take advantage of the current attractive economic environment. 
Now let me provide some color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our commercial aerospace business, our overall sales were $60 million, down from roughly $66 million last year. This slight decline versus 2016 was primarily due to ongoing weakness within the regional and business jet markets, a relatively small portion of operation, and includes the wind-down of one program in particular, which had margins below our expectations. 
Our large commercial fixed-line business was stable, reflecting the timing of shipments across the various platforms we serve. We saw strong deliveries to Boeing for the 737 and 787 platforms as well as some very nice growth on the Airbus 320 and Airbus 330 aircraft. We ended the quarter with a commercial aerospace backlog of $310 million, which remains near record levels, and are pleased with the outlook for growth across our core Boeing and Airbus platforms as they transition to next-generation aircraft this year. 
In addition, we remain on track with regards to expanding our Parsons, Canada facility to support our titanium operations and platform requirements. This is a major investment for Ducommun and drove our CapEx spending in Q1 to more than double that of last year. We're supporting and driving dozens of new applications this year, which will significantly impact our growth going forward. 
Turning to our military and space sector. We posted first quarter revenue of $63 million, up nearly $6 million from last year, though down slightly from Q4, reflecting order timing. The fact that shipments improved year-over-year even net of the Miltec divestiture is a very good sign. I remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook going forward, particularly given the potential for budget increases in Washington. We also saw a nice uptick this quarter in sales of radar racks for the F-15 and F-18, along with a rebound in Black Hawk shipments. 
In addition, while overall defense backlog fell to $244 million from $256 million at the end of Q4, we believe we'll continue to see military revenue of around $60 million plus or minus going forward with some upside potential under the current administration. We also believe there is a pent-up demand for many military programs as well as missile defense programs. This would include general modifications and upgrades, which will potentially lead to higher bookings in revenue as the year plays out. 
Overall, I believe the company is on solid financial footing for the rest of 2017 even as we look to bolster top line growth, invest for the future and continue to delever the balance sheet. Our structural and economic capabilities have already resulted to Ducommun being a trusted supplier on some of the world's top OEM platforms using our unique titanium composite technology as well as our electronic capabilities. But I believe we can further streamline our production capacity and improve our customer relationships to increase content on these and other commercial and military aircraft. Myself and the whole team must remain, and will, significant -- singularly focused on being a trusted value-added provider of innovative applications for the end use markets we serve. 
Finally, we're committed to driving excellence in all areas and everything we do here at Ducommun for the betterment of our customers, employees, suppliers and shareholders. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug? Thank you."
267761,428560607,1191734,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day to everyone. Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $136.3 million compared to $142.1 million for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusting for the divestitures and plant consolidations, revenue rose 2% year-over-year. On an a",1024,"Thank you, Steve, and good day to everyone. Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $136.3 million compared to $142.1 million for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusting for the divestitures and plant consolidations, revenue rose 2% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, there was a decline year-over-year of $6 million in lower revenue within the company's commercial aerospace markets, primarily due to the wind-down of a regional jet program and the transition to new models across the large airframe platform, along with $5.8 million of lower revenue within our industrial markets, which was due to the divestiture of our -- the company's Pittsburgh facility in January of 2016 and closure of one of our Tulsa operations last June. The negative impact of such items was partially offset by $5.9 million of higher revenue within Ducommun's military and space markets, reflecting stronger deliveries even with the negative impact of our Miltec divestiture last March. 
Ducommun's backlog was approximately $581 million at the end of the first quarter, down slightly from year-end, primarily reflecting the timing of certain commercial orders. The backlog remains near record levels, as Steve mentioned, and once again, underscores our strong position within a rather healthy aerospace market. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 18.3% in the first quarter versus 19% in last year's comparable period. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix and the continued ramping of production on certain commercial programs within the company's Structural Systems segment. 
SG&A was $20.8 million in the first quarter versus $22.7 million in 2016. This primarily reflects our divestitures as well as cost-cutting initiatives. The first quarter of 2017 also included approximately $1 million of nonrecurring executive transition costs. Operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $4.1 million or 3% of revenue versus $4.3 million, also 3% of revenue in the prior year period. Interest expense decreased to $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $2.4 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt as a result of net voluntary principal prepayments on the company's credit facilities. Net income was $2.1 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared to $13.6 million or $1.21 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016. 
The first quarter of 2016 did include an $18.8 million gain on divestitures, the net effect of which was $12.2 million after-tax or $1.08 per diluted share. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $0.4 million or 15.6% compared to 17 -- excuse me, $7.2 million or 34.6% in the comparable period last year, again reflecting the divestiture gains I just mentioned. The income tax rate for 2017 first quarter was reduced due to higher-than-expected tax benefits related to share-based compensation. 
Going forward, the tax rate for 2017 is expected to be approximately 29% to 30%. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 was $11.7 million or 8.6% of revenue compared to 11.1% or 7.8% of revenue for the comparable period in 2016. 
Now let me return to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $57.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 versus $64 million last year. The decline was primarily due to $7.2 million of lower sales within our commercial aerospace markets, reflecting a wind-down of a regional jet program and the ongoing transition of a large aircraft platform. This was partially offset by $0.8 million of higher revenue in our military and space end use markets. 
Structural Systems operating income for the first quarter was $2.6 million or 4.6% of revenue compared to $2.7 million or 4.3% of revenue last year. The first quarter of 2017 included the impact of additional investment we're making in new programs. As noted on last quarter's earnings call, we see operating margins for the Structural Systems trending in the 5% to 8% range near term due to the ramp-up of platforms and impact of related investments in 2017. 
Turning to the Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment revenue posted revenue of $78.7 million in the first quarter versus $78.1 million in the prior year period. These results reflect $5.2 million of higher shipments within our military and space end use markets, partially offset by the impact of divesting our Miltec operation in March 2016. We also saw $1.2 million of higher revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms but a $5.8 million sales decline within the industrial arena, again, due to the closure of one of our Tulsa operations in June 2016 and divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility in January 2016. Electronic System posted revenue income for the first quarter of $7.1 million or 9% of revenue, up from $6.4 million or 8.2% in the prior period.
Corporate, general and administrative expense for the first quarter was $5.6 million or 4% -- 4.1% of company revenue compared to $4.8 million or 3.4% of revenue last year. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation benefit cost of $1.1 million, partially offset by lower professional fees. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $13.2 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $5.5 million in 2016, and we remain diligent in effective working capital management. We also paid down an additional $5 million of debt this quarter, as Steve mentioned, and expect to pay down approximately $25 million of debt during 2017 as we continue towards our goal of deleveraging to a target of 2.25x to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. 
Capital expenditures were $6.8 million in the quarter, and we expect CapEx to be approximately $22 million to $26 million for 2017, primarily due to the expansion of our Parsons facility and continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year. 
In closing, the quarter played out as expected and reflected the various dynamics of our end markets. We continue to expect that revenue will likely grow 2% to 3% sequentially for the next few quarters. And with our strong for cash flow, we'll pay down more debt as appropriate. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

267761,428560607,1195623,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2017 First Quarter Conference Call. I'll begin by providing an overview of our performance, including some market color.

I'll begin by providing an overview of our performance, including some market color. Afterwards, I'm going to have Doug Groves go over our financial results in detail. 
We posted revenue of $136 million for the quarter, up slightly year-over-year adjusted for the divestitures. That's reflecting a nice rebound on our military business and stable shipments across our large commercial platforms even as some of the platform transitions take place. We also generated $13 million in cash flow from operations, which was the best Q1 performance over the best 10 -- over the last 10 years and more than double that of 2016. The company did pay down an additional $5 million of debt in the quarter as well. And with a backlog of $581 million, I believe the company is positioned well for a solid performance this year. 
But before providing more color on our markets and platforms, let me just step back and talk about the past few months. Since joining the company in late January, I spent a great deal of time reviewing all aspects of our operations, meeting staff, touring factories, assessing financial performance and visiting with our customers. I believe Ducommun has a good portfolio of products and serves a broad array of key aerospace and defense platforms. But I also believe we have a potential to be much better. Even as we've accomplished a good deal these past 12 months resulting in a more focused organization and improved cost structure. I see room for higher operating performance, including margin expansion going forward. And I like -- I'm assessing all areas of the organization for new ways to streamline manufacturing, further increase margins and enhance return on capital. 
I've also hired some key talent to help us achieve our near-term goals, including bringing on Suman Mookerji, a UTC executive, as VP of Strategy, Acquisitions and Integration. Suman was previously a senior Director of Strategy at United Technologies Aerospace, and I've known him nearly a decade in several capacities. He's a critical thinker and a seasoned executive, who will help us develop a vision, along with myself and the rest of the team, to run our business more effectively as well as lead our acquisition process as well as also the all-important integration. 
My priorities for the second half of 2017 is to execute on initiatives designed to bolster our long-term growth trajectory while strengthening bottom line performance. The overall goal, and my overall goal, is to build a culture focused on value, driving excellence, cost performance and most importantly, results. I'll have more to say on this in the coming quarters as we craft a plan to leverage Ducommun's technology, its applications and its long-standing customer relationships to take advantage of the current attractive economic environment. 
Now let me provide some color on our end markets, products and programs. Beginning with our commercial aerospace business, our overall sales were $60 million, down from roughly $66 million last year. This slight decline versus 2016 was primarily due to ongoing weakness within the regional and business jet markets, a relatively small portion of operation, and includes the wind-down of one program in particular, which had margins below our expectations. 
Our large commercial fixed-line business was stable, reflecting the timing of shipments across the various platforms we serve. We saw strong deliveries to Boeing for the 737 and 787 platforms as well as some very nice growth on the Airbus 320 and Airbus 330 aircraft. We ended the quarter with a commercial aerospace backlog of $310 million, which remains near record levels, and are pleased with the outlook for growth across our core Boeing and Airbus platforms as they transition to next-generation aircraft this year. 
In addition, we remain on track with regards to expanding our Parsons, Canada facility to support our titanium operations and platform requirements. This is a major investment for Ducommun and drove our CapEx spending in Q1 to more than double that of last year. We're supporting and driving dozens of new applications this year, which will significantly impact our growth going forward. 
Turning to our military and space sector. We posted first quarter revenue of $63 million, up nearly $6 million from last year, though down slightly from Q4, reflecting order timing. The fact that shipments improved year-over-year even net of the Miltec divestiture is a very good sign. I remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook going forward, particularly given the potential for budget increases in Washington. We also saw a nice uptick this quarter in sales of radar racks for the F-15 and F-18, along with a rebound in Black Hawk shipments. 
In addition, while overall defense backlog fell to $244 million from $256 million at the end of Q4, we believe we'll continue to see military revenue of around $60 million plus or minus going forward with some upside potential under the current administration. We also believe there is a pent-up demand for many military programs as well as missile defense programs. This would include general modifications and upgrades, which will potentially lead to higher bookings in revenue as the year plays out. 
Overall, I believe the company is on solid financial footing for the rest of 2017 even as we look to bolster top line growth, invest for the future and continue to delever the balance sheet. Our structural and economic capabilities have already resulted to Ducommun being a trusted supplier on some of the world's top OEM platforms using our unique titanium composite technology as well as our electronic capabilities. But I believe we can further streamline our production capacity and improve our customer relationships to increase content on these and other commercial and military aircraft. Myself and the whole team must remain, and will, significant -- singularly focused on being a trusted value-added provider of innovative applications for the end use markets we serve. 
Finally, we're committed to driving excellence in all areas and everything we do here at Ducommun for the betterment of our customers, employees, suppliers and shareholders. 
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug? Thank you."
267761,428560607,1195623,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day to everyone. Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $136.3 million compared to $142.1 million for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusting for the divestitures and plant consolidations, revenue rose 2% year-over-year. On an a",1024,"Thank you, Steve, and good day to everyone. Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $136.3 million compared to $142.1 million for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusting for the divestitures and plant consolidations, revenue rose 2% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, there was a decline year-over-year of $6 million in lower revenue within the company's commercial aerospace markets, primarily due to the wind-down of a regional jet program and the transition to new models across the large airframe platform, along with $5.8 million of lower revenue within our industrial markets, which was due to the divestiture of our -- the company's Pittsburgh facility in January of 2016 and closure of one of our Tulsa operations last June. The negative impact of such items was partially offset by $5.9 million of higher revenue within Ducommun's military and space markets, reflecting stronger deliveries even with the negative impact of our Miltec divestiture last March. 
Ducommun's backlog was approximately $581 million at the end of the first quarter, down slightly from year-end, primarily reflecting the timing of certain commercial orders. The backlog remains near record levels, as Steve mentioned, and once again, underscores our strong position within a rather healthy aerospace market. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 18.3% in the first quarter versus 19% in last year's comparable period. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix and the continued ramping of production on certain commercial programs within the company's Structural Systems segment. 
SG&A was $20.8 million in the first quarter versus $22.7 million in 2016. This primarily reflects our divestitures as well as cost-cutting initiatives. The first quarter of 2017 also included approximately $1 million of nonrecurring executive transition costs. Operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $4.1 million or 3% of revenue versus $4.3 million, also 3% of revenue in the prior year period. Interest expense decreased to $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $2.4 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt as a result of net voluntary principal prepayments on the company's credit facilities. Net income was $2.1 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared to $13.6 million or $1.21 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016. 
The first quarter of 2016 did include an $18.8 million gain on divestitures, the net effect of which was $12.2 million after-tax or $1.08 per diluted share. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $0.4 million or 15.6% compared to 17 -- excuse me, $7.2 million or 34.6% in the comparable period last year, again reflecting the divestiture gains I just mentioned. The income tax rate for 2017 first quarter was reduced due to higher-than-expected tax benefits related to share-based compensation. 
Going forward, the tax rate for 2017 is expected to be approximately 29% to 30%. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 was $11.7 million or 8.6% of revenue compared to 11.1% or 7.8% of revenue for the comparable period in 2016. 
Now let me return to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $57.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 versus $64 million last year. The decline was primarily due to $7.2 million of lower sales within our commercial aerospace markets, reflecting a wind-down of a regional jet program and the ongoing transition of a large aircraft platform. This was partially offset by $0.8 million of higher revenue in our military and space end use markets. 
Structural Systems operating income for the first quarter was $2.6 million or 4.6% of revenue compared to $2.7 million or 4.3% of revenue last year. The first quarter of 2017 included the impact of additional investment we're making in new programs. As noted on last quarter's earnings call, we see operating margins for the Structural Systems trending in the 5% to 8% range near term due to the ramp-up of platforms and impact of related investments in 2017. 
Turning to the Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment revenue posted revenue of $78.7 million in the first quarter versus $78.1 million in the prior year period. These results reflect $5.2 million of higher shipments within our military and space end use markets, partially offset by the impact of divesting our Miltec operation in March 2016. We also saw $1.2 million of higher revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms but a $5.8 million sales decline within the industrial arena, again, due to the closure of one of our Tulsa operations in June 2016 and divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility in January 2016. Electronic System posted revenue income for the first quarter of $7.1 million or 9% of revenue, up from $6.4 million or 8.2% in the prior period.
Corporate, general and administrative expense for the first quarter was $5.6 million or 4% -- 4.1% of company revenue compared to $4.8 million or 3.4% of revenue last year. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation benefit cost of $1.1 million, partially offset by lower professional fees. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $13.2 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $5.5 million in 2016, and we remain diligent in effective working capital management. We also paid down an additional $5 million of debt this quarter, as Steve mentioned, and expect to pay down approximately $25 million of debt during 2017 as we continue towards our goal of deleveraging to a target of 2.25x to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. 
Capital expenditures were $6.8 million in the quarter, and we expect CapEx to be approximately $22 million to $26 million for 2017, primarily due to the expansion of our Parsons facility and continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year. 
In closing, the quarter played out as expected and reflected the various dynamics of our end markets. We continue to expect that revenue will likely grow 2% to 3% sequentially for the next few quarters. And with our strong for cash flow, we'll pay down more debt as appropriate. 
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

I'll begin by providing an overview of our performance, including some market color. Afterwards, then Doug Groves will go over a financial results in detail. I'm happy report we posted revenue of $141 million this quarter, an increase both sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting $18 million of higher military defense shipments offsetting lower revenue and some of our commercial aerospace platforms. The weakest on the commercial side was primarily due to a aligning down of our regional jet program, which had unattractive margins, and some continued softness in the business jet market, as was discussed last quarter. But as a reminder, the regional business jet markets are a mighty contributor to Ducommun's growth strategy, and we had in the quarter with our highest commercial aerospace backlog ever, some $337 million. We've set the stage for revenue acceleration in the quarter, to follow as we move into the second half of 2017. I also want to share with you some excellent news that some total backlog at the end of Q2 stood at $611 million, and that's up $30 million for from last quarter. We generated $3 million in cash from operations this quarter, which equates to $16.3 million year-to-date, but did not pay down any additional debt to superior as we normally do for very good reasons. As we move forward in time, we're going to deploy capital and future growth. We invested $9.5 million in the businesses period, roughly twice our normal amount from CapEx. This is largely due to our next generation titanium operations and Parsons Cannons. We're we have been working diligently preparing for new production for the Boeing 737 Max, Airbus A320 neo, Airbus A330 and A350, along with Coldstream, G500 and G600 series. Ducommun will be manufacturing titanium engine frames, exit repowered ask, cooler docs, and exhaust pairing assemblies as well as other titanium modules and components at the state-of-the-art facility. Facility expansion is on track, and we have our top operations leader, fully engaged as we work to fully support our customer requirements in the months and the quarters to come. That said, we will continue to manage cash very aggressively. We will pay down as much debt this year as possible to reduce the company's leverage and strengthened our balance sheet. In regards to her structures business, let me also add that I'm disappointed with the operating margins within this business. And the goal team is to focus on ways to streamline the company and the operations further reduce costs with the goal being greater efficiency, margin expansion and higher asset utilization. Due to that challenge and with my time here in the company. In May, I promoted Jerry Redondo to Senior Vice President of Operations and Head of our Structure's business. Jerry also have received the office of operational excellence, where we drive continues improvement, product integrity, program execution, engineering and supply chain management. To accelerate growth and maximize the value of our products and services. Jerry is now with Ducommun, and as Vice President of operational excellence since 2013. And previously worked at Aerospace and Parker Huntington. I've worked with Jerry since beginning of my role of Ducommun in January and I trust him to deliver on major improvements in 2017 and beyond. He knows as do I that even while investing in critical new programs and platforms, like the ones I just mentioned is necessary, we need to get our structured business back to operating margins in the mid-to-high single digits. We will also be highlighting additional plans as the year progresses to address this efficiency in our operations, so stay tuned. The finished my first orderly in the company, let me add that are occurring several factors that started to come together this year.
Our sequentially better financial performance, robust backlog, and most important, higher level of customer responsiveness, all illustrates progress in serving both of our clients and our shareholders. 
  We have a very good reception of the Paris Airshow this summer, and OEMs are gaining more confidence in Ducommun. And our technology, our capabilities and our ability to achieve a high level of success, we increased our present at the show beside several NDA's. We came away with the knowledge that many customers do not fully yet understand the full capabilities of Ducommun. So we had no follow-up meetings. Overall, this time, very well spent, and encouraging results. Some I'm really pleased that how far we come critical near-term priorities, as myself and the team lay the groundwork from increasing margins and taking the company to the next level. As much more to come in our transformation. Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets products and programs. The aerospace business, overall sales were $56 million this quarter, down from roughly $64 million last year. I'd mention this decline was primarily due to weakness with the regional and business jet markets wind down of one particular program. But our large commercial business was stable and growing. But strong deliveries to Boeing for the 737 platform as well as to Airbus for the A320 and A330 aircraft. And we should see even higher overall commercial deliveries in the second half of the year. As I previously mentioned, we ended the quarter with a record commercial aerospace backlog of $337 million, and I'm excited about the growth prospects we see for 2018 and beyond. Particularly after the expansion of our Parsons titanium operation, it's completed next spring. 
  Turning to our military space activity, be posted the second quarter revenue of $70 million versus $52 million last year. Strong showing driven by greater and the F-15 and F-18 along with significant growth across various helicopter platforms, including the Apache, B22 and Black Hawk. In addition, we saw an increase in revenue in our missal applications. And we remain cautiously optimistic about future events growth going forward. While we still expecting military revenue on the $60 million to $70 million range quarterly for the foreseeable future, and will be looking to see how spending priorities change in Washington, as our budget for fiscal '18 moves towards completion. I continue resolution is still likely near-term, but really there's an opportunity for additional defense outlays, both domestically and overseas through, which might increase our outlook for this part of our black-market heading into next year. So the company has not come along with this past 2 years as well as these past few months to reaching its potential of being a leading structural and electronics provider to the world's top aerospace and defense OEMs. We have a great opportunity ahead of us to further streamline operations and improve customer service to our new awards and increase our content on a variety of programs and applications. I have more to say about this in the coming quarters, including plans to accelerate growth, and very importantly, improve our operating margins, positioning us for greater performance over the next decade. 
  With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $140.9 million compared to $133.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $17.6 million of higher sales within our military and space end-use",956,"Thank you, Steven good everyone. Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $140.9 million compared to $133.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $17.6 million of higher sales within our military and space end-use markets, partially offset by $7.7 million of lower commercial aerospace revenue, primarily due to the winding down of a regional jet program in soft nuts in the business jet market, as Steve mentioned. These related areas are not considered strategic to Ducommun, nor to our long-term growth plans. Revenue for the quarter was also down within the industrial sector $2.4 million. Ducommun's backlog was $611 million at the end of the quarter, highlighting the strength and diversity of the platforms we serve. 
  Moving to gross profit, our gross margin was 18.6 in the second quarter versus 19.6% last year's comparable period. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix and the continued new program development of ramping up production on certain commercial aerospace programs within the company's Structural Systems segment. 
  SG&A was $19.7 million in the second quarter versus $18.9 million in 2016 with the primary increase reflecting higher compensation and benefit cost. Operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $6.5 million or 4.6% of revenue versus $7.3 million or 5.4% of revenue in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects the higher SG&A, I just mentioned. Interest expense was flat at $1.9 million in the second quarters of both 2017 and 2016. As a positive impact of a lower outstanding term loan balance was offset by higher utilization of the company's revolving credit facility. Net income for the second quarter was $3.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to $3.9 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2016. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $0.7 million or 16.2% compared to $1.5 million or 27.6% in the comparable period last year. 
  The income tax rate for 2017 second quarter was reduced due to share-based compensation accounting, for the remainder of the year, the tax rate is expected to be approximately 27% to 28%. Adjusted EBITDA for the tech second quarter was $13.6 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to $13.7 million or 10.3% of revenue for the comparable period in 2016. 
  Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $59.1 million in the second quarter of 2017 versus $60.7 million last year, the slight decline was primarily due to $5 million of lower sales in commercial aerospace, mainly in the regional business death platforms, I previously mentioned, but this was partially offset by $3.4 million of higher revenue within the military and space end markets. 
  Structural systems operating income for the second quarter was $2 million or 3.5% of revenue compared to $4.7 million or 7.8% of revenue last year. The second quarter of 2017, again, included the impact of ongoing investment in new programs. 
  As noted on prior earning calls, we see operating margins for the structural systems trending lower than normal near term due to the new program development and ramp-up of platforms throughout 2017. That said, and as Steve mentioned, we are actively assessing our operations for additional ways to reduce cost and streamline production as the current margins are unacceptable. 
  Turning to electronic system segment. The electronics at system segment posted revenue of $81.8 million in the second quarter versus $72.7 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect $14.2 million of higher shipments within the commercial military and space end-used markets, partially offset by $2.7 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms, primarily reflecting softness is in the businesses jet market as I previously mentioned. Electronic system revenue was also $2.4 million lower within our industrial markets. Electronic systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $8.8 million or 10.8% of revenue versus $6.8 million or 9.3% of revenue in the prior year period. Corporate general administrative expenses, see G&A for the second quarter was $4.4 million or 3.1% of total company revenue compared to $4.2 million or 3.2% of the revenue last year. 
  Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $3 million of cash flow from operations in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $6.6 million at 2016, with the decline primarily due to short-term changes in working capital. We expect a positive impact from working capital management in the second half of 2017. Unlike prior quarters, we did not pay down any net debt this period, as Steve mentioned, this was due to our $9.5 million capital deployment during the period, much of it towards next-generation programs, primarily in our titanium centers of excellence such as our Parsons Complex. That said, we still expect to pay down approximately $15 million to $20 million of debt during 2017 as we continue towards our goal of delevering to a target of 2.25 to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. 
  In terms of CapEx, we anticipate spending approximately $22 million $26 million in total this year, this includes the Parsons facility expansion, I just mentioned, along with continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next generation platforms ramping up in the latter part of 2017 and 2018. 
  In closing, the quarter again showed consistent solid results as well as the potential for higher growth, given our increasing backlog and more positive demand dynamics, including on the defense side of our business. However, our performance also highlighted the need for further work on strategic initiatives designed to increase  margins within our structure systems unit, and we are taking this challenge head-on. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

I'll begin by providing an overview of performance, including some market color. After which, Doug Groves will go over a financial results in detail.
I'm happy report we posted revenue of $141 million this quarter, an increase both sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting $18 million of higher military defense shipments offsetting lower revenue and some of our commercial aerospace platforms. The weakness on the commercial side was primarily due to a aligning down of a regional jet program, which had unattractive margins, and some continued softness in the business jet market, as was discussed last quarter. But as a reminder, the regional business jet markets are a mighty contributor to Ducommun's growth strategy, and [indiscernible] we ended the quarter with our highest commercial aerospace backlog ever, some $337 million.
We've set the stage for revenue acceleration in the quarters to follow as we move into the second half of 2017. I also want to share with you some excellent news that the total backlog at the end of Q2 stood at $611 million, and that's up $30 million from last quarter. We generated $3 million in cash from operations this quarter, which equates to $16.3 million year-to-date, but did not pay down any additional debt [ to superior ] as we normally do for a very good reasons. As we move forward to time, we're going to deploy capital of a future growth. We invested $9.5 million in the businesses period, roughly twice our normal amount for CapEx. This is largely due to our next generation titanium operations and Parsons, Canada. We're we are working diligently preparing for new production for the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320 NEO, Airbus A330 and A350, allow us Gulfstream, G500 and G600 series.
Ducommun will be manufacturing titanium engine frames, auxiliary power ducts, cooler ducts, inlet engine bulkheads and exhaust pairing assemblies as well as other titanium modules and components at the state-of-the-art facility. Facility expansion is on track, and we have our top operations leader, fully engaged as we work to fully support our customer requirements in the months, in the quarters to come.
That said, we will continue to manage cash very aggressively. We'll pay down as much debt this year as possible to reduce the company's leverage and strengthened our balance sheet. In regards to our structure's business, let me also add that I'm disappointed with the operating margins within this business. And the goal of our team is to focus on ways to streamline the company and the operations further reduce costs with the goals being greater efficiency, margin expansion and higher asset utilization. Due to that challenge and with my time here in the company.
In May, I promoted Jerry Redondo to Senior Vice President of Operations and Head of our Structure's business. Jerry also have received the office of operational excellence, where he drive continues improvement, product integrity, program execution, engineering and supply chain management to accelerate growth and maximize the value of our products and services. Jerry is now with Ducommun, as Vice President of Operational Excellence since 2013. And previously worked at Crane Aerospace and Parker Hannifin. I've worked with Jerry since beginning of my role Ducommun in January and I trust him to deliver on major improvements in 2017 and beyond. He knows as do I, that even while investing in critical new programs and platforms, like the one, I just mentioned is necessary, we need to get our structure's business back to operating margins in the mid- to high single digits. We will also be highlighting additional plans as the year progresses to address this efficiency in our operations, so stay tuned. To finished my first full quarter in the company, let me add that I'm encouraged by several factors that started to come together this year.
Our sequentially better financial performance, robust backlog, and most important a higher level of customer responsiveness, all illustrate progress in serving both of our clients and our shareholders.
We had a very good reception at the Paris Airshow this summer, and OEMs are gaining more confidence in Ducommun. In our technology, our capabilities and our ability to [indiscernible] to achieve a high level of success, we increased our presence at the show beside the several NDA's. We came away with the knowledge that many customers do not fully yet understand the full capabilities of Ducommun. So we had no much request to follow-up meetings. Overall, the time, very well spent with encouraging results.
So I'm really pleased that how far we've come in addressing some critical near-term priorities, as myself and the team lay the groundwork from increasing margins and taking the company to the next level. As much more to come in our transformation.
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Begin with our commercial aerospace business, overall sales were $56 million this quarter, down from roughly $64 million last year. I'd mention this decline was primarily due to weakness with the regional and business jet markets going to wind out of one particular program. But our large commercial fixed-line business was stable and growing. The strong deliveries to Boeing for the 737 platform as well as to Airbus for the A320 and A330 aircraft. And we should see even higher overall commercial deliveries in the second half of the year. As I previously mentioned, we ended the quarter with a record commercial aerospace backlog of $337 million, and I'm excited about the growth prospects we see for 2018 and beyond. Particularly after the expansion of our Parsons, titanium operation, it's completed next spring.
Turning to our military and space sector we posted the second quarter revenue of $70 million versus $52 million last year. Strong show driven by radar rack sales and the F-15 and F-18 along with significant growth across various helicopter platforms, including the Apache, V-22 and Black Hawk.
In addition, we saw an increase in revenue in our missile applications. And we remain cautiously optimistic about future events growth going forward. While we still expecting military revenue on the $60 million to $70 million range quarterly for the foreseeable future, and will be looking to see how spending priorities change in Washington, as the budget for fiscal '18 moves towards completion. I continue -- continuing resolution is still likely near-term, but we believe there's an opportunity for additional defense outlays, both domestically and overseas through allies, which might increase our outlook for this part of our market heading into next year. So the company has come along way these past few years as well as these past few months to reaching its potential of being a leading structural and electronics provider to the world's top aerospace and defense OEMs. We have a great opportunity ahead of us to further streamline operations and improve customer service to a new awards and increase our content on a variety of programs and applications. I have more to say about this in the coming quarters, including plans to accelerate growth, and very importantly, improve our operating margins, positioning us for greater performance over the next decade.
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $140.9 million compared to $133.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $17.6 million of higher sales within our military and space",959,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $140.9 million compared to $133.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $17.6 million of higher sales within our military and space end-use markets, partially offset by $7.7 million of lower commercial aerospace revenue, primarily due to the winding down of a regional jet program and softness in the business jet market, as Steve mentioned. These related areas are not considered strategic to Ducommun, or to our long-term growth plans.
Revenue for the quarter was also down within the industrial sector $2.4 million. Ducommun's backlog was approximately $611 million at the end of the quarter, highlighting the strength and diversity of the platforms we serve.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 18.6% in the second quarter versus 19.6% last year's comparable period. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix and the continued new program development of ramping up production on certain commercial aerospace programs within the company's Structural Systems segment.
SG&A was $19.7 million in the second quarter versus $18.9 million in 2016 with the primary increase reflecting higher compensation and benefit cost. Operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $6.5 million or 4.6% of revenue versus $7.3 million or 5.4% of revenue in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects the higher SG&A, I just mentioned. Interest expense was flat at $1.9 million in the second quarters of both 2017 and 2016. As a positive impact of a lower outstanding term loan balance was offset by higher utilization of the company's revolving credit facility.
Net income for the second quarter was $3.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to $3.9 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2016. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $0.7 million or 16.2% compared to $1.5 million or 27.6% in the comparable period last year.
The income tax rate for 2017 second quarter was reduced due to share-based compensation accounting, for the remainder of the year the tax rate is expected to be approximately 27% to 28%.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2017 was $13.6 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to $13.7 million or 10.3% of revenue for the comparable period in 2016.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $59.1 million in the second quarter of 2017 versus $60.7 million last year. The slight decline was primarily due to $5 million of lower sales in commercial aerospace, mainly in a regional business debt platforms, I previously mentioned. But this was partially offset by $3.4 million of higher revenue within the military and space end markets.
Structural systems operating income for the second quarter was $2 million or 3.5% of revenue compared to $4.7 million or 7.8% of revenue last year. The second quarter of 2017, again, included the impact of ongoing investment in new programs.
As noted on prior earning calls, we see operating margins for the structural systems trending lower than normal near term due to the new program development and ramp-up of platforms throughout 2017. That said, and as Steve mentioned, we are actively assessing our operations for additional ways to reduce cost and streamline production as the current margins are unacceptable.
Turning to electronic system segment. The electronics at system segment posted revenue of $81.8 million in the second quarter versus $72.7 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect $14.2 million of higher shipments within the commercial military and space end-used markets, partially offset by $2.7 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms, primarily reflecting softness in the business jet market, as I previously mentioned. Electronic system revenue was also $2.4 million lower within our industrial markets. Electronic systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $8.8 million or 10.8% of revenue versus $6.8 million or 9.3% of revenue in the prior year period.
Corporate, general and administrative expenses, CGNA, for the second quarter was $4.4 million or 3.1% of total company revenue compared to $4.2 million or 3.2% of the revenue last year.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $3 million of cash flow from operations in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $6.6 million of 2016, with the decline primarily due to short-term changes in working capital. We expect a positive impact from working capital management in the second half of 2017. Unlike prior quarters, we did not pay down any net debt this period, as Steve mentioned, this was due to our $9.5 million capital deployment during the period, much of it towards next-generation programs, primarily at our titanium centers of excellence such as our Parsons Complex. That said, we still expect to pay down approximately $15 million to $20 million of debt during 2017, as we continue towards our goal of delevering to a target of 2.25x to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA.
In terms of CapEx, we anticipate spending approximately $22 million to $26 million in total this year. This includes the Parsons facility expansion, I just mentioned, along with continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next-generation aircraft platforms ramping up in the latter part of 2017 and 2018.
In closing, the quarter again showed consistent solid results as well as the potential for higher growth, given our increasing backlog and more positive demand dynamics, including on the defense side of our business. However, our performance also highlighted the need for further work on strategic initiatives designed to increase margins within ou Structural Systems unit, and we are taking this challenge head-on.
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

And also, progress in our next generation titanium operations. We also had an expanded presence in great series of meetings, again, like I mentioned, important customers in Paris Airshow, which I think will positively impact our prospects going forward.
As I view opportunities and I mentioned earlier, we clearly fell short in terms of margins on our structures business. However, the addition of Jerry Redondo, who I trust and is a top A-player to leave the structures group will make a clear difference in the future. I've also many entituded many changes throughout the company to increase our focus on efficiency and asset allocation, rewarding customers responsiveness as well, a drive and a passion for excellence, and assessing ways to increase top-line growth and overall performance.

And thank you, everyone for joining us today for our 2017 Second Quarter Conference Call. I'll begin by providing an overview of performance, including some market color.

I'll begin by providing an overview of performance, including some market color. After which, Doug Groves will go over financial results in detail.
I'm happy report we posted revenues of $141 million this quarter, an increased both sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting $18 million of higher military and defense shipments offsetting lower revenue in some of our commercial aerospace platforms. The weakness on the commercial side was primarily due to a winding down of a regional jet program, which had unattractive margins, and some continued softness in the business jet market, as was discussed last quarter. But as a reminder, the regional business jet markets are a mighty contributor to Ducommun's growth strategy, and, indeed, we ended the quarter with our highest commercial aerospace backlog ever, some $337 million.
We've set the stage for revenue acceleration in the quarters to follow as we move into the second half of 2017. I also want to share with you some excellent news that the total backlog at the end of Q2 stood at $611 million, and that's up $30 million from last quarter. We generated $3 million in cash from operations this quarter, which equates to $16.3 million year-to-date, but did not pay down any additional debt this period as we normally do for a very good reason. As we move forward in time, we're going to deploy capital for future growth. We invested $9.5 million in the businesses period, roughly twice our normal amount for CapEx. This is largely due to our next generation titanium operations in Parsons, Canada, where we are working diligently preparing for new production for the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320 NEO, Airbus A330 and A350, along with Gulfstream, G500 and G600 series.
Ducommun will be manufacturing titanium engine frames, auxiliary power ducts, cooler ducts, inlet engine bulkheads and exhaust pairing assemblies as well as other titanium modules and components at this state-of-the-art facility. Facility expansion is on track, and we have our top operations leader, fully engaged as we work to fully support our customer requirements in the months and the quarters to come.
That said, we will continue to manage cash very aggressively. We'll pay down as much debt this year as possible to reduce the company's leverage and strengthen our balance sheet. In regards to our structure's business, let me also add that I'm disappointed with the operating margins within this business. And the goal of our team is to focus on ways to streamline the company and the operations further reduce costs with the goals being greater efficiency, margin expansion and higher asset utilization. Due to that challenge and with my time here at the company, in May, I promoted Jerry Redondo to Senior Vice President of Operations and Head of our Structure's business. Jerry also received the office of operational excellence, where he drive continues improvement, product integrity, program execution, engineering and supply chain management to accelerate growth and maximize the value of our products and services. Jerry has been with Ducommun, as Vice President of Operational Excellence since 2013. And previously worked at Crane Aerospace and Parker Hannifin. I've worked with Jerry since beginning my role at Ducommun in January and I trust him to deliver on major improvements in 2017 and beyond. He knows as do I, that even while investing in critical new programs and platforms, like the ones I just mentioned, is necessary, we need to get our structure's business back to operating margins in the mid- to high single digits. We will also be highlighting additional plans as the year progresses to address this deficiency in our operations, so stay tuned. To finish my first full quarter in the company, let me add that I'm encouraged by several factors that have started to come together this year.
Our sequentially better financial performance, robust backlog, and most important a higher level of customer responsiveness, all illustrate progress in serving both our clients and our shareholders.
We had a very good reception at the Paris Airshow this summer, and OEMs are gaining more confidence in Ducommun. In our technology, our capabilities and our ability to [indiscernible] to achieve a high level of success, we increased our presence at the show besides several NDA's. We came away though with the knowledge that many customers do not fully yet understand the full capabilities of Ducommun. So we had numerous requests for follow-up meetings. Overall, it was time very well spent with encouraging results.
So I'm really pleased at how far we've come in addressing some critical near-term priorities, as myself and the team lay the groundwork for increasing margins and taking the company to the next level. There's much more to come in our transformation.
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Begin with our commercial aerospace business, overall sales were $56 million this quarter, down from roughly $64 million last year. As mentioned, this decline was primarily due to weakness with the regional and business jet markets including the winddown of one particular program. But our large commercial fixed-wing business was stable and growing. But strong deliveries to Boeing for the 737 platform as well as to Airbus for the A320 and A330 aircraft. And we should see even higher overall commercial deliveries in the second half of the year. As I previously mentioned, we ended the quarter with a record commercial aerospace backlog of $337 million, and are excited about the growth prospects we see for 2018 and beyond. Particularly after the expansion of our Parsons titanium operation is completed next spring.
Turning to our military and space sector we posted second quarter revenue of $70 million versus $52 million last year. A strong showing driven by radar rack sales and the F-15 and F-18 along with significant growth across various helicopter platforms, including the Apache, V-22 and Black Hawk.
In addition, we saw an increase in revenue in our missile applications. And we remain cautiously optimistic about future defense growth going forward. While we're still expecting military revenue on the $60 million to $70 million range quarterly for the foreseeable future, and we'll be looking to see how spending priorities change in Washington, as the budget for fiscal '18 moves towards completion. I continue -- a continuing resolution is still likely near-term, but we believe there's an opportunity for additional defense outlays, both domestically and overseas through our allies, which might increase our outlook for this part of our market heading into next year. So the company has come a long way these past few years as well as these past few months to reaching its potential of being a leading structural and electronics provider to the world's top aerospace and defense OEMs. We have a great opportunity ahead of us to further streamline operations and improve customer service to win new awards and increase our content on a variety of programs and applications. I'll have more to say about this in the coming quarters, including plans to accelerate growth, and very importantly, improve our operating margins, positioning us for greater performance over the next decade.
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $140.9 million compared to $133.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $17.6 million of higher sales within our military and space",959,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $140.9 million compared to $133.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $17.6 million of higher sales within our military and space end-use markets, partially offset by $7.7 million of lower commercial aerospace revenue, primarily due to the winding down of a regional jet program and softness in the business jet market, as Steve mentioned. These related areas are not considered strategic to Ducommun, or to our long-term growth plans.
Revenue for the quarter was also down within the industrial sector $2.4 million. Ducommun's backlog was approximately $611 million at the end of the quarter, highlighting the strength and diversity of the platforms we serve.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 18.6% in the second quarter versus 19.6% last year's comparable period. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix and the continued new program development at ramping up production on certain commercial aerospace programs within the company's Structural Systems segment.
SG&A was $19.7 million in the second quarter versus $18.9 million in 2016 with the primary increase reflecting higher compensation and benefit cost. Operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $6.5 million or 4.6% of revenue versus $7.3 million or 5.4% of revenue in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects the higher SG&A, I just mentioned. Interest expense was flat at $1.9 million in the second quarters of both 2017 and 2016, as a positive impact of a lower outstanding term loan balance was offset by higher utilization of the company's revolving credit facility.
Net income for the second quarter was $3.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to $3.9 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2016. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $0.7 million or 16.2% compared to $1.5 million or 27.6% in the comparable period last year.
The income tax rate for 2017 second quarter was reduced due to share-based compensation accounting, for the remainder of the year the tax rate is expected to be approximately 27% to 28%.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2017 was $13.6 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to $13.7 million or 10.3% of revenue for the comparable period in 2016.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $59.1 million in the second quarter of 2017 versus $60.7 million last year. The slight decline was primarily due to $5 million of lower sales in commercial aerospace, mainly in the regional and business debt platforms, I previously mentioned. But this was partially offset by $3.4 million of higher revenue within the military and space end markets.
Structural Systems operating income for the second quarter was $2 million or 3.5% of revenue compared to $4.7 million or 7.8% of revenue last year. The second quarter of 2017, again, included the impact of ongoing investment in new programs.
As noted on prior earning calls, we see operating margins for the structural systems trending lower than normal near term due to the new program development and ramp-up of platforms throughout 2017. That said, and as Steve mentioned, we are actively assessing our operations for additional ways to reduce cost and streamline production as the current margins are unacceptable.
Turning to Electronic System segment. The Electronics System segment posted revenue of $81.8 million in the second quarter versus $72.7 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect $14.2 million of higher shipments within the commercial military and space end-use markets, partially offset by $2.7 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms, primarily reflecting softness in the business jet market, as I previously mentioned. Electronic System revenue was also $2.4 million lower within our industrial markets. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $8.8 million or 10.8% of revenue versus $6.8 million or 9.3% of revenue in the prior year period.
Corporate, general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the second quarter was $4.4 million or 3.1% of total company revenue compared to $4.2 million or 3.2% of the revenue last year.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $3 million of cash flow from operations in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $6.6 million of 2016, with the decline primarily due to short-term changes in working capital. We expect a positive impact from working capital management in the second half of 2017. Unlike prior quarters, we did not pay down any net debt this period, as Steve mentioned, this was due to our $9.5 million capital deployment during the period, much of it towards next-generation programs, primarily at our titanium centers of excellence such as our Parsons Complex. That said, we still expect to pay down approximately $15 million to $20 million of debt during 2017, as we continue towards our goal of delevering to a target of 2.25x to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA.
In terms of CapEx, we anticipate spending approximately $22 million to $26 million in total this year. This includes the Parsons facility expansion, I just mentioned, along with continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next-generation aircraft platforms ramping up in the latter part of 2017 and 2018.
In closing, the quarter again showed consistent solid results as well as the potential for higher growth, given our increasing backlog and more positive demand dynamics, including on the defense side of our business. However, our performance also highlighted the need for further work on strategic initiatives designed to increase margins within our Structure Systems unit, and we are taking this challenge head-on.
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

We and I are also encouraged by the increase in our backlog, which means customers like what they see and continue to trust us with additional orders. And also, progress in our next generation titanium operations. We also had an expanded presence and great series of meetings, again, like I mentioned, with important customers at the Paris Airshow, which I think will positively impact our prospects going forward.
As I view opportunities and I mentioned earlier, we clearly fell short in terms of margins on our structures business. However, the addition of Jerry Redondo, who I trust and is a top A-player to lead the structures group will make a clear difference in the future. I've also many instituted many changes throughout the company to increase our focus on efficiency and asset allocation, rewarding customers responsiveness as well, a drive and a passion for excellence, and assessing ways to increase top-line growth and overall performance.
In this regard, the Ducommun team has responded well to the challenges I've implemented. I'm optimistic about the future. To our investors and the investor community, I say stay tuned. We'll have many more initiatives to discuss as the year progresses.

I'll begin by providing an overview of performance, including some market color. After which, Doug Groves will go over financial results in detail.
I'm happy report we posted revenues of $141 million this quarter, an increased both sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting $18 million of higher military and defense shipments offsetting lower revenue in some of our commercial aerospace platforms. The weakness on the commercial side was primarily due to a winding down of a regional jet program, which had unattractive margins, and some continued softness in the business jet market, as was discussed last quarter. But as a reminder, the regional business jet markets are a mighty contributor to Ducommun's growth strategy, and, indeed, we ended the quarter with our highest commercial aerospace backlog ever, some $337 million.
We've set the stage for revenue acceleration in the quarters to follow as we move into the second half of 2017. I also want to share with you some excellent news that the total backlog at the end of Q2 stood at $611 million, and that's up $30 million from last quarter. We generated $3 million in cash from operations this quarter, which equates to $16.3 million year-to-date, but did not pay down any additional debt this period as we normally do for a very good reason. As we move forward in time, we're going to deploy capital for future growth. We invested $9.5 million in the businesses period, roughly twice our normal amount for CapEx. This is largely due to our next generation titanium operations in Parsons, Canada, where we are working diligently preparing for new production for the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320 NEO, Airbus A330 and A350, along with Gulfstream, G500 and G600 series.
Ducommun will be manufacturing titanium engine frames, auxiliary power ducts, cooler ducts, inlet engine bulkheads and exhaust pairing assemblies as well as other titanium modules and components at this state-of-the-art facility. Facility expansion is on track, and we have our top operations leader, fully engaged as we work to fully support our customer requirements in the months and the quarters to come.
That said, we will continue to manage cash very aggressively. We'll pay down as much debt this year as possible to reduce the company's leverage and strengthen our balance sheet. In regards to our structure's business, let me also add that I'm disappointed with the operating margins within this business. And the goal of our team is to focus on ways to streamline the company and the operations further reduce costs with the goals being greater efficiency, margin expansion and higher asset utilization. Due to that challenge and with my time here at the company, in May, I promoted Jerry Redondo to Senior Vice President of Operations and Head of our Structure's business. Jerry also received the office of operational excellence, where he drive continues improvement, product integrity, program execution, engineering and supply chain management to accelerate growth and maximize the value of our products and services. Jerry has been with Ducommun, as Vice President of Operational Excellence since 2013. And previously worked at Crane Aerospace and Parker Hannifin. I've worked with Jerry since beginning my role at Ducommun in January and I trust him to deliver on major improvements in 2017 and beyond. He knows as do I, that even while investing in critical new programs and platforms, like the ones I just mentioned, is necessary, we need to get our structure's business back to operating margins in the mid- to high single digits. We will also be highlighting additional plans as the year progresses to address this deficiency in our operations, so stay tuned. To finish my first full quarter in the company, let me add that I'm encouraged by several factors that have started to come together this year.
Our sequentially better financial performance, robust backlog, and most important a higher level of customer responsiveness, all illustrate progress in serving both our clients and our shareholders.
We had a very good reception at the Paris Airshow this summer, and OEMs are gaining more confidence in Ducommun. In our technology, our capabilities and our ability to [indiscernible] to achieve a high level of success, we increased our presence at the show besides several NDA's. We came away though with the knowledge that many customers do not fully yet understand the full capabilities of Ducommun. So we had numerous requests for follow-up meetings. Overall, it was time very well spent with encouraging results.
So I'm really pleased at how far we've come in addressing some critical near-term priorities, as myself and the team lay the groundwork for increasing margins and taking the company to the next level. There's much more to come in our transformation.
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Begin with our commercial aerospace business, overall sales were $56 million this quarter, down from roughly $64 million last year. As mentioned, this decline was primarily due to weakness with the regional and business jet markets including the winddown of one particular program. But our large commercial fixed-wing business was stable and growing. But strong deliveries to Boeing for the 737 platform as well as to Airbus for the A320 and A330 aircraft. And we should see even higher overall commercial deliveries in the second half of the year. As I previously mentioned, we ended the quarter with a record commercial aerospace backlog of $337 million, and are excited about the growth prospects we see for 2018 and beyond. Particularly after the expansion of our Parsons titanium operation is completed next spring.
Turning to our military and space sector we posted second quarter revenue of $70 million versus $52 million last year. A strong showing driven by radar rack sales and the F-15 and F-18 along with significant growth across various helicopter platforms, including the Apache, V-22 and Black Hawk.
In addition, we saw an increase in revenue in our missile applications. And we remain cautiously optimistic about future defense growth going forward. While we're still expecting military revenue on the $60 million to $70 million range quarterly for the foreseeable future, and we'll be looking to see how spending priorities change in Washington, as the budget for fiscal '18 moves towards completion. I continue -- a continuing resolution is still likely near-term, but we believe there's an opportunity for additional defense outlays, both domestically and overseas through our allies, which might increase our outlook for this part of our market heading into next year. So the company has come a long way these past few years as well as these past few months to reaching its potential of being a leading structural and electronics provider to the world's top aerospace and defense OEMs. We have a great opportunity ahead of us to further streamline operations and improve customer service to win new awards and increase our content on a variety of programs and applications. I'll have more to say about this in the coming quarters, including plans to accelerate growth, and very importantly, improve our operating margins, positioning us for greater performance over the next decade.
With that, I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $140.9 million compared to $133.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $17.6 million of higher sales within our military and space",959,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $140.9 million compared to $133.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $17.6 million of higher sales within our military and space end-use markets, partially offset by $7.7 million of lower commercial aerospace revenue, primarily due to the winding down of a regional jet program and softness in the business jet market, as Steve mentioned. These related areas are not considered strategic to Ducommun, or to our long-term growth plans.
Revenue for the quarter was also down within the industrial sector $2.4 million. Ducommun's backlog was approximately $611 million at the end of the quarter, highlighting the strength and diversity of the platforms we serve.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 18.6% in the second quarter versus 19.6% last year's comparable period. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix and the continued new program development at ramping up production on certain commercial aerospace programs within the company's Structural Systems segment.
SG&A was $19.7 million in the second quarter versus $18.9 million in 2016 with the primary increase reflecting higher compensation and benefit cost. Operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $6.5 million or 4.6% of revenue versus $7.3 million or 5.4% of revenue in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects the higher SG&A, I just mentioned. Interest expense was flat at $1.9 million in the second quarters of both 2017 and 2016, as a positive impact of a lower outstanding term loan balance was offset by higher utilization of the company's revolving credit facility.
Net income for the second quarter was $3.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to $3.9 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2016. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $0.7 million or 16.2% compared to $1.5 million or 27.6% in the comparable period last year.
The income tax rate for 2017 second quarter was reduced due to share-based compensation accounting, for the remainder of the year the tax rate is expected to be approximately 27% to 28%.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2017 was $13.6 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to $13.7 million or 10.3% of revenue for the comparable period in 2016.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $59.1 million in the second quarter of 2017 versus $60.7 million last year. The slight decline was primarily due to $5 million of lower sales in commercial aerospace, mainly in the regional and business debt platforms, I previously mentioned. But this was partially offset by $3.4 million of higher revenue within the military and space end markets.
Structural Systems operating income for the second quarter was $2 million or 3.5% of revenue compared to $4.7 million or 7.8% of revenue last year. The second quarter of 2017, again, included the impact of ongoing investment in new programs.
As noted on prior earning calls, we see operating margins for the structural systems trending lower than normal near term due to the new program development and ramp-up of platforms throughout 2017. That said, and as Steve mentioned, we are actively assessing our operations for additional ways to reduce cost and streamline production as the current margins are unacceptable.
Turning to Electronic System segment. The Electronics System segment posted revenue of $81.8 million in the second quarter versus $72.7 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect $14.2 million of higher shipments within the commercial military and space end-use markets, partially offset by $2.7 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms, primarily reflecting softness in the business jet market, as I previously mentioned. Electronic System revenue was also $2.4 million lower within our industrial markets. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $8.8 million or 10.8% of revenue versus $6.8 million or 9.3% of revenue in the prior year period.
Corporate, general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the second quarter was $4.4 million or 3.1% of total company revenue compared to $4.2 million or 3.2% of the revenue last year.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $3 million of cash flow from operations in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $6.6 million of 2016, with the decline primarily due to short-term changes in working capital. We expect a positive impact from working capital management in the second half of 2017. Unlike prior quarters, we did not pay down any net debt this period, as Steve mentioned, this was due to our $9.5 million capital deployment during the period, much of it towards next-generation programs, primarily at our titanium centers of excellence such as our Parsons Complex. That said, we still expect to pay down approximately $15 million to $20 million of debt during 2017, as we continue towards our goal of delevering to a target of 2.25x to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA.
In terms of CapEx, we anticipate spending approximately $22 million to $26 million in total this year. This includes the Parsons facility expansion, I just mentioned, along with continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next-generation aircraft platforms ramping up in the latter part of 2017 and 2018.
In closing, the quarter again showed consistent solid results as well as the potential for higher growth, given our increasing backlog and more positive demand dynamics, including on the defense side of our business. However, our performance also highlighted the need for further work on strategic initiatives designed to increase margins within our Structure Systems unit, and we are taking this challenge head-on.
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

I'll just add a few final comments before opening it up to questions. I want to close my remarks today, and just say that I think we've started to make some real progress, especially on the customer side, along with posting some good top-line growth due to diversity of our products on a variety of key commercial and military platforms. We and I are also encouraged by the increase in our backlog, which means customers like what they see and continue to trust us with additional orders. And also, progress in our next generation titanium operations. We also had an expanded presence and great series of meetings, again, like I mentioned, with important customers at the Paris Airshow, which I think will positively impact our prospects going forward.
As I view opportunities and I mentioned earlier, we clearly fell short in terms of margins on our structures business. However, the addition of Jerry Redondo, who I trust and is a top A-player to lead the structures group will make a clear difference in the future. I've also many instituted many changes throughout the company to increase our focus on efficiency and asset allocation, rewarding customers responsiveness as well, a drive and a passion for excellence, and assessing ways to increase top-line growth and overall performance.
In this regard, the Ducommun team has responded well to the challenges I've implemented. I'm optimistic about the future. To our investors and the investor community, I say stay tuned. We'll have many more initiatives to discuss as the year progresses. And I strongly believe the company will be in excellent shape as we take on the opportunities to outperform and over deliver in terms of service to our customers and also returns to shareholders.

I'll begin by providing an overview of performance, including some market color. After which, Doug Groves will go over financial results in detail.
I'm happy report we posted revenues of $141 million this quarter, an increased both sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting $18 million of higher military and defense shipments offsetting lower revenue in some of our commercial aerospace platforms. The weakness on the commercial side was primarily due to a winding down of a regional jet program, which had unattractive margins, and some continued softness in the business jet market, as was discussed last quarter. But as a reminder, the regional business jet markets are a minor contributor to Ducommun's growth strategy, and, indeed, we ended the quarter with our highest commercial aerospace backlog ever, some $337 million.
We've set the stage for revenue acceleration in the quarters to follow as we move into the second half of 2017. I also want to share with you some excellent news that the total backlog at the end of Q2 stood at $611 million, and that's up $30 million from last quarter. We generated $3 million in cash from operations this quarter, which equates to $16.3 million year-to-date, but did not pay down any additional debt this period as we normally do for a very good reason. As we move forward in time, we're going to deploy capital for future growth. We invested $9.5 million in the businesses period, roughly twice our normal amount for CapEx. This is largely due to our next generation titanium operations in Parsons, Kansas, where we are working diligently preparing for new production for the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320 NEO, Airbus A330 and A350, along with Gulfstream, G500 and G600 series.
Ducommun will be manufacturing titanium engine frames, auxiliary power ducts, cooler ducts, inlet engine bulkheads and exhaust pairing assemblies as well as other titanium modules and components at this state-of-the-art facility. Facility expansion is on track, and we have our top operations leader, fully engaged as we work to fully support our customer requirements in the months and the quarters to come.
That said, we will continue to manage cash very aggressively. We'll pay down as much debt this year as possible to reduce the company's leverage and strengthen our balance sheet. In regards to our structure's business, let me also add that I'm disappointed with the operating margins within this business. And the goal of our team is to focus on ways to streamline the company and the operations further reduce costs with the goals being greater efficiency, margin expansion and higher asset utilization. Due to that challenge and with my time here at the company, in May, I promoted Jerry Redondo to Senior Vice President of Operations and Head of our Structure's business. Jerry also received the office of operational excellence, where he drive continues improvement, product integrity, program execution, engineering and supply chain management to accelerate growth and maximize the value of our products and services. Jerry has been with Ducommun, as Vice President of Operational Excellence since 2013. And previously worked at Crane Aerospace and Parker Hannifin. I've worked with Jerry since beginning my role at Ducommun in January and I trust him to deliver on major improvements in 2017 and beyond. He knows as do I, that even while investing in critical new programs and platforms, like the ones I just mentioned, is necessary, we need to get our structure's business back to operating margins in the mid- to high single digits. We will also be highlighting additional plans as the year progresses to address this deficiency in our operations, so stay tuned. To finish my first full quarter in the company, let me add that I'm encouraged by several factors that have started to come together this year.
Our sequentially better financial performance, robust backlog, and most important a higher level of customer responsiveness, all illustrate progress in serving both our clients and our shareholders.
We had a very good reception at the Paris Airshow this summer, and OEMs are gaining more confidence in Ducommun. In our technology, our capabilities and our ability to [indiscernible] to achieve a high level of success, we increased our presence at the show besides several NDA's. We came away though with the knowledge that many customers do not fully yet understand the full capabilities of Ducommun. So we had numerous requests for follow-up meetings. Overall, it was time very well spent with encouraging results.
So I'm really pleased at how far we've come in addressing some critical near-term priorities, as myself and the team lay the groundwork for increasing margins and taking the company to the next level. There's much more to come in our transformation.
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. Begin with our commercial aerospace business, overall sales were $56 million this quarter, down from roughly $64 million last year. As mentioned, this decline was primarily due to weakness with the regional and business jet markets including the wind down of one particular program. But our large commercial fixed-wing business was stable and growing. But strong deliveries to Boeing for the 737 platform as well as to Airbus for the A320 and A330 aircraft. And we should see even higher overall commercial deliveries in the second half of the year. As I previously mentioned, we ended the quarter with a record commercial aerospace backlog of $337 million, and are excited about the growth prospects we see for 2018 and beyond. Particularly after the expansion of our Parsons titanium operation is completed next spring.
Turning to our military and space sector we posted second quarter revenue of $70 million versus $52 million last year. A strong showing driven by radar rack sales and the F-15 and F-18 along with significant growth across various helicopter platforms, including the Apache, V-22 and Black Hawk.
In addition, we saw an increase in revenue in our missile applications. And we remain cautiously optimistic about future defense growth going forward. While we're still expecting military revenue on the $60 million to $70 million range quarterly for the foreseeable future, and we'll be looking to see how spending priorities change in Washington, as the budget for fiscal '18 moves towards completion. I continue -- a continuing resolution is still likely near term, but we believe there's an opportunity for additional defense outlays, both domestically and overseas for our allies, which might increase our outlook for this part of our market heading into next year. So the company has come a long way these past few years as well as these past few months to reaching its potential of being a leading structural and electronics provider to the world's top aerospace and defense OEMs. We have a great opportunity ahead of us to further streamline operations and improve customer service to win new awards and increase our content on a variety of programs and applications. I'll have more to say about this in the coming quarters, including plans to accelerate growth, and very importantly, improve our operating margins, positioning us for greater performance over the next decade.

267761,531603469,1288893,"Ducommun Incorporated, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2017",2017-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $140.9 million compared to $133.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $17.6 million of higher sales within our military and space",959,"Thank you, Steve, and good day, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $140.9 million compared to $133.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $17.6 million of higher sales within our military and space end-use markets, partially offset by $7.7 million of lower commercial aerospace revenue, primarily due to the winding down of a regional jet program and softness in the business jet market, as Steve mentioned. These related areas are not considered strategic to Ducommun, or to our long-term growth plans.
Revenue for the quarter was also down within the industrial sector $2.4 million. Ducommun's backlog was approximately $611 million at the end of the quarter, highlighting the strength and diversity of the platforms we serve.
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 18.6% in the second quarter versus 19.6% last year's comparable period. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix and the continued new program development and ramping of production on certain commercial aerospace programs within the company's Structural Systems segment.
SG&A was $19.7 million in the second quarter versus $18.9 million in 2016 with the primary increase reflecting higher compensation and benefit cost. Operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $6.5 million or 4.6% of revenue versus $7.3 million or 5.4% of revenue in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects the higher SG&A, I just mentioned. Interest expense was flat at $1.9 million in the second quarters of both 2017 and 2016, as a positive impact of a lower outstanding term loan balance was offset by higher utilization of the company's revolving credit facility.
Net income for the second quarter was $3.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to $3.9 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2016. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $0.7 million or 16.2% compared to $1.5 million or 27.6% in the comparable period last year.
The income tax rate for 2017 second quarter was reduced due to share-based compensation accounting, for the remainder of the year the tax rate is expected to be approximately 27% to 28%.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2017 was $13.6 million or 9.6% of revenue compared to $13.7 million or 10.3% of revenue for the comparable period in 2016.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $59.1 million in the second quarter of 2017 versus $60.7 million last year. The slight decline was primarily due to $5 million of lower sales in commercial aerospace, mainly in the regional and business jet platforms, I previously mentioned. But this was partially offset by $3.4 million of higher revenue within the military and space end markets.
Structural Systems operating income for the second quarter was $2 million or 3.5% of revenue compared to $4.7 million or 7.8% of revenue last year. The second quarter of 2017, again, included the impact of ongoing investment in new programs.
As noted on prior earning calls, we see operating margins for the structural systems trending lower than normal near term due to the new program development and ramp-up of platforms throughout 2017. That said, and as Steve mentioned, we are actively assessing our operations for additional ways to reduce cost and streamline production as the current margins are unacceptable.
Turning to Electronic System segment. The Electronics System segment posted revenue of $81.8 million in the second quarter versus $72.7 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect $14.2 million of higher shipments within the commercial military and space end-use markets, partially offset by $2.7 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms, primarily reflecting softness in the business jet market, as I previously mentioned. Electronic System revenue was also $2.4 million lower within our industrial markets. Electronic Systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $8.8 million or 10.8% of revenue versus $6.8 million or 9.3% of revenue in the prior year period.
Corporate, general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the second quarter was $4.4 million or 3.1% of total company revenue compared to $4.2 million or 3.2% of the revenue last year.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $3 million of cash flow from operations in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $6.6 million of 2016, with the decline primarily due to short-term changes in working capital. We expect a positive impact from working capital management in the second half of 2017. Unlike prior quarters, we did not pay down any net debt this period, as Steve mentioned, this was due to our $9.5 million capital deployment during the period, much of it towards next-generation programs, primarily at our titanium centers of excellence such as our Parsons Complex. That said, we still expect to pay down approximately $15 million to $20 million of debt during 2017, as we continue towards our goal of delevering to a target of 2.25x to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA.
In terms of CapEx, we anticipate spending approximately $22 million to $26 million in total this year. This includes the Parsons facility expansion, I just mentioned, along with continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next-generation aircraft platforms ramping up in the latter part of 2017 and 2018.
In closing, the quarter again showed consistent solid results as well as the potential for higher growth, given our increasing backlog and more positive demand dynamics, including on the defense side of our business. However, our performance also highlighted the need for further work on strategic initiatives designed to increase margins within our Structure Systems unit, and we are taking this challenge head-on.
I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve?"

I'll just add a few final comments before opening it up to questions. I want to close my remarks today, and just say that I think we've started to make some real progress, especially on the customer side, along with posting some good top-line growth due to diversity of our products on a variety of key commercial and military platforms. We and I are also encouraged by the increase in our backlog, which means customers like what they see and continue to trust us with additional orders. And also, progress in our next generation titanium operations. We also had an expanded presence and great series of meetings, again, like I mentioned, with important customers at the Paris Airshow, which I think will positively impact our prospects going forward.
As I view opportunities and I mentioned earlier, we clearly fell short in terms of margins on our structures business. However, the addition of Jerry Redondo, who I trust and is a top A-player to lead the structures group will make a clear difference in the future. I've also instituted many changes throughout the company to increase our focus on efficiency and asset allocation, rewarding customers' responsiveness as well, a drive and a passion for excellence, and assessing ways to increase top-line growth and overall performance.
In this regard, the Ducommun team has responded well to the challenges I've implemented. I'm optimistic about the future. To our investors and the investor community, I say stay tuned. We'll have many more initiatives to discuss as the year progresses. And I strongly believe the company will be in excellent shape as we take on the opportunities to outperform and over deliver in terms of service to our customers and also returns to shareholders. This will all happen in the quarters to come.
With that, operator, let's now open up for questions."

And thank you everyone for joining us today for our 2017 third quarter conference call. I'll begin by providing an overview of the recent developments after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.Well, first let me start by",1237,"Thanks, Chris. And thank you everyone for joining us today for our 2017 third quarter conference call. I'll begin by providing an overview of the recent developments after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.Well, first let me start by briefly talking about a few accomplishments this quarter and our near-term focus. I was pleased with our Q3 performance primarily due to 2 reasons. First we saw 15% growth year-over-year on our military and space platforms as we continue to benefit from resurgence in demand for the F-15 radar racks along with increased shipments on certain helicopter platforms and missile systems. Our defense related backlog is now stable at $256 million. We are optimistic about future top-line growth in the quarters to come.Second accomplishment to note this quarter was the sequential 230 basis point improvement versus second quarter and operating margins for our structures business. As Doug will review in a moment the structure's operating margin was 5.8% this quarter versus 3.5% in Q2, a significant increase. As I mentioned earlier, the past margins were unacceptable and pretty much continue to be as we work hard to improve those. But with Jerry Redondo in the group since May we are announcing the progress I expect now and in the future.This brings me to the next major topic I like to discuss which is our restructuring plans. I spoke during the past 2 earnings calls about how we've been assessing all aspects of the organization to further streamline processes, increase asset utilization and expand margin with particular focus across our structure's operation. We're now taking initial steps to improve our company, announcing plans that result in $22 million to $25 million of pretax restructuring charges beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 and running through 2018.We're still finalizing the details as to the timing of certain initiatives such as operations affected and the write-down of inventory and impairment of fixed assets. However, the goals are clear, beginning in 2019 the company anticipates these restructuring measures in aggregate result in a total cost savings of approximately $14 million annually. Given the expected results of such initiatives combined with higher manufacturing efficiencies as new platforms ramp, our margins and cash flow should be greatly improved and Ducommun will be more efficient, stronger and innovative supplier to the aerospace and defense industry.Our plans also involve an assessment of all our products and programs to ensure we are engaged on the right type of attractive profitable applications. Just as we decided some time ago to exit certain contracts when appropriate within the business and regional jet space we will reduce our involvement on platforms that are unattractive, inappropriate or lower our overall margin profile. Such decisions will play out in 2018 and that will impact top line growth in our commercial aerospace operation even as we seek continued higher demand across a number of large fixed-wing platforms, particularly within the narrow-body space where we have an excellent position.I'll have more to say about such strategic decisions in the future but suffice it to say that there will be some -- still some programs which should not leverage our core competency or do not meet our internal investment hurdles. I want to share with you that when I began as CEO I clearly communicated to the leadership team that we're only going -- that we were going to be decisive regarding actions on all business which either lost money or marginally profitable. As I said in the past, we need to take these steps to position Ducommun for higher level performance, one that we owe our customers, employees and shareholders alike.At the same time we will continue to look at opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions that can strengthen our capabilities and improve our market position in key platforms. Such was the thinking with the purchase of lightning diversion systems in this past September. Based in Huntington Beach, California LDS is a world leader in lightning protection systems using proprietary technologies of various aerospace applications. We believe the company has a strong position in a niche market and was well worth its $60 million price given the key aircraft platforms it serves and potential growth trajectory.I'm also happy to share that we are on track integrating LDS into our existing electronic segment and we are very optimistic about the impact this will have on our margins going forward. I'm also pleased as well to have Dave Wilmot, the President of LDS and his team as part of Ducommun after bidding successfully and competing heavily against several other more key names in the aerospace industry for this property.So we've accomplished a great deal this quarter, improving margin sequentially, acquiring a key aerospace supplier. We also paid down debt as well and our backlog increased to $655 million. And with the announcement of some significant restructuring plans we are well on our way to building Ducommun of tomorrow.Now let me provide you some additional color on our end-markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector we posted third quarter revenues of $62.8 million, up 15% year-over-year as I mentioned earlier. This positive performance is indicative of overall increasing demand for the platforms we serve with sales up 20% year-to-date. The top-line growth is driven by higher sales of radar racks, particularly for the F-15 as well as expanded shipments for helicopter platforms like the Apache and Blackhawk along with higher spending on missile defense systems.Military backlog, as I mentioned earlier, remains robust, $256 million. As I said earlier, and I'm optimistic regarding further opportunities for system upgrades and defense spending increases in the quarters to come.Within our commercial aerospace operations overall sales were $61 million this quarter, down from roughly $64 million last year. As mentioned in past quarters, decline in 2017 has been due to weakness within the regional business jet markets, including the wind down of one particular program is expected to continue impacting year-over-year comps for the first quarter of 2018.In contrast our large commercial fixed-wing business is stable and growing with sales of roughly $40 million this quarter versus $36 million in 2016, driven by strong deliveries to Boeing for the 737 platform as well as to Airbus for the A320 and A330 aircraft. We ended the quarter with a record commercial aerospace backlog of $367 million. And we are working hard to execute on many growth platforms for 2018 and beyond. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, growth next year will primarily be across our core narrow-body programs as we assess our portfolio to further reduce exposure to unattractive and lower margin business.I also have to report we also remain on track in regards to our next-generation titanium operation in Parsons, Kansas. Our production continues to ramp up on the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320neo, A330, A350 along with very important programs as well for Gulfstream G500 and G600.It's been a of solid execution and we're on track to complete this expansion in the spring of 2018. I'm proud of how far we've come and pleased to see the record backlogs and sequential increase in margins. With our restructuring plans now framed out in broad terms we will focus on finalizing these initiatives to streamline Ducommun's operations and increase asset utilization. We'll have much more to say on this topic in the quarters to come.So with that I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

Revenue for the third quarter of 2017 was $138.7 million compared to $132.6 million for the third quarter 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $8.1 million of higher sales within our military and space market",1030,"Thank you, Steve, and good day everyone. Revenue for the third quarter of 2017 was $138.7 million compared to $132.6 million for the third quarter 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $8.1 million of higher sales within our military and space markets, a $0.9 million increase in revenue in our industrial end markets which was partially offset by $2.8 million lower sales to our commercial aerospace customers primarily due to the winding down of a regional jet program and softness in the jet market as we've discussed in the past.The top-line military growth year-over-year was due to higher demand across many of our platforms. Ducommun's backlog was approximately $655 million at the end of the quarter, illustrating the strength of the industry and our position on key platforms as Steve discussed.Moving to gross profit, our gross margin was 18.8% in the third quarter versus 19% in last years' comparable period. The declining gross margin year-over-year was primarily due to product mix and program manufacturing inefficiencies on certain new commercial aerospace platforms within the company's Structural System segment.SG&A was $18.8 million in the third quarter versus $17.2 million in 2016 with the primary increase being higher compensation and benefit costs. Operating income for the third quarter of 2017 was $7.2 million or 5.2% of revenue versus $8.1 million or 6.1% of revenue in the prior-year period.The decrease in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects the higher SG&A I just mentioned. Interest expense was $2.1 million in the third quarter 2017 versus $1.9 million last year as the positive impact of a lower outstanding term loan balance was more than offset by higher utilization of the company's revolving credit facility which was partially used for the acquisition of LDS.Net income for the third quarter was $4.7 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared to $5 million or $0.44 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2016. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $0.9 million or 16.8% compared to $1.2 million or 19.8% in the comparable period last year.The income tax rate for the 2017 third quarter was reduced due to the finalization of our 2016 federal tax return which included some favorable adjustments and share-based compensation accounting. For the upcoming fourth quarter the expected tax rate is to be in the range of 23% to 25% excluding any discrete items.Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2017 was $14.5 million or 10.4% of revenue compared to $14.9 million or 11.2% of revenue for the comparable period in 2016. Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Structural System segment posted revenue of $59.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 versus $60.9 million last year.The slight decline was primarily due to $1.6 million of lower sales on our regional and business jet platforms as I previously mentioned. Structural Systems' operating income for the third quarter was $3.5 million or 5.8% of revenue compared to $5.9 million or 9.7% of revenue last year.The third quarter of 2017 once again included the impact of ongoing investments in new programs although margins rose 230 basis point sequentially from the second quarter. As Steve noted, we are taking appropriate strategic measures to boost long-term structural margins through ongoing restructuring initiatives while facing some near-term manufacturing inefficiencies due to the Parsons facility expansion and a ramp up of new programs.Turning to the Electronic Systems segment, our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $79 million in the third quarter versus $71.6 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect $7.7 million of higher shipments within the company's military and space end-use markets as well as $0.9 million increase in industrial sales partially offset by $1.3 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms primarily reflecting the softness in the business jet market as previously mentioned.Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $8.2 million or 10.4% of revenue versus $6.6 million or 9.2% of revenue in the prior-year period. Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the third quarter was $4.5 million or 3.2% of company revenue compared to $4.4 million or 3.3% of revenue last year.Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $11.1 million of cash from operations in the third quarter of 2017 compared to $15.5 million in 2016. We also paid down $8.9 million of debt in the quarter and still expect to pay down approximately $12 million to $15 million in debt for 2017.We will continue to pay down debt with our free cash flow while balancing strategic investments including opportunistic acquisitions like LDS. In terms of CapEx we spent $8.4 million in the third quarter and we anticipate spending approximately $26 million to $30 million in total this year which includes the ongoing Parsons facility expansion and continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next generation aircraft platforms ramping up in 2018 and beyond.Now turning to the restructuring. As Steve mentioned we have initiated a restructuring plan to stream[Audio Gap]operations and increased asset utilization, particularly within the structures business. Company currently expects that these actions will result in approximately $22 million to $25 million or pretax restructuring charges beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 and continuing through the planned completion of such activities at the end of 2018.Of these charges about 40% are expected to represent actual cash outlays for employee separation and business consolidation costs and about 60% will be comprised of cash charges for the write down of the inventory and impairment of fixed assets. Approximately $10.5 million of the charges are expected to be recorded in 2017. After such measures are complete in late 2018 the company anticipates total cost savings of approximately $14 million â€“- $14 million annually beginning in 2019.So in closing, the quarter was one of continued execution on our plans to ramp up production of Parsons, look to address inefficiencies across the operations and increase our content backlog on a variety of key aerospace and defense platforms. We believe we are actively taking the correct steps to transform Ducommun into a better-performing, faster growing and more technology focused company for years to come.I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks. Steve."

And thank you everyone for joining us today for our 2017 third quarter conference call. I'll begin by providing an overview of the recent developments after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.Well, first let me start by",1237,"Thanks, Chris. And thank you everyone for joining us today for our 2017 third quarter conference call. I'll begin by providing an overview of the recent developments after which Doug will review our financial results in detail.Well, first let me start by briefly talking about a few accomplishments this quarter and our near-term focus. I was pleased with our Q3 performance primarily due to 2 reasons. First we saw 15% growth year-over-year on our military and space platforms as we continue to benefit from resurgence in demand for the F-15 radar racks along with increased shipments on certain helicopter platforms and missile systems. Our defense related backlog is now stable at $256 million. We are optimistic about future top-line growth in the quarters to come.Second accomplishment to note this quarter was the sequential 230 basis point improvement versus second quarter and operating margins for our structures business. As Doug will review in a moment the structure's operating margin was 5.8% this quarter versus 3.5% in Q2, a significant increase. As I mentioned earlier, the past margins were unacceptable and pretty much continue to be as we work hard to improve those. But with Jerry Redondo in the group since May we are announcing the progress I expect now and in the future.This brings me to the next major topic I like to discuss which is our restructuring plans. I spoke during the past 2 earnings calls about how we've been assessing all aspects of the organization to further streamline processes, increase asset utilization and expand margin with particular focus across our structure's operation. We're now taking initial steps to improve our company, announcing plans that result in $22 million to $25 million of pretax restructuring charges beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 and running through 2018.We're still finalizing the details as to the timing of certain initiatives such as operations affected and the write-down of inventory and impairment of fixed assets. However, the goals are clear, beginning in 2019 the company anticipates these restructuring measures in aggregate result in a total cost savings of approximately $14 million annually. Given the expected results of such initiatives combined with higher manufacturing efficiencies as new platforms ramp, our margins and cash flow should be greatly improved and Ducommun will be more efficient, stronger and innovative supplier to the aerospace and defense industry.Our plans also involve an assessment of all our products and programs to ensure we are engaged on the right type of attractive profitable applications. Just as we decided some time ago to exit certain contracts when appropriate within the business and regional jet space we will reduce our involvement on platforms that are unattractive, inappropriate or lower our overall margin profile. Such decisions will play out in 2018 and that will impact top line growth in our commercial aerospace operation even as we seek continued higher demand across a number of large fixed-wing platforms, particularly within the narrow-body space where we have an excellent position.I'll have more to say about such strategic decisions in the future but suffice it to say that there will be some -- still some programs which should not leverage our core competency or do not meet our internal investment hurdles. I want to share with you that when I began as CEO I clearly communicated to the leadership team that we're only going -- that we were going to be decisive regarding actions on all business which either lost money or marginally profitable. As I said in the past, we need to take these steps to position Ducommun for higher level performance, one that we owe our customers, employees and shareholders alike.At the same time we will continue to look at opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions that can strengthen our capabilities and improve our market position in key platforms. Such was the thinking with the purchase of lightning diversion systems in this past September. Based in Huntington Beach, California LDS is a world leader in lightning protection systems using proprietary technologies of various aerospace applications. We believe the company has a strong position in a niche market and was well worth its $60 million price given the key aircraft platforms it serves and potential growth trajectory.I'm also happy to share that we are on track integrating LDS into our existing electronic segment and we are very optimistic about the impact this will have on our margins going forward. I'm also pleased as well to have Dave Wilmot, the President of LDS and his team as part of Ducommun after bidding successfully and competing heavily against several other more key names in the aerospace industry for this property.So we've accomplished a great deal this quarter, improving margin sequentially, acquiring a key aerospace supplier. We also paid down debt as well and our backlog increased to $655 million. And with the announcement of some significant restructuring plans we are well on our way to building Ducommun of tomorrow.Now let me provide you some additional color on our end-markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector we posted third quarter revenues of $62.8 million, up 15% year-over-year as I mentioned earlier. This positive performance is indicative of overall increasing demand for the platforms we serve with sales up 20% year-to-date. The top-line growth is driven by higher sales of radar racks, particularly for the F-15 as well as expanded shipments for helicopter platforms like the Apache and Blackhawk along with higher spending on missile defense systems.Military backlog, as I mentioned earlier, remains robust, $256 million. As I said earlier, and I'm optimistic regarding further opportunities for system upgrades and defense spending increases in the quarters to come.Within our commercial aerospace operations overall sales were $61 million this quarter, down from roughly $64 million last year. As mentioned in past quarters, decline in 2017 has been due to weakness within the regional business jet markets, including the wind down of one particular program is expected to continue impacting year-over-year comps for the first quarter of 2018.In contrast our large commercial fixed-wing business is stable and growing with sales of roughly $40 million this quarter versus $36 million in 2016, driven by strong deliveries to Boeing for the 737 platform as well as to Airbus for the A320 and A330 aircraft. We ended the quarter with a record commercial aerospace backlog of $367 million. And we are working hard to execute on many growth platforms for 2018 and beyond. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, growth next year will primarily be across our core narrow-body programs as we assess our portfolio to further reduce exposure to unattractive and lower margin business.I also have to report we also remain on track in regards to our next-generation titanium operation in Parsons, Kansas. Our production continues to ramp up on the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320neo, A330, A350 along with very important programs as well for Gulfstream G500 and G600.It's been a of solid execution and we're on track to complete this expansion in the spring of 2018. I'm proud of how far we've come and pleased to see the record backlogs and sequential increase in margins. With our restructuring plans now framed out in broad terms we will focus on finalizing these initiatives to streamline Ducommun's operations and increase asset utilization. We'll have much more to say on this topic in the quarters to come.So with that I'll now have Doug review our financial results in detail. Doug?"

Revenue for the third quarter of 2017 was $138.7 million compared to $132.6 million for the third quarter 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $8.1 million of higher sales within our military and space market",1030,"Thank you, Steve, and good day everyone. Revenue for the third quarter of 2017 was $138.7 million compared to $132.6 million for the third quarter 2016. The increase year-over-year reflects $8.1 million of higher sales within our military and space markets, a $0.9 million increase in revenue in our industrial end markets which was partially offset by $2.8 million lower sales to our commercial aerospace customers primarily due to the winding down of a regional jet program and softness in the jet market as we've discussed in the past.The top-line military growth year-over-year was due to higher demand across many of our platforms. Ducommun's backlog was approximately $655 million at the end of the quarter, illustrating the strength of the industry and our position on key platforms as Steve discussed.Moving to gross profit, our gross margin was 18.8% in the third quarter versus 19% in last years' comparable period. The declining gross margin year-over-year was primarily due to product mix and program manufacturing inefficiencies on certain new commercial aerospace platforms within the company's Structural System segment.SG&A was $18.8 million in the third quarter versus $17.2 million in 2016 with the primary increase being higher compensation and benefit costs. Operating income for the third quarter of 2017 was $7.2 million or 5.2% of revenue versus $8.1 million or 6.1% of revenue in the prior-year period.The decrease in operating income year-over-year primarily reflects the higher SG&A I just mentioned. Interest expense was $2.1 million in the third quarter 2017 versus $1.9 million last year as the positive impact of a lower outstanding term loan balance was more than offset by higher utilization of the company's revolving credit facility which was partially used for the acquisition of LDS.Net income for the third quarter was $4.7 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared to $5 million or $0.44 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2016. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $0.9 million or 16.8% compared to $1.2 million or 19.8% in the comparable period last year.The income tax rate for the 2017 third quarter was reduced due to the finalization of our 2016 federal tax return which included some favorable adjustments and share-based compensation accounting. For the upcoming fourth quarter the expected tax rate is to be in the range of 23% to 25% excluding any discrete items.Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2017 was $14.5 million or 10.4% of revenue compared to $14.9 million or 11.2% of revenue for the comparable period in 2016. Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Structural System segment posted revenue of $59.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 versus $60.9 million last year.The slight decline was primarily due to $1.6 million of lower sales on our regional and business jet platforms as I previously mentioned. Structural Systems' operating income for the third quarter was $3.5 million or 5.8% of revenue compared to $5.9 million or 9.7% of revenue last year.The third quarter of 2017 once again included the impact of ongoing investments in new programs although margins rose 230 basis point sequentially from the second quarter. As Steve noted, we are taking appropriate strategic measures to boost long-term structural margins through ongoing restructuring initiatives while facing some near-term manufacturing inefficiencies due to the Parsons facility expansion and a ramp up of new programs.Turning to the Electronic Systems segment, our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $79 million in the third quarter versus $71.6 million in the prior-year period. These results reflect $7.7 million of higher shipments within the company's military and space end-use markets as well as $0.9 million increase in industrial sales partially offset by $1.3 million of lower revenue across our commercial aerospace platforms primarily reflecting the softness in the business jet market as previously mentioned.Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $8.2 million or 10.4% of revenue versus $6.6 million or 9.2% of revenue in the prior-year period. Corporate general and administrative expenses, CG&A, for the third quarter was $4.5 million or 3.2% of company revenue compared to $4.4 million or 3.3% of revenue last year.Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $11.1 million of cash from operations in the third quarter of 2017 compared to $15.5 million in 2016. We also paid down $8.9 million of debt in the quarter and still expect to pay down approximately $12 million to $15 million in debt for 2017.We will continue to pay down debt with our free cash flow while balancing strategic investments including opportunistic acquisitions like LDS. In terms of CapEx we spent $8.4 million in the third quarter and we anticipate spending approximately $26 million to $30 million in total this year which includes the ongoing Parsons facility expansion and continued investment in new programs as we prepare for the next generation aircraft platforms ramping up in 2018 and beyond.Now turning to the restructuring. As Steve mentioned we have initiated a restructuring plan to stream[Audio Gap]operations and increased asset utilization, particularly within the structures business. Company currently expects that these actions will result in approximately $22 million to $25 million or pretax restructuring charges beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 and continuing through the planned completion of such activities at the end of 2018.Of these charges about 40% are expected to represent actual cash outlays for employee separation and business consolidation costs and about 60% will be comprised of cash charges for the write down of the inventory and impairment of fixed assets. Approximately $10.5 million of the charges are expected to be recorded in 2017. After such measures are complete in late 2018 the company anticipates total cost savings of approximately $14 million â€“- $14 million annually beginning in 2019.So in closing, the quarter was one of continued execution on our plans to ramp up production of Parsons, look to address inefficiencies across the operations and increase our content backlog on a variety of key aerospace and defense platforms. We believe we are actively taking the correct steps to transform Ducommun into a better-performing, faster growing and more technology focused company for years to come.I'll now turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks.
