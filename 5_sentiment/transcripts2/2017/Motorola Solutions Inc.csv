I'd like to share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q4 was an outstanding quarter capping a very solid year. For the quarter, we grew revenue by 12% including 4% organically. Additionally, we grew revenue in every region. Our Products segment revenue grew 9% led by a continuing strength in North America and reflecting the durability of our core LMR business. Second, 2016 was a pivotal year for us as we returned to growth. We strengthened our competitive position and grew revenues 6% while ending the year with a record backlog position, and our Services segment grew 18% to $2.4 billion with services now comprising 40% of our business. And lastly, I'm very confident in our position going forward. Since the split 6 years ago, MSI's annual total shareholder return has averaged over 20% a year, we've strengthened our product portfolio, dramatically reduced our cost profile, normalized the balance sheet, reduced our share count by 52%, refreshed our board and senior leadership team and completed 4 key software- and services-based acquisitions just this past year. So with that baseline, I believe we're set up well for success going forward. As I think about 2017 and beyond, we remain fully committed to revenue growth, earnings growth and continued cash flow improvement. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Q4 results include revenue of $1.9 billion, up 12% from last year including Airwave revenue of $124 million. The strong results were driven by growth in every region, 9% growth in products and 18% growth in services. GAAP operating earnings were $403 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $541 million or 29% of sales, representing an improvement of 150 basis points from the year ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.43 compared to $1.56 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.03 a share, up $1.58 -- up from $1.58 in the year ago quarter, a 28% year-over-year increase. Ending backlog is up $1.9 billion from last year and $234 million sequentially. The $1.9 billion increase versus last year was driven by $1.25 billion from Airwave, $300 million from organic Managed & Support services and $300 million from products. 
For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted. For the full year, revenue grew 6% including $462 million of Airwave revenue. Revenue excluding Airwave declined 2% on weakness in Latin America and parts of Europe in the first half, while both North America and Asia Pac grew for the full year. Managed & Support services grew 49% in the full year and 5% excluding Airwave. Operating earnings were $1.4 billion, up $261 million or 22% compared to the previous year. Earnings per share grew 48% to $4.92. Free cash flow was $894 million, up $48 million. 
Moving to the Products segment. Q4 products sales were $1.23 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by growth in every region. Q4 products' operating income was $407 million or 33% of sales, up 300 basis points from last year driven by higher sales. Products backlog ended the quarter at $1.5 billion, up approximately $300 million from last year primarily on continued strength in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $102 million, also driven by strong order volume in North America. 
Q4 Services revenue was $657 million, up 18% including $124 million of Airwave. Excluding Airwave, Managed & Support services grew 5%. Services operating income was $134 million or 20% of revenue. Operating margins were down year-on-year due to higher integration costs associated with the completion of the Norway implementation phase as well as higher incentive costs for the 2016 backlog performance. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $1.6 billion from last year. Of the $1.6 billion increase, Airwave was $1.25 billion and organic Managed & Support services was up $300 million, driven primarily by North America. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $133 million driven by North America and Latin America and it includes a $250 million adjustment primarily due to the British pound. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx in Q4 was $408 million, up $22 million from the year ago quarter, driven primarily by M&A expenses and higher incentives associated with our 2016 record backlog performance. It's important to note that from a run rate perspective, we achieved our 2016 targets and remain on track for structural reductions to OpEx. For the year, we reduced operating expenses by approximately $80 million. Other income and expense in Q4 was $41 million compared to $51 million in the year ago quarter. The Q4 effective tax rate was 31%, and for the full year, 2016, the effective tax rate was also 31%. 
Moving to cash and capital allocation. Q4 operating cash flow was $513 million, an increase of $98 million from last year, driven by higher revenue and EBITDA. Free cash flow was $453 million, up $82 million. We ended Q4 in a net debt position of $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $114 million of stock, paid out $68 million in dividends and repaid the term loan related to the Airwave acquisition. We also invested $246 million in software solutions with the acquisitions of Spillman Technologies, Gridstone and Siphus [ph]. Capital return for 2016 was $2.4 billion. This is comprised of acquisitions of $1.3 billion, share buybacks of $842 million at an average price of $70.28 and dividends of $280 million. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales growth of 3% to 5% and EPS between $0.52 and $0.57. This outlook reflects approximately $50 million of incremental Airwave revenue versus the year ago quarter and an average diluted share count of approximately 170 million shares and it's based on current FX rates. 
For the full year 2017, we expect revenue growth of 1% to 2% and EPS of $5.05 to $5.20. We expect operating cash flow to grow by approximately $50 million to $1,225,000,000 and free cash flow to be approximately and $950 million. This outlook is based on current foreign exchange rates and assumes Airwave revenue to be approximately flat from the prior year due entirely to currency. 
Moving to regional results. North America grew 3% in Q4 and 2% for the full year with approximately equal growth in both Products and Services. Backlog is up significantly in both Products and Services year-over-year and sequentially. Latin America revenue grew 21% in Q4 driven by Products. For the year, Latin America declined 20% on macroeconomic headwinds in the first half as well as expected item declines. Ending backlog is up double digits both year-over-year and sequentially driven by large projects in Q4. EMEA grew 45% in Q4 inclusive of Airwave and was up 1% organically. For the year, EMEA grew 33% including Airwave. Excluding Airwave, EMEA declined 15% driven primarily by approximately $100 million of lower Norway revenue associated with the completion of the implementation phase of the nationwide contract. Asia Pac revenue grew 15% for the quarter and 3% for the year driven by the Products segment. 
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights. The Products segment strong results reflect our continued focus on innovation, cost efficiency and execution. A few example of this innovation and investment include targeted acquisitions including Spillman Technologies and Gridstone which strengthened our software offerings for public safety, the release of new P25 and TETRA devices that provide advanced features and functionality including Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi and enhanced location services that enable future software and service opportunities. 
Norway and Sweden conducted their first major cross-border emergency response exercise supported by our software that enables fully interoperable multivendor radio communications. This land mobile radio cross-border collaboration is spurring additional interest from neighboring countries and illustrates the power of our LMR communications platform. 
I also want to mention some notable wins: a $140 million P25 system deployment for the Washington Metro Area Transit authority, enabling seamless communication both above and below ground; $60 million to upgrade and maintain the citywide P25 system for the metro area of San Francisco; and $40 million to upgrade a P25 system that expands coverage and enables interoperable communications unifying 8 cities in Argentina. 
In the Services segment, we continue to grow our Managed & Support Services business around the world. Q4 multi-year service awards include wins in Texas, South Carolina, California, United Kingdom, Argentina, China and Latvia. Deals such as these helped drive our Services backlog growth of nearly $300 million or 7% excluding Airwave. We expect our momentum in the Managed & Support Services business to continue as our customers choose Motorola expertise to help them navigate their fast-changing technology options at a predictable cost. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me just close with a few brief thoughts. 2016 was a strong year of execution and growth especially considering the macroeconomic headwinds in Latin America and parts of Europe earlier in the year. For a little additional perspective, it's worth noting that North America grew each of the past 2 years and 6 of the last 8 quarters. Asia Pac grew the past 2 years and EMEA returned to growth this year as well, all of which I think confirms the durability and longevity of our LMR platform. So while I'm pleased with our results, we'll continue to drive the business for improved operating leverage and revenue growth in 2017, and I expect our record backlog position entering this year to support our growth going forward. 
I'll now turn it back over to Chris."

So just wanted to make sure that's the right picture. And then if you can give us a sense of what gives you confidence in this organic growth. Is that mostly services? Or do you see growth in Products as well and maybe in terms of geography? And then a quick follow-up in the Q1. Your guide is below expectations and it seems like the seasonality between Q4 and Q1 is below what we've seen in recent years, so if you could explain the moving parts around that, that would be very helpful."

Make sure I capture everything, and if I don't, please follow up, but let's talk about 2017. So you're right. We're guiding 1% to 2% at the top line. You correctly articulated that it incorporates a few things, right? So iDEN is a negative headwind of $50 million. There is an order for about ESN for about $25 million that with the delay of ESN, gets pushed out of 2017. And the third dimension is Airwave. Now Airwave is flat, contemplated in this guidance at about $460 million in '17. As a footnote, Pierre, if we were operating with the pound at the rate when we closed Airwave just under a year ago, that would yield $80 million -- would have yielded $80 million of additional top line revenue this year in 2017. So that's kind of the trough to field on the puts and takes in 2017. We do believe organic growth will continue in 2017 and we do believe we'll grow in both Products and the Services segments, which is assumed in the overall 1% to 2% envelope for 2017. For Q1, 2 points to make, right? So we look at Q1 and we look at Q4 more or less together. So when we look -- when Gino and I and Jack and Bruce, we look at Q4 and Q1 and combine those 2 quarters, from a revenue and actually an EPS perspective, it's at or above where we thought it would be coming into Q4. So we had an exceptionally strong Q4 both on top and bottom. So I wouldn't necessarily get concerned about the linearity or the dimensions between the flow between the quarters. The other note, Pierre, is on Q1 EPS, we have a higher tax rate and we have higher interest expense in Q1. Those 2 items are worth about $0.08. So that should give you some other ingredients to help think about and dimensionalize the overall performance in Q4 Q1 in fiscal year 2017."

If you look at Q1 OpEx, it's up a little bit modestly, flat to slightly up. But for the full year, we expect OpEx to be down roughly $20 million to $25 million. By the way, that's inclusive of about $40 million of acquisitions made. So overall, I'm very pleased with OpEx on a run rate performance. The management team hit the targets they committed to me and we will reduce OpEx in 2017 over '16 again, and that's absorbing $40 million of acquisitions."

You will see us continue to invest both organically and look opportunistically inorganically around software and services. So the larger the LMR platform, and you saw our Products segment there, the broader the footprint. That's a greater opportunity to monetize on services, managed services, support services. We'll always be on the lookout for acquisitions that would be Airwave-like in their attractive characteristics where we can operate and take ownership of those networks. So I'm very pleased with the strategy and the execution of it. And also we've talked about, right, going from critical communications to critical intelligence. And the critical intelligence is having a better footprint and incumbency in the command center, and Spillman hits the sweet spot, among others, with ECW in filling out that portfolio.

But we talked about it, services which includes installation services, is 40% of our business for 2016. So when you add software in of a few hundred million, it takes it to about 43%. That's a 2016 view. I think there's a number of things that are driving demand for our business. Some of it is aged of the technology and refresh it, but a lot of it is upgrading it. In current releases, it's the need for new work, digitally more efficient radios with more feature functionality. Public safety has always remained high in the value chain of mission-critical communications, particularly in developed countries, certainly in North America. I think that continues to -- it continues to be a strong component of overall demand. Things around border security, immigration, lone wolf terrorism in other parts of the country all lend itself to the need for mission-critical encrypted secure end-to-end reliable, redundant, always on communications. Very different than a smartphone, very different than a cellular network. And in these times, I think there are a variety of things that remind people and reinforce the need to invest in land mobile radio. I think each time we put in a system, we see, Stanley, many customers still buying 10- and 15-year maintenance contracts on these systems and platforms that are going in. So in addition to that, the more systems that are in, people think about monetizing and upgrading from a services contract and adding other software to it. So there's a lot of different factors. It depends by region, but there's a number of drivers from a demand standpoint that I think reflected very favorably in Q4 and reflect the fact if we continue organically that this business will grow in 2017, by the way, in both segments of product and software. I wasn't sure I totally understood the backlog question you asked, but I would simply say that it's up -- first of all, it was up in 3 or 4 regions and it was up in product and services and it was up year-over-year and sequentially. And aged backlog was up very nicely and the aged backlog increase, in combination with improved process that I talked about earlier, gives us higher confidence in the visibility, in hitting the growth targets that we outlined for top and bottom line guidance."

The portfolio is stronger than it was a year ago, and I think it's a good opportunity for us.

I should just say that I think that we've done a much better job in the rhythm of meeting or beating expectations, and that's for the whole host of reasons. But I think it's important just to mention that the thought of that remains front and center on us taking forecasting very seriously and all of us individually, collectively having every expectation to deliver on the commitments that we've outlined. That said as context, things in the unknown in '17, you can never predict FX. We've certainly seen that. In 2016, we had Brexit that I don't think a lot of people predicted in June, July, but we were still able to hit guidance right exactly in the midpoint of revenue for '16 and overachieved at the high end of EPS. And I think that's a credit to Gino and the finance team as they way they kind of baked in the volatility or potential variability of Airwave in fiscal 2016. But Paul, for sure, one of the unknowns is FX. I think that that's really the one that comes to mind top of mind. I think you get into, could there be an economic downturn or a trade war, maybe. But again, 65% of our revenue is North America. And when I look at -- let's take Mexico and China, since they are the most talked about. China is 3% of our business and we're forecasting it to be flat to slightly down. Mexico is less than 1% of our business. So despite all of the chatter politically between the U.S. and Mexico, the fact of the matter is our business is very small there. If anything, I think there's opportunity there for us. So I think the answer to your question, the best thing is FX is the biggest wildcard and economic volatility associated with the trade war would be the other one."

From a managed services and software standpoint, we're going to be very flexible on business model going forward and we'd like to accommodate customers in different ways to sell them solutions flexibly. Could be selling as a product, could be selling as a service, but we'll price flexibly to accommodate the demand requirements of our customer set. From a seasonality standpoint, specifically, with the U.S. Federal business, I have to give a shoutout to specifically Mark McNulty here at the U.S. federal business that runs it, he's done a great job, he and his team. We had a very good year in 2016, double-digit growth above $500 million. As we think about it this year, we're thinking about it being comparable to that number figure, probably flat to low single-digit growth coming off such a very good year in '16."

But nonetheless, we continue to work well with the U.K. home office. I think it's too early to speculate on impact on Airwave. So we'll just continue to work closely with the customer making sure, obviously, that Airwave performs the way it needs to. And it has and I think it will continue to, and from our expectation, from a contract standpoint, we're very pleased with the Airwave acquisition. But we are equally cognizant of doing everything we can for the U.K. home office on ESN, and we'll manage those interdependencies."

I'd like to share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q4 was an outstanding quarter capping a very solid year. For the quarter, we grew revenue by 12%, including 4% organically. Additionally, we grew revenue in every region. Our Products segment revenue grew 9%, led by continuing strength in North America and reflecting the durability of our core LMR business. Second, 2016 was a pivotal year for us as we returned to growth. We strengthened our competitive position and grew revenues 6%, while ending the year with a record backlog position. And our Services segment grew 18% to $2.4 billion, with Services now comprising 40% of our business. And lastly, I'm very confident in our position going forward. Since the split 6 years ago, MSI's annual total shareholder return has averaged over 20% a year. We've strengthened our product portfolio, dramatically reduced our cost profile, normalized the balance sheet, reduced our share count by 52%, refreshed our board and senior leadership team and completed 4 key software- and services-based acquisitions just this past year. So with that baseline, I believe we're set up well for success going forward. As I think about 2017 and beyond, we remain fully committed to revenue growth, earnings growth and continued cash flow improvement.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Q4 results include revenue of $1.9 billion, up 12% from last year, including Airwave revenue of $124 million. The strong results were driven by growth in every region, 9% growth in Products and 18% growth in Services. GAAP operating earnings were $403 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $541 million or 29% of sales, representing an improvement of 150 basis points from the year-ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.43 compared to $1.56 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.03 a share, up $1.58 -- up from $1.58 in the year-ago quarter, a 28% year-over-year increase. Ending backlog is up $1.9 billion from last year and $234 million sequentially. The $1.9 billion increase versus last year was driven by $1.25 billion from Airwave, $300 million from organic Managed and Support Services and $300 million from Products. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
For the full year, revenue grew 6%, including $462 million of Airwave revenue. Revenue excluding Airwave declined 2% on weakness in Latin America and parts of Europe in the first half, while both North America and Asia Pac grew for the full year. Managed and Support Services grew 49% in the full year and 5% excluding Airwave. Operating earnings were $1.4 billion, up $261 million or 22% compared to the previous year. Earnings per share grew 48% to $4.92. Free cash flow was $894 million, up $48 million.
Moving to the Products segment. Q4 Products sales were $1.23 billion, up 9% from the prior year driven by growth in every region. Q4 Products operating income was $407 million or 33% of sales, up 300 basis points from last year driven by higher sales. Products backlog ended the quarter at $1.5 billion, up approximately $300 million from last year primarily on continued strength in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $102 million, also driven by strong order volume in North America.
Q4 Services revenue was $657 million, up 18%, including $124 million of Airwave. Excluding Airwave, Managed and Support Services grew 5%. Services operating income was $134 million or 20% of revenue. Operating margins were down year-on-year due to higher integration costs associated with the completion of the Norway implementation phase as well as higher incentive costs for the 2016 backlog performance. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $1.6 billion from last year. Of the $1.6 billion increase, Airwave was $1.25 billion and organic Managed and Support Services was up $300 million driven primarily by North America. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $133 million driven by North America and Latin America, and it includes a $215 million adjustment primarily due to the British pound.
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx in Q4 was $408 million, up $22 million from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by M&A expenses and higher incentives associated with our 2016 record backlog performance. It's important to note that from a run rate perspective, we achieved our 2016 targets and remain on track for structural reductions to OpEx. For the year, we reduced operating expenses by approximately $80 million. Other income and expense in Q4 was $41 million compared to $51 million in the year-ago quarter. The Q4 effective tax rate was 31%. And for the full year, 2016, the effective tax rate was also 31%.
Moving to cash and capital allocation. Q4 operating cash flow was $513 million, an increase of $98 million from last year, driven by higher revenue and EBITDA. Free cash flow was $453 million, up $82 million. We ended Q4 in a net debt position of $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $114 million of stock, paid out $68 million in dividends and repaid the term loan related to the Airwave acquisition. We also invested $246 million in software solutions with the acquisitions of Spillman Technologies, Gridstone and Cyfas. Capital return for 2016 was $2.4 billion. This is comprised of acquisitions of $1.3 billion, share buybacks of $842 million at an average price of $70.28 and dividends of $280 million.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales growth of 3% to 5% and EPS between $0.52 and $0.57. This outlook reflects approximately $50 million of incremental Airwave revenue versus the year-ago quarter and an average diluted share count of approximately 170 million shares, and it's based on current FX rates.
For the full year 2017, we expect revenue growth of 1% to 2% and EPS of $5.05 to $5.20. We expect operating cash flow to grow by approximately $50 million to $1,225,000,000 and free cash flow to be approximately $950 million. This outlook is based on current foreign exchange rates and assumes Airwave revenue to be approximately flat from the prior year due entirely to currency.
Moving to regional results. North America grew 3% in Q4 and 2% for the full year with approximately equal growth in both Products and Services. Backlog is up significantly in both Products and Services year-over-year and sequentially. Latin America revenue grew 21% in Q4 driven by Products. For the year, Latin America declined 20% on macroeconomic headwinds in the first half as well as expected iDEN declines. Ending backlog is up double digits both year-over-year and sequentially driven by large projects in Q4. EMEA grew 45% in Q4 inclusive of Airwave and was up 1% organically. For the year, EMEA grew 33% including Airwave. Excluding Airwave, EMEA declined 15% driven primarily by approximately $100 million of lower Norway revenue associated with the completion of the implementation phase of the nationwide contract. Asia Pac revenue grew 15% for the quarter and 3% for the year driven by the Products segment.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights. The Products segment strong results reflect our continued focus on innovation, cost efficiency and execution. A few example of this innovation and investment include targeted acquisitions including Spillman Technologies and Gridstone, which strengthened our software offerings for public safety; the release of new P25 and TETRA devices that provide advanced features and functionality, including Bluetooth 4.0, WiFi and enhanced location services that enable future software and services opportunities.
Norway and Sweden conducted their first major cross-border emergency response exercise supported by our software that enables fully interoperable multi-vendor radio communications. This land mobile radio cross-border collaboration is spurring additional interest from neighboring countries and illustrates the power of our LMR communications platform.
I also want to mention some notable wins: a $140 million P25 system deployment for the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority, enabling seamless communication both above and belowground; $60 million to upgrade and maintain the citywide P25 system for the metro area of San Francisco; and $40 million to upgrade a P25 system that expands coverage and enables interoperable communications unifying 8 cities in Argentina.
In the Services segment, we continue to grow our Managed and Support Services business around the world. Q4 multiyear service awards include wins in Texas, South Carolina, California, the United Kingdom, Argentina, China and Latvia. Deals such as these help drive our Services backlog growth of nearly $300 million or 7% excluding Airwave. We expect our momentum in the Managed and Support Services business to continue as our customers choose Motorola expertise to help them navigate their fast-changing technology options at a predictable cost.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me just close with a few brief thoughts. 2016 was a strong year of execution and growth especially considering the macroeconomic headwinds in Latin America and parts of Europe earlier in the year. For a little additional perspective, it's worth noting that North America grew each of the past 2 years and 6 of the last 8 quarters. Asia Pac grew the past 2 years and EMEA returned to growth this year as well, all of which, I think, confirms the durability and longevity of our LMR platform. So while I'm pleased with our results, we'll continue to drive the business for improved operating leverage and revenue growth in 2017, and I expect our record backlog position entering this year to support our growth going forward.
I'll now turn it back over to Chris."

So just wanted to make sure that's the right picture. And then if you can give us a sense of what gives you confidence in this organic growth. Is that mostly Services? Or do you see growth in Products as well and maybe in terms of geography? And then a quick follow-up, of course, on Q1.

Make sure I capture everything, and if I don't, please follow-up, but let's talk about 2017. So you're right. We're guiding 1% to 2% at the top line. You correctly articulated that it incorporates a few things, right? So iDEN is a negative headwind of $50 million. There is an order for about -- ESN for about $25 million that with the delay of ESN gets pushed out of 2017. And the third dimension is Airwave. Now Airwave is flat, contemplated in this guidance at about $460 million in '17. As a footnote, Pierre, if we were operating with the pound at the rate when we closed Airwave of just under a year ago, that would yield $80 million -- would have yielded $80 million of additional top line revenue this year in 2017. So that's kind of to chalk the field on the puts and takes in 2017. We do believe organic growth will continue in 2017. And we do believe we'll grow in both Products and the Services segments, which is assumed in the overall 1% to 2% envelope for 2017. For Q1, 2 points to make, right? So we look at Q1 and we look at Q4 more or less together. So when we look -- when Gino and I and Jack and Bruce, we look at Q4 and Q1 and combine those 2 quarters, from a revenue and actually an EPS perspective, it's at or above where we thought it would be coming into Q4. So we had an exceptionally strong Q4 both on top and bottom so I wouldn't necessarily get concerned about the linearity or the dimensions between the flow between the quarters. The other note, Pierre, is on Q1 EPS. We have a higher tax rate and we have higher interest expense in Q1. Those 2 items are worth about $0.08. So that should give you some other ingredients to help think about and dimensionalize the overall performance in Q4, Q1 in fiscal year 2017."

If you look at Q1 OpEx, it's up a little bit modestly, flat to slightly up. But for the full year, we expect OpEx to be down roughly $20 million to $25 million. By the way, that's inclusive of about $40 million of acquisitions made. So overall, I'm very pleased with OpEx. On a run rate performance, the management team hit the targets they committed to me, and we will reduce OpEx in 2017 over '16 again, and that's absorbing $40 million of acquisitions."

We'll always be on the lookout for acquisitions that would be Airwave-like in their attractive characteristics where we can operate and take ownership of those networks.

But we talked about the services, which includes installation services, is 40% of our business for 2016. So when you add software in of a few hundred million, it takes it to about 43%. That's a 2016 view. I think there's a number of things that are driving demand for our business. Some of it is age of the technology and we refresh it, but a lot of it is upgrading it in current releases, it's the need for newer, digitally, more spectrally efficient radios with more feature functionality. Public safety has always remained high in the value chain of mission-critical communications, particularly in developed countries, certainly in North America. I think that continues to -- it continues to be a strong component of overall demand. Things around border security, immigration, lone-wolf terrorism in other parts of the country all lend itself to the need for mission-critical, encrypted, secure, end-to-end, reliable, redundant, always-on communications. Very different than a smartphone, very different than a cellular network. And in these times, I think there are a variety of things that remind people and reinforce the need to invest in land mobile radio. I think each time we put in a system, we see, Stanley, many customers still buying 10- and 15-year maintenance contracts on these systems and platforms that are going in. So in addition to that, the more systems that are in, people think about monetizing and upgrading from a services contract and adding other software to it. So there's a lot of different factors. It depends by region, but there's a number of drivers from a demand standpoint that I think reflected very favorably in Q4 and reflect the fact that we continue organically that this business will grow in 2017, by the way, in both segments of product and software. I wasn't sure I totally understood the backlog question you asked, but I would simply say that it's up -- first of all, it was up in 3 or 4 regions, and it was up in product and services, and it was up year-over-year and sequentially. And aged backlog was up very nicely. And the aged backlog increase, in combination with improved process that I talked about earlier, gives us higher confidence in the visibility, in hitting the growth targets that we outlined for top and bottom line guidance."

I should just say that I think that we've done a much better job in the rhythm of meeting or beating expectations, and that's for a whole host of reasons. But I think it's important just to mention the thought that, that remains front and center on us taking forecasting very seriously and all of us individually, collectively, having every expectation to deliver on the commitments that we've outlined. That said as context, things in the unknown in '17, you can never predict FX. We've certainly seen that. In 2016, we had Brexit that I don't think a lot of people predicted in June, July, but we were still able to hit guidance, both right exactly in the midpoint of revenue for '16 and overachieved at the high end of EPS. And I think that's a credit to Gino and the finance team as the way they kind of baked in the volatility or potential variability of Airwave in fiscal 2016. But Paul, for sure, one of the unknowns is FX. I think that, that's really the one that comes to mind, top of mind. I think you get into, could there be an economic downturn or a trade war, maybe. But again, 65% of our revenue is North America. And when I look at -- let's take Mexico and China, since they are the most talked about. China is 3% of our business and we're forecasting it to be flat to slightly down. Mexico is less than 1% of our business. So despite all of the chatter politically between the U.S. and Mexico, the fact of the matter is our business is very small there. If anything, I think there's opportunity there for us. So I think the answer to your question, the best thing is FX is the biggest wildcard and economic volatility associated with a trade war would be the other one."

I'd like to share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q4 was an outstanding quarter, capping a very solid year. For the quarter, we grew revenue by 12%, including 4% organically. Additionally, we grew revenue in every region. Our Products segment revenue grew 9%, led by continuing strength in North America and reflecting the durability of our core LMR business. Second, 2016 was a pivotal year for us as we returned to growth. We strengthened our competitive position and grew revenues 6% while ending the year with a record backlog position. And our Services segment grew 18% to $2.4 billion, with Services now comprising 40% of our business. And lastly, I'm very confident in our position going forward. Since the split 6 years ago, MSI's annual total shareholder return has averaged over 20% a year. We've strengthened our product portfolio, dramatically reduced our cost profile, normalized the balance sheet, reduced our share count by 52%, refreshed our board and senior leadership team and completed 4 key software- and services-based acquisitions just this past year. So with that baseline, I believe we're set up well for success going forward. As I think about 2017 and beyond, we remain fully committed to revenue growth, earnings growth and continued cash flow improvement.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Q4 results include revenue of $1.9 billion, up 12% from last year, including Airwave revenue of $124 million. The strong results were driven by growth in every region, 9% growth in Products and 18% growth in Services. GAAP operating earnings were $403 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $541 million or 29% of sales, representing an improvement of 150 basis points from the year-ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.43 compared to $1.56 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.03 a share, up $1.58 -- up from $1.58 in the year-ago quarter, a 28% year-over-year increase. Ending backlog is up $1.9 billion from last year and $234 million sequentially. The $1.9 billion increase versus last year was driven by $1.25 billion from Airwave, $300 million from organic Managed and Support Services and $300 million from Products. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
For the full year, revenue grew 6%, including $462 million of Airwave revenue. Revenue excluding Airwave declined 2% on weakness in Latin America and parts of Europe in the first half, while both North America and Asia Pac grew for the full year. Managed and Support Services grew 49% in the full year and 5% excluding Airwave. Operating earnings were $1.4 billion, up $261 million or 22% compared to the previous year. Earnings per share grew 48% to $4.92. Free cash flow was $894 million, up $48 million.
Moving to the Products segment. Q4 Products sales were $1.23 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by growth in every region. Q4 Products operating income was $407 million or 33% of sales, up 300 basis points from last year driven by higher sales. Products backlog ended the quarter at $1.5 billion, up approximately $300 million from last year, primarily on continued strength in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $102 million, also driven by strong order volume in North America.
Q4 Services revenue was $657 million, up 18%, including $124 million of Airwave. Excluding Airwave, Managed and Support Services grew 5%. Services operating income was $134 million or 20% of revenue. Operating margins were down year-on-year due to higher integration costs associated with the completion of the Norway implementation phase as well as higher incentive costs for the 2016 backlog performance. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $1.6 billion from last year. Of the $1.6 billion increase, Airwave was $1.25 billion and organic Managed and Support Services was up $300 million, driven primarily by North America. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $133 million driven by North America and Latin America, and it includes a $215 million adjustment, primarily due to the British pound.
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx in Q4 was $408 million, up $22 million from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by M&A expenses and higher incentives associated with our 2016 record backlog performance. It's important to note that from a run rate perspective, we achieved our 2016 targets and remain on track for structural reductions to OpEx. For the year, we reduced operating expenses by approximately $80 million. Other income and expense in Q4 was $41 million compared to $51 million in the year-ago quarter. The Q4 effective tax rate was 31%. And for the full year 2016, the effective tax rate was also 31%.
Moving to cash and capital allocation. Q4 operating cash flow was $513 million, an increase of $98 million from last year, driven by higher revenue and EBITDA. Free cash flow was $453 million, up $82 million. We ended Q4 in a net debt position of $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $114 million of stock, paid out $68 million in dividends and repaid the term loan related to the Airwave acquisition. We also invested $246 million in software solutions with the acquisitions of Spillman Technologies, Gridstone and Cyfas. Capital return for 2016 was $2.4 billion. This is comprised of acquisitions of $1.3 billion, share buybacks of $842 million at an average price of $70.28, and dividends of $280 million.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales growth of 3% to 5% and EPS between $0.52 and $0.57. This outlook reflects approximately $50 million of incremental Airwave revenue versus the year-ago quarter and an average diluted share count of approximately 170 million shares, and it's based on current FX rates.
For the full year 2017, we expect revenue growth of 1% to 2% and EPS of $5.05 to $5.20. We expect operating cash flow to grow by approximately $50 million to $1,225,000,000 and free cash flow to be approximately $950 million. This outlook is based on current foreign exchange rates and assumes Airwave revenue to be approximately flat from the prior year due entirely to currency.
Moving to regional results. North America grew 3% in Q4 and 2% for the full year with approximately equal growth in both Products and Services. Backlog is up significantly in both Products and Services year-over-year and sequentially. Latin America revenue grew 21% in Q4, driven by Products. For the year, Latin America declined 20% on macroeconomic headwinds in the first half as well as expected iDEN declines. Ending backlog is up double digits both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by large projects in Q4. EMEA grew 45% in Q4 inclusive of Airwave and was up 1% organically. For the year, EMEA grew 33% including Airwave. Excluding Airwave, EMEA declined 15%, driven primarily by approximately $100 million of lower Norway revenue associated with the completion of the implementation phase of the nationwide contract. Asia Pac revenue grew 15% for the quarter and 3% for the year, driven by the Products segment.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights. The Products segment strong results reflect our continued focus on innovation, cost efficiency and execution. A few examples of this innovation and investment include: targeted acquisitions including Spillman Technologies and Gridstone, which strengthened our software offerings for public safety; the release of new P25 and TETRA devices that provide advanced features and functionality, including Bluetooth 4.0, WiFi and enhanced location services that enable future software and services opportunities.
Norway and Sweden conducted their first major cross-border emergency response exercise supported by our software that enables fully interoperable multi-vendor radio communications. This land mobile radio cross-border collaboration is spurring additional interest from neighboring countries and illustrates the power of our LMR communications platform.
I also want to mention some notable wins: a $140 million P25 system deployment for the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority, enabling seamless communication both above and below ground; $60 million to upgrade and maintain the citywide P25 system for the metro area of San Francisco; and $40 million to upgrade a P25 system that expands coverage and enables interoperable communications unifying 8 cities in Argentina.
In the Services segment, we continue to grow our Managed and Support Services business around the world. Q4 multiyear service awards include wins in Texas, South Carolina, California, the United Kingdom, Argentina, China and Latvia. Deals such as these help drive our Services backlog growth of nearly $300 million or 7% excluding Airwave. We expect our momentum in the Managed and Support Services business to continue as our customers choose Motorola expertise to help them navigate their fast-changing technology options at a predictable cost.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me just close with a few brief thoughts. 2016 was a strong year of execution and growth, especially considering the macroeconomic headwinds in Latin America and parts of Europe earlier in the year. For a little additional perspective, it's worth noting that North America grew each of the past 2 years and 6 of the last 8 quarters. Asia Pac grew the past 2 years and EMEA returned to growth this year as well, all of which, I think, confirms the durability and longevity of our LMR platform. So while I'm pleased with our results, we'll continue to drive the business for improved operating leverage and revenue growth in 2017, and I expect our record backlog position entering this year to support our growth going forward.

There is an order for about -- ESN for about $25 million that with the delay of ESN gets pushed out of 2017. And the third dimension is Airwave. Now Airwave is flat, contemplated in this guidance at about $460 million in '17.

So that's kind of to chalk the field on the puts and takes in 2017. We do believe organic growth will continue in 2017. And we do believe we'll grow in both Products and the Services segments, which is assumed in the overall 1% to 2% envelope for 2017. For Q1, 2 points to make, right? So we look at Q1 and we look at Q4 more or less together. So when we look -- when Gino and I and Jack and Bruce, we look at Q4 and Q1 and combine those 2 quarters, from a revenue and actually an EPS perspective, it's at or above where we thought it would be coming into Q4. So we had an exceptionally strong Q4 both on top and bottom, so I wouldn't necessarily get concerned about the linearity or the dimensions between the flow between the quarters. The other note, Pierre, is on Q1 EPS. We have a higher tax rate and we have higher interest expense in Q1. Those 2 items are worth about $0.08. So that should give you some other ingredients to help think about and dimensionalize the overall performance in Q4, Q1 in fiscal year 2017."

If you look at Q1 OpEx, it's up a little bit modestly, flat to slightly up. But for the full year, we expect OpEx to be down roughly $20 million to $25 million. By the way, that's inclusive of about $40 million of acquisitions made. So overall, I'm very pleased with OpEx. On a run rate performance, the management team hit the targets they committed to me, and we will reduce OpEx in 2017 over '16 again, and that's absorbing $40 million of acquisitions."

We'll always be on the lookout for acquisitions that would be Airwave-like in their attractive characteristics where we can operate and take ownership of those networks. So I'm very pleased with the strategy and the execution of it. And also we've talked about, right, going from critical communications to critical intelligence.

So with respect to product, I just wanted to get a better sense of where we are within the backlog as far as the aging of the backlog and some of the deals that have been there for some time and what impact that's having on the current revenue trends in Products. And within that, if you can also help us understand in your installed base, is it a matter of the fleet of products that your customers have that's getting old, that's driving some of the end-of-life product revenue? And then the final piece of that product question would be, I just want to better understand the software elements of product. It sounded like when you add software to services, it would increase to 43%, 44% of revenue. So maybe you can just reiterate what the product versus software mix in that overall product pie is."

So let me make sure I can try to capture everything. And if I don't, Stanley, follow-up. But we talked about the services, which includes installation services, is 40% of our business for 2016.

But we talked about the services, which includes installation services, is 40% of our business for 2016. So when you add software in of a few hundred million, it takes it to about 43%. That's a 2016 view. I think there's a number of things that are driving demand for our business. Some of it is age of the technology and we refresh it, but a lot of it is upgrading it in current releases, it's the need for newer, digitally, more spectrally efficient radios with more feature functionality. Public safety has always remained high in the value chain of mission-critical communications, particularly in developed countries, certainly in North America. I think that continues to -- it continues to be a strong component of overall demand. Things around border security, immigration, lone-wolf terrorism in other parts of the country all lend itself to the need for mission-critical, encrypted, secure, end-to-end, reliable, redundant, always-on communications. Very different than a smartphone, very different than a cellular network. And in these times, I think there are a variety of things that remind people and reinforce the need to invest in land mobile radio. I think each time we put in a system, we see, Stanley, many customers still buying 10- and 15-year maintenance contracts on these systems and platforms that are going in. So in addition to that, the more systems that are in, people think about monetizing and upgrading from a services contract and adding other software to it. So there's a lot of different factors. It depends by region, but there's a number of drivers from a demand standpoint that I think reflected very favorably in Q4 and reflect the fact that we continue organically that this business will grow in 2017, by the way, in both segments of product and software. I wasn't sure I totally understood the backlog question you asked, but I would simply say that it's up -- first of all, it was up in 3 or 4 regions, and it was up in product and services, and it was up year-over-year and sequentially. And aged backlog was up very nicely. And the aged backlog increase, in combination with improved process that I talked about earlier, gives us higher confidence in the visibility, in hitting the growth targets that we outlined for top and bottom line guidance."

It's a combination of improving the product portfolio, better execution, new management, particularly in EMEA. Viv Francis has done a fantastic job there. And we -- I just think that the team is executing well. The portfolio is stronger than it was a year ago. And I think it's a good opportunity for us. It was a little spotty historically on execution. And historically, we had a product gap or 2 on the very low end. I think Bruce Brda's team on portfolio and Molloy's team on sales coverage and execution have done some significant things to solidify that business since its history in the last year or so."

I should just say that I think that we've done a much better job in the rhythm of meeting or beating expectations, and that's for a whole host of reasons. But I think it's important just to mention the thought that, that remains front and center on us taking forecasting very seriously and all of us individually, collectively, having every expectation to deliver on the commitments that we've outlined. That said as context, things in the unknown in '17, you can never predict FX. We've certainly seen that. In 2016, we had Brexit that I don't think a lot of people predicted in June, July, but we were still able to hit guidance, both right exactly in the midpoint of revenue for '16 and overachieved at the high end of EPS. And I think that's a credit to Gino and the finance team as the way they kind of baked in the volatility or potential variability of Airwave in fiscal 2016. But Paul, for sure, one of the unknowns is FX. I think that, that's really the one that comes to mind, top of mind. I think you get into, could there be an economic downturn or a trade war, maybe. But again, 65% of our revenue is North America. And when I look at -- let's take Mexico and China, since they are the most talked about. China is 3% of our business and we're forecasting it to be flat to slightly down. Mexico is less than 1% of our business. So despite all of the chatter politically between the U.S. and Mexico, the fact of the matter is our business is very small there. If anything, I think there's opportunity there for us. So I think the answer to your question, the best thing is FX is the biggest wildcard and economic volatility associated with a trade war would be the other one."

I'd like to share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q4 was an outstanding quarter, capping a very solid year. For the quarter, we grew revenue by 12%, including 4% organically. Additionally, we grew revenue in every region. Our Products segment revenue grew 9%, led by continuing strength in North America and reflecting the durability of our core LMR business. Second, 2016 was a pivotal year for us as we returned to growth. We strengthened our competitive position and grew revenues 6% while ending the year with a record backlog position. And our Services segment grew 18% to $2.4 billion, with Services now comprising 40% of our business. And lastly, I'm very confident in our position going forward. Since the split 6 years ago, MSI's annual total shareholder return has averaged over 20% a year. We've strengthened our product portfolio, dramatically reduced our cost profile, normalized the balance sheet, reduced our share count by 52%, refreshed our board and senior leadership team and completed 4 key software- and services-based acquisitions just this past year. So with that baseline, I believe we're set up well for success going forward. As I think about 2017 and beyond, we remain fully committed to revenue growth, earnings growth and continued cash flow improvement.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Q4 results include revenue of $1.9 billion, up 12% from last year, including Airwave revenue of $124 million. The strong results were driven by growth in every region, 9% growth in Products and 18% growth in Services. GAAP operating earnings were $403 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $541 million or 29% of sales, representing an improvement of 150 basis points from the year-ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.43 compared to $1.56 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.03 a share, up $1.58 -- up from $1.58 in the year-ago quarter, a 28% year-over-year increase. Ending backlog is up $1.9 billion from last year and $234 million sequentially. The $1.9 billion increase versus last year was driven by $1.25 billion from Airwave, $300 million from organic Managed and Support Services and $300 million from Products. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
For the full year, revenue grew 6%, including $462 million of Airwave revenue. Revenue excluding Airwave declined 2% on weakness in Latin America and parts of Europe in the first half, while both North America and Asia Pac grew for the full year. Managed and Support Services grew 49% in the full year and 5% excluding Airwave. Operating earnings were $1.4 billion, up $261 million or 22% compared to the previous year. Earnings per share grew 48% to $4.92. Free cash flow was $894 million, up $48 million.
Moving to the Products segment. Q4 Products sales were $1.23 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by growth in every region. Q4 Products operating income was $407 million or 33% of sales, up 300 basis points from last year driven by higher sales. Products backlog ended the quarter at $1.5 billion, up approximately $300 million from last year, primarily on continued strength in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $102 million, also driven by strong order volume in North America.
Q4 Services revenue was $657 million, up 18%, including $124 million of Airwave. Excluding Airwave, Managed and Support Services grew 5%. Services operating income was $134 million or 20% of revenue. Operating margins were down year-on-year due to higher integration costs associated with the completion of the Norway implementation phase as well as higher incentive costs for the 2016 backlog performance. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $1.6 billion from last year. Of the $1.6 billion increase, Airwave was $1.25 billion and organic Managed and Support Services was up $300 million, driven primarily by North America. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $133 million driven by North America and Latin America, and it includes a $215 million adjustment, primarily due to the British pound.
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx in Q4 was $408 million, up $22 million from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by M&A expenses and higher incentives associated with our 2016 record backlog performance. It's important to note that from a run rate perspective, we achieved our 2016 targets and remain on track for structural reductions to OpEx. For the year, we reduced operating expenses by approximately $80 million. Other income and expense in Q4 was $41 million compared to $51 million in the year-ago quarter. The Q4 effective tax rate was 31%. And for the full year 2016, the effective tax rate was also 31%.
Moving to cash and capital allocation. Q4 operating cash flow was $513 million, an increase of $98 million from last year, driven by higher revenue and EBITDA. Free cash flow was $453 million, up $82 million. We ended Q4 in a net debt position of $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $114 million of stock, paid out $68 million in dividends and repaid the term loan related to the Airwave acquisition. We also invested $246 million in software solutions with the acquisitions of Spillman Technologies, Gridstone and Cyfas. Capital return for 2016 was $2.4 billion. This is comprised of acquisitions of $1.3 billion, share buybacks of $842 million at an average price of $70.28, and dividends of $280 million.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales growth of 3% to 5% and EPS between $0.52 and $0.57. This outlook reflects approximately $50 million of incremental Airwave revenue versus the year-ago quarter and an average diluted share count of approximately 170 million shares, and it's based on current FX rates.
For the full year 2017, we expect revenue growth of 1% to 2% and EPS of $5.05 to $5.20. We expect operating cash flow to grow by approximately $50 million to $1,225,000,000 and free cash flow to be approximately $950 million. This outlook is based on current foreign exchange rates and assumes Airwave revenue to be approximately flat from the prior year due entirely to currency.
Moving to regional results. North America grew 3% in Q4 and 2% for the full year with approximately equal growth in both Products and Services. Backlog is up significantly in both Products and Services year-over-year and sequentially. Latin America revenue grew 21% in Q4, driven by Products. For the year, Latin America declined 20% on macroeconomic headwinds in the first half as well as expected iDEN declines. Ending backlog is up double digits both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by large projects in Q4. EMEA grew 45% in Q4 inclusive of Airwave and was up 1% organically. For the year, EMEA grew 33% including Airwave. Excluding Airwave, EMEA declined 15%, driven primarily by approximately $100 million of lower Norway revenue associated with the completion of the implementation phase of the nationwide contract. Asia Pac revenue grew 15% for the quarter and 3% for the year, driven by the Products segment.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights. The Products segment strong results reflect our continued focus on innovation, cost efficiency and execution. A few examples of this innovation and investment include: targeted acquisitions including Spillman Technologies and Gridstone, which strengthened our software offerings for public safety; the release of new P25 and TETRA devices that provide advanced features and functionality, including Bluetooth 4.0, WiFi and enhanced location services that enable future software and services opportunities.
Norway and Sweden conducted their first major cross-border emergency response exercise supported by our software that enables fully interoperable multi-vendor radio communications. This land mobile radio cross-border collaboration is spurring additional interest from neighboring countries and illustrates the power of our LMR communications platform.
I also want to mention some notable wins: a $140 million P25 system deployment for the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority, enabling seamless communication both above and below ground; $60 million to upgrade and maintain the citywide P25 system for the metro area of San Francisco; and $40 million to upgrade a P25 system that expands coverage and enables interoperable communications unifying 8 cities in Argentina.
In the Services segment, we continue to grow our Managed and Support Services business around the world. Q4 multiyear service awards include wins in Texas, South Carolina, California, the United Kingdom, Argentina, China and Latvia. Deals such as these help drive our Services backlog growth of nearly $300 million or 7% excluding Airwave. We expect our momentum in the Managed and Support Services business to continue as our customers choose Motorola expertise to help them navigate their fast-changing technology options at a predictable cost.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me just close with a few brief thoughts. 2016 was a strong year of execution and growth, especially considering the macroeconomic headwinds in Latin America and parts of Europe earlier in the year. For a little additional perspective, it's worth noting that North America grew each of the past 2 years and 6 of the last 8 quarters. Asia Pac grew the past 2 years and EMEA returned to growth this year as well, all of which, I think, confirms the durability and longevity of our LMR platform. So while I'm pleased with our results, we'll continue to drive the business for improved operating leverage and revenue growth in 2017, and I expect our record backlog position entering this year to support our growth going forward.

You correctly articulated that it incorporates a few things, right? So iDEN is a negative headwind of $50 million. There is an order for about -- ESN for about $25 million that with the delay of ESN gets pushed out of 2017. And the third dimension is Airwave. Now Airwave is flat, contemplated in this guidance at about $460 million in '17. As a footnote, Pierre, if we were operating with the pound at the rate when we closed Airwave of just under a year ago, that would yield $80 million -- would have yielded $80 million of additional top line revenue this year in 2017. So that's kind of to chalk the field on the puts and takes in 2017. We do believe organic growth will continue in 2017. And we do believe we'll grow in both Products and the Services segments, which is assumed in the overall 1% to 2% envelope for 2017. For Q1, 2 points to make, right? So we look at Q1 and we look at Q4 more or less together. So when we look -- when Gino and I and Jack and Bruce, we look at Q4 and Q1 and combine those 2 quarters, from a revenue and actually an EPS perspective, it's at or above where we thought it would be coming into Q4. So we had an exceptionally strong Q4 both on top and bottom, so I wouldn't necessarily get concerned about the linearity or the dimensions between the flow between the quarters. The other note, Pierre, is on Q1 EPS. We have a higher tax rate and we have higher interest expense in Q1. Those 2 items are worth about $0.08. So that should give you some other ingredients to help think about and dimensionalize the overall performance in Q4, Q1 in fiscal year 2017."

By the way, that's inclusive of about $40 million of acquisitions made. So overall, I'm very pleased with OpEx. On a run rate performance, the management team hit the targets they committed to me, and we will reduce OpEx in 2017 over '16 again, and that's absorbing $40 million of acquisitions."

Corporate tax reform reduction is obviously -- the prospects of that is positive. And the notion of less red tape and less regulation also is positive, but those 2 things apply to all businesses. I think what's unique to us with this administration is it appears that they have a strong priority around law enforcement and security, and I think those themes and trends could prove to be favorable to us, we'll see, supporting us going forward. Obviously, it's very early. There's other things around trade, immigration. You know that 2/3 of our revenue is North America. If we take examples of China, which gets a lot of news and noise, China is about 3% of our overall revenue now. It was down over 20% last year. This year, we're contemplating it to be flat to down. And the management of our business there, even though it's a significant opportunity, we thought about it in the context of the guidance we've provided you. So I think we have it sized pretty well and I'm cautiously optimistic about some of the opportunities that we may be presented with."

And within that, if you can also help us understand in your installed base, is it a matter of the fleet of products that your customers have that's getting old, that's driving some of the end-of-life product revenue? And then the final piece of that product question would be, I just want to better understand the software elements of product.

But we talked about the services, which includes installation services, is 40% of our business for 2016. So when you add software in of a few hundred million, it takes it to about 43%. That's a 2016 view. I think there's a number of things that are driving demand for our business. Some of it is age of the technology and we refresh it, but a lot of it is upgrading it in current releases, it's the need for newer, digitally, more spectrally efficient radios with more feature functionality. Public safety has always remained high in the value chain of mission-critical communications, particularly in developed countries, certainly in North America. I think that continues to -- it continues to be a strong component of overall demand. Things around border security, immigration, lone-wolf terrorism in other parts of the country all lend itself to the need for mission-critical, encrypted, secure, end-to-end, reliable, redundant, always-on communications. Very different than a smartphone, very different than a cellular network. And in these times, I think there are a variety of things that remind people and reinforce the need to invest in land mobile radio. I think each time we put in a system, we see, Stanley, many customers still buying 10- and 15-year maintenance contracts on these systems and platforms that are going in. So in addition to that, the more systems that are in, people think about monetizing and upgrading from a services contract and adding other software to it. So there's a lot of different factors. It depends by region, but there's a number of drivers from a demand standpoint that I think reflected very favorably in Q4 and reflect the fact that we continue organically that this business will grow in 2017, by the way, in both segments of product and software. I wasn't sure I totally understood the backlog question you asked, but I would simply say that it's up -- first of all, it was up in 3 or 4 regions, and it was up in product and services, and it was up year-over-year and sequentially. And aged backlog was up very nicely. And the aged backlog increase, in combination with improved process that I talked about earlier, gives us higher confidence in the visibility, in hitting the growth targets that we outlined for top and bottom line guidance."

It's the best quarter I've seen in the PCR, the professional and commercial radio business, in several quarters. It's a combination of improving the product portfolio, better execution, new management, particularly in EMEA. Viv Francis has done a fantastic job there. And we -- I just think that the team is executing well. The portfolio is stronger than it was a year ago. And I think it's a good opportunity for us. It was a little spotty historically on execution. And historically, we had a product gap or 2 on the very low end. I think Bruce Brda's team on portfolio and Molloy's team on sales coverage and execution have done some significant things to solidify that business since its history in the last year or so."

I should just say that I think that we've done a much better job in the rhythm of meeting or beating expectations, and that's for a whole host of reasons. But I think it's important just to mention the thought that, that remains front and center on us taking forecasting very seriously and all of us individually, collectively, having every expectation to deliver on the commitments that we've outlined. That said as context, things in the unknown in '17, you can never predict FX. We've certainly seen that. In 2016, we had Brexit that I don't think a lot of people predicted in June, July, but we were still able to hit guidance, both right exactly in the midpoint of revenue for '16 and overachieved at the high end of EPS. And I think that's a credit to Gino and the finance team as the way they kind of baked in the volatility or potential variability of Airwave in fiscal 2016. But Paul, for sure, one of the unknowns is FX. I think that, that's really the one that comes to mind, top of mind. I think you get into, could there be an economic downturn or a trade war, maybe. But again, 65% of our revenue is North America. And when I look at -- let's take Mexico and China, since they are the most talked about. China is 3% of our business and we're forecasting it to be flat to slightly down. Mexico is less than 1% of our business. So despite all of the chatter politically between the U.S. and Mexico, the fact of the matter is our business is very small there. If anything, I think there's opportunity there for us. So I think the answer to your question, the best thing is FX is the biggest wildcard and economic volatility associated with a trade war would be the other one."

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. Look, first, Q1 was a strong quarter and an excellent start to the year. We grew revenue 7%, ended the quarter with record backlog. We significantly expanded operating margins. We grew earnings and we generated much higher cash flow. 
Second, I'm very pleased with our continued progress in services. Our operational execution was strong, the Services segment growing double digits this quarter including acquisitions, and we also acquired Interexport in Chile, adding a valuable Managed Services hub in Latin America. From software perspective, we announced the planned acquisition of Kodiak Networks and hired Andrew Sinclair, a seasoned software executive, to lead our software efforts. Acquiring the Interexport and Kodiak assets demonstrate our continued commitment towards more recurring software and services revenue. 
And finally, we're thrilled to be part of the winning FirstNet team with AT&T. Our investments and innovation in public safety LTE include offerings of mobile applications, services, critically important LMR and LTE interoperability as well as next-generation devices. This FirstNet opportunity further validates our competitive position for both LMR and Public Safety LTE going forward. I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

GAAP operating earnings of $176 million, up 76% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $224 million or 17.5% of sales, an increase of 360 basis points from the year-ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.45 compared to $0.10 in the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 versus $0.52 in the year-ago quarter, a 37% year-over-year increase. Ending backlog is up $129 million from last year. Product backlog is up $285 million. Services backlog is down $156 million driven by a $650 million reduction of Airwave backlog over the past 12 months. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
Q1 product sales were $703 million, up $1 million from last year. Q1 Products segment operating income was $101 million or 14.4% of sales, up 240 basis points from last year, driven by improved gross margin and lower OpEx. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, an increase of 22% or $285 million from last year, driven by North America. Sequentially, product backlog increased $38 million, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth. 
Q1 Services revenue was $578 million, up 18%. Excluding Airwave, Managed and Support Services grew 8%. Services operating income was $123 million, up $41 million from the prior year. Operating margins were 21.3%, an increase of 470 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, down $156 million from last year, driven by $650 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $61 million driven primarily by the acquisition of Interexport. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx was $352 million, a decrease of $3 million from the year-ago quarter. Q1 2017 included an incremental $10 million of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $59 million compared to $42 million last year. Net interest expense was $51 million compared to $49 million a year ago. The Q1 effective tax rate was 26%. 
Q1 operating cash flow was $142 million, an increase of $129 million driven by higher earnings and a $52 million legal settlements. Free cash flow was $74 million, an increase of $112 million from last year. We ended Q1 with cash of $829 million and net debt of $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $178 million of stock at an average price of $80.82, paid $77 million of dividends and invested $55 million of cash in acquisitions. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up 2% to 3% including approximately $25 million of FX headwind primarily driven by the British pound. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS between $0.98 and $1.03 including $0.05 of Airwave currency headwinds. Inclusive of Q1 results, the first half of 2017 is slightly above our prior expectations. We now expect full year 2017 sales to be at the high end of our prior range at approximately 2% and we are raising non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.08 to $5.23. 
Looking at regional results. Americas' revenue grew 3%, driven by strong demand for services in both North America and Latin America. Backlog is up in both Products and Services versus last year and up sequentially as customers continue to invest in LMR systems. EMEA revenue increased 27% including $58 million of incremental Airwave revenue for the full quarter. Excluding Airwave, EMEA was up 2% with growth in both Products and Services. Asia Pac was flat versus last year with Australia continuing to be an area of strength for some of our most advanced public safety solutions. 
Finally I'll end with some notable segment highlights. In our Products segment, we launched WAVE OnCloud, a new subscription-based SaaS version of our wave solution. That makes it simple to deploy, maintain and improve workgroup communications. WAVE OnCloud customers can integrate their radio systems with broadband networks, extending their reach to mobile users across various devices and networks. 
Additionally, we announced the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, a leading provider of broadband push-to-talk for commercial customers which adds a carrier-integrated push-to-talk solution for mobile operators around the world. We also won several notable deals that included an $80 million award from a country in Europe to upgrade and manage its nationwide TETRA network, a $34 million award to upgrade an existing P25 network in Northern California and 2 P25 wins in Argentina totaling $10 million. 
In our Services segment, we acquired Interexport, a provider of managed services for communication systems to publicly safety and commercial users in Chile. Similar to our Airwave business, Interexport helps us deliver on our strategy to drive growth in our Managed and Support Services business. We also grew double digits in our command center software business driven by the demand for our Spillman, Emergency CallWorks and PremierOne solutions. 
Finally, building on our Managed Services business in Australia, we signed a significant multi-year managed services contract with the Victoria Police. This contract will allow us to administer a full spectrum of solutions including hardware, software and purpose-built applications on multiple networks. I now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

It's a data and video network for interoperable broadband that will interface with our narrowband mission-critical communications voice network. I think the big differences between a private network and a cellular network are things around coverage and capacity, cost and coverage. There's hardened encryption. There's so many different things that go into making a private, always on, reliable, secure, purpose-built network along with the devices that are very unique for the value proposition of public safety versus a FirstNet or a cellular type network. I think on devices, I see a scenario where people will wear 2 devices on their belt, a mission-critical communications radio and a next-generation device. We're well positioned to do that. To the extent, to your point, that may evolve over time because today every first responder in the U.S. or just about everyone, police officer, and add 2 devices today. They have a radio for mission-critical communications voice; and they have a smartphone over a carrier network that provisions 4G broadband today. We see that scenario replicating, in which case, that second new device is greenfield opportunity for us. If those devices merge over time and at some point in the future, we're better positioned than anybody given the domain expertise, the latency and the demand requirements around public safety to provide the integrated device. But if that happens, I see that as a long way off. So FirstNet we see as purely incremental too."

I would say, first of all, as he said, it's comparable to 2016, but there are some things that we're hearing from our sales team that could be beneficial. Namely, the supplemental budgets that's in play right now includes additional funding for both border security and defense. So as we think about those from a demand driver, we think that could be beneficial here as we work our way through 2017. From a state and local perspective, Brian, we've been really pleased with the performance. Really going back to 2015, the performance has been strong, state and local budgets, particularly as they apply to public safety, and that's important because there's a stickiness to public safety funding given the cirme patterns that we see throughout the U.S. right now. They remain solid. Spoke to you earlier, devices, it remains solid as well as infrastructure. And I think the important thing in there is infrastructure as well as the Managed and Support Services that those sales drive. So that's also been good. The third element, and we've made -- Greg made reference to it last quarter, is the commercial markets. So we've increased our hiring of sales headcount effective really the middle of early 2015 and that's starting to obviously yield dividends for us in terms of -- and think about that in terms of the utility marketplace, oil and gas marketplace. And most recently, we've made incremental hires in terms of transportation logistics and manufacturing, and we've seen both of those markets in the U.S. start to yield PCR like system sales for us.

It's not unlike that they have funding to buy Ford Explorers or anything different. Now if you take a side piece of that, over the last really -- we've seen really over the course of the last 5 to 6 maybe 10 years, we've seen funding that's actually gone to fund the operational expense of data devices, and that's really the funding that will start to come in play. And by the way, it hasn't been just AT&T. So really AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and, to a smaller extent, T-Mobile, have really competed for that operational expense budget, the cellphone type data devices. Historically, it's been Blackberries now moving to more iPhone, Android type devices. That budget's resonant today.

First of all, push-to-talk over cellular has been around for a long time and you can even go back at 2 decades with Nextel. But with LTE-based service, the capacity has been out there in the network for 4, 5, 6 years with most carriers. There are a number of issues that with respect to the standards that need to continue to be enhanced to provide true mission-critical support for public safety. One that I would point out is direct mode operation. In most public safety environments incident scene, public safety will often switch to a direct mode operation. That doesn't exist in the public -- in the LTE standards today. So as one example, that would need to be solved and that needs to go through standards and then ripple through the ecosystem being built into chips, being built into products and then deployed into the market. So there's quite a long process that needs to take place before you could ever get to true mission-critical public safety great LTE for push-to-talk services."

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. Look, first, Q1 was a strong quarter and an excellent start to the year. We grew revenue 7%, ended the quarter with record backlog. We significantly expanded operating margins. We grew earnings and we generated much higher cash flow. 
Second, I'm very pleased with our continued progress in services. Our operational execution was strong, the Services segment growing double digits this quarter including acquisitions, and we also acquired Interexport in Chile, adding a valuable Managed Services hub in Latin America. From a software perspective, we announced the planned acquisition of Kodiak Networks and hired Andrew Sinclair, a seasoned software executive, to lead our software efforts. Acquiring the Interexport and Kodiak assets demonstrate our continued commitment towards more recurring software and services revenue. 
And finally, we're thrilled to be part of the winning FirstNet team with AT&T. Our investments in innovation and public safety LTE include offerings of mobile applications, services, critically important LMR and LTE interoperability as well as next-generation devices. This FirstNet opportunity further validates our competitive position for both LMR and public safety LTE going forward. I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

GAAP operating earnings of $176 million, up 76% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $224 million or 17.5% of sales, an increase of 360 basis points from the year ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.45 compared to $0.10 in the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 versus $0.52 in the year ago quarter, a 37% year-over-year increase. Ending backlog is up $129 million from last year. Product backlog is up $285 million. Services backlog is down $156 million driven by a $650 million reduction of Airwave backlog over the past 12 months. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
Q1 product sales were $703 million, up $1 million from last year. Q1 Products segment operating income was $101 million or 14.4% of sales, up 240 basis points from last year, driven by improved gross margin and lower OpEx. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, an increase of 22% or $285 million from last year, driven by North America. Sequentially, product backlog increased $38 million, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth. 
Q1 Services revenue was $578 million, up 18%. Excluding Airwave, Managed and Support Services grew 8%. Services operating income was $123 million, up $41 million from the prior year. Operating margins were 21.3%, an increase of 470 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, down $156 million from last year, driven by $650 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $61 million driven primarily by the acquisition of Interexport. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx was $352 million, a decrease of $3 million from the year ago quarter. Q1 2017 included an incremental $10 million of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $59 million compared to $42 million last year. Net interest expense was $51 million compared to $49 million a year ago. The Q1 effective tax rate was 26%. 
Q1 operating cash flow was $142 million, an increase of $129 million driven by higher earnings and a $52 million legal settlement. Free cash flow was $74 million, an increase of $112 million from last year. We ended Q1 with cash of $829 million and net debt of $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $178 million of stock at an average price of $80.82, paid $77 million of dividends and invested $55 million of cash in acquisitions. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up 2% to 3% including approximately $25 million of FX headwind primarily driven by the British pound. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS between $0.98 and $1.03 including $0.05 of Airwave currency headwinds. Inclusive of Q1 results, the first half of 2017 is slightly above our prior expectations. We now expect full year 2017 sales to be at the high end of our prior range at approximately 2% and we are raising non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.08 to $5.23. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue grew 3%, driven by strong demand for services in both North America and Latin America. Backlog is up in both Products and Services versus last year and up sequentially as customers continue to invest in LMR systems. EMEA revenue increased 27% including $58 million of incremental Airwave revenue for the full quarter. Excluding Airwave, EMEA was up 2% with growth in both Products and Services. Asia Pac was flat versus last year with Australia continuing to be an area of strength for some of our most advanced public safety solutions. 
Finally I'll end with some notable segment highlights. In our Products segment, we launched WAVE OnCloud, a new subscription-based SaaS version of our WAVE solution that makes it simple to deploy, maintain and improve workgroup communications. WAVE OnCloud customers can integrate their radio systems with broadband networks, extending their reach to mobile users across various devices and networks. 
Additionally, we announced the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, a leading provider of broadband push-to-talk for commercial customers which adds a carrier-integrated push-to-talk solution for mobile operators around the world. We also won several notable deals that included: $80 million award from a country in Europe to upgrade and manage its nationwide TETRA network; a $34 million award to upgrade an existing P25 network in Northern California; and 2 P25 wins in Argentina totaling $10 million. 
In our Services segment, we acquired Interexport, a provider of managed services for communication systems to public safety and commercial users in Chile. Similar to our Airwave business, Interexport helps us deliver on our strategy to drive growth in our Managed and Support Services business. We also grew double digits in our command center software business driven by the demand for our Spillman, Emergency CallWorks and PremierOne solutions. 
Finally, building on our Managed Services business in Australia, we signed a significant multi-year managed services contract with the Victoria Police. This contract will allow us to administer a full spectrum of solutions including hardware, software and purpose-built applications on multiple networks. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

We're excited because this opportunity is all incremental to our core business. When we look at what it could include, it could include software and mobile applications. It could include Services. I think the most critical piece will be the interoperability with the FirstNet network to interconnect and interoperate with our installed base of land mobile radio systems throughout the U.S. and it could include next-generation devices.

It's a data and video network for interoperable broadband that will interface with our narrowband mission-critical communications voice network. I think the big differences between a private network and a cellular network are things around coverage and capacity, cost and coverage. There's hardened encryption. There's so many different things that go into making a private, always on, reliable, secure, purpose-built network along with the devices that are very unique for the value proposition of public safety versus a FirstNet or a cellular type network. I think on devices, I see a scenario where people will wear 2 devices on their belt, a mission-critical communications radio and a next-generation device. We're well positioned to do that. To the extent, to your point, that may evolve over time because today every first responder in the U.S. or just about everyone, police officer  [ unhands ] 2 devices today. They have a radio for mission-critical communications voice, and they have a smartphone over a carrier network that provisions 4G broadband today. We see that scenario replicating, in which case, that second new device is greenfield opportunity for us. If those devices merge over time and at some point in the future, we're better positioned than anybody given the domain expertise, the latency and the demand requirements around public safety to provide the integrated device. But if that happens, I see that as a long way off. So FirstNet we see as purely incremental, too."

We continue to march forward with the prioritization around Software and Services as we've talked about, command center software, Managed and Support Services, things and areas that reinforce our platform and solution orientation. Our capital allocation framework hasn't changed. So I think we talked about $600 million for the full year being fungible and available for either share repurchase or M&A that we found attractive or accretive. I don't think that's changed. We did purchase 177 million of shares, 178 million of shares in Q1 at a price of 80 82 because we thought that was the sound use of capital. So I think, we continually think, in terms of capital return to the shareholder as well as M&A and we'll look to optimize that every quarter going forward."

I think it's steady as she goes, and we have to evaluate all the activities and what ultimately happens and gets decided between now and the end of the year, how that maps into activity for '18. In terms of visibility, our aged backlog is higher at this point for the balance of the year than it was a year ago. I think that we've got pretty good visibility of the business. We work with a 6-quarter rolling forecast with Jack Molloy and all the field general managers. As it relates to demand in the U.S., the Americas in Q1 grew 3%. North America was 2% of that. If you were to dimensionalize the U.S. federal business as a segment within North America, we expect it to be comparable this year over last year about $500 million, but I think the business is performing in a more balanced way, and we grew in every region in Q1. Asia Pac was flat but we have growth in the others and it is conceivable all feeders can grow for the balance of '17. So it's more balanced, and that's embedded in the guidance we provided."

I think we'll start with just to kind of reiterate Greg just talked about, first of all, start with the federal government. I would say, first of all, as he said, it's comparable to 2016, but there are some things that we're hearing from our sales team that could be beneficial. Namely, the supplemental budgets that's in play right now includes additional funding for both border security and defense. So as we think about those from a demand driver, we think that could be beneficial here as we work our way through 2017. From a state and local perspective, Brian, we've been really pleased with the performance. Really going back to 2015, the performance has been strong, state and local budgets, particularly as they apply to public safety, and that's important because there's a stickiness to public safety funding given the crime patterns that we see throughout the U.S. right now. They remain solid. Spoke to it earlier, device business remains solid as well as infrastructure. And I think the important thing there is infrastructure as well as the Managed and Support Service that those sales drive. So that's also been good. The third element, and we've made -- Greg made reference to it last quarter, is the commercial markets. So we've increased our hiring of sales headcount effective, really, the middle of -- early 2015 and that's starting to obviously yield dividends for us in terms of -- and think about that in terms of the utility marketplace, oil and gas marketplace. And most recently, we've made incremental hires in terms of transportation logistics and manufacturing, and we've seen both of those markets in the U.S. start to yield PCR like system sales force. So all in, if we think about those 3 elements in North America, the demand drivers look very positive for us."

So first of all, when you think about state and local budgets, and that's really what we're talking about as we start to look to FirstNet, there's 2 separate funding budgets actually. Typically with state and local with the systems and the devices, those are public safety operational budgets that would be kind of more deemed to be traditionally CapEx budgets, meaning every year they've got a certain amount that they buy radios with. It's not unlike that they have funding to buy Ford Explorers or anything different. Now if you take a side piece of that, over the last really -- we've seen really over the course of the last 5 to 6 maybe 10 years, we've seen funding that's actually gone to fund the operational expense of data devices, and that's really the funding that will start to come in play. And by the way, it hasn't been just AT&T. So really AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and to a smaller extent, T-Mobile, have really competed for that operational expense budget, the cellphone type data devices. Historically, it's been Blackberries now moving to more iPhone, Android type devices. That budget's resonant today. So I think that budget will be what people look to move on in terms of FirstNet and getting data subscribers."

But with LTE-based service, the capacity has been out there in the network for 4, 5, 6 years with most carriers. There are a number of issues that, with respect to the standards, that need to continue to be enhanced to provide true mission-critical support for public safety. One that I would point out is direct mode operation. In most public safety environments incident scene, public safety will often switch to a direct mode operation. That doesn't exist in the public -- in the LTE standards today. So as one example, that would need to be solved and that needs to go through standards and then ripple through the ecosystem being built into chips, being built into products and then deployed into the market.

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. Look, first, Q1 was a strong quarter and an excellent start to the year. We grew revenue 7%, ended the quarter with record backlog. We significantly expanded operating margins. We grew earnings and we generated much higher cash flow. 
Second, I'm very pleased with our continued progress in Services. Our operational execution was strong, the Services segment growing double digits this quarter including acquisitions, and we also acquired Interexport in Chile, adding a valuable Managed Services hub in Latin America. From a software perspective, we announced the planned acquisition of Kodiak Networks and hired Andrew Sinclair, a seasoned software executive, to lead our software efforts. Acquiring the Interexport and Kodiak assets demonstrate our continued commitment towards more recurring Software and Services revenue. 
And finally, we're thrilled to be part of the winning FirstNet team with AT&T. Our investments in innovation and public safety LTE include offerings of mobile applications, services, critically important LMR and LTE interoperability as well as next-generation devices. This FirstNet opportunity further validates our competitive position for both LMR and public safety LTE going forward. I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Q1 results include revenue of $1.3 billion, up 7% from last year. Excluding Airwave, revenue grew 3%. GAAP operating earnings of $176 million, up 76% from last year.

GAAP operating earnings of $176 million, up 76% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $224 million or 17.5% of sales, an increase of 360 basis points from the year ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.45 compared to $0.10 in the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 versus $0.52 in the year ago quarter, a 37% year-over-year increase. Ending backlog is up $129 million from last year. Products backlog is up $285 million. Services backlog is down $156 million, driven by a $650 million reduction of Airwave backlog over the past 12 months. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
Q1 product sales were $703 million, up $1 million from last year. Q1 Products segment operating income was $101 million or 14.4% of sales, up 240 basis points from last year, driven by improved gross margin and lower OpEx. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, an increase of 22% or $285 million from last year, driven by North America. Sequentially, Products backlog increased $38 million, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth. 
Q1 Services revenue was $578 million, up 18%. Excluding Airwave, Managed and Support Services grew 8%. Services operating income was $123 million, up $41 million from the prior year. Operating margins were 21.3%, an increase of 470 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, down $156 million from last year, driven by $650 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $61 million, driven primarily by the acquisition of Interexport. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx was $352 million, a decrease of $3 million from the year ago quarter. Q1 2017 included an incremental $10 million of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $59 million compared to $42 million last year. Net interest expense was $51 million compared to $49 million a year ago. The Q1 effective tax rate was 26%. 
Q1 operating cash flow was $142 million, an increase of $129 million, driven by higher earnings and a $52 million legal settlement. Free cash flow was $74 million, an increase of $112 million from last year. We ended Q1 with cash of $829 million and net debt of $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $178 million of stock at an average price of $80.82, paid $77 million of dividends and invested $55 million of cash in acquisitions. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up 2% to 3% including approximately $25 million of FX headwind, primarily driven by the British pound. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS between $0.98 and $1.03 including $0.05 of Airwave currency headwinds. Inclusive of Q1 results, the first half of 2017 is slightly above our prior expectations. We now expect full year 2017 sales to be at the high end of our prior range at approximately 2% and we are raising non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.08 to $5.23. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue grew 3%, driven by strong demand for services in both North America and Latin America. Backlog is up in both Products and Services versus last year and up sequentially, as customers continue to invest in LMR systems. EMEA revenue increased 27% including $58 million of incremental Airwave revenue for the full quarter. Excluding Airwave, EMEA was up 2% with growth in both Products and Services. Asia Pac was flat versus last year, with Australia continuing to be an area of strength for some of our most advanced public safety solutions. 
Finally I'll end with some notable segment highlights. In our Products segment, we launched WAVE OnCloud, a new subscription-based SaaS version of our WAVE solution that makes it simple to deploy, maintain and improve workgroup communications. WAVE OnCloud customers can integrate their radio systems with broadband networks, extending their reach to mobile users across various devices and networks. 
Additionally, we announced the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, a leading provider of broadband push-to-talk for commercial customers, which adds a carrier-integrated push-to-talk solution for mobile operators around the world. We also won several notable deals that included: $80 million award from a country in Europe to upgrade and manage its nationwide TETRA network; a $34 million award to upgrade an existing P25 network in Northern California; and 2 P25 wins in Argentina totaling $10 million. 
In our Services segment, we acquired Interexport, a provider of managed services for communication systems to public safety and commercial users in Chile. Similar to our Airwave business, Interexport helps us deliver on our strategy to drive growth in our Managed and Support Services business. We also grew double digits in our command center software business, driven by the demand for our Spillman, Emergency CallWorks and PremierOne solutions. 
Finally, building on our Managed Services business in Australia, we signed a significant multi-year managed services contract with the Victoria Police. This contract will allow us to administer a full spectrum of solutions including hardware, software and purpose-built applications on multiple networks. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Second, I'm especially pleased with our public safety LTE position going forward. In addition to being part of the FirstNet award, we've also won all 4 of the largest global public safety LTE awards to date. Our commitment and investment to public safety has positioned us well. 
And in closing, I'm very pleased with our Q1 performance. I like the strength of our competitive position and I'm encouraged by our momentum going forward. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris."

I think, Pierre, embedded to your question is both Software and Services and our push toward more recurring revenues in both Software and Services. Exiting last year, the recurring revenues in Software and Services were slightly higher than 25%. It would be our desire to finish this year with something north of that. I think you see us continuing to march forward on purposeful software acquisitions, whether it be in the command center, with Software as a Service with Spillman and Emergency CallWorks or whether it's on the Managed Services side, both with Airwave a year ago and now Interexport in Chile.

I think on devices, I see a scenario where people will wear 2 devices on their belt, a mission-critical communications radio and a next-generation device. We're well-positioned to do that. To the extent, to your point, that may evolve over time, because today every first responder in the U.S. or just about every one, police officer, and they have 2 devices today. They have a radio for mission-critical communications voice, and they have a smartphone over a carrier network that provisions 4G broadband today. We see that scenario replicating, in which case, that second new device is greenfield opportunity for us. If those devices merge over time and at some point in the future, we're better positioned than anybody, given the domain expertise, the latency and the demand requirements around public safety, to provide the integrated device. But if that happens, I see that as a long way off. So FirstNet we see as purely incremental, too."

I would say, first of all, as he said, it's comparable to 2016, but there are some things that we're hearing from our sales team that could be beneficial. Namely, the supplemental budget that's in play right now includes additional funding for both border security and defense. So as we think about those from a demand driver, we think that could be beneficial here as we work our way through 2017. From a state and local perspective, Brian, we've been really pleased with the performance. Really going back to 2015, the performance has been strong, state and local budgets, particularly as they apply to public safety, and that's important because there's a stickiness to public safety funding given the crime patterns that we see throughout the U.S. right now. They remain solid. Spoke to it earlier, device business remains solid as well as infrastructure. And I think the important thing there is infrastructure as well as the Managed and Support Service, that those sales drive. So that's also been good. The third element, and we've made -- Greg made reference to it last quarter, is the commercial markets. So we've increased our hiring of sales headcount effective, really, the middle of -- early 2015 and that's starting to obviously yield dividends for us in terms of -- and think about that in terms of the utility marketplace, oil and gas marketplace. And most recently, we've made incremental hires in terms of transportation logistics and manufacturing, and we've seen both of those markets in the U.S. start to yield PCR-like system sales force. So all in, if we think about those 3 elements in North America, the demand drivers look very positive for us."

It's not unlike that they have funding to buy Ford Explorers or anything different. Now if you take a side piece of that, over the last, really -- we've seen really over the course of the last 5 to 6 maybe 10 years, we've seen funding that's actually gone to fund the operational expense of data devices, and that's really the funding that will start to come in play. And by the way, it hasn't been just AT&T. So really AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and to a smaller extent, T-Mobile, have really competed for that operational expense budget, the cellphone type data devices.

First of all, push-to-talk over cellular has been around for a long time and you can even go back 2 decades with Nextel. But with LTE-based service, the capacity has been out there in the network for 4, 5, 6 years with most carriers. There are a number of issues though, with respect to the standards, that need to continue to be enhanced to provide true mission-critical support for public safety. One that I would point out is direct mode operation. In most public safety environments, at a incident scene, public safety will often switch to a direct mode operation. That doesn't exist in the public -- in the LTE standards today. So as one example, that would need to be solved and that needs to go through standards and then ripple through the ecosystem, being built into chips, being built into products and then deployed into the market. So there's quite a long process that needs to take place before you could ever get to true mission-critical public safety-grade LTE for push-to-talk services."

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. Look, first, Q1 was a strong quarter and an excellent start to the year. We grew revenue 7%, ended the quarter with record backlog. We significantly expanded operating margins. We grew earnings and we generated much higher cash flow. 
Second, I'm very pleased with our continued progress in Services. Our operational execution was strong, the Services segment growing double digits this quarter including acquisitions, and we also acquired Interexport in Chile, adding a valuable Managed Services hub in Latin America. From a software perspective, we announced the planned acquisition of Kodiak Networks and hired Andrew Sinclair, a seasoned software executive, to lead our software efforts. Acquiring the Interexport and Kodiak assets demonstrate our continued commitment towards more recurring Software and Services revenue. 
And finally, we're thrilled to be part of the winning FirstNet team with AT&T. Our investments in innovation and public safety LTE include offerings of mobile applications, services, critically important LMR and LTE interoperability as well as next-generation devices. This FirstNet opportunity further validates our competitive position for both LMR and public safety LTE going forward. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

GAAP operating earnings of $176 million, up 76% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $224 million or 17.5% of sales, an increase of 360 basis points from the year ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.45 compared to $0.10 in the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 versus $0.52 in the year ago quarter, a 37% year-over-year increase. Ending backlog is up $129 million from last year. Products backlog is up $285 million. Services backlog is down $156 million, driven by a $650 million reduction of Airwave backlog over the past 12 months. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
Q1 product sales were $703 million, up $1 million from last year. Q1 Products segment operating income was $101 million or 14.4% of sales, up 240 basis points from last year, driven by improved gross margin and lower OpEx. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, an increase of 22% or $285 million from last year, driven by North America. Sequentially, Products backlog increased $38 million, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth. 
Q1 Services revenue was $578 million, up 18%. Excluding Airwave, Managed and Support Services grew 8%. Services operating income was $123 million, up $41 million from the prior year. Operating margins were 21.3%, an increase of 470 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, down $156 million from last year, driven by $650 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $61 million, driven primarily by the acquisition of Interexport. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx was $352 million, a decrease of $3 million from the year ago quarter. Q1 2017 included an incremental $10 million of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $59 million compared to $42 million last year. Net interest expense was $51 million compared to $49 million a year ago. The Q1 effective tax rate was 26%. 
Q1 operating cash flow was $142 million, an increase of $129 million, driven by higher earnings and a $52 million legal settlement. Free cash flow was $74 million, an increase of $112 million from last year. We ended Q1 with cash of $829 million and net debt of $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $178 million of stock at an average price of $80.82, paid $77 million of dividends and invested $55 million of cash in acquisitions. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up 2% to 3% including approximately $25 million of FX headwind, primarily driven by the British pound. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS between $0.98 and $1.03 including $0.05 of Airwave currency headwinds. Inclusive of Q1 results, the first half of 2017 is slightly above our prior expectations. We now expect full year 2017 sales to be at the high end of our prior range at approximately 2% and we are raising non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.08 to $5.23. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue grew 3%, driven by strong demand for services in both North America and Latin America. Backlog is up in both Products and Services versus last year and up sequentially, as customers continue to invest in LMR systems. EMEA revenue increased 27% including $58 million of incremental Airwave revenue for the full quarter. Excluding Airwave, EMEA was up 2% with growth in both Products and Services. Asia Pac was flat versus last year, with Australia continuing to be an area of strength for some of our most advanced public safety solutions. 
Finally I'll end with some notable segment highlights. In our Products segment, we launched WAVE OnCloud, a new subscription-based SaaS version of our WAVE solution that makes it simple to deploy, maintain and improve workgroup communications. WAVE OnCloud customers can integrate their radio systems with broadband networks, extending their reach to mobile users across various devices and networks. 
Additionally, we announced the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, a leading provider of broadband push-to-talk for commercial customers, which adds a carrier-integrated push-to-talk solution for mobile operators around the world. We also won several notable deals that included: $80 million award from a country in Europe to upgrade and manage its nationwide TETRA network; a $34 million award to upgrade an existing P25 network in Northern California; and 2 P25 wins in Argentina totaling $10 million. 
In our Services segment, we acquired Interexport, a provider of managed services for communication systems to public safety and commercial users in Chile. Similar to our Airwave business, Interexport helps us deliver on our strategy to drive growth in our Managed and Support Services business. We also grew double digits in our command center software business, driven by the demand for our Spillman, Emergency CallWorks and PremierOne solutions. 
Finally, building on our Managed Services business in Australia, we signed a significant multi-year managed services contract with the Victoria Police. This contract will allow us to administer a full spectrum of solutions including hardware, software and purpose-built applications on multiple networks. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

The other piece of news that I would highlight is Vodafone network that provides core ring connectivity between the cores within the Airwave network is being shut down at the end of Q1 2020.

It's a data and video network for interoperable broadband that will interface with our narrowband mission-critical communications voice network. I think the big differences between a private network and a cellular network are things around coverage and capacity, cost and coverage. There's hardened encryption. There's so many different things that go into making a private, always-on, reliable, secure, purpose-built network, along with the devices that are very unique for the value proposition of public safety versus a FirstNet or a cellular type network. I think on devices, I see a scenario where people will wear 2 devices on their belt, a mission-critical communications radio and a next-generation device. We're well-positioned to do that. To the extent, to your point, that may evolve over time, because today every first responder in the U.S. or just about every one, police officer, and they have 2 devices today. They have a radio for mission-critical communications voice, and they have a smartphone over a carrier network that provisions 4G broadband today. We see that scenario replicating, in which case, that second new device is greenfield opportunity for us. If those devices merge over time and at some point in the future, we're better positioned than anybody, given the domain expertise, the latency and the demand requirements around public safety, to provide the integrated device. But if that happens, I see that as a long way off. So FirstNet we see as purely incremental, too."

We continue to march forward with the prioritization around Software and Services as we've talked about, command center software, Managed and Support Services, things and areas that reinforce our platform and solution orientation. Our capital allocation framework hasn't changed. So I think we talked about $600 million for the full year being fungible and available for either share repurchase or M&A that we found attractive or accretive. I don't think that's changed. We did purchase $177 million of shares, $178 million of shares in Q1 at a price of $80.82 because we thought that was a sound use of capital.

I think it's steady as she goes, and we have to evaluate all the activities and what ultimately happens and gets decided between now and the end of the year, how that maps into activity for '18. In terms of visibility, our aged backlog is higher at this point for the balance of the year than it was a year ago. I think that we've got pretty good visibility into the business. We work with a 6-quarter rolling forecast with Jack Molloy and all the field general managers. As it relates to demand in the U.S., the Americas in Q1 grew 3%. North America was 2% of that. If you were to dimensionalize the U.S. federal business as a segment within North America, we expect it to be comparable this year over last year, about $500 million, but I think the business is performing in a more balanced way. I think growth, we grew in every region in Q1. Asia Pac was flat, but we had growth in the others and it is conceivable all theaters can grow for the balance of '17. So it's more balanced, and that's embedded in the guidance we provided."

I think we'll start with just to kind of reiterate Greg just talked about, first of all, start with the federal government. I would say, first of all, as he said, it's comparable to 2016, but there are some things that we're hearing from our sales team that could be beneficial. Namely, the supplemental budget that's in play right now includes additional funding for both border security and defense. So as we think about those from a demand driver, we think that could be beneficial here as we work our way through 2017. From a state and local perspective, Brian, we've been really pleased with the performance. Really going back to 2015, the performance has been strong, state and local budgets, particularly as they apply to public safety, and that's important because there's a stickiness to public safety funding given the crime patterns that we see throughout the U.S. right now. They remain solid. Spoke to it earlier, device business remains solid as well as infrastructure. And I think the important thing there is infrastructure as well as the Managed and Support Service, that those sales drive. So that's also been good. The third element, and we've made -- Greg made reference to it last quarter, is the commercial markets. So we've increased our hiring of sales headcount effective, really, the middle of -- early 2015 and that's starting to obviously yield dividends for us in terms of -- and think about that in terms of the utility marketplace, oil and gas marketplace. And most recently, we've made incremental hires in terms of transportation logistics and manufacturing, and we've seen both of those markets in the U.S. start to yield PCR-like system sales force. So all in, if we think about those 3 elements in North America, the demand drivers look very positive for us."

Typically, with state and local with the systems and the devices, those are public safety operational budgets that would be kind of more deemed to be traditionally CapEx budgets, meaning every year, they've got a certain amount that they buy radios with. It's not unlike that they have funding to buy Ford Explorers or anything different. Now if you take a side piece of that, over the last, really -- we've seen really over the course of the last 5 to 6 maybe 10 years, we've seen funding that's actually gone to fund the operational expense of data devices, and that's really the funding that will start to come in play. And by the way, it hasn't been just AT&T. So really AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and to a smaller extent, T-Mobile, have really competed for that operational expense budget, the cellphone type data devices. Historically, it used to be Blackberries, now moving to more iPhone, Android type devices. That budget's resonant today. So I think that budget will be what people look to move on in terms of FirstNet and getting data subscribers."

But with LTE-based service, the capacity has been out there in the network for 4, 5, 6 years with most carriers. There are a number of issues though, with respect to the standards, that need to continue to be enhanced to provide true mission-critical support for public safety. One that I would point out is direct mode operation. In most public safety environments, at a incident scene, public safety will often switch to a direct mode operation. That doesn't exist in the public -- in the LTE standards today. So as one example, that would need to be solved and that needs to go through standards and then ripple through the ecosystem, being built into chips, being built into products and then deployed into the market. So there's quite a long process that needs to take place before you could ever get to true mission-critical public safety-grade LTE for push-to-talk services."

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. Look, first, Q1 was a strong quarter and an excellent start to the year. We grew revenue 7%, ended the quarter with record backlog. We significantly expanded operating margins. We grew earnings and we generated much higher cash flow. 
Second, I'm very pleased with our continued progress in Services. Our operational execution was strong, the Services segment growing double digits this quarter including acquisitions, and we also acquired Interexport in Chile, adding a valuable Managed Services hub in Latin America. From a software perspective, we announced the planned acquisition of Kodiak Networks and hired Andrew Sinclair, a seasoned software executive, to lead our software efforts. Acquiring the Interexport and Kodiak assets demonstrate our continued commitment towards more recurring Software and Services revenue. 
And finally, we're thrilled to be part of the winning FirstNet team with AT&T. Our investments in innovation and public safety LTE include offerings of mobile applications, services, critically important LMR and LTE interoperability as well as next-generation devices. This FirstNet opportunity further validates our competitive position for both LMR and public safety LTE going forward. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

GAAP operating earnings of $176 million, up 76% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $224 million or 17.5% of sales, an increase of 360 basis points from the year ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.45 compared to $0.10 in the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 versus $0.52 in the year ago quarter, a 37% year-over-year increase. Ending backlog is up $129 million from last year. Products backlog is up $285 million. Services backlog is down $156 million, driven by a $650 million reduction of Airwave backlog over the past 12 months. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. 
Q1 product sales were $703 million, up $1 million from last year. Q1 Products segment operating income was $101 million or 14.4% of sales, up 240 basis points from last year, driven by improved gross margin and lower OpEx. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, an increase of 22% or $285 million from last year, driven by North America. Sequentially, Products backlog increased $38 million, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth. 
Q1 Services revenue was $578 million, up 18%. Excluding Airwave, Managed and Support Services grew 8%. Services operating income was $123 million, up $41 million from the prior year. Operating margins were 21.3%, an increase of 470 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, down $156 million from last year, driven by $650 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $61 million, driven primarily by the acquisition of Interexport. 
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx was $352 million, a decrease of $3 million from the year ago quarter. Q1 2017 included an incremental $10 million of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $59 million compared to $42 million last year. Net interest expense was $51 million compared to $49 million a year ago. The Q1 effective tax rate was 26%. 
Q1 operating cash flow was $142 million, an increase of $129 million, driven by higher earnings and a $52 million legal settlement. Free cash flow was $74 million, an increase of $112 million from last year. We ended Q1 with cash of $829 million and net debt of $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $178 million of stock at an average price of $80.82, paid $77 million of dividends and invested $55 million of cash in acquisitions. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up 2% to 3% including approximately $25 million of FX headwind, primarily driven by the British pound. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS between $0.98 and $1.03 including $0.05 of Airwave currency headwinds. Inclusive of Q1 results, the first half of 2017 is slightly above our prior expectations. We now expect full year 2017 sales to be at the high end of our prior range at approximately 2% and we are raising non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.08 to $5.23. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue grew 3%, driven by strong demand for services in both North America and Latin America. Backlog is up in both Products and Services versus last year and up sequentially, as customers continue to invest in LMR systems. EMEA revenue increased 27% including $58 million of incremental Airwave revenue for the full quarter. Excluding Airwave, EMEA was up 2% with growth in both Products and Services. Asia Pac was flat versus last year, with Australia continuing to be an area of strength for some of our most advanced public safety solutions. 
Finally I'll end with some notable segment highlights. In our Products segment, we launched WAVE OnCloud, a new subscription-based SaaS version of our WAVE solution that makes it simple to deploy, maintain and improve workgroup communications. WAVE OnCloud customers can integrate their radio systems with broadband networks, extending their reach to mobile users across various devices and networks. 
Additionally, we announced the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, a leading provider of broadband push-to-talk for commercial customers, which adds a carrier-integrated push-to-talk solution for mobile operators around the world. We also won several notable deals that included: $80 million award from a country in Europe to upgrade and manage its nationwide TETRA network; a $34 million award to upgrade an existing P25 network in Northern California; and 2 P25 wins in Argentina totaling $10 million. 
In our Services segment, we acquired Interexport, a provider of managed services for communication systems to public safety and commercial users in Chile. Similar to our Airwave business, Interexport helps us deliver on our strategy to drive growth in our Managed and Support Services business. We also grew double digits in our command center software business, driven by the demand for our Spillman, Emergency CallWorks and PremierOne solutions. 
Finally, building on our Managed Services business in Australia, we signed a significant multi-year managed services contract with the Victoria Police. This contract will allow us to administer a full spectrum of solutions including hardware, software and purpose-built applications on multiple networks. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Second, I'm especially pleased with our public safety LTE position going forward. In addition to being part of the FirstNet award, we've also won all 4 of the largest global public safety LTE awards to date. Our commitment and investment to public safety has positioned us well. 
And in closing, I'm very pleased with our Q1 performance. I like the strength of our competitive position and I'm encouraged by our momentum going forward.

I think, Pierre, embedded to your question is both Software and Services and our push toward more recurring revenues in both Software and Services. Exiting last year, the recurring revenues in Software and Services were slightly higher than 25%. It would be our desire to finish this year with something north of that. I think you see us continuing to march forward on purposeful software acquisitions, whether it be in the command center, with Software as a Service with Spillman and Emergency CallWorks or whether it's on the Managed Services side, both with Airwave a year ago and now Interexport in Chile.

We're excited because this opportunity is all incremental to our core business. When we look at what it could include, it could include software and mobile applications. It could include Services. I think the most critical piece will be the interoperability with the FirstNet network to interconnect and interoperate with our installed base of land mobile radio systems throughout the U.S. and it could include next-generation devices.

It's a data and video network for interoperable broadband that will interface with our narrowband mission-critical communications voice network. I think the big differences between a private network and a cellular network are things around coverage and capacity, cost and coverage. There's hardened encryption. There's so many different things that go into making a private, always-on, reliable, secure, purpose-built network, along with the devices that are very unique for the value proposition of public safety versus a FirstNet or a cellular type network. I think on devices, I see a scenario where people will wear 2 devices on their belt, a mission-critical communications radio and a next-generation device. We're well-positioned to do that. To the extent, to your point, that may evolve over time, because today every first responder in the U.S. or just about every one, police officer, and they have 2 devices today. They have a radio for mission-critical communications voice, and they have a smartphone over a carrier network that provisions 4G broadband today. We see that scenario replicating, in which case, that second new device is greenfield opportunity for us. If those devices merge over time and at some point in the future, we're better positioned than anybody, given the domain expertise, the latency and the demand requirements around public safety, to provide the integrated device. But if that happens, I see that as a long way off. So FirstNet we see as purely incremental, too."

I would say, first of all, as he said, it's comparable to 2016, but there are some things that we're hearing from our sales team that could be beneficial. Namely, the supplemental budget that's in play right now includes additional funding for both border security and defense. So as we think about those from a demand driver, we think that could be beneficial here as we work our way through 2017. From a state and local perspective, Brian, we've been really pleased with the performance. Really going back to 2015, the performance has been strong, state and local budgets, particularly as they apply to public safety, and that's important because there's a stickiness to public safety funding given the crime patterns that we see throughout the U.S. right now. They remain solid. Spoke to it earlier, device business remains solid as well as infrastructure. And I think the important thing there is infrastructure as well as the Managed and Support Service, that those sales drive. So that's also been good. The third element, and we've made -- Greg made reference to it last quarter, is the commercial markets. So we've increased our hiring of sales headcount effective, really, the middle of -- early 2015 and that's starting to obviously yield dividends for us in terms of -- and think about that in terms of the utility marketplace, oil and gas marketplace. And most recently, we've made incremental hires in terms of transportation logistics and manufacturing, and we've seen both of those markets in the U.S. start to yield PCR-like system sales force.

So first of all, when you think about state and local budgets, and that's really what we're talking about as we start to look to FirstNet, there's 2 separate funding budgets, actually. Typically, with state and local with the systems and the devices, those are public safety operational budgets that would be kind of more deemed to be traditionally CapEx budgets, meaning every year, they've got a certain amount that they buy radios with. It's not unlike that they have funding to buy Ford Explorers or anything different. Now if you take a side piece of that, over the last, really -- we've seen really over the course of the last 5 to 6 maybe 10 years, we've seen funding that's actually gone to fund the operational expense of data devices, and that's really the funding that will start to come in play. And by the way, it hasn't been just AT&T. So really AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and to a smaller extent, T-Mobile, have really competed for that operational expense budget, the cellphone type data devices. Historically, it used to be Blackberries, now moving to more iPhone, Android type devices. That budget's resident today. So I think that budget will be what people look to move on in terms of FirstNet and getting data subscribers."

First of all, push-to-talk over cellular has been around for a long time and you can even go back 2 decades with Nextel. But with LTE-based service, the capacity has been out there in the network for 4, 5, 6 years with most carriers. There are a number of issues though, with respect to the standards, that need to continue to be enhanced to provide true mission-critical support for public safety. One that I would point out is direct mode operation. In most public safety environments, at a incident scene, public safety will often switch to a direct mode operation. That doesn't exist in the public -- in the LTE standards today. So as one example, that would need to be solved and that needs to go through standards and then ripple through the ecosystem, being built into chips, being built into products and then deployed into the market. So there's quite a long process that needs to take place before you could ever get to true mission-critical public safety-grade LTE for push-to-talk services."

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. 
So first, our strong Q2 results. We continue to build momentum in the second quarter, posting revenue growth of 5% and earnings per share growth of 9%. We grew in both Products and Services. We grew organically and we grew backlog, primarily driven by systems demand in North America. Our land mobile radio business continues to lead the way as both public safety and commercial customers continue to demand always on private, secure, resilient and redundant mission-critical voice communications. 
Second, our guidance. We're raising our full year guidance for both revenue and earnings per share based on our first half results and the ongoing demand visibility. We now expect full year revenue growth of 3% to 4% with higher earnings per share as we continue to see strong demand across the globe for land mobile radio Products and Services. 
And finally, our investments in software. We announced our intent to acquire Airbus DS Communications, also known as Plant CML, which strengthens our suite of command center solutions for agencies of all sizes. Our command center software will improve the way our customers operate and provide critical intelligence across public safety workflows, from first responders in the field to operations staff at the command center. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our Q2 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Q2 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% versus last year. GAAP operating earnings of $257 million, up 15% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up $4 million to $328 million. Operating margins were down 80 basis point",868,"Thank you, Greg. Q2 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% versus last year. GAAP operating earnings of $257 million, up 15% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up $4 million to $328 million. Operating margins were down 80 basis points to 21.9%. GAAP earnings per share were $0.78, up 28% from $0.61 in the year ago quarter. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, up 9% from $1.03 last year. Ending backlog was $8.5 billion, up $265 million from last year. Products backlog was up $204 million and services backlog was up $61 million. Additionally, H backlog for the remainder of the year is higher than at this point last year. 
At the remainder of the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. Q2 product sales were $848 million, up 6% from last year, driven primarily by the Americas. We saw growth in every region, reflecting significant demand for our P25 LMR systems. Q2 Products segment operating income was $193 million or 22.8% of sales, up 80 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and lower OpEx. Gross margins were down, as expected, on higher system sales as well as inefficiencies associated with implementing our new ERP system during the quarter. 
For the full year, we continue to expect gross margins to be comparable to last year. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, up 15% or $204 million from last year driven by North America. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, product backlog was up $1 million. 
Turning to services. Q2 services revenue was $649 million, up 3%, including $20 million of currency headwinds associated with Airwave. Managed and Support Services grew 3% or 7% in constant currency. Services operating income was $135 million or 20.8% of sales, down from 23.5% of sales last year. As expected, the operating margin decline was attributable to Airwave. We continue to expect full year services gross margins to be comparable to last year.
Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $61 million from last year, including approximately $500 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, services backlog was up $3 million. Total OpEx was $367 million, up $4 million from a year ago quarter. Excluding acquisition, OpEx was down as expected versus last year. We continue to expect full year OpEx to be down $10 million to $15 million inclusive of acquisitions. Other income and expense was $51 million, down from $57 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $51 million compared to $54 million a year ago. The Q2 effective tax rate was 31.6%.
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $173 million, a decrease of $190 million from last year, primarily due to working capital timing associated with the ERP implementation. Free cash flow was $120 million, a decrease of $81 million from last year.
On a year-to-date basis, both operating cash flow and free cash flow are up compared to the first half of 2016, and we continue to expect approximately $1,225,000,000 in operating cash flow for 2017.
We ended Q2 with cash of $805 million and net debt of $3.7 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $80 million of stock at an average price of $83.59 and we paid $77 million in dividends. We also announced our intent to acquire the Airbus plant CML business. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up 3% to 4% versus last year and non-GAAP EPS between $1.36 and $1.41. As Gregg mentioned, for the full year, we are raising both revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect full year 2017 sales growth of 3% to 4% and non-GAAP EPS of $5.20 to $5.30. This assumes approximately $170 million fully diluted shares. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 7% driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services. Backlog was also up year-over-year and sequentially and Products and Services as customers continue to invest in LMR systems. EMEA was down 1% due to approximately $20 million of U.K. currency headwinds while products was up 12%. Asia Pac was up 2% on strong product performance driven by P25 demand in Australia. Services was down on lower systems integration, while Managed and Support Services was up.
I'd like to end with some notable highlights. During the quarter, we signed the FirstNet partnership agreement with AT&T, and we are encouraged that all states that have made a decision to date have opted into the plan network. Additionally, during Q2, AT&T certified our Lex F10 FirstNet device, making us the only vendor with both a handheld device and a vehicular modem that is FirstNet ready. Some key product wins include: a $43 million award for P25 devices in a major U.S. city; a $40 million P25 system in Broward County, Florida; and a $10 million P25 devices order in Australia.
In services, we secured a 10-year $160 million contract for Managed and Support Services in Canada and a $90 million P25 system award covering 3 counties in Kentucky that includes a 10-year Managed and Support Services agreement. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg"

First, with an excellent start to the year and continued demand visibility, we expect to grow in all regions. And we are well-positioned for strong full year performance. This now reflected in our higher revenue and EPS guidance. 
Second, we continue to see customers invest in land mobile radio for the long-term. North America products revenue grew in 2015, again in 2016 and again in the first half of this year. Over the same time period, North America products backlog has grown nearly $400 million. This solid ongoing demand speaks to the criticality and value of our LMR platform, of permission critical communications and confirms the coexistence of LMR and LTE over the long term. 
And finally, with the planned acquisition of Airbus DS, we're building what we believe is the most comprehensive command center suite in the industry covering critical workflows of call taking, dispatch, records management and crime analytics. As I look into the future of public safety, I'm pleased with our position and I'm pleased with our momentum. We're leveraging our LMR systems installed base while simultaneously building incremental and complementary platforms for the command center and public safety LTE, which together, I think provide the foundation for continued growth, cash generation earnings expansion and shareholder return over the long term. I now turn it back over to Chris."

Taking a step back, though, as we emphasize both software and management support services and what that could mean to us from a recurring revenue stream, just this past quarter in Q2, 29% of our overall revenue was recurring, which is a favorable trend, and we feel good about our ability to build on it."

We view the FirstNet opportunity as incremental. We don't count on any revenue this year. I mentioned a couple of months ago an estimate of about $40 million to $60 million for next year. I think for now, that's fine. We'll update you by the end of the year. But again, while states are opting in, there's a long way to go between now and the end of the year.

We had an exceptionally strong Q4 of last year with products revenue growing 9%. But as I mentioned, North America, which is 2/3 of the company's revenue, the demand has been pretty steady. 2015, 2016, the first half of this year, product backlog, which is a reasonable indicator for visibility going forward, up about $400 million around from a North America perspective over the same 10 quarters. And the thing that I'm particularly pleased about in Q2 is the systems demand. So when these land mobile radio platforms or systems go in, they're going in for the long term, which you will then load with subscriber devices, which you then add to it with agencies and secondary and tertiary users and they typically go in with 10 and 15-year maintenance agreements. So I think the demand has been pretty steady. I think also part of it is Molloy's team has been pretty consistent in execution. Latin America has gone from a negative to a positive and the team down there has done a very nice job. In EMEA, under new leadership in Marks middle doing a very good job, new leadership in the channel organization, changes we've made, better execution. So I think it's a combination of demand being steady and strong around the globe, led by North America from a system standpoint and strong execution from the worldwide sales team."

Overall, again, to an earlier question I had, we like this space a lot. I mean, we leverage the land mobile radio systems installed base we have. But we're also building a pretty significant software platform, which involves a variety of acquisitions and at the moment, point solutions. I think over time, we can plan from that business, integrate the software applications into a more comprehensive suite led by Andrew Sinclair.

With respect to gross margins, in the release, we don't have the gross margin by segment. But as expected and recall during our last call, the guidance, our expectation was for gross margin to be down driven primarily by a few things. One was Airwave FX and the purchase accounting adjustment, catch-up adjustment year-to-date in 2016. That would be obviously reflected in the services gross margin, as well as a shift to systems in North America. Greg mentioned and I mentioned in prepared remarks the strength of systems in North America, as well as some ERP-related, ERP implementation-related cost in Q2. So Q2 margin down approximately 160 basis points, spread across really those 3 issues.

No, as I mentioned, I think demand, I'm very pleased with our demand, both as represented in revenue and backlog, led by North America and over the past several quarters. I saw the note that you referenced around land mobile radio licensing decline, I think there's a few things to note from a clarification standpoint. I'm not surprised by it at all, but at the same token, number one, a large number of customers are converting to P25 TDMA. That has a 2 to 1 spectral efficiency. So you literally need have a license than you previously would need as you move to upgrade to a more efficient P25 TDMA deployment. In addition to that, number two, we're seeing more customers increase statewide and regionwide deployments, taking advantage of the 700 megahertz frequency. The impact is the same. I mean, demand, if anything, continues to go up for LMR. But the actual system or license, spectrum licenses could decline because the systems are spread over new bands and they're much more spectrum efficient. So -- and the last thing I'd mention is I know that, that referenced a slight period of several years ago associated with narrowband. So while I think it's interesting, I do not think it's a good proxy or correlation to use to judge the demand for our land mobile radio business, in particular, P25 because all systems are green and over a sustainable period of time and through the second half of this year."

I think the demand that we're seeing for land mobile radio systems and product backlog, along with these customers buying brand-new systems with a 10 and 15-year maintenance, speaks to what they think firsthand North America led, U.S.-led on the criticality, durability and longevity of land mobile radio here. I think that you'll read and hear things about other push-to-talk solutions. The confusing thing is some people call it mission-critical push-to-talk, whether they reference it in 3GPP release 13 or 14 or now they're talking about release 15. But I don't think it changes what we're seeing, which is continued strong demand for P25 systems U.S.-led. The last thing I'd mentioned is we now have won 5 of the largest public safety LTE awards in the world, Los Angeles, FirstNet as a subcontractor to AT&T, the U.K, home office in the form of ESN; and 2 countries in the Middle East. And what we see in all of those cases, 5 out of 5 is continued strong investment, either upgrading or in some cases, brand-new land mobile radio, which speaks to the coexistence and the expectation by our customers that public safety LTE will be data focused and video focused while mission-critical voice will continue to be provisioned over P25."

Your comps aren't necessarily that hard and you had a number of one-time issues and contracts rolling off last year that have now anniversaried. You bought decent backlog, you got the public safety LTE. What's your confidence now, Greg, or just landing in that kind of lower single-digit revenue growth rate very consistently at least for the foreseeable future as in I'm not talking just Q3, but into '17 and '18, perhaps? And then the second question is, this was a long time ago. It may not be relevant anymore. But you once I think said that once public safety LTE hit, you might be a mid to high single digit revenue growth company. Is that something you think? I think I know a lot has changed since that was initially said. Is that something you think about on a long-term basis or she would not think about that for some reason?"

We mobile, yes. We have the opportunity to move more toward the right goal post in that regard. How do I feel about growth overall? I feel pretty good about it referencing the fact that we're taking the full year up to 3 to 4. I feel good about it because it's underpinned by higher aged backlog. I feel good about it when I look at the desegregation of the segments and some of the key metrics we looked at. I feel good about organic growth on a constant currency basis in Q2 being 4%.

If we take a look at '18 while we're not going to get into the specifics, I would expect OpEx, excluding acquisitions, to continue to be down slightly on the base businesses. So I think the team continues to do things on the OpEx side. And on the efficiency side, which and build themselves for us to take advantage of. By the way, we talked about the ERP implementation that we cut over in April. That would be on Phase I completed here in Q3. Eventually, as we get more conversion and completion of that system, there's requisite efficiencies in IT costs and business process efficiencies that I think could be reflected over the longer term. That's in part why we invested in the ERP. So net-net, we will be down $10 million to $15 million this year, all in. And I think that operating leverage is expected to improve again in '18."

Greg and Gino will review our results along with commentary and Bruce and Jack will join for Q&A. We have posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor, which are intended to supplement this call. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference.
A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update these forward-looking statements. 
I'll now turn it over to Greg"

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. 
So first, our strong Q2 results. We continued to build momentum in the second quarter, posting revenue growth of 5% and earnings per share growth of 9%. We grew in both Products and Services. We grew organically and we grew backlog, primarily driven by systems demand in North America. Our land mobile radio business continues to lead the way, as both public safety and commercial customers continue to demand always-on, private, secure, resilient and redundant mission-critical voice communications. 
Second, our guidance. We're raising our full year guidance for both revenue and earnings per share based on our first half results and ongoing demand visibility. We now expect full year revenue growth of 3% to 4% with higher earnings per share as we continue to see strong demand across the globe for land mobile radio Products and Services. 
And finally, our investments in software. We announced our intent to acquire Airbus DS Communications, also known as PlantCML, which strengthens our suite of command center solutions for agencies of all sizes. Our command center software will improve the way our customers operate and provide critical intelligence across public safety workflows, from first responders in the field to operations staff at the command center. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our Q2 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Q2 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% versus last year. GAAP operating earnings of $257 million, up 15% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up $4 million to $328 million. Operating margins were down 80 basis point",867,"Thank you, Greg. Q2 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% versus last year. GAAP operating earnings of $257 million, up 15% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up $4 million to $328 million. Operating margins were down 80 basis points to 21.9%. GAAP earnings per share were $0.78, up 28% from $0.61 in the year ago quarter. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, up 9% from $1.03 last year. Ending backlog was $8.5 billion, up $265 million from last year. Products backlog was up $204 million and Services backlog was up $61 million. Additionally, age backlog for the remainder of the year is higher than at this point last year. 
For the remainder of the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. Q2 product sales were $848 million, up 6% from last year, driven primarily by the Americas. We saw growth in every region, reflecting significant demand for our P25's LMR systems. Q2 Products segment operating income was $193 million or 22.8% of sales, up 80 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and lower OpEx. Gross margins were down, as expected, on higher system sales as well as inefficiencies associated with implementing our new ERP system during the quarter. 
For the full year, we continue to expect gross margins to be comparable to last year. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, up 15% or $204 million from last year driven by North America. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, product backlog was up $1 million. 
Turning to services. Q2 services revenue was $649 million, up 3%, including $20 million of currency headwinds associated with Airwave. Managed and Support Services grew 3%, or 7% in constant currency. Services operating income was $135 million or 20.8% of sales, down from 23.5% of sales last year. As expected, the operating margin decline was attributable to Airwave. We continue to expect full year services gross margins to be comparable to last year.
Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $61 million from last year, including approximately $500 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, services backlog was up $3 million. Total OpEx was $367 million, up $4 million from the year ago quarter. Excluding acquisitions, OpEx was down as expected versus last year. We continue to expect full year OpEx to be down $10 million to $15 million inclusive of acquisitions. Other income and expense was $51 million, down from $57 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $51 million compared to $54 million a year ago. The Q2 effective tax rate was 31.6%.
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $173 million, a decrease of $119 million from last year, primarily due to working capital timing associated with the ERP implementation. Free cash flow was $120 million, a decrease of $81 million from last year.
On a year-to-date basis, both operating cash flow and free cash flow are up compared to the first half of 2016, and we continue to expect approximately $1,225,000,000 in operating cash flow for 2017.
We ended Q2 with cash of $805 million and net debt of $3.7 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $80 million of stock at an average price of $83.59 and we paid $77 million in dividends. We also announced our intent to acquire the Airbus PlantCML business. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up 3% to 4% versus last year and non-GAAP EPS between $1.36 and $1.41. As Greg mentioned, for the full year, we are raising both revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect full year 2017 sales growth of 3% to 4% and non-GAAP EPS of $5.20 to $5.30. This assumes approximately 170 million fully diluted shares. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 7% driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services. Backlog was also up year-over-year and sequentially in Products and Services as customers continued to invest in LMR systems. EMEA was down 1% due to approximately $20 million of U.K. currency headwinds while products was up 12%. Asia Pac was up 2% on strong product performance driven by P25 demand in Australia. Services was down on lower systems integration, while Managed and Support Services was up.
I'd like to end with some notable highlights. During the quarter, we signed the FirstNet partnership agreement with AT&T, and we are encouraged that all states that have made a decision to date have opted into the plan network. Additionally, during Q2, AT&T certified our Lex F10 FirstNet device, making us the only vendor with both a handheld device and a vehicular modem that is FirstNet ready. Some key product wins include: a $43 million award for P25 devices in a major U.S. city; a $40 million P25 system in Broward County, Florida; and a $10 million P25 devices order in Australia.
In Services, we secured a 10-year $160 million contract for Managed and Support Services in Canada and a $19 million P25 system award covering 3 counties in Kentucky that includes a 10-year Managed and Support Services agreement. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

First, with an excellent start to the year and continued demand visibility, we expect to grow in all regions. And we are well positioned for strong full year performance. This is now reflected in our higher revenue and EPS guidance. 
Second, we continue to see customers invest in land mobile radio for the long term. North America Products revenue grew in 2015, again in 2016 and again in the first half of this year. Over that same time period, North America Products backlog has grown nearly $400 million. This solid ongoing demand speaks to the criticality and value of our LMR platform for mission-critical communications, and confirms the coexistence of LMR and LTE over the long term. 
And finally, with the planned acquisition of Airbus DS, we're building what we believe is the most comprehensive command center suite in the industry covering the critical workflows of call taking, dispatch, records management and crime analytics. As I look into the future of public safety, I'm pleased with our position and I'm pleased with our momentum. We're leveraging our LMR systems installed base while simultaneously building incremental and complementary platforms for the command center and public safety LTE, which together, I think provide the foundation for continued growth, cash generation earnings expansion and shareholder return over the long term. 
And I'll now turn it back over to Chris."

And what's included in that, whether it's 911 call taking, CAD dispatch, realtime analytics, records management and as you pointed out, we have been steady -- had a steady drumbeat of inorganic acquisitions to build out that suite. I think as we continue to make progress for the rest of this year and into next year, we'll complete what I think is over the most comprehensive suite in the industry. We had Andrew Sinclair join the firm about 4 months ago. We feel good about his capabilities, his expertise and what he'll build and bring to us over time. I think that what the most likely thing, Matt, we'll do is progress through the end of this year and probably do a pretty comprehensive review of the software business at our financial analyst meeting, which we anticipate will be Q1 of next year. Taking a step back, though, as we emphasize both software and management support services and what that can mean to us from a recurring revenue stream, just this past quarter in Q2, 29% of our overall revenue was recurring, which is a favorable trend, and we feel good about our ability to build on it."

We're pleased, as Gino mentioned in his remarks, that all states have opted in. By the way, Michigan opted in just an hour ago, I think, representing the ninth state; and 10th, including the U.S. Virgin Islands overall. So we have an agreement signed that was new since the last earnings call with AT&T. I think we can monetize this relationship in software and mobile apps, services interoperability between LTE and LMR, which I mentioned. I think we'll coexist over the long term as well as devices. We view the FirstNet opportunity as incremental. We don't count on any revenue this year. I mentioned a couple of months ago an estimate of about $40 million to $60 million for next year. I think for now, that's fine. We'll update you by the end of the year. But again, while states are opting in, there's a long way to go between now and the end of the year. And the ultimate success of FirstNet will depend on the actual penetration or loading of subscribers that switch from an existing wireless carrier over to FirstNet. And time will tell. But we feel very good about our portfolio and uniqueness in the space and the agreement with AT&T."

We had an exceptionally strong Q4 of last year with products revenue growing 9%. But as I mentioned, North America, which is 2/3 of the company's revenue, the demand has been pretty steady, 2015, 2016, the first half of this year. Product backlog, which is a reasonable indicator for visibility going forward, up about $400 million around -- from a North America perspective over the same 10 quarters. And the thing that I'm particularly pleased about in Q2 is the systems demand. So when these land mobile radio platforms or systems go in, they're going in for the long term, which you will then load with subscriber devices, which you'll then add to with agencies and secondary and tertiary users. And they typically go in with 10- and 15-year maintenance agreements. So I think the demand has been pretty steady. I think also part of it is Molloy's team has been pretty consistent in execution. Latin America has gone from a negative to a positive and the team down there has done a very nice job. And EMEA, under new leadership, with Mark Schmidl doing a very good job. New leadership in the channel organization, changes we've made, better execution. So I think it's a combination of demand being steady and strong around the globe, led by North America from a systems standpoint and strong execution from the worldwide sales team."

The application sales and device sales will obviously follow subscribers actually opting in subscribing to the network and then buying devices and applications to use on the network. So in the short term or near term, it's interoperability between LMR and LTE. And in the longer term, which will follow, subscriber loading would be applications and devices."

Overall, again, to an earlier question I had, we like this space a lot. I mean, we leverage the land mobile radio systems installed base we have. But we're also building a pretty significant software platform, which involves a variety of acquisitions and, at the moment, point solutions. I think over time, we can platform that business, integrate the software applications into a more comprehensive suite led by Andrew Sinclair.

One was Airwave FX and the purchase accounting adjustment -- catch-up adjustment year-to-date in 2016. That would be obviously reflected in the services gross margin as well as a shift to systems in North America. Greg mentioned and I've mentioned in prepared remarks the strength of systems in North America as well as some ERP-related -- ERP implementation-related costs in Q2. So Q2 margin down approximately 160 basis points, spread across really those 3 issues. And I should say, as I said in the prepared remarks, our expectation is that gross margin in both Services and Products, we expect to be comparable for the full year.

I saw the note that you referenced around land mobile radio licensing decline. I think there's a few things to note from a clarification standpoint. I'm not surprised by it at all but, at the same token, number one, a large number of customers are converting to P25 TDMA. That has a 2:1 spectral efficiency so you literally need half the license than you previously would need as you move to upgrade to a more efficient P25 TDMA deployment. In addition to that, number two, we're seeing more customers increase statewide and regionwide deployments, taking advantage of the 700 megahertz frequency. The impact is the same. I mean, demand, if anything, continues to go up for LMR. But the actual system or license, spectrum licenses could decline because the systems are spread over new bands and they're much more spectrally efficient. So -- and the last thing I'd mention is I know that, that referenced a slight period of several years ago associated with narrowband. So while I think it's interesting, I do not think it's a good proxy or correlation to use to judge the demand for our land mobile radio business, in particular, P25 because all systems are green and over a sustainable period of time and through the second half of this year."

There's a difference between push-to-talk over cellular mission-critical push-to-talk over cellular. I think the demand that we're seeing for land mobile radio systems and product backlog, along with these customers buying brand-new systems with 10- and 15-year maintenance speaks to what they think firsthand North America-led, U.S.-led on the criticality, durability and longevity of land mobile radio here. I think that you'll read and hear things about other push-to-talk solutions. The confusing thing is some people call it mission-critical push-to-talk, whether they reference it in 3GPP release 13 or 14 or now they're talking about release 15. But I don't think it changes what we're seeing, which is continued strong demand for P25 systems U.S.-led. The last thing I'd mentioned is we now have won 5 of the largest public safety LTE awards in the world: Los Angeles, FirstNet as a subcontractor to AT&T; the U.K. Home Office in the form of ESN; and 2 countries in the Middle East. And what we see in all of those cases, 5 out of 5 is continued strong investment, either upgrading or in some cases, brand-new land mobile radio, which speaks to the coexistence and the expectation by our customers that public safety LTE will be data focused and video focused while mission-critical voice will continue to be provisioned over P25."

By the way, we talked about the ERP implementation that we cut over in April. That will be on Phase 1 completed here in Q3. Eventually, as we get more conversion and completion of that system, there's requisite efficiencies and IT costs and business process efficiencies that I think could be reflected over the longer term.

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. 
So first, our strong Q2 results. We continued to build momentum in the second quarter, posting revenue growth of 5% and earnings per share growth of 9%. We grew in both Products and Services. We grew organically and we grew backlog, primarily driven by systems demand in North America. Our land mobile radio business continues to lead the way, as both public safety and commercial customers continue to demand always-on, private, secure, resilient and redundant mission-critical voice communications. 
Second, our guidance. We're raising our full year guidance for both revenue and earnings per share based on our first half results and ongoing demand visibility. We now expect full year revenue growth of 3% to 4% with higher earnings per share as we continue to see strong demand across the globe for land mobile radio Products and Services. 
And finally, our investments in software. We announced our intent to acquire Airbus DS Communications, also known as PlantCML, which strengthens our suite of command center solutions for agencies of all sizes. Our command center software will improve the way our customers operate and provide critical intelligence across public safety workflows, from first responders in the field to operations staff at the command center. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our Q2 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Q2 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% versus last year. GAAP operating earnings of $257 million, up 15% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up $4 million to $328 million. Operating margins were down 80 basis point",867,"Thank you, Greg. Q2 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% versus last year. GAAP operating earnings of $257 million, up 15% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up $4 million to $328 million. Operating margins were down 80 basis points to 21.9%. GAAP earnings per share were $0.78, up 28% from $0.61 in the year ago quarter. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, up 9% from $1.03 last year. Ending backlog was $8.5 billion, up $265 million from last year. Products backlog was up $204 million and Services backlog was up $61 million. Additionally, age backlog for the remainder of the year is higher than at this point last year. 
For the remainder of the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. Q2 product sales were $848 million, up 6% from last year, driven primarily by the Americas. We saw growth in every region, reflecting significant demand for our P25 LMR systems. Q2 Products segment operating income was $193 million or 22.8% of sales, up 80 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and lower OpEx. Gross margins were down, as expected, on higher system sales as well as inefficiencies associated with implementing our new ERP system during the quarter. 
For the full year, we continue to expect gross margins to be comparable to last year. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, up 15% or $204 million from last year driven by North America. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, product backlog was up $1 million. 
Turning to services. Q2 services revenue was $649 million, up 3%, including $20 million of currency headwinds associated with Airwave. Managed and Support Services grew 3%, or 7% in constant currency. Services operating income was $135 million or 20.8% of sales, down from 23.5% of sales last year. As expected, the operating margin decline was attributable to Airwave. We continue to expect full year services gross margins to be comparable to last year.
Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $61 million from last year, including approximately $500 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, services backlog was up $3 million. Total OpEx was $367 million, up $4 million from the year ago quarter. Excluding acquisitions, OpEx was down as expected versus last year. We continue to expect full year OpEx to be down $10 million to $15 million inclusive of acquisitions. Other income and expense was $51 million, down from $57 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $51 million compared to $54 million a year ago. The Q2 effective tax rate was 31.6%.
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $173 million, a decrease of $119 million from last year, primarily due to working capital timing associated with the ERP implementation. Free cash flow was $120 million, a decrease of $81 million from last year.
On a year-to-date basis, both operating cash flow and free cash flow are up compared to the first half of 2016, and we continue to expect approximately $1,225,000,000 in operating cash flow for 2017.
We ended Q2 with cash of $805 million and net debt of $3.7 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $80 million of stock at an average price of $83.59 and we paid $77 million in dividends. We also announced our intent to acquire the Airbus PlantCML business. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up 3% to 4% versus last year and non-GAAP EPS between $1.36 and $1.41. As Greg mentioned, for the full year, we are raising both revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect full year 2017 sales growth of 3% to 4% and non-GAAP EPS of $5.20 to $5.30. This assumes approximately 170 million fully diluted shares. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 7% driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services. Backlog was also up year-over-year and sequentially in Products and Services as customers continue to invest in LMR systems. EMEA was down 1% due to approximately $20 million of U.K. currency headwinds while products was up 12%. Asia Pac was up 2% on strong product performance driven by P25 demand in Australia. Services was down on lower systems integration, while Managed and Support Services was up.
I'd like to end with some notable highlights. During the quarter, we signed the FirstNet partnership agreement with AT&T, and we are encouraged that all states that have made a decision to date have opted into the plan network. Additionally, during Q2, AT&T certified our LEX F10 FirstNet device, making us the only vendor with both a handheld device and a vehicular modem that is FirstNet ready. Some key product wins include: a $43 million award for P25 devices in a major U.S. city; a $40 million P25 system in Broward County, Florida; and a $10 million P25 devices order in Australia.
In Services, we secured a 10-year $160 million contract for Managed and Support Services in Canada and a $19 million P25 system award covering 3 counties in Kentucky that includes a 10-year Managed and Support Services agreement. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

First, with an excellent start to the year and continued demand visibility, we expect to grow in all regions. And we are well positioned for strong full year performance that's now reflected in our higher revenue and EPS guidance. 
Second, we continue to see customers invest in land mobile radio for the long term. North America Products revenue grew in 2015, again in 2016 and again in the first half of this year. Over that same time period, North America Products backlog has grown nearly $400 million. This solid ongoing demand speaks to the criticality and value of our LMR platform for mission-critical communications, and confirms the coexistence of LMR and LTE over the long term. 
And finally, with the planned acquisition of Airbus DS, we're building what we believe is the most comprehensive command center suite in the industry covering the critical workflows of call taking, dispatch, records management and crime analytics. As I look into the future of public safety, I'm pleased with our position and I'm pleased with our momentum. We're leveraging our LMR systems installed base while simultaneously building incremental and complementary platforms for the command center and public safety LTE, which together, I think, provide the foundation for continued growth, cash generation earnings expansion and shareholder return over the long term. 
And I'll now turn it back over to Chris."

We had Andrew Sinclair join the firm about 4 months ago. We feel good about his capabilities, his expertise and what he'll build and bring to us over time. I think that what the most likely thing, Matt, we'll do is progress through the end of this year and probably do a pretty comprehensive review of the software business at our financial analyst meeting, which we anticipate will be Q1 of next year. Taking a step back, though, as we emphasize both software and management support services and what that can mean to us from a recurring revenue stream, just this past quarter in Q2, 29% of our overall revenue was recurring, which is a favorable trend, and we feel good about our ability to build on it."

I think we can monetize this relationship in software and mobile apps, services interoperability between LTE and LMR, which I mentioned, I think will coexist over the long term as well as devices. We view the FirstNet opportunity as incremental. We don't count on any revenue this year. I mentioned a couple of months ago an estimate of about $40 million to $60 million for next year. I think for now, that's fine. We'll update you by the end of the year. But again, while states are opting in, there's a long way to go between now and the end of the year.

We had an exceptionally strong Q4 of last year with products revenue growing 9%. But as I mentioned, North America, which is 2/3 of the company's revenue, the demand has been pretty steady, 2015, 2016, the first half of this year. Product backlog, which is a reasonable indicator for visibility going forward, up about $400 million around -- from a North America perspective over the same 10 quarters. And the thing that I'm particularly pleased about in Q2 is the systems demand. So when these land mobile radio platforms or systems go in, they're going in for the long term, which you will then load with subscriber devices, which you'll then add to with agencies and secondary and tertiary users. And they typically go in with 10- and 15-year maintenance agreements. So I think the demand has been pretty steady. I think also part of it is Molloy's team has been pretty consistent in execution. Latin America has gone from a negative to a positive and the team down there has done a very nice job. And EMEA, under new leadership, with Mark Schmidl doing a very good job. New leadership in the channel organization, changes we've made, better execution. So I think it's a combination of demand being steady and strong around the globe, led by North America from a systems standpoint and strong execution from the worldwide sales team."

Overall, again, to an earlier question I had, we like this space a lot. I mean, we leverage the land mobile radio systems installed base we have. But we're also building a pretty significant software platform, which involves a variety of acquisitions and, at the moment, point solutions. I think over time, we can platform that business, integrate the software applications into a more comprehensive suite led by Andrew Sinclair. And I think the addressable market for the command center is a sizable one for us to pursue, so it makes sense for us to build that platform along with the public safety LTE platform as well."

With respect to gross margins, in the release, we don't have the gross margin by segment. But as expected, and recall during our last call and guidance, our expectation was for gross margin to be down, driven primarily by a few things. One was Airwave FX and the purchase accounting adjustment -- catch-up adjustment year-to-date in 2016. That would be obviously reflected in the services gross margin as well as a shift to systems in North America. Greg mentioned and I've mentioned in prepared remarks the strength of systems in North America as well as some ERP-related -- ERP implementation-related costs in Q2. So Q2 margin down approximately 160 basis points, spread across really those 3 issues. And I should say, as I said in the prepared remarks, our expectation is that gross margin in both Services and Products, we expect to be comparable for the full year.

I saw the note that you referenced around land mobile radio licensing decline. I think there's a few things to note from a clarification standpoint. I'm not surprised by it at all but, at the same token, number one, a large number of customers are converting to P25 TDMA. That has a 2:1 spectral efficiency so you'll literally need half the license than you previously would need as you move to upgrade to a more efficient P25 TDMA deployment. In addition to that, number two, we're seeing more customers increase statewide and regionwide deployments, taking advantage of the 700-megahertz frequency. The impact is the same. I mean, demand, if anything, continues to go up for LMR. But the actual system or license, spectrum licenses could decline because the systems are spread over new bands and they're much more spectrally efficient. So -- and the last thing I'd mention is I know that, that referenced a slight period of several years ago associated with narrowband. So while I think it's interesting, I do not think it's a good proxy or correlation to use to judge the demand for our land mobile radio business, in particular, P25 because all systems are green and over a sustainable period of time and through the second half of this year."

I think the demand that we're seeing for land mobile radio systems and product backlog, along with these customers buying brand-new systems with 10- and 15-year maintenance, speaks to what they think firsthand North America-led, U.S.-led on the criticality, durability and longevity of land mobile radio here. I think that you'll read and hear things about other push-to-talk solutions. The confusing thing is some people call it mission-critical push-to-talk, whether they reference it in 3GPP release 13 or 14 or now they're talking about release 15. But I don't think it changes what we're seeing, which is continued strong demand for P25 systems U.S.-led. The last thing I'd mention is we now have won 5 of the largest public safety LTE awards in the world: Los Angeles, FirstNet as a subcontractor to AT&T; the U.K. Home Office in the form of ESN; and 2 countries in the Middle East. And what we see in all of those cases, 5 out of 5 is continued strong investment, either upgrading or in some cases, brand-new land mobile radio, which speaks to the coexistence and the expectation by our customers that public safety LTE will be data focused and video focused while mission-critical voice will continue to be provisioned over P25."

But again, I think the momentum we have here, as we finish the second half of the year, I feel good about our position. And I feel very good about our momentum, Kulbinder."

Like I'm not talking just near term, I'm talking about -- or is there a need to maybe invest in the business to pursue some more of these initiatives? Can OpEx be held flat in like a 3%, 4% top line environment or is that changing in any way?"

We're cutting expense and simultaneously investing, I think, where we need to. So I think that's proved to be a very effective reference, the operating leverage that you have seen recently and that, quite frankly, I think we continue to expect. OpEx will be down $10 million to $15 million this year. That includes all of the acquisitions. If we take a look at '18, while we're not going to get into the specifics, I would expect OpEx, excluding acquisitions, to continue to be down slightly on the base businesses. So I think the team continues to do things on the OpEx side. And on the efficiency side, which avail themselves for us to take advantage of. By the way, we talked about the ERP implementation that we cut over in April. That will be on Phase 1 completed here in Q3. Eventually, as we get more conversion and completion of that system, there's requisite efficiencies and IT costs and business process efficiencies that I think could be reflected over the longer term. That's in part why we invested in the ERP. So net-net, we will be down $10 million to $15 million this year, all-in. And I think that operating leverage is expected to improve again in '18."

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. 
So first, our strong Q2 results. We continued to build momentum in the second quarter, posting revenue growth of 5% and earnings per share growth of 9%. We grew in both Products and Services. We grew organically and we grew backlog, primarily driven by systems demand in North America. Our land mobile radio business continues to lead the way, as both public safety and commercial customers continue to demand always-on, private, secure, resilient and redundant mission-critical voice communications. 
Second, our guidance. We're raising our full year guidance for both revenue and earnings per share based on our first half results and ongoing demand visibility. We now expect full year revenue growth of 3% to 4% with higher earnings per share as we continue to see strong demand across the globe for land mobile radio Products and Services. 
And finally, our investments in software. We announced our intent to acquire Airbus DS Communications, also known as PlantCML, which strengthens our suite of command center solutions for agencies of all sizes. Our command center software will improve the way our customers operate and provide critical intelligence across public safety workflows, from first responders in the field to operations staff at the command center. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our Q2 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts."

Q2 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% versus last year. GAAP operating earnings of $257 million, up 15% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up $4 million to $328 million. Operating margins were down 80 basis point",867,"Thank you, Greg. Q2 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% versus last year. GAAP operating earnings of $257 million, up 15% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up $4 million to $328 million. Operating margins were down 80 basis points to 21.9%. GAAP earnings per share were $0.78, up 28% from $0.61 in the year ago quarter. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, up 9% from $1.03 last year. Ending backlog was $8.5 billion, up $265 million from last year. Products backlog was up $204 million and Services backlog was up $61 million. Additionally, age backlog for the remainder of the year is higher than at this point last year. 
For the remainder of the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. Q2 product sales were $848 million, up 6% from last year, driven primarily by the Americas. We saw growth in every region, reflecting significant demand for our P25 LMR systems. Q2 Products segment operating income was $193 million or 22.8% of sales, up 80 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and lower OpEx. Gross margins were down, as expected, on higher system sales as well as inefficiencies associated with implementing our new ERP system during the quarter. 
For the full year, we continue to expect gross margins to be comparable to last year. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, up 15% or $204 million from last year driven by North America. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, product backlog was up $1 million. 
Turning to services. Q2 services revenue was $649 million, up 3%, including $20 million of currency headwinds associated with Airwave. Managed and Support Services grew 3%, or 7% in constant currency. Services operating income was $135 million or 20.8% of sales, down from 23.5% of sales last year. As expected, the operating margin decline was attributable to Airwave. We continue to expect full year services gross margins to be comparable to last year.
Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $61 million from last year, including approximately $500 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, services backlog was up $3 million. Total OpEx was $367 million, up $4 million from the year ago quarter. Excluding acquisitions, OpEx was down as expected versus last year. We continue to expect full year OpEx to be down $10 million to $15 million inclusive of acquisitions. Other income and expense was $51 million, down from $57 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $51 million compared to $54 million a year ago. The Q2 effective tax rate was 31.6%.
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $173 million, a decrease of $119 million from last year, primarily due to working capital timing associated with the ERP implementation. Free cash flow was $120 million, a decrease of $81 million from last year.
On a year-to-date basis, both operating cash flow and free cash flow are up compared to the first half of 2016, and we continue to expect approximately $1,225,000,000 in operating cash flow for 2017.
We ended Q2 with cash of $805 million and net debt of $3.7 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $80 million of stock at an average price of $83.59 and we paid $77 million in dividends. We also announced our intent to acquire the Airbus PlantCML business. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up 3% to 4% versus last year and non-GAAP EPS between $1.36 and $1.41. As Greg mentioned, for the full year, we are raising both revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect full year 2017 sales growth of 3% to 4% and non-GAAP EPS of $5.20 to $5.30. This assumes approximately 170 million fully diluted shares. 
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 7% driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services. Backlog was also up year-over-year and sequentially in Products and Services as customers continue to invest in LMR systems. EMEA was down 1% due to approximately $20 million of U.K. currency headwinds while products was up 12%. Asia Pac was up 2% on strong product performance driven by P25 demand in Australia. Services was down on lower systems integration, while Managed and Support Services was up.
I'd like to end with some notable highlights. During the quarter, we signed the FirstNet partnership agreement with AT&T, and we are encouraged that all states that have made a decision to date have opted into the plan network. Additionally, during Q2, AT&T certified our LEX F10 FirstNet device, making us the only vendor with both a handheld device and a vehicular modem that is FirstNet ready. Some key product wins include: a $43 million award for P25 devices in a major U.S. city; a $40 million P25 system in Broward County, Florida; and a $10 million P25 devices order in Australia.
In Services, we secured a 10-year $160 million contract for Managed and Support Services in Canada and a $19 million P25 system award covering 3 counties in Kentucky that includes a 10-year Managed and Support Services agreement. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

First, with an excellent start to the year and continued demand visibility, we expect to grow in all regions. And we are well positioned for strong full year performance that's now reflected in our higher revenue and EPS guidance. 
Second, we continue to see customers invest in land mobile radio for the long term. North America Products revenue grew in 2015, again in 2016 and again in the first half of this year. Over that same time period, North America Products backlog has grown nearly $400 million. This solid ongoing demand speaks to the criticality and value of our LMR platform for mission-critical communications, and confirms the coexistence of LMR and LTE over the long term. 
And finally, with the planned acquisition of Airbus DS, we're building what we believe is the most comprehensive command center suite in the industry covering the critical workflows of call taking, dispatch, records management and crime analytics. As I look into the future of public safety, I'm pleased with our position and I'm pleased with our momentum. We're leveraging our LMR systems installed base while simultaneously building incremental and complementary platforms for the command center and public safety LTE, which together, I think, provide the foundation for continued growth, cash generation earnings expansion and shareholder return over the long term. 
And I'll now turn it back over to Chris."

We had Andrew Sinclair join the firm about 4 months ago. We feel good about his capabilities, his expertise and what he'll build and bring to us over time. I think that what the most likely thing, Matt, we'll do is progress through the end of this year and probably do a pretty comprehensive review of the software business at our financial analyst meeting, which we anticipate will be Q1 of next year. Taking a step back, though, as we emphasize both software and management support services and what that can mean to us from a recurring revenue stream, just this past quarter in Q2, 29% of our overall revenue was recurring, which is a favorable trend, and we feel good about our ability to build on it."

I think we can monetize this relationship in software and mobile apps, services interoperability between LTE and LMR, which I mentioned, I think will coexist over the long term as well as devices. We view the FirstNet opportunity as incremental. We don't count on any revenue this year. I mentioned a couple of months ago an estimate of about $40 million to $60 million for next year. I think for now, that's fine. We'll update you by the end of the year. But again, while states are opting in, there's a long way to go between now and the end of the year.

We had an exceptionally strong Q4 of last year with products revenue growing 9%. But as I mentioned, North America, which is 2/3 of the company's revenue, the demand has been pretty steady, 2015, 2016, the first half of this year. Product backlog, which is a reasonable indicator for visibility going forward, up about $400 million around -- from a North America perspective over the same 10 quarters. And the thing that I'm particularly pleased about in Q2 is the systems demand. So when these land mobile radio platforms or systems go in, they're going in for the long term, which you will then load with subscriber devices, which you'll then add to with agencies and secondary and tertiary users. And they typically go in with 10- and 15-year maintenance agreements. So I think the demand has been pretty steady. I think also part of it is Molloy's team has been pretty consistent in execution. Latin America has gone from a negative to a positive and the team down there has done a very nice job. And EMEA, under new leadership, with Mark Schmidl doing a very good job. New leadership in the channel organization, changes we've made, better execution. So I think it's a combination of demand being steady and strong around the globe, led by North America from a systems standpoint and strong execution from the worldwide sales team."

One was Airwave FX and the purchase accounting adjustment -- catch-up adjustment year-to-date in 2016. That would be obviously reflected in the services gross margin as well as a shift to systems in North America. Greg mentioned and I've mentioned in prepared remarks the strength of systems in North America as well as some ERP-related -- ERP implementation-related costs in Q2. So Q2 margin down approximately 160 basis points, spread across really those 3 issues.

I saw the note that you referenced around land mobile radio licensing decline. I think there's a few things to note from a clarification standpoint. I'm not surprised by it at all but, at the same token, number one, a large number of customers are converting to P25 TDMA. That has a 2:1 spectral efficiency so you'll literally need half the license than you previously would need as you move to upgrade to a more efficient P25 TDMA deployment. In addition to that, number two, we're seeing more customers increase statewide and regionwide deployments, taking advantage of the 700-megahertz frequency. The impact is the same. I mean, demand, if anything, continues to go up for LMR. But the actual system or license, spectrum licenses could decline because the systems are spread over new bands and they're much more spectrally efficient. So -- and the last thing I'd mention is I know that, that referenced a slight period of several years ago associated with narrowband. So while I think it's interesting, I do not think it's a good proxy or correlation to use to judge the demand for our land mobile radio business, in particular, P25 because all systems are green and over a sustainable period of time and through the second half of this year."

There's a difference between push-to-talk over cellular and mission-critical push-to-talk over cellular. I think the demand that we're seeing for land mobile radio systems and product backlog, along with these customers buying brand-new systems with 10- and 15-year maintenance, speaks to what they think firsthand North America-led, U.S.-led on the criticality, durability and longevity of land mobile radio here. I think that you'll read and hear things about other push-to-talk solutions. The confusing thing is some people call it mission-critical push-to-talk, whether they reference it in 3GPP release 13 or 14 or now they're talking about release 15. But I don't think it changes what we're seeing, which is continued strong demand for P25 systems U.S.-led. The last thing I'd mention is we now have won 5 of the largest public safety LTE awards in the world: Los Angeles, FirstNet as a subcontractor to AT&T; the U.K. Home Office in the form of ESN; and 2 countries in the Middle East. And what we see in all of those cases, 5 out of 5 is continued strong investment, either upgrading or in some cases, brand-new land mobile radio, which speaks to the coexistence and the expectation by our customers that public safety LTE will be data focused and video focused while mission-critical voice will continue to be provisioned over P25."

We want to maintain our edge in what we provide and not disclose what we don't need to. But we'll competitively bid and enthusiastically go head-to-head against anybody we need to.

So I think the team continues to do things on the OpEx side. And on the efficiency side, which avail themselves for us to take advantage of. By the way, we talked about the ERP implementation that we cut over in April. That will be on Phase 1 completed here in Q3. Eventually, as we get more conversion and completion of that system, there's requisite efficiencies and IT costs and business process efficiencies that I think could be reflected over the longer term.

And I think -- so what -- when you think about that, it does a couple of things. It tells you there's continued and sustained interest in P25. And the second thing is just, due to our sales coverage in the federal market, is in these multi-vendor environments, we perform very well.

Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of the men and women in public safety. First responders work hard every day to serve and protect our communities, and their critical importance was exemplified during the recent natural disasters. We've dedicated to helping our customers to be their best in the moments that matter. So I'd also like to thank all of our employees for their role in assisting public safety to ensure that mission-critical communications remained operational during these extreme events over the last few months. 
With that, I'd turn to quarterly results and share a few thoughts about the business. First, Q3 was another outstanding quarter, driven by strong sales growth in our Land Mobile Radio business. Total revenue grew 7%. Organic revenue grew 5%. Organic revenue in North America also grew 5% and we grew organically in every region. These results reflect the continued customer demand for always-on, private, secure, reliable and redundant mission-critical voice communications.
Second, we're raising our full year outlook again for both revenue and EPS on continued LMR demand and execution, led by North America. We now expect full year 2017 revenue growth of approximately 5% and non-GAAP EPS of $5.35 to $5.40. And finally, I'm especially pleased with our momentum heading into Q4 and into 2018. Not only have we grown revenues 6% year-to-date but we also finished Q3 with record backlog. The primary driver of growth is continued strong demand in North America which has year-to-date revenue growth of 4% and ending backlog up over $1 billion from a year ago. Considering that many of our systems typically last 10 to 20 years, this demand is a testament to the criticality and longevity of our LMR business. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook before returning for some closing thoughts."

Q3 results include revenue of $1.6 billion, up 7% versus last year including approximately $40 million of revenue from acquisitions. Organic revenue was up 5%. GAAP operating earnings of $338 million, down $3 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $423 million, up 7% or $27 million from the prior year. Operating margins were 25.7% of sales, comparable to last year. GAAP earnings per share was $1.25, up 11% from $1.13 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.53, up 12% from $1.37 last year. Ending backlog was $8.9 billion, up $768 million from last year. Product backlog was up $344 million and Services backlog was up $424 million.
For the remainder of the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted. 
Q3 product sales were $989 million, up 8% from last year, led by North America and EMEA on continued demand for P25 systems for both public safety and commercial customers.
Q3 products segment operating income was $287 million or 29% of sales, up 260 basis points from last year, driven primarily by higher sales and lower OpEx. Gross margins were flat compared to the prior year.
Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.8 billion, up $344 million or 24% versus last year. This is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, products backlog was up $203 million or 13%. The year-over-year and sequential backlog growth continues to be driven by North America, which had 13 P25 system orders valued at over $10 million each.
Turning to services. Q3 services revenue was $656 million, up 7% from last year. Our Managed and Support services revenue grew 8%. Services operating income was $136 million or 20.7% of sales, down from 25% last year. As expected, gross margins returned to the mid 30s from the high 30s in the year ago quarter. As previously noted, we continue to expect gross margins in the mid-30 range for the Services segment. Additionally, OpEx was up $10 million in the segment primarily as a result of acquisitions.
Services backlog ended at $7.1 billion, up $424 million or 6% from last year including approximately $400 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $228 million including $116 million of favorable currency adjustments. Services backlog continues to be driven primarily by North America demand for long-term Managed and Support services contract.
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx up from continuing operations was $375 million, up $5 million from the year-ago quarter inclusive of $12 million related to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $52 million compared to $48 million in the year-ago quarter. The Q3 effective tax rate was 29.9%.
Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $270 million, a decrease of $78 million from last year, driven by higher working capital associated with the ERP implementation and higher tax payments. Free cash flow was $185 million, a decrease of $95 million from last year. From a trailing 12-month perspective, free cash flow was up $20 million. We expect approximately $1.2 billion in operating cash flow for 2017. We ended Q3 with cash of $717 million and a net debt position of $3.8 billion. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of stock at an average price of $87.54 and we paid dividends of $76 million. Additionally, we paid $205 million in cash related to the acquisition of Kodiak. Today, we also announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 11% to $0.52 per share.
Turning to our outlook. We are raising our Q4 and full year guidance. We expect Q4 revenue growth of approximately 3% with non-GAAP EPS between $2 and $2.05. We now expect full year 2017 revenue growth of approximately 5% versus our previous forecast of 3% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $5.35 to $5.40, an increase from the prior outlook of $5.20 to $5.30. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 169 million shares. 
Full year operating expenses are expected to be $1.48 billion, down approximately $15 million from 2016 including approximately $45 million of OpEx from acquisitions.
We expect the full year 2017 effective tax rate to be approximately 32% and operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion for the year.
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 9% driven by organic growth of 5% in North America. This growth was driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services as well as demand for PCR products, serving commercial customers. Backlog is also up more than $1.2 billion year-over-year and up more than $500 million sequentially as customers continue to invest in LMR solutions for the long term. EMEA was up 6% on strong demand in Products while backlog was down from the Airwave revenue conversion. Asia Pac was up 1% primarily driven by services.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights. In our Products segment, we won several deals that include a $79 million award to deploy a P25 system for 3 counties in the state of Oregon; a $54 million award for a P25 system in Memphis, Tennessee; and a $24 million award for a P25 system in Burlington, New Jersey. 
In our Services segment, we were awarded 3 new Managed and Support contracts that extend support for P25 networks through the year 2028. These include a $26 million support contract in the Phoenix area, a $12 million contract for Stafford County, Virginia and a $10 million regional contract in Georgia.
Additionally, from a technology perspective, we introduced the PSX Application Suite, providing push-to-talk, messaging and mapping applications designed specifically for public safety LTE users. We announced responder alert, technology that triggers automatic alerts to the command center for events such as weapon drawn or fired. The Motorola Public Safety LTE LEX F10 handset and the VML 750 vehicular modem were added to the firstnet.com website and AT&T's speed portal. 
And finally, we closed the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, which provides push-to-talk over cellular solutions in North America, Latin America and Europe for customers such as AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, Bell Canada and Telefonica. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

First, we raised our full year revenue and EPS forecast again. Our customers continue to require always-on voice communication for mission-critical situations and that was reinforced by the reliability of our systems during the recent U.S. hurricanes. Second, I'm confident with our strategic position. We're leveraging our LMR systems installed base to attach incremental services while simultaneously building complementary platforms for the command center and public safety LTE, which, together, provide the foundation for continued growth, continued cash generation and continued earnings expansion and shareholder return over the long term. And finally, with our record ending backlog, I think we're very well positioned for continued growth heading into 2018. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris."

We've grown organically, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in all regions. I think we've also seen strength in commercial markets as well as state and local and federal. And quite frankly, I think overall, our execution in sales coverage is stronger than it was a year ago or 18 months ago. We do expect to grow in 2018 and we expect to grow organically in 2018.

Now that said, once that's all behind us, then the rubber meets the road on end-user decisions, decisions by city, municipality, county, state and the individual decisions of whether they switch to their existing carrier because it's a carrier-to-carrier switch and what they do. And we'll work with our partner, AT&T, to see how much traction we can get in that regard. The only other thing I'd say on the Verizon front, they're going to do what they're going to do but we closed on the acquisition of Kodiak. Verizon uses Kodiak as a push-to-talk solution today. So we now have working with Verizon on that front. But I think we'll have a better update for you on the Q4 earnings call around FirstNet and our view in terms of fiscal '18 financially."

Just this afternoon, I met with a customer from Holten Canada who just recently secured a private LTE network from Motorola. Interestingly enough, just 10 months ago, they signed an 8-year SUA and a P25 network that they procured just 3 years ago. So I think you'll see parallel path, P25 will continue to be the mission-critical voice solution for our customer base. As Greg alluded to, hasn't slowed any discussion, hasn't slowed cycles. In fact, we closed 13 deals over $15 million, as Gino alluded to. In the conversation I had with Holten today was really around next-generation applications, mobile intelligence, how you ultimately link command center intelligence, which plays into the investments we're making there to making officers more efficient and optimize what they do from an intelligence perspective in the field. Think about moving records CAD, those kinds of things into the field more seamlessly. So really it hasn't slowed, but we think there's a real good story on both ends and parallel path."

Andrew Sinclair, really happy with the hire. You know that we're moving more toward software and services. Recurring services were 40% of our overall revenue in Q3. Recurring revenue was 27% of our revenue in Q3, and we've said that we will play a greater role in the command center. We've made acquisitions that reflect that stated strategy.

Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of the men and women in public safety. First responders work hard every day to serve and protect our communities, and their critical importance was exemplified during the recent natural disasters. We're dedicated to helping our customers be their best in the moments that matter. So I'd also like to thank all of our employees for their role in assisting public safety to ensure that mission-critical communications remained operational during these extreme events over the last few months. 
With that, I'd turn to quarterly results and share a few thoughts about the business. First, Q3 was another outstanding quarter, driven by strong sales growth in our Land Mobile Radio business. Total revenue grew 7%. Organic revenue grew 5%. Organic revenue in North America also grew 5%, and we grew organically in every region. These results reflect the continued customer demand for always-on, private, secure, reliable and redundant mission-critical voice communications.
Second, we're raising our full year outlook again for both revenue and EPS on continued LMR demand and execution, led by North America. We now expect full year 2017 revenue growth of approximately 5% and non-GAAP EPS of $5.35 to $5.40. And finally, I'm especially pleased with our momentum heading into Q4 and into 2018. Not only have we grown revenues 6% year-to-date, but we also finished Q3 with record backlog. The primary driver of growth is continued strong demand in North America which has year-to-date revenue growth of 4% and ending backlog up over $1 billion from a year ago. Considering that many of our systems typically last 10 to 20 years, this demand is a testament to the criticality and longevity of our LMR business. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts."

Operating margins were 25.7% of sales, comparable to last year. GAAP earnings per share was $1.25, up 11% from $1.13 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.53, up 12% from $1.37 last year. Ending backlog was $8.9 billion, up $768 million from last year. Product backlog was up $344 million and Services backlog was up $424 million.
For the remainder of the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted. 
Q3 product sales were $989 million, up 8% from last year, led by North America and EMEA on continued demand for P25 systems for both public safety and commercial customers.
Q3 Products segment operating income was $287 million, or 29% of sales, up 260 basis points from last year, driven primarily by higher sales and lower OpEx. Gross margins were flat compared to the prior year.
Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.8 billion, up $344 million, or 24%, versus last year. This is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, Products backlog was up $203 million, or 13%. The year-over-year and sequential backlog growth continues to be driven by North America, which had 13 P25 system orders valued at over $10 million each.
Turning to Services. Q3 Services revenue was $656 million, up 7% from last year. Our Managed and Support Services revenue grew 8%. Services operating income was $136 million or 20.7% of sales, down from 25% last year. As expected, gross margins returned to the mid-30s from the high 30s in the year ago quarter. As previously noted, we continue to expect gross margins in the mid-30 range for the Services segment. Additionally, OpEx was up $10 million in the segment, primarily as a result of acquisitions.
Services backlog ended at $7.1 billion, up $424 million, or 6%, from last year, including approximately $400 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $228 million, including $116 million of favorable currency adjustments. Services backlog continues to be driven primarily by North America demand for long-term Managed and Support Services contract.
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx from continuing operations was $375 million, up $5 million from the year ago quarter, inclusive of $12 million related to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $52 million, compared to $48 million in the year ago quarter. The Q3 effective tax rate was 29.9%.
Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $270 million, a decrease of $78 million from last year, driven by higher working capital associated with the ERP implementation and higher tax payments. Free cash flow was $185 million, a decrease of $95 million from last year. From a trailing 12-month perspective, free cash flow was up $20 million. We expect approximately $1.2 billion in operating cash flow for 2017. We ended Q3 with cash of $717 million and a net debt position of $3.8 billion. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of stock at an average price of $87.54, and we paid dividends of $76 million. Additionally, we paid $205 million in cash related to the acquisition of Kodiak. Today, we also announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 11% to $0.52 per share.
Turning to our outlook. We are raising our Q4 and full year guidance. We expect Q4 revenue growth of approximately 3% with non-GAAP EPS between $2 and $2.05. We now expect full year 2017 revenue growth of approximately 5% versus our previous forecast of 3% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $5.35 to $5.40, an increase from the prior outlook of $5.20 to $5.30. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 169 million shares. 
Full year operating expenses are expected to be $1.48 billion, down approximately $15 million from 2016 including approximately $45 million of OpEx from acquisitions.
We expect the full year 2017 effective tax rate to be approximately 32%, and operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion for the year.
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 9%, driven by organic growth of 5% in North America. This growth was driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services as well as demand for PCR products, serving commercial customers. 
Backlog is also up more than $1.2 billion year-over-year and up more than $500 million sequentially, as customers continue to invest in LMR solutions for the long term. EMEA was up 6% on strong demand in Products, while backlog was down from the Airwave revenue conversion. Asia Pac was up 1%, primarily driven by Services.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights. In our Products segment, we won several deals that include: a $79 million award to deploy a P25 system for 3 counties in the state of Oregon; a $54 million award for a P25 system in Memphis, Tennessee; and a $24 million award for a P25 system in Burlington, New Jersey. 
In our Services segment, we were awarded 3 new Managed and Support contracts that extend support for P25 networks through the year 2028. These include: a $26 million support contract in the Phoenix area; a $12 million contract for Stafford County, Virginia; and a $10 million regional contract in Georgia.
Additionally, from a technology perspective, we introduced the PSX Application Suite, providing push-to-talk, messaging and mapping applications designed specifically for public safety LTE users. We announced Responder Alert, technology that triggers automatic alerts to the command center for events such as weapon drawn or fired. The Motorola public safety LTE LEX F10 handset and the VML 750 vehicular modem were added to the firstnet.com website and AT&T's Speed portal. 
And finally, we closed the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, which provides push-to-talk over cellular solutions in North America, Latin America and Europe for customers such as AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, Bell Canada and Telefonica. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

We're leveraging our LMR systems installed base to attach incremental services, while simultaneously building complementary platforms for the command center and public safety LTE, which, together, provide the foundation for continued growth, continued cash generation and continued earnings expansion and shareholder return over the long term; and finally, with our record ending backlog, I think we're very well positioned for continued growth heading into 2018.

And we'll work with our partner, AT&T, to see how much traction we can get in that regard. The only other thing I'd say on the Verizon front, they're going do -- what they're going to do, but we closed on the acquisition of Kodiak. Verizon uses Kodiak as a push-to-talk solution today.

I remind you that we don't have any revenue associated with ESN or the U.K. Home Office in 2017. That's one of the reasons why when we think about our LTE revenues for the full year in '17, they're probably closer to $80 million to $90 million this fiscal year than what we thought would be a higher number given to some of the ESN replan work. We continue to work closely with them. Bruce Brda, as you would imagine, has a whole team dedicated to them, and we're working closely accordingly shoulder to shoulder. In terms of other demand, anecdotally, Molloy mentioned Holten, Canada, while small, I think it's symbolic since they just purchased an LMR system a few quarters ago. There's also an LTE Asia Pac customer that I think will make a decision probably in Q1, and it's more in the tens of millions of dollars than the size of some of our other previous awards. But that's really the only next one on the horizon that comes to mind. I think it'll be first 3 or 4 months in 2018. And I think generally speaking, we're working hard and well positioned."

Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of the men and women in public safety. First responders work hard every day to serve and protect our communities, and their critical importance was exemplified during the recent natural disasters. We're dedicated to helping our customers be their best in the moments that matter. So I'd also like to thank all of our employees for their role in assisting public safety to ensure that mission-critical communications remained operational during these extreme events over the last few months. 
With that, I'd turn to quarterly results and share a few thoughts about the business. First, Q3 was another outstanding quarter, driven by strong sales growth in our Land Mobile Radio business. Total revenue grew 7%. Organic revenue grew 5%. Organic revenue in North America also grew 5%, and we grew organically in every region. These results reflect the continued customer demand for always-on, private, secure, reliable and redundant mission-critical voice communications.
Second, we're raising our full year outlook again for both revenue and EPS on continued LMR demand and execution, led by North America. We now expect full year 2017 revenue growth of approximately 5% and non-GAAP EPS of $5.35 to $5.40. And finally, I'm especially pleased with our momentum heading into Q4 and into 2018. Not only have we grown revenues 6% year-to-date, but we also finished Q3 with record backlog. The primary driver of growth is continued strong demand in North America which has year-to-date revenue growth of 4% and ending backlog up over $1 billion from a year ago. Considering that many of our systems typically last 10 to 20 years, this demand is a testament to the criticality and longevity of our LMR business. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts."

Q3 results include revenue of $1.6 billion, up 7% versus last year, including approximately $40 million of revenue from acquisitions. Organic revenue was up 5%. GAAP operating earnings of $338 million, down $3 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $423 million, up 7% or $27 million from the prior year. Operating margins were 25.7% of sales, comparable to last year. GAAP earnings per share was $1.25, up 11% from $1.13 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.53, up 12% from $1.37 last year. Ending backlog was $8.9 billion, up $768 million from last year. Product backlog was up $344 million and Services backlog was up $424 million.
For the remainder of the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted. 
Q3 product sales were $989 million, up 8% from last year, led by North America and EMEA on continued demand for P25 systems for both public safety and commercial customers.
Q3 Products segment operating income was $287 million, or 29% of sales, up 260 basis points from last year, driven primarily by higher sales and lower OpEx. Gross margins were flat compared to the prior year.
Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.8 billion, up $344 million, or 24%, versus last year. This is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, Products backlog was up $203 million, or 13%. The year-over-year and sequential backlog growth continues to be driven by North America, which had 13 P25 system orders valued at over $10 million each.
Turning to Services. Q3 Services revenue was $656 million, up 7% from last year. Our Managed and Support Services revenue grew 8%. Services operating income was $136 million or 20.7% of sales, down from 25% last year. As expected, gross margins returned to the mid-30s from the high 30s in the year ago quarter. As previously noted, we continue to expect gross margins in the mid-30 range for the Services segment. Additionally, OpEx was up $10 million in the segment, primarily as a result of acquisitions.
Services backlog ended at $7.1 billion, up $424 million, or 6%, from last year, including approximately $400 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $228 million, including $116 million of favorable currency adjustments. Services backlog continues to be driven primarily by North America demand for long-term Managed and Support Services contract.
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx from continuing operations was $375 million, up $5 million from the year ago quarter, inclusive of $12 million related to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $52 million, compared to $48 million in the year ago quarter. The Q3 effective tax rate was 29.9%.
Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $270 million, a decrease of $78 million from last year, driven by higher working capital associated with the ERP implementation and higher tax payments. Free cash flow was $185 million, a decrease of $95 million from last year. From a trailing 12-month perspective, free cash flow was up $20 million. We expect approximately $1.2 billion in operating cash flow for 2017. We ended Q3 with cash of $717 million and a net debt position of $3.8 billion. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of stock at an average price of $87.54, and we paid dividends of $76 million. Additionally, we paid $205 million in cash related to the acquisition of Kodiak. Today, we also announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 11% to $0.52 per share.
Turning to our outlook. We are raising our Q4 and full year guidance. We expect Q4 revenue growth of approximately 3% with non-GAAP EPS between $2 and $2.05. We now expect full year 2017 revenue growth of approximately 5% versus our previous forecast of 3% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $5.35 to $5.40, an increase from the prior outlook of $5.20 to $5.30. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 169 million shares. 
Full year operating expenses are expected to be $1.48 billion, down approximately $15 million from 2016 including approximately $45 million of OpEx from acquisitions.
We expect the full year 2017 effective tax rate to be approximately 32%, and operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion for the year.
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 9%, driven by organic growth of 5% in North America. This growth was driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services as well as demand for PCR products, serving commercial customers. 
Backlog is also up more than $1.2 billion year-over-year and up more than $500 million sequentially, as customers continue to invest in LMR solutions for the long term. EMEA was up 6% on strong demand in Products, while backlog was down from the Airwave revenue conversion. Asia Pac was up 1%, primarily driven by Services.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights. In our Products segment, we won several deals that include: a $79 million award to deploy a P25 system for 3 counties in the state of Oregon; a $54 million award for a P25 system in Memphis, Tennessee; and a $24 million award for a P25 system in Burlington, New Jersey. 
In our Services segment, we were awarded 3 new Managed and Support contracts that extend support for P25 networks through the year 2028. These include: a $26 million support contract in the Phoenix area; a $12 million contract for Stafford County, Virginia; and a $10 million regional contract in Georgia.
Additionally, from a technology perspective, we introduced the PSX Application Suite, providing push-to-talk, messaging and mapping applications designed specifically for public safety LTE users. We announced Responder Alert, technology that triggers automatic alerts to the command center for events such as weapon drawn or fired. The Motorola public safety LTE LEX F10 handset and the VML 750 vehicular modem were added to the firstnet.com website and AT&T's Speed portal. 
And finally, we closed the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, which provides push-to-talk over cellular solutions in North America, Latin America and Europe for customers such as AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, Bell Canada and Telefonica. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me just close with 3 final thoughts: First, we raised our full year revenue and EPS forecast again. Our customers continue to require always-on voice communication for mission-critical situations, and that was reinforced by the reliability of our systems during the recent U.S. hurricanes; second, I'm confident with our strategic position. We're leveraging our LMR systems installed base to attach incremental services, while simultaneously building complementary platforms for the command center and public safety LTE, which, together, provide the foundation for continued growth, continued cash generation and continued earnings expansion and shareholder return over the long term; and finally, with our record ending backlog, I think we're very well positioned for continued growth heading into 2018. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris."

I feel good about the ending backlog, and I feel good about the foundation that we have to build on, heading into next year. I think overall demand remains strong. It's been strong in North America. We've grown organically, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in all regions. I think we've also seen strength in commercial markets as well as state, local and federal. And quite frankly, I think overall, our execution in sales coverage is stronger than it was a year ago or 18 months ago. We do expect to grow in 2018, and we expect to grow organically in 2018.

Now that said, once that's all behind us, then the rubber meets the road on end user decisions, decisions by city, municipality, county, state and the individual decisions of whether they switch to their existing carrier, because it's a carrier-to-carrier switch, and what they do. And we'll work with our partner, AT&T, to see how much traction we can get in that regard. The only other thing I'd say on the Verizon front, they're going do -- what they're going to do, but we closed on the acquisition of Kodiak. Verizon uses Kodiak as a push-to-talk solution today. So we now have entrée working with Verizon on that front. But I think, we'll have a better update for you on the Q4 earnings call around FirstNet and our view in terms of fiscal '18 financially."

In fact, we closed 13 deals, over $15 million, as Gino alluded to. And the conversation with Holten today was really around next-generation applications, mobile intelligence, how you ultimately link command center intelligence, which plays into the investments we're making there to making officers more efficient and optimize what they do from an intelligence perspective in the field.

All the systems stayed up. It's pretty noteworthy and significant. By the way, the Q3 print really didn't have anything material at all, as it relates the hurricanes. I think the opportunity for future add-on business or rebuild exists going forward, but the strength of Q3 was more around the fundamental core demand of what we're seeing, state and local, commercial, federal, North America-led. Andrew Sinclair, really happy with the hire. You know that we're moving more toward software and services. Recurring -- Services were 40% overall revenue in Q3. Recurring revenue was 27% of our revenue in Q3, and we've said that we will play a greater role in the command center. We've made acquisitions that reflect that stated strategy.

I remind you that we don't have any revenue associated with ESN or the U.K. Home Office in 2017. That's one of the reasons why when we think about our LTE revenues for the full year in '17, they're probably closer to $80 million to $90 million this fiscal year than what we thought would be a higher number given to some of the ESN replan work. We continue to work closely with them. Bruce Brda, as you would imagine, has a whole team dedicated to them, and we're working closely accordingly shoulder to shoulder. In terms of other demand, anecdotally, Molloy mentioned Holten, Canada, while small, I think it's symbolic since they just purchased an LMR system a few quarters ago. There's also an LTE Asia Pac customer that I think will make a decision probably in Q1, and it's more in the tens of millions of dollars than the size of some of our other previous awards.

Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of the men and women in public safety. First responders work hard every day to serve and protect our communities, and their critical importance was exemplified during the recent natural disasters. We're dedicated to helping our customers be their best in the moments that matter. So I'd also like to thank all of our employees for their role in assisting public safety to ensure that mission-critical communications remained operational during these extreme events over the last few months. 
With that, I'd turn to quarterly results and share a few thoughts about the business. First, Q3 was another outstanding quarter, driven by strong sales growth in our Land Mobile Radio business. Total revenue grew 7%. Organic revenue grew 5%. Organic revenue in North America also grew 5%, and we grew organically in every region. These results reflect the continued customer demand for always-on, private, secure, reliable and redundant mission-critical voice communications.
Second, we're raising our full year outlook again for both revenue and EPS on continued LMR demand and execution, led by North America. We now expect full year 2017 revenue growth of approximately 5% and non-GAAP EPS of $5.35 to $5.40. And finally, I'm especially pleased with our momentum heading into Q4 and into 2018. Not only have we grown revenues 6% year-to-date, but we also finished Q3 with record backlog. The primary driver of growth is continued strong demand in North America which has year-to-date revenue growth of 4% and ending backlog up over $1 billion from a year ago. Considering that many of our systems typically last 10 to 20 years, this demand is a testament to the criticality and longevity of our LMR business. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts."

Q3 results include revenue of $1.6 billion, up 7% versus last year, including approximately $40 million of revenue from acquisitions. Organic revenue was up 5%. GAAP operating earnings of $338 million, down $3 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $423 million, up 7% or $27 million from the prior year. Operating margins were 25.7% of sales, comparable to last year. GAAP earnings per share was $1.25, up 11% from $1.13 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.53, up 12% from $1.37 last year. Ending backlog was $8.9 billion, up $768 million from last year. Product backlog was up $344 million and Services backlog was up $424 million.
For the remainder of the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted. 
Q3 product sales were $989 million, up 8% from last year, led by North America and EMEA on continued demand for P25 systems for both public safety and commercial customers.
Q3 Products segment operating income was $287 million, or 29% of sales, up 260 basis points from last year, driven primarily by higher sales and lower OpEx. Gross margins were flat compared to the prior year.
Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.8 billion, up $344 million, or 24%, versus last year. This is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, Products backlog was up $203 million, or 13%. The year-over-year and sequential backlog growth continues to be driven by North America, which had 13 P25 system orders valued at over $10 million each.
Turning to Services. Q3 Services revenue was $656 million, up 7% from last year. Our Managed and Support Services revenue grew 8%. Services operating income was $136 million or 20.7% of sales, down from 25% last year. As expected, gross margins returned to the mid-30s from the high 30s in the year ago quarter. As previously noted, we continue to expect gross margins in the mid-30 range for the Services segment. Additionally, OpEx was up $10 million in the segment, primarily as a result of acquisitions.
Services backlog ended at $7.1 billion, up $424 million, or 6%, from last year, including approximately $400 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $228 million, including $116 million of favorable currency adjustments. Services backlog continues to be driven primarily by North America demand for long-term Managed and Support Services contract.
Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx from continuing operations was $375 million, up $5 million from the year ago quarter, inclusive of $12 million related to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $52 million, compared to $48 million in the year ago quarter. The Q3 effective tax rate was 29.9%.
Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $270 million, a decrease of $78 million from last year, driven by higher working capital associated with the ERP implementation and higher tax payments. Free cash flow was $185 million, a decrease of $95 million from last year. From a trailing 12-month perspective, free cash flow was up $20 million. We expect approximately $1.2 billion in operating cash flow for 2017. We ended Q3 with cash of $717 million and a net debt position of $3.8 billion. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of stock at an average price of $87.54, and we paid dividends of $76 million. Additionally, we paid $205 million in cash related to the acquisition of Kodiak. Today, we also announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 11% to $0.52 per share.
Turning to our outlook. We are raising our Q4 and full year guidance. We expect Q4 revenue growth of approximately 3% with non-GAAP EPS between $2 and $2.05. We now expect full year 2017 revenue growth of approximately 5% versus our previous forecast of 3% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $5.35 to $5.40, an increase from the prior outlook of $5.20 to $5.30. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 169 million shares. 
Full year operating expenses are expected to be $1.48 billion, down approximately $15 million from 2016 including approximately $45 million of OpEx from acquisitions.
We expect the full year 2017 effective tax rate to be approximately 32%, and operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion for the year.
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 9%, driven by organic growth of 5% in North America. This growth was driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services as well as demand for PCR products, serving commercial customers. 
Backlog is also up more than $1.2 billion year-over-year and up more than $500 million sequentially, as customers continue to invest in LMR solutions for the long term. EMEA was up 6% on strong demand in Products, while backlog was down from the Airwave revenue conversion. Asia Pac was up 1%, primarily driven by Services.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights. In our Products segment, we won several deals that include: a $79 million award to deploy a P25 system for 3 counties in the state of Oregon; a $54 million award for a P25 system in Memphis, Tennessee; and a $24 million award for a P25 system in Burlington, New Jersey. 
In our Services segment, we were awarded 3 new Managed and Support contracts that extend support for P25 networks through the year 2028. These include: a $26 million support contract in the Phoenix area; a $12 million contract for Stafford County, Virginia; and a $10 million regional contract in Georgia.
Additionally, from a technology perspective, we introduced the PSX Application Suite, providing push-to-talk, messaging and mapping applications designed specifically for public safety LTE users. We announced Responder Alert, technology that triggers automatic alerts to the command center for events such as weapon drawn or fired. The Motorola public safety LTE LEX F10 handset and the VML 750 vehicular modem were added to the firstnet.com website and AT&T's Speed portal. 
And finally, we closed the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, which provides push-to-talk over cellular solutions in North America, Latin America and Europe for customers such as AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, Bell Canada and Telefonica. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

Let me just close with 3 final thoughts: First, we raised our full year revenue and EPS forecast again. Our customers continue to require always-on voice communication for mission-critical situations, and that was reinforced by the reliability of our systems during the recent U.S. hurricanes; second, I'm confident with our strategic position. We're leveraging our LMR systems installed base to attach incremental services, while simultaneously building complementary platforms for the command center and public safety LTE, which, together, provide the foundation for continued growth, continued cash generation and continued earnings expansion and shareholder return over the long term; and finally, with our record ending backlog, I think we're very well positioned for continued growth heading into 2018.

And we'll work with our partner, AT&T, to see how much traction we can get in that regard. The only other thing I'd say on the Verizon front, they're going do -- what they're going to do, but we closed on the acquisition of Kodiak. Verizon uses Kodiak as a push-to-talk solution today.

I mean it's a one-of-a-kind. So we're working closely with them. You've seen public announcements where they have, kind of, resized and re-estimated the time line in that regard. I remind you that we don't have any revenue associated with ESN or the U.K. Home Office in 2017. That's one of the reasons why when we think about our LTE revenues for the full year in '17, they're probably closer to $80 million to $90 million this fiscal year than what we thought would be a higher number given to some of the ESN replan work. We continue to work closely with them. Bruce Brda, as you would imagine, has a whole team dedicated to them, and we're working closely accordingly shoulder to shoulder. In terms of other demand, anecdotally, Molloy mentioned Holten, Canada, while small, I think it's symbolic since they just purchased an LMR system a few quarters ago. There's also an LTE Asia Pac customer that I think will make a decision probably in Q1, and it's more in the tens of millions of dollars than the size of some of our other previous awards. But that's really the only next one on the horizon that comes to mind. I think it'll be first 3 or 4 months in 2018. And I think generally speaking, we're working hard and well positioned."
