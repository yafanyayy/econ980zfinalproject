With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal second quarter financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal third quarter.
At our Investor Day in December, we took the opportunity to present our differentiated platform, strategy and business model and to [ph] describe the significant growth opportunities for our company. With the growing storage industry and evolving data-driven requirements, we are uniquely positioned to help define and drive the storage architectures of the future. We are pleased with the increasingly strategic interactions we are having with customers, validating our approach to value creation.
We reported strong financial performance in the December quarter enabled by excellent operational execution by our team. The favorable trends across all of our end markets that begin earlier in 2016 continued. This included healthy demand for capacity enterprise hard drives, all NAND-based products and hard drives in client [ph] applications helped by stronger-than-expected PC demand. We reported revenue of $4.9 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 37% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30, outperforming the revised guidance provided at our Investor Day.
We continue to execute well on 2 key strategic priorities: the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD; and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology. The transition to 3D NAND technology continues as planned with the ramp of our 64-layer architecture. We commenced retail shipments in [ph] OEM sampling of our 64-layer products in the December quarter. As we demonstrated at Investor Day, we are executing methodically and thoughtfully on our technology strategy, and we fully expect our leadership in 2D NAND to extend into 3D NAND. 
In 2017 and beyond, you will see the deployment of our 64-layer 3D NAND across our product portfolio, spanning removable, embedded, client SSD and enterprise SSD offerings.
As we all know from recent disclosures by Toshiba and news reports, our Flash joint venture partner is facing challenges. We have been in regular communication with them over the last several weeks. We are confident that their semiconductor memory business remains healthy and strategically viable. Under any circumstance, we will act to protect Western Digital's interest and work to ensure that we maintain the leadership position of our joint venture. 
In closing, I want to express my gratitude to our Chief Technology Officer, Steve Campbell, who is leaving the company after 20 years of distinguished service to Western Digital. I also want to welcome Martin Fink [ph] onboard as our new CTO. Martin brings deep storage systems and memory-driven computing expertise that will help us accelerate our ongoing transformation. I am sure Martin is known to many of you from his years at HP where he most recently served as CTO and Director of HP Labs at HP Enterprise. I'm delighted to have him on the senior team at Western Digital. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the December quarter."

Our December quarter results reflect strong execution across our portfolio amidst a favorable industry environment in both flash and hard disk drive markets.

Our December quarter results reflect strong execution across our portfolio amidst a favorable industry environment in both flash and hard disk drive markets. Demand remained robust throughout the quarter and we launched several new products, further expanding the breadth of our offering. We made additional gains in the ongoing conversion of 3D NAND technology, and the commercial ramp of our 64-layer technology is accelerating. We are building stronger and deeper partnerships with our customers as our platforms increasingly align with our customer strategic directions. 
Overall, we had a strong finish to calendar 2016, providing business momentum as we enter 2017. 
In client devices, our participation with OEM customers has meaningly [ph] increased as a broadening portfolio of hard drives and flash-based solutions address the PC market that is healthier than expected. Our revenue from client devices increased sequentially, primarily driven by client SSDs and [ph] embedded products as revenue synergies from the SanDisk acquisition benefited us further in a seasonally strong quarter.
Increasing storage capacities in mobile phones and market preference for client SSDs are long-term tailwinds for this portion of our business.
Switching to client solutions, we experienced robust holiday seasonal demand and achieved sequential revenue growth driven by key NAND-based products. We are pleased to note that the combined revenue contribution from new products such as iXpand and dual USB drives also grew, underscoring continued consumer enthusiasm for our retail branded solutions. We announced new retail products, including the 4-terabyte mypassport, [ph] the 8-terabyte My Book hard drive for the PC, and a new 4-terabyte hard drive for the Mac. Shipments of our 64-layer 3D NAND-based retail products began in the December quarter, and we expect an increasing use of this underlying technology in our portfolio in 2017 and beyond. 
In the data center category, demand for high-capacity storage devices remain very strong. Year-over-year petabyte growth for capacity-optimized hard drives met our upwardly revised expectation, which we had estimated at 40% growth. We are pleased with the mainstream adoption of our 10-terabyte third-generation Helium drive. We have revised our planning to anticipate petabyte year-over-year demand growth for capacity-optimized hard drives to continue at approximately the same 40% rate compared to our prior forecast of about 35%. 
At our Investor Day, we announced a 12-terabyte capacity Helium drive as well as a derivative assay motor [ph -based 14-terabyte drive, marking the start of our fourth generation Helium product line. The traction we have achieved on our Helium drive offerings, which were launched 4 years ago, demonstrates true cost of ownership value for our customers, and we look forward to providing them with ongoing innovation around this platform. Notably, the December quarter marked a cumulative shipment milestone of more than 12 million Helium drives, reflecting our leadership in this category. 
From an enterprise SSD standpoint, we experienced strong demand across our products at both hyperscale and OEM accounts, driving sequential revenue growth. In the December quarter, we announced our latest NVMe PCIe [ph] enterprise class SSD with leading performance and high-capacity SaaS enterprise SSD contributing to a further expansion of our portfolio. 
In our Data Center Solutions category, our disk and flash storage platform business achieved several new design wins at leading system OEM customers for their cloud scale storage systems. We are achieving new customer wins and solid repeat business from existing customers in key verticals around the world. This nascent business continues to represent a strong growth opportunity for the company. 
Turning to silicon operations. We are very pleased with the progress we are making commercializing our 3D NAND technology. As I indicated earlier, we have already begun retail product shipments containing 64-layer BiCS3, and we also expect to launch client SSDs in [ph] embedded mobile offerings with this technology throughout the year. Additionally, we are on track to begin sampling enterprise SSD products utilizing 64-layer of BiCS3 this calendar year. We expect our broad implementation of BiCS3 across our portfolio will result in Western Digital having the industry's richest mix of 64-layer 3D NAND-based products in calendar 2017, underscoring our growing confidence in [ph] our ability to successfully commercialize this technology. 
In the March quarter, we expect to break ground for the construction of Fab 6 along with our joint venture partner, Toshiba. Fab 6 will provide new clean room space to support continued conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect operations in Fab 6 to commence in calendar 2018. 
In closing, our December quarter results reflect the positive impact of the Western Digital platform, deepening customer relationships helped by our portfolio, and technology expertise along with our global go-to-market capabilities further strengthen us as a leading storage solutions provider. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."
314057,415683199,1116805,"Western Digital Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2017",2017-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I am pleased with our financial performance this quarter.

I am pleased with our financial performance this quarter. Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalized on our strong product offerings, achieved targeted cost and efficiency improvements and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow performance. We exceeded the revised guidance from our Investor Day on December 6 across our key financial metrics. 
Our revenue for the December quarter was $4.9 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion, client devices was $2.4 billion, and client solutions was $1.1 billion. In each end market, our revenue was flat to up from the September quarter, which underscores our strong performance as the September quarter is typically our strongest period. 
Our data center revenue growth continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. As a result, this quarter, we saw continued strength in capacity enterprise hard drives, sequential growth for performance enterprise hard drives as well as increased demand for enterprise SSDs. Client devices, which include both hard drives and flash-based products, benefited from a healthier PC market as well as traditional seasonal trends. Embedded solutions experienced strong growth, primarily from increases in storage capacity in mobile phones. In client solutions, our revenue grew as a result of strong demand for removable and other flash-based products during the holiday season. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin grew to 36.7%, up 280 basis points versus the September quarter. We achieved this expansion through continued product cost improvements and healthy pricing for our products. Our product cost improvements resulted from consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities.
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $797 million, down $66 million from the September quarter. We continue to make progress towards our integration synergy targets while making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $221 million. Our non-GAAP interest expense was $205 million, a reduction of $31 million from the September quarter, driven by the debt repricings and reductions. Our non-GAAP other expenses, net of interest income, were $16 million for the December quarter. These expenses were primarily a result of foreign exchange revaluations that had no economic or cash impact. While it was an expense in the second quarter, it will result in lower expenses in future periods. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the December quarter was approximately 13%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the December quarter was $675 million or $2.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $235 million or $0.80 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization and charges associated with our acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the December quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations, with $189 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $871 million. We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $142 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.2 billion. We have approximately $6.2 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. Our net debt position has decreased approximately $800 million from the September quarter driven by higher cash balances. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also evaluating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.
As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal second quarter this year, we achieved approximately $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annualized basis.
With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal second quarter, we realized synergies of approximately $135 million on an annual run rate basis, short [ph] our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis. 
To build on what Steve said about our flash joint ventures, it is a important to note that the operations and financial position of flash ventures are healthy, and investments are on track for the significant drop of our 64-layer BiCS3 technology throughout calendar 2017. As a reminder, the joint ventures generate positive cash flow that is used to finance a significant portion of the capital requirements for both partners. I will now provide our guidance for the March quarter on a non-GAAP basis.
As I've previously indicated, we generate slightly more revenue in the second half for the calendar year than in the first half. In that context, we expect revenue for our March quarter to be approximately $4.55 billion, which represents significant year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. As a result, for fiscal 2017, we currently expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that is consistent with our long-term financial model. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to increase to approximately 38%, primarily driven by continued favorable pricing and product mix across our business.
Turning to non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect those to total approximately $800 million, consistent with our December quarter. We continue to make progress with reductions in our costs and, at the same time, support our integration and growth with certain incremental investments. Additionally, we expect OpEx to be essentially flat in the fourth fiscal quarter, consistent with second and third quarter levels. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million. We expect an effective non-GAAP tax rate in the 12% to 14% range. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $2 and $2.10, with an estimated share count of 298 million diluted shares.

I think the fact we've updated and increased our annual growth rate is an indication of our confidence, the ongoing strength. We've talked in previous conference calls around some of the reasons that's happening as there are sort of fewer efficiency things happening in hyperscale, whether they be operational or technological, we believe we continue to see more of the raw or based demand flowing through to us for HD petabyte growth. So we would expect that 40% growth for the current calendar year. Relative to the sort of the way we engage them, I think we talked about this earlier. We certainly benefit from the broad portfolio of products we have. Our ability to participate across both HDD and flash-based product offerings gives us the unique position to work not only short-term relative to sort of business engagement, but also long-term as we think about long-range data center architectures of the future. So we have all the components, we are uniquely positioned to have that conversation and we're already benefiting from that portfolio optimization."

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal second quarter financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal third quarter.
At our Investor Day in December, we took the opportunity to present our differentiated platform, strategy and business model and to describe the significant growth opportunities for our company. With the growing storage industry and evolving data-driven requirements, we are uniquely positioned to help define and drive the storage architectures of the future. We are pleased with the increasingly strategic interactions we are having with customers, validating our approach to value creation.
We reported strong financial performance in the December quarter enabled by excellent operational execution by our team. The favorable trends across all of our end markets that begin earlier in 2016 continued. This included healthy demand for capacity enterprise hard drives, all NAND-based products and hard drives in client applications helped by stronger-than-expected PC demand. We reported revenue of $4.9 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 37% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30, outperforming the revised guidance provided at our Investor Day.
We continue to execute well on 2 key strategic priorities: the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD; and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology. The transition to 3D NAND technology continues as planned with the ramp of our 64-layer architecture. We commenced retail shipments and OEM sampling of our 64-layer products in the December quarter. As we demonstrated at Investor Day, we are executing methodically and thoughtfully on our technology strategy, and we fully expect our leadership in 2D NAND to extend into 3D NAND. 
In 2017 and beyond, you will see the deployment of our 64-layer 3D NAND across our product portfolio, spanning removable, embedded, client SSD and enterprise SSD offerings.
As we all know from recent disclosures by Toshiba and news reports, our Flash joint venture partner is facing challenges. We have been in regular communication with them over the last several weeks. We are confident that their semiconductor memory business remains healthy and strategically viable. Under any circumstance, we will act to protect Western Digital's interest and work to ensure that we maintain the leadership position of our joint venture. 
In closing, I want to express my gratitude to our Chief Technology Officer, Steve Campbell, who is leaving the company after 20 years of distinguished service to Western Digital. I also want to welcome Martin Fink onboard as our new CTO. Martin brings deep storage systems and memory-driven computing expertise that will help us accelerate our ongoing transformation. I am sure Martin is known to many of you from his years at HP where he most recently served as CTO and Director of HP Labs at HP Enterprise. I'm delighted to have him on the senior team at Western Digital.

Our December quarter results reflect strong execution across our portfolio amidst a favorable industry environment in both flash and hard disk drive markets. Demand remained robust throughout the quarter and we launched several new products, further expanding the breadth of our offering. We made additional gains in the ongoing conversion of 3D NAND technology, and the commercial ramp of our 64-layer technology is accelerating. We are building stronger and deeper partnerships with our customers as our platforms increasingly align with our customer strategic directions. 
Overall, we had a strong finish to calendar 2016, providing business momentum as we enter 2017. 
In client devices, our participation with OEM customers has meaningfully [ph] increased as a broadening portfolio of hard drives and flash-based solutions address the PC market that is healthier than expected. Our revenue from client devices increased sequentially, primarily driven by client SSDs and embedded products as revenue synergies from the SanDisk acquisition benefited us further in a seasonally strong quarter.
Increasing storage capacities in mobile phones and market preference for client SSDs are long-term tailwinds for this portion of our business.
Switching to client solutions, we experienced robust holiday seasonal demand and achieved sequential revenue growth driven by key NAND-based products. We are pleased to note that the combined revenue contribution from new products such as iXpand and dual USB drives also grew, underscoring continued consumer enthusiasm for our retail branded solutions. We announced new retail products, including the 4-terabyte My Passport, the 8-terabyte My Book hard drive for the PC, and a new 4-terabyte hard drive for the Mac. Shipments of our 64-layer 3D NAND-based retail products began in the December quarter, and we expect an increasing use of this underlying technology in our portfolio in 2017 and beyond. 
In the data center category, demand for high-capacity storage devices remain very strong. Year-over-year petabyte growth for capacity-optimized hard drives met our upwardly revised expectation, which we had estimated at 40% growth. We are pleased with the mainstream adoption of our 10-terabyte third-generation Helium drive. We have revised our planning to anticipate petabyte year-over-year demand growth for capacity-optimized hard drives to continue at approximately the same 40% rate compared to our prior forecast of about 35%. 
At our Investor Day, we announced a 12-terabyte capacity Helium drive as well as a derivative assay motor-based 14-terabyte drive, marking the start of our fourth generation Helium product line. The traction we have achieved on our Helium drive offerings, which were launched 4 years ago, demonstrates true cost of ownership value for our customers, and we look forward to providing them with ongoing innovation around this platform. Notably, the December quarter marked a cumulative shipment milestone of more than 12 million Helium drives, reflecting our leadership in this category. 
From an enterprise SSD standpoint, we experienced strong demand across our products at both hyperscale and OEM accounts, driving sequential revenue growth. In the December quarter, we announced our latest NVMe PCIe enterprise class SSD with leading performance and high-capacity SaaS enterprise SSD contributing to a further expansion of our portfolio. 
In our Data Center Solutions category, our disk and flash storage platform business achieved several new design wins at leading system OEM customers for their cloud scale storage systems. We are achieving new customer wins and solid repeat business from existing customers in key verticals around the world. This nascent business continues to represent a strong growth opportunity for the company. 
Turning to silicon operations. We are very pleased with the progress we are making commercializing our 3D NAND technology. As I indicated earlier, we have already begun retail product shipments containing 64-layer BiCS3, and we also expect to launch client SSDs in embedded mobile offerings with this technology throughout the year. Additionally, we are on track to begin sampling enterprise SSD products utilizing 64-layer of BiCS3 this calendar year. We expect our broad implementation of BiCS3 across our portfolio will result in Western Digital having the industry's richest mix of 64-layer 3D NAND-based products in calendar 2017, underscoring our growing confidence in our ability to successfully commercialize this technology. 
In the March quarter, we expect to break ground for the construction of Fab 6 along with our joint venture partner, Toshiba. Fab 6 will provide new clean room space to support continued conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect operations in Fab 6 to commence in calendar 2018. 
In closing, our December quarter results reflect the positive impact of the Western Digital platform, deepening customer relationships helped by our portfolio, and technology expertise along with our global go-to-market capabilities further strengthen us as a leading storage solutions provider. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."

I am pleased with our financial performance this quarter. Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalized on our strong product offerings, achieved targeted cost and efficiency improvements and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow performance. We exceeded the revised guidance from our Investor Day on December 6 across our key financial metrics. 
Our revenue for the December quarter was $4.9 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion, client devices was $2.4 billion, and client solutions was $1.1 billion. In each end market, our revenue was flat to up from the September quarter, which underscores our strong performance as the September quarter is typically our strongest period. 
Our data center revenue growth continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. As a result, this quarter, we saw continued strength in capacity enterprise hard drives, sequential growth for performance enterprise hard drives as well as increased demand for enterprise SSDs. Client devices, which include both hard drives and flash-based products, benefited from a healthier PC market as well as traditional seasonal trends. Embedded solutions experienced strong growth, primarily from increases in storage capacity in mobile phones. In client solutions, our revenue grew as a result of strong demand for removable and other flash-based products during the holiday season. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin grew to 36.7%, up 280 basis points versus the September quarter. We achieved this expansion through continued product cost improvements and healthy pricing for our products. Our product cost improvements resulted from consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities.
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $797 million, down $66 million from the September quarter. We continue to make progress towards our integration synergy targets while making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $221 million. Our non-GAAP interest expense was $205 million, a reduction of $31 million from the September quarter, driven by the debt repricings and reductions. Our non-GAAP other expenses, net of interest income, were $16 million for the December quarter. These expenses were primarily a result of foreign exchange revaluations that had no economic or cash impact. While it was an expense in the second quarter, it will result in lower expenses in future periods. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the December quarter was approximately 13%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the December quarter was $675 million or $2.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $235 million or $0.80 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization and charges associated with our acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the December quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations, with $189 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $871 million. We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $142 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.2 billion. We have approximately $6.2 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. Our net debt position has decreased approximately $800 million from the September quarter driven by higher cash balances. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also evaluating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.
As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal second quarter this year, we achieved approximately $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annualized basis.
With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal second quarter, we realized synergies of approximately $135 million on an annual run rate basis support our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis. 
To build on what Steve said about our flash joint ventures, it is important to note that the operations and financial position of flash ventures are healthy, and investments are on track for the significant drop of our 64-layer BiCS3 technology throughout calendar 2017. As a reminder, the joint ventures generate positive cash flow that is used to finance a significant portion of the capital requirements for both partners. I will now provide our guidance for the March quarter on a non-GAAP basis.
As I've previously indicated, we generate slightly more revenue in the second half for the calendar year than in the first half. In that context, we expect revenue for our March quarter to be approximately $4.55 billion, which represents significant year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. As a result, for fiscal 2017, we currently expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that is consistent with our long-term financial model. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to increase to approximately 38%, primarily driven by continued favorable pricing and product mix across our business.
Turning to non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect those to total approximately $800 million, consistent with our December quarter. We continue to make progress with reductions in our costs and, at the same time, support our integration and growth with certain incremental investments. Additionally, we expect OpEx to be essentially flat in the fourth fiscal quarter, consistent with second and third quarter levels. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million. We expect an effective non-GAAP tax rate in the 12% to 14% range. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $2 and $2.10, with an estimated share count of 298 million diluted shares.

As well, as Mike indicated, we are seeing good mix in terms of our products, particularly in terms of capacity enterprise. That's helping us. And I think it's also important to note that the margin model that we've talked about, one, is a long-term gross margin model. That doesn't mean to say that, first off, that we're not going to stop at 38%. I mean, if we can improve our margins beyond that, we're going to do that.

So we would expect that 40% growth for the current calendar year. Relative to the sort of the way we engage them, I think we talked about this earlier. We certainly benefit from the broad portfolio of products we have. Our ability to participate across both HDD and flash-based product offerings gives us a unique position to work not only short-term relative to sort of business engagement, but also long-term as we think about long-range data center architectures of the future.

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal second quarter financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal third quarter.
At our Investor Day in December, we took the opportunity to present our differentiated platform, strategy and business model and to describe the significant growth opportunities for our company. With a growing storage industry and evolving data-driven requirements, we are uniquely positioned to help define and drive the storage architectures of the future. We are pleased with the increasingly strategic interactions we are having with customers, validating our approach to value creation.
We reported strong financial performance in the December quarter, enabled by excellent operational execution by our team. The favorable trends across all of our end markets that began earlier in 2016 continued. This included healthy demand for capacity enterprise hard drives, all NAND-based products and hard drives in client applications helped by stronger-than-expected PC demand. We reported revenue of $4.9 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 37% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30, outperforming the revised guidance provided at our Investor Day.
We continue to execute well on 2 key strategic priorities: the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD; and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology. The transition to 3D NAND technology continues as planned with the ramp of our 64-layer architecture. We commenced retail shipments and OEM sampling of our 64-layer products in the December quarter. As we demonstrated at Investor Day, we are executing methodically and thoughtfully on our technology strategy, and we fully expect our leadership in 2D NAND to extend into 3D NAND. 
In 2017 and beyond, you will see the deployment of our 64-layer 3D NAND across our product portfolio, spanning removable, embedded, client SSD and enterprise SSD offerings.
As we all know from recent disclosures by Toshiba and news reports, our flash joint venture partner is facing challenges. We have been in regular communication with them over the last several weeks. We are confident that their semiconductor memory business remains healthy and strategically viable. Under any circumstance, we will act to protect Western Digital's interests and work to ensure that we maintain the leadership position of our joint venture. 
In closing, I want to express my gratitude to our Chief Technology Officer, Steve Campbell, who is leaving the company after 20 years of distinguished service to Western Digital. I also want to welcome Martin Fink onboard as our new CTO. Martin brings deep storage systems and memory-driven computing expertise that will help us accelerate our ongoing transformation. I am sure Martin is known to many of you from his years at HP where he most recently served as CTO and Director of HP Labs at HP Enterprise. I'm delighted to have him on the senior team at Western Digital.

Our December quarter results reflect strong execution across our portfolio amidst a favorable industry environment in both flash and hard disk drive markets. Demand remained robust throughout the quarter and we launched several new products, further expanding the breadth of our offering. We made additional gains in the ongoing conversion of 3D NAND technology, and the commercial ramp of our 64-layer technology is accelerating. We are building stronger and deeper partnerships with our customers as our platforms increasingly align with our customers' strategic directions. 
Overall, we had a strong finish to calendar 2016, providing business momentum as we enter 2017. 
In client devices, our participation with OEM customers has meaningfully [ph] increased as a broadening portfolio of hard drives and flash-based solutions address the PC market that is healthier than expected. Our revenue from client devices increased sequentially, primarily driven by client SSDs and embedded products as revenue synergies from the SanDisk acquisition benefited us further in a seasonally strong quarter.
Increasing storage capacities in mobile phones and market preference for client SSDs are long-term tailwinds for this portion of our business.
Switching to client solutions, we experienced robust holiday seasonal demand and achieved sequential revenue growth driven by key NAND-based products. We are pleased to note that the combined revenue contribution from new products such as iXpand and dual USB drives also grew, underscoring continued consumer enthusiasm for our retail branded solutions. We announced new retail products, including the 4-terabyte My Passport, the 8-terabyte My Book hard drive for the PC, and a new 4-terabyte hard drive for the Mac. Shipments of our 64-layer 3D NAND-based retail products began in the December quarter, and we expect an increasing use of this underlying technology in our portfolio in 2017 and beyond. 
In the data center category, demand for high-capacity storage devices remain very strong. Year-over-year petabyte growth for capacity-optimized hard drives met our upwardly revised expectation, which we had estimated at 40% growth. We are pleased with the mainstream adoption of our 10-terabyte third-generation Helium drive. We have revised our planning to anticipate petabyte year-over-year demand growth for capacity-optimized hard drives to continue at approximately the same 40% rate compared to our prior forecast of about 35%. 
At our Investor Day, we announced a 12-terabyte capacity Helium drive as well as a derivative assay motor-based 14-terabyte drive, marking the start of our fourth generation Helium product line. The traction we have achieved on our Helium drive offerings, which were launched 4 years ago, demonstrates true cost of ownership value for our customers, and we look forward to providing them with ongoing innovation around this platform. Notably, the December quarter marked a cumulative shipment milestone of more than 12 million Helium drives, reflecting our leadership in this category. 
From an enterprise SSD standpoint, we experienced strong demand across our products at both hyperscale and OEM accounts, driving sequential revenue growth. In the December quarter, we announced our latest NVMe PCIe enterprise class SSD with leading performance and a high-capacity SaaS enterprise SSD contributing to a further expansion of our portfolio. 
In our Data Center Solutions category, our disk and flash storage platform business achieved several new design wins at leading system OEM customers for their cloud scale storage systems. We are achieving new customer wins and solid repeat business from existing customers in key verticals around the world. This nascent business continues to represent a strong growth opportunity for the company. 
Turning to silicon operations. We are very pleased with the progress we are making commercializing our 3D NAND technology. As I indicated earlier, we have already begun retail product shipments containing 64-layer BiCS3, and we also expect to launch client SSDs in embedded mobile offerings with this technology throughout the year. Additionally, we are on track to begin sampling enterprise SSD products utilizing 64-layer BiCS3 this calendar year. We expect our broad implementation of BiCS3 across our portfolio will result in Western Digital having the industry's richest mix of 64-layer 3D NAND-based products in calendar 2017, underscoring our growing confidence in our ability to successfully commercialize this technology. 
In the March quarter, we expect to break ground for the construction of Fab 6 along with our joint venture partner, Toshiba. Fab 6 will provide new clean room space to support continued conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect operations in Fab 6 to commence in calendar 2018. 
In closing, our December quarter results reflect the positive impact of the Western Digital platform, deepening customer relationships helped by our portfolio, and technology expertise along with our global go-to-market capabilities further strengthen us as a leading storage solutions provider. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."

I am pleased with our financial performance this quarter. Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalized on our strong product offerings, achieved targeted cost and efficiency improvements and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow performance. We exceeded the revised guidance from our Investor Day on December 6 across our key financial metrics. 
Our revenue for the December quarter was $4.9 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion, client devices was $2.4 billion, and client solutions was $1.1 billion. In each end market, our revenue was flat to up from the September quarter, which underscores our strong performance as the September quarter is typically our strongest period. 
Our data center revenue growth continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. As a result, this quarter, we saw continued strength in capacity enterprise hard drives, sequential growth for performance enterprise hard drives as well as increased demand for enterprise SSDs. Client devices, which include both hard drives and flash-based products, benefited from a healthier PC market as well as traditional seasonal trends. Embedded solutions experienced strong growth, primarily from increases in storage capacity in mobile phones. In client solutions, our revenue grew as a result of strong demand for removable and other flash-based products during the holiday season. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin grew to 36.7%, up 280 basis points versus the September quarter. We've achieved this expansion through continued product cost improvements and healthy pricing for our products. Our product cost improvements resulted from consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities.
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $797 million, down $66 million from the September quarter. We continue to make progress towards our integration synergy targets while making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $221 million. Our non-GAAP interest expense was $205 million, a reduction of $31 million from the September quarter, driven by the debt repricings and reductions. Our non-GAAP other expenses, net of interest income, were $16 million for the December quarter. These expenses were primarily a result of foreign exchange revaluations that had no economic or cash impact. While it was an expense in the second quarter, it will result in lower expenses in future periods. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the December quarter was approximately 13%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the December quarter was $675 million or $2.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $235 million or $0.80 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization and charges associated with our acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the December quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations, with $189 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $871 million. We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $142 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.2 billion. We have approximately $6.2 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. Our net debt position has decreased approximately $800 million from the September quarter driven by higher cash balances. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also evaluating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.
As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal second quarter this year, we achieved approximately $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annualized basis.
With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal second quarter, we had realized synergies of approximately $135 million on an annual run rate basis, toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis. 
To build on what Steve said about our flash joint ventures, it is important to note that the operations and financial position of flash ventures are healthy, and investments are on track for the significant ramp of our 64-layer BiCS3 technology throughout calendar 2017. As a reminder, the joint ventures generate positive cash flow that is used to finance a significant portion of the capital requirements for both partners. I will now provide our guidance for the March quarter on a non-GAAP basis.
As I've previously indicated, we generate slightly more revenue in the second half of the calendar year than in the first half. In that context, we expect revenue for our March quarter to be approximately $4.55 billion, which represents significant year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. As a result, for fiscal 2017, we currently expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that is consistent with our long-term financial model. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to increase to approximately 38%, primarily driven by continued favorable pricing and product mix across our business.
Turning to non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect those to total approximately $800 million, consistent with our December quarter. We continue to make progress with reductions in our costs and, at the same time, support our integration and growth with certain incremental investments. Additionally, we expect OpEx to be essentially flat in the fourth fiscal quarter, consistent with second and third quarter levels. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million. We expect an effective non-GAAP tax rate in the 12% to 14% range. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $2 and $2.10, with an estimated share count of 298 million diluted shares.

At our Investor Day in December, we took the opportunity to present our differentiated platform, strategy and business model and to describe the significant growth opportunities for our company. With a growing storage industry and evolving data-driven requirements, we are uniquely positioned to help define and drive the storage architectures of the future. We are pleased with the increasingly strategic interactions we are having with customers, validating our approach to value creation.
We reported strong financial performance in the December quarter, enabled by excellent operational execution by our team. The favorable trends across all of our end markets that began earlier in 2016 continued. This included healthy demand for capacity enterprise hard drives, all NAND-based products and hard drives in client applications helped by stronger-than-expected PC demand. We reported revenue of $4.9 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 37% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30, outperforming the revised guidance provided at our Investor Day.
We continue to execute well on 2 key strategic priorities: the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD; and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology. The transition to 3D NAND technology continues as planned with the ramp of our 64-layer architecture. We commenced retail shipments and OEM sampling of our 64-layer products in the December quarter. As we demonstrated at Investor Day, we are executing methodically and thoughtfully on our technology strategy, and we fully expect our leadership in 2D NAND to extend into 3D NAND. 
In 2017 and beyond, you will see the deployment of our 64-layer 3D NAND across our product portfolio, spanning removable, embedded, client SSD and enterprise SSD offerings.
As we all know from recent disclosures by Toshiba and news reports, our flash joint venture partner is facing challenges. We have been in regular communication with them over the last several weeks. We are confident that their semiconductor memory business remains healthy and strategically viable. Under any circumstance, we will act to protect Western Digital's interests and work to ensure that we maintain the leadership position of our joint venture. 
In closing, I want to express my gratitude to our Chief Technology Officer, Steve Campbell, who is leaving the company after 20 years of distinguished service to Western Digital. I also want to welcome Martin Fink onboard as our new CTO. Martin brings deep storage systems and memory-driven computing expertise that will help us accelerate our ongoing transformation. I am sure Martin is known to many of you from his years at HP where he most recently served as CTO and Director of HP Labs at HP Enterprise. I'm delighted to have him on the senior team at Western Digital.

Our December quarter results reflect strong execution across our portfolio amidst a favorable industry environment in both flash and hard disk drive markets. Demand remained robust throughout the quarter and we launched several new products, further expanding the breadth of our offering. We made additional gains in the ongoing conversion of 3D NAND technology, and the commercial ramp of our 64-layer technology is accelerating. We are building stronger and deeper partnerships with our customers as our platforms increasingly align with our customers' strategic directions. 
Overall, we had a strong finish to calendar 2016, providing business momentum as we enter 2017. 
In client devices, our participation with OEM customers has meaningfully [ph] increased as a broadening portfolio of hard drives and flash-based solutions address the PC market that is healthier than expected. Our revenue from client devices increased sequentially, primarily driven by client SSDs and embedded products as revenue synergies from the SanDisk acquisition benefited us further in a seasonally strong quarter.
Increasing storage capacities in mobile phones and market preference for client SSDs are long-term tailwinds for this portion of our business.
Switching to client solutions, we experienced robust holiday seasonal demand and achieved sequential revenue growth driven by key NAND-based products. We are pleased to note that the combined revenue contribution from new products such as iXpand and dual USB drives also grew, underscoring continued consumer enthusiasm for our retail branded solutions. We announced new retail products, including the 4-terabyte My Passport, the 8-terabyte My Book hard drive for the PC, and a new 4-terabyte hard drive for the Mac. Shipments of our 64-layer 3D NAND-based retail products began in the December quarter, and we expect an increasing use of this underlying technology in our portfolio in 2017 and beyond. 
In the data center category, demand for high-capacity storage devices remain very strong. Year-over-year petabyte growth for capacity-optimized hard drives met our upwardly revised expectation, which we had estimated at 40% growth. We are pleased with the mainstream adoption of our 10-terabyte third-generation Helium drive. We have revised our planning to anticipate petabyte year-over-year demand growth for capacity-optimized hard drives to continue at approximately the same 40% rate compared to our prior forecast of about 35%. 
At our Investor Day, we announced a 12-terabyte capacity Helium drive as well as a derivative assay motor-based 14-terabyte drive, marking the start of our fourth generation Helium product line. The traction we have achieved on our Helium drive offerings, which were launched 4 years ago, demonstrates true cost of ownership value for our customers, and we look forward to providing them with ongoing innovation around this platform. Notably, the December quarter marked a cumulative shipment milestone of more than 12 million Helium drives, reflecting our leadership in this category. 
From an enterprise SSD standpoint, we experienced strong demand across our products at both hyperscale and OEM accounts, driving sequential revenue growth. In the December quarter, we announced our latest NVMe PCIe enterprise class SSD with leading performance and a high-capacity SaaS enterprise SSD contributing to a further expansion of our portfolio. 
In our Data Center Solutions category, our disk and flash storage platform business achieved several new design wins at leading system OEM customers for their cloud scale storage systems. We are achieving new customer wins and solid repeat business from existing customers in key verticals around the world. This nascent business continues to represent a strong growth opportunity for the company. 
Turning to silicon operations. We are very pleased with the progress we are making commercializing our 3D NAND technology. As I indicated earlier, we have already begun retail product shipments containing 64-layer BiCS3, and we also expect to launch client SSDs in embedded mobile offerings with this technology throughout the year. Additionally, we are on track to begin sampling enterprise SSD products utilizing 64-layer BiCS3 this calendar year. We expect our broad implementation of BiCS3 across our portfolio will result in Western Digital having the industry's richest mix of 64-layer 3D NAND-based products in calendar 2017, underscoring our growing confidence in our ability to successfully commercialize this technology. 
In the March quarter, we expect to break ground for the construction of Fab 6 along with our joint venture partner, Toshiba. Fab 6 will provide new clean room space to support continued conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect operations in Fab 6 to commence in calendar 2018. 
In closing, our December quarter results reflect the positive impact of the Western Digital platform, deepening customer relationships helped by our portfolio, and technology expertise along with our global go-to-market capabilities further strengthen us as a leading storage solutions provider. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."

I am pleased with our financial performance this quarter. Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalized on our strong product offerings, achieved targeted cost and efficiency improvements and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow performance. We exceeded the revised guidance from our Investor Day on December 6 across our key financial metrics. 
Our revenue for the December quarter was $4.9 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion, client devices was $2.4 billion, and client solutions was $1.1 billion. In each end market, our revenue was flat to up from the September quarter, which underscores our strong performance as the September quarter is typically our strongest period. 
Our data center revenue growth continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. As a result, this quarter, we saw continued strength in capacity enterprise hard drives, sequential growth for performance enterprise hard drives as well as increased demand for enterprise SSDs. Client devices, which include both hard drives and flash-based products, benefited from a healthier PC market as well as traditional seasonal trends. Embedded solutions experienced strong growth, primarily from increases in storage capacity in mobile phones. In client solutions, our revenue grew as a result of strong demand for removable and other flash-based products during the holiday season. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin grew to 36.7%, up 280 basis points versus the September quarter. We've achieved this expansion through continued product cost improvements and healthy pricing for our products. Our product cost improvements resulted from consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities.
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $797 million, down $66 million from the September quarter. We continue to make progress towards our integration synergy targets while making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $221 million. Our non-GAAP interest expense was $205 million, a reduction of $31 million from the September quarter, driven by the debt repricings and reductions. Our non-GAAP other expenses, net of interest income, were $16 million for the December quarter. These expenses were primarily a result of foreign exchange revaluations that had no economic or cash impact. While it was an expense in the second quarter, it will result in lower expenses in future periods. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the December quarter was approximately 13%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the December quarter was $675 million or $2.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $235 million or $0.80 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization and charges associated with our acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the December quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations, with $189 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $871 million. We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $142 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.2 billion. We have approximately $6.2 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. Our net debt position has decreased approximately $800 million from the September quarter driven by higher cash balances. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also evaluating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.
As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal second quarter this year, we achieved approximately $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annualized basis.
With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal second quarter, we had realized synergies of approximately $135 million on an annual run rate basis, toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis. 
To build on what Steve said about our flash joint ventures, it is important to note that the operations and financial position of flash ventures are healthy, and investments are on track for the significant ramp of our 64-layer BiCS3 technology throughout calendar 2017. As a reminder, the joint ventures generate positive cash flow that is used to finance a significant portion of the capital requirements for both partners. I will now provide our guidance for the March quarter on a non-GAAP basis.
As I've previously indicated, we generate slightly more revenue in the second half of the calendar year than in the first half. In that context, we expect revenue for our March quarter to be approximately $4.55 billion, which represents significant year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. As a result, for fiscal 2017, we currently expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that is consistent with our long-term financial model. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to increase to approximately 38%, primarily driven by continued favorable pricing and product mix across our business.
Turning to non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect those to total approximately $800 million, consistent with our December quarter. We continue to make progress with reductions in our costs and, at the same time, support our integration and growth with certain incremental investments. Additionally, we expect OpEx to be essentially flat in the fourth fiscal quarter, consistent with second and third quarter levels. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million. We expect an effective non-GAAP tax rate in the 12% to 14% range. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $2 and $2.10, with an estimated share count of 298 million diluted shares. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?"

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal third quarter financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter.
We reported strong financial performance in the March quarter, enabled by excellent operational execution by our team and favorable trends across all of our end markets. We reported revenue of $4.6 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 39% and non-GAAP earnings are share of $2.39.
With 3 consecutive quarters of strong financial results following the completion of the SanDisk acquisition, we are seeing continued validation of our growth strategy and our ongoing transformation into a comprehensive provider of diversified storage products and technologies. We have constructed a powerful platform with the broadest set of products enabling us to be a leader in the storage industry. Our transformation over the last several years provides us with opportunity to not only compete in today's marketplace, but to be strongly positioned to grow and thrive into the future. And, I would remind you that the results we are achieving today do not yet reflect the full impact of our targeted synergies from our HGST and SanDisk integrations.
The healthy current demand environment underscores the unabated growth in data and its increasing value in our professional and personal lives. As the new Western Digital, we are enjoying increasingly strategic relationships with our customers as they contemplate pivotal technology and architectural transitions, strengthening our ability to play a leading role in the storage industry. Our team continues to execute very well on 2 key strategic priorities: The integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD, and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology, each of which Mark and Mike will elaborate on.
I want to share some thoughts on Toshiba's efforts to divest their memory business. Since 2000, Western Digital has been a partner with Toshiba driving flash memory innovation and contributing significant value to our respective stakeholders through our joint venture in Japan. Our goals throughout the current process have remained consistent and resolute. First, to protect and preserve the health of the JV, which we believe is one of the most successful in the technology industry and in which we have invested more than $13 billion over its 17-year duration.
Second, to protect our interest with respect to any transaction involving the JV, interest or assets, none of which could be completed without our consent. And finally, to explore potential long-term value creation opportunities for both Western Digital's and Toshiba's stakeholders.
We are committed to continuing this story partnership in Japan. As we have communicated directly to Toshiba, we believe Western Digital is best positioned to lead and implement a transaction that will achieve the goals of all of Toshiba's stakeholders and we are working with them to develop a win-win solution. We have been communicating with key stakeholders and partners to evaluate a full range of potential alternatives to this challenging situation.
I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the March quarter."

Our March quarter results reflect continued strong demand for our products and focused operational execution.

Our March quarter results reflect continued strong demand for our products and focused operational execution. Industry-wide demand for NAND flash remained very strong and the industry-wide hard drive demand was stable, together contributing to the favorable environment for our overall business. Demand was healthy across all of our end markets and has helped mitigate typical seasonality. We made further progress in our ongoing conversion to the 3D NAND technology and our helium hard drives achieved new milestones as well.
In client devices, we saw strength for embedded products and for hard drives and surveillance applications while traditional [ commute ] demand was softer as expected. Demand for our solid-state drives for client applications increased sequentially, reflecting expansion of attached rates of SSDs to PCs and the ongoing adoption of our client SSDs enabling us to expand our market presence. We commenced shipments of our 64-layer 3D NAND and client SSD form factor, and we expect to further expand the usage of this industry-leading technology across our product portfolio during the remainder of calendar 2017.
In the mobile embedded category, we further deepened our OEM customer engagement through increased acceptance of our EMMC solutions, including our 3-bit per cell X3 offerings. Our design win pipeline expanded within the traditional mobile categories, as well as in emerging growth areas such as auto, connected home and the Internet of Things.
Turning to client solutions. Our comprehensive portfolio of flash and HDD products performed strongly and it significantly mitigated typical seasonal revenue decline. The strong market appeal of our WD SanDisk and key technology brand continues, demonstrated by an ongoing consumer preference for our products on a global basis.
In data center devices and solutions, we saw a sustained strength for enterprise class SSDs and a growing requirement from hyperscale customers for our 10-terabyte helium capacity hard drive. We completed several additional key qualifications for the 10-terabyte drive with these customers during the March quarter.
Yesterday, we announced that we have begun customer shipments of our 12-terabyte drive, our fourth generation helium product underscoring our generational lead in this category. I am pleased to note that we have now shipped approximately 15 million helium hard drives cumulatively since the platform's launch 4 years ago.
From a memory technology and operations perspective, we are ahead of our previously communicated expectations. First, we have already achieved cost crossover for our 64-layer 3D NAND versus our 15-nanometer X3 node. Second, we now plan to produce more than 75% of our total 3D NAND bit output based on the 64-layer architecture in calendar 2017. These achievements are particularly noteworthy indicating that our joint venture remains focused on executing our technology, manufacturing and operational strategies.
Looking forward, our estimates for NAND industry bit growth rates for calendar 2017 are at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%, and for calendar 2018, somewhat higher than in 2017. When combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we believe that the NAND industry supply-demand environment will likely remain favorable through at least the first half of calendar 2018.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for financial overview."

I'm pleased with our financial performance in the March quarter. Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalized on our diversified product offerings, achieved cost targets and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow generation.
Our revenue for the March quarter was $4.6 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue data center devices and solutions was $1.3 billion; client devices was $2.3 billion; and client solutions was $1 billion. Our revenue was only down 5% from our December quarter versus the typical decline of approximately 15% on a pro forma basis, which underscores our strong performance.
Our data center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our March quarter revenue for data center devices and solutions declined 2% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. We saw a sustained strength in capacity enterprise hard drives and sequential growth for our enterprise SSDs, offset by decline in performance enterprise hard drives.
Client devices revenue for the March quarter increased 23% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, primarily driven by significant strength in embedded flash, surveillance HDD and client SSD.
Client solutions revenue for the March quarter increased 6% year-over-year on a pro forma basis due to strong demand for removable and other flash-based products.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 39.3%, up 260 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 650 basis points year-over-year on a pro forma basis. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment, product cost improvements and a higher mix of flash-based revenue.
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $811 million. We were slightly above guidance due to higher performance-based compensation driven by our better-than-expected financial results. We continue to make progress towards our integration synergy targets while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth.
Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the March quarter was $206 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. In our March quarter, we successfully repriced both our euro-denominated Term Loan B and our U.S. dollar Term Loan B. The aggregate annual savings from these 2 repricings will result in approximately $42 million of annual interest savings starting in our June quarter.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the March quarter was approximately 11%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the March quarter was $716 million or $2.39 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $248 million or $0.83 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges associated with our acquisitions, and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the March quarter, we generated $1 billion in operating cash flow, with $257 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $741 million. We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend, totaling $145 million during the quarter, and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.8 billion, resulting in approximately $6.8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion undrawn revolver capacity. Our net debt outstanding has decreased approximately $1.5 billion since the beginning of the fiscal year, mostly driven by strong cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also assessing value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.
As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration activities. We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal third quarter this year, we achieved approximately $300 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $325 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run-rate basis.
With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal third quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $150 million on an annual run-rate basis, toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.
I will now provide our guidance for the June quarter on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue for our June quarter to be approximately $4.8 billion, which would represent double-digit year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. As a result, for fiscal 2017, we expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that will be in line with our long-term financial model of 4% to 8%. We expect gross margin to be approximately 40%. 
Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to be similar to our March quarter results. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $200 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 10% to 13% range. As a result, we expect earnings per share between $2.55 and $2.65, with an estimated share count of 302 million diluted shares.
As we described in details during our last Investor Day, we believe our integrated product and technology platform will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we see an opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $12 for the full calendar year 2017.

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal third quarter financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter.
We reported strong financial performance in the March quarter, enabled by excellent operational execution by our team and favorable trends across all of our end markets. We reported revenue of $4.6 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 39% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.39.
With 3 consecutive quarters of strong financial results following the completion of the SanDisk acquisition, we are seeing continued validation of our growth strategy and our ongoing transformation into a comprehensive provider of diversified storage products and technologies. We have constructed a powerful platform with the broadest set of products enabling us to be a leader in the storage industry. Our transformation over the last several years provides us with the opportunity to not only compete in today's marketplace, but to be strongly positioned to grow and thrive into the future. And, I would remind you that the results we are achieving today do not yet reflect the full impact of our targeted synergies from our HGST and SanDisk integrations.
The healthy current demand environment underscores the unabated growth in data and its increasing value in our professional and personal lives. As the new Western Digital, we are enjoying increasingly strategic relationships with our customers as they contemplate pivotal technology and architectural transitions, strengthening our ability to play a leading role in the storage industry. Our team continues to execute very well on 2 key strategic priorities: The integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD, and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology, each of which Mark and Mike will elaborate on.
I want to share some thoughts on Toshiba's efforts to divest their memory business. Since 2000, Western Digital has been a partner with Toshiba driving flash memory innovation and contributing significant value to our respective stakeholders through our joint venture in Japan. Our goals throughout the current process have remained consistent and resolute. First, to protect and preserve the health of the JV, which we believe is one of the most successful in the technology industry and in which we have invested more than $13 billion over a 17-year duration.
Second, to protect our interest with respect to any transaction involving the JV, interest or assets, none of which could be completed without our consent. And finally, to explore potential long-term value creation opportunities for both Western Digital's and Toshiba's stakeholders.
We are committed to continuing this story partnership in Japan. As we have communicated directly to Toshiba, we believe Western Digital is best positioned to lead and implement a transaction that will achieve the goals of all of Toshiba's stakeholders and we are working with them to develop a win-win solution. We have been communicating with key stakeholders and partners to evaluate a full range of potential alternatives to this challenging situation.
I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the March quarter."

Our March quarter results reflect continued strong demand for our products and focused operational execution. Industry-wide demand for NAND flash remained very strong and the industry-wide hard drive demand",532,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter results reflect continued strong demand for our products and focused operational execution. Industry-wide demand for NAND flash remained very strong and the industry-wide hard drive demand was stable, together contributing to the favorable environment for our overall business. Demand was healthy across all of our end markets and has helped mitigate typical seasonality. We made further progress in our ongoing conversion to the 3D NAND technology and our helium hard drives achieved new milestones as well.
In client devices, we saw strength for embedded products and for hard drives and surveillance applications while traditional commute demand was softer as expected. Demand for our solid state drives for client applications increased sequentially, reflecting expansion of attached rates of SSD to PCs and the ongoing adoption of our client SSDs enabling us to expand our market presence. We commenced shipments of our 64-layer 3D NAND and client SSD form factor, and we expect to further expand the usage of this industry-leading technology across our product portfolio during the remainder of calendar 2017.
In the mobile embedded category, we further deepened our OEM customer engagement through increased acceptance of our eMMC solutions, including our 3-bit per cell X3 offerings. Our design win pipeline expanded within the traditional mobile categories, as well as in emerging growth areas such as auto, connected home and the Internet of Things.
Turning to client solutions. Our comprehensive portfolio of flash and HDD products performed strongly and it significantly mitigated typical seasonal revenue decline. The strong market appeal of our WD SanDisk and key technology brand continues, demonstrated by ongoing consumer preference for our products on a global basis.
In data center devices and solutions, we saw a sustained strength for enterprise class SSDs and a growing requirement from hyperscale customers for our 10-terabyte helium capacity hard drive. We completed several additional key qualifications for the 10-terabyte drive with these customers during the March quarter.
Yesterday, we announced that we have begun customer shipments of our 12-terabyte drive, our fourth generation helium product underscoring our generational lead in this category. I am pleased to note that we have now shipped approximately 15 million helium hard drives cumulatively since the platform's launch 4 years ago.
From a memory technology and operations perspective, we are ahead of our previously communicated expectations. First, we have already achieved cost crossover for our 64-layer 3D NAND versus our 15-nanometer X3 node. Second, we now plan to produce more than 75% of our total 3D NAND bit output based on the 64-layer architecture in calendar 2017. These achievements are particularly noteworthy indicating that our joint venture remains focused on executing our technology, manufacturing and operational strategies.
Looking forward, our estimates for NAND industry bit growth rates for calendar 2017 are at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%, and for calendar 2018, somewhat higher than in 2017. When combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we believe that the NAND industry supply-demand environment will likely remain favorable through at least the first half of calendar 2018.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for a financial overview."

I'm pleased with our financial performance in the March quarter.

I'm pleased with our financial performance in the March quarter. Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalized on our diversified product offerings, achieved cost targets and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow generation.
Our revenue for the March quarter was $4.6 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.3 billion, client devices was $2.3 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our revenue was only down 5% from our December quarter versus the typical decline of approximately 15% on a pro forma basis, which underscores our strong performance.
Our data center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our March quarter revenue for data center devices and solutions declined 2% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. We saw a sustained strength in capacity enterprise hard drives and sequential growth for our enterprise SSDs, offset by a decline in performance enterprise hard drives.
Client devices revenue for the March quarter increased 23% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, primarily driven by significant strength in embedded flash, surveillance HDD and client SSD.
Client solutions revenue for the March quarter increased 6% year-over-year on a pro forma basis due to strong demand for removable and other flash-based products.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 39.3%, up 260 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 650 basis points year-over-year on a pro forma basis. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment, product cost improvements and a higher mix of flash-based revenue.
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $811 million. We were slightly above guidance due to higher performance-based compensation driven by our better-than-expected financial results. We continue to make progress towards our integration synergy targets while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth.
Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the March quarter was $206 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. In our March quarter, we successfully repriced both our euro-denominated Term Loan B and our U.S. dollar Term Loan B. The aggregate annual savings from these 2 repricings will result in approximately $42 million of annual interest savings starting in our June quarter.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the March quarter was approximately 11%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the March quarter was $716 million or $2.39 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $248 million or $0.83 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges associated with our acquisitions, and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the March quarter, we generated $1 billion in operating cash flow, with $257 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $741 million. We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $144 million during the quarter, and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.8 billion, resulting in approximately $6.8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion undrawn revolver capacity. Our net debt outstanding has decreased approximately $1.5 billion since the beginning of the fiscal year, mostly driven by strong cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also assessing value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.
As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration activities. We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal third quarter this year, we achieved approximately $300 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $325 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run-rate basis.
With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal third quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $150 million on an annual run-rate basis, toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.
I will now provide our guidance for the June quarter on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue for our June quarter to be approximately $4.8 billion, which would represent double-digit year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. As a result, for fiscal 2017, we expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that will be in line with our long-term financial model of 4% to 8%. We expect gross margin to be approximately 40%. 
Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to be similar to our March quarter results. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $200 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 10% to 13% range. As a result, we expect earnings per share between $2.55 and $2.65, with an estimated share count of 302 million diluted shares.
As we described in detail during our last Investor Day, we believe our integrated product and technology platform will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we see an opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $12 for the full calendar year 2017.

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. 
After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal third quarter financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter.
We reported strong financial performance in the March quarter, enabled by excellent operational execution by our team and favorable trends across all of our end markets. We reported revenue of $4.6 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 39% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.39.
With 3 consecutive quarters of strong financial results following the completion of the SanDisk acquisition, we are seeing continued validation of our growth strategy and our ongoing transformation into a comprehensive provider of diversified storage products and technologies. 
We have constructed a powerful platform with the broadest set of products enabling us to be a leader in the storage industry. 
Our transformation over the last several years provides us with the opportunity to not only compete in today's marketplace, but to be strongly positioned to grow and thrive into the future. 
And, I would remind you that the results we are achieving today do not yet reflect the full impact of our targeted synergies from our HGST and SanDisk integrations.
The healthy current demand environment underscores the unabated growth in data and its increasing value in our professional and personal lives. 
As the new Western Digital, we are enjoying increasingly strategic relationships with our customers as they contemplate pivotal technology and architectural transitions, strengthening our ability to play a leading role in the storage industry. 
Our team continues to execute very well on 2 key strategic priorities: the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD; and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology, each of which Mark and Mike will elaborate on.
I want to share some thoughts on Toshiba's efforts to divest their memory business. Since 2000, Western Digital has been a partner with Toshiba, driving flash memory innovation and contributing significant value to our respective stakeholders through our joint venture in Japan. 
Our goals throughout the current process have remained consistent and resolute. First, to protect and preserve the health of the JV, which we believe is one of the most successful in the technology industry and in which we have invested more than $13 billion over a 17-year duration.
Second, to protect our interest with respect to any transaction involving the JV, interest or assets, none of which could be completed without our consent. 
And finally, to explore potential long-term value creation opportunities for both Western Digital's and Toshiba's stakeholders.
We are committed to continuing this storied partnership in Japan. As we have communicated directly to Toshiba, we believe Western Digital is best positioned to lead and implement a transaction that will achieve the goals of all of Toshiba's stakeholders and we are working with them to develop a win-win solution. 
We have been communicating with key stakeholders and partners to evaluate a full range of potential alternatives to this challenging situation.
I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the March quarter."

Our March quarter results reflect continued strong demand for our products and focused operational execution. 
Industry-wide demand for NAND flash remained very strong and the industry-wide hard drive demand was stable, together contributing to a favorable environment for our overall business. 
Demand was healthy across all of our end markets and this helped mitigate typical seasonality. 
We made further progress in our ongoing conversion to the 3D NAND technology and our helium hard drives achieved new milestones as well.
In Client Devices, we saw strength for embedded products and for hard drives and surveillance applications, while traditional compute demand was softer as expected. 
Demand for our solid state drives for client applications increased sequentially, reflecting expansion of attached rates of SSDs to PCs and the ongoing adoption of our client SSDs enabling us to expand our market presence. 
We commenced shipments of our 64-layer 3D NAND and client SSD form factor, and we expect to further expand the usage of this industry-leading technology across our product portfolio during the remainder of calendar 2017.
In the mobile embedded category, we further deepened our OEM customer engagement through increased acceptance of our eMMC solutions, including our 3-bit per cell X3 offerings. 
Our design win pipeline expanded within the traditional mobile categories, as well as in emerging growth areas such as auto, connected home and the Internet of Things.
Turning to Client Solutions. Our comprehensive portfolio of flash and HDD products performed strongly and it significantly mitigated typical seasonal revenue decline. 
The strong market appeal of our WD, SanDisk and G-Technology brands continues, demonstrated by ongoing consumer preference for our products on a global basis.
In Data Center Devices & Solutions, we saw a sustained strength for enterprise class SSDs and a growing requirement from hyperscale customers for our 10-terabyte helium capacity hard drive. 
We completed several additional key qualifications for the 10-terabyte drive with these customers during the March quarter.
Yesterday, we announced that we have begun customer shipments of our 12-terabyte drive, our fourth generation helium product underscoring our generational lead in this category. 
I am pleased to note that we have now shipped approximately 15 million helium hard drives cumulatively since the platform's launch 4 years ago.
From a memory technology and operations perspective, we are ahead of our previously-communicated expectations. 
First, we have already achieved cost crossover for our 64-layer 3D NAND versus our 15-nanometer X3 node. 
Second, we now plan to produce more than 75% of our total 3D NAND bit output based on the 64-layer architecture in calendar 2017. 
These achievements are particularly noteworthy, indicating that our joint venture remains focused on executing our technology, manufacturing and operational strategies.
Looking forward, our estimates for NAND industry bit growth rates for calendar 2017 are at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%; and for calendar 2018, somewhat higher than in 2017. 
When combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we believe that the NAND industry supply-demand environment will likely remain favorable through at least the first half of calendar 2018.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial overview."

I'm pleased with our financial performance in the March quarter. 
Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalized on our diversified product offerings, achieved cost targets, and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow generation.
Our revenue for the March quarter was $4.6 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. 
Revenue in Data Center Devices and Solutions was $1.3 billion. Client Devices was $2.3 billion; and Client Solutions was $1 billion. 
Our revenue was only down 5% from our December quarter versus the typical decline of approximately 15% on a pro forma basis, which underscores our strong performance.
Our Data Center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. 
Our March quarter revenue for Data Center Devices & Solutions declined 2% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. 
We saw a sustained strength in capacity enterprise hard drives and sequential growth for our enterprise SSDs, offset by a decline in performance enterprise hard drives.
Client Devices revenue for the March quarter increased 23% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, primarily driven by significant strength in embedded flash, surveillance HDD and client SSD.
Client Solutions revenue for the March quarter increased 6% year-over-year on a pro forma basis due to strong demand for removable and other flash-based products.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 39.3%, up 260 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 650 basis points year-over-year on a pro forma basis. 
This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment, product cost improvements, and a higher mix of flash-based revenue.
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $811 million. 
We were slightly above guidance due to higher performance-based compensation driven by our better-than-expected financial results. 
We continue to make progress towards our integration synergy targets while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, and IT projects, as part of our transformation to enable future growth.
Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the March quarter was $206 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. 
In our March quarter, we successfully repriced both our euro-denominated Term Loan B and our U.S. dollar Term Loan B. 
The aggregate annual savings from these 2 repricings will result in approximately $42 million of annual interest savings, starting in our June quarter.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the March quarter was approximately 11%. 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the March quarter was $716 million or $2.39 per share. 
On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $248 million or $0.83 per share. 
The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges associated with our acquisitions, and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the March quarter, we generated $1 billion in operating cash flow, with $257 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $741 million. 
We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. 
We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $144 million during the quarter, and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.8 billion, resulting in approximately $6.8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion undrawn revolver capacity. 
Our net debt outstanding has decreased approximately $1.5 billion since the beginning of the fiscal year, mostly driven by strong cash flow generated by the business. 
We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also assessing value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.
As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration activities. 
We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. 
As of the end of our fiscal third quarter this year, we achieved approximately $300 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $325 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run-rate basis.
With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal third quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $150 million on an annual run-rate basis, toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.
I will now provide our guidance for the June quarter on a non-GAAP basis. 
We expect revenue for our June quarter to be approximately $4.8 billion, which would represent double-digit, year-over-year growth, on a pro forma basis. 
As a result, for fiscal 2017, we expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that will be in line with our long-term financial model of 4% to 8%. 
We expect gross margin to be approximately 40%. 
Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to be similar to our March quarter results. 
Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $200 million. 
We expect an effective tax rate in the 10% to 13% range. 
As a result, we expect earnings per share between $2.55 and $2.65, with an estimated share count of 302 million diluted shares.
As we described in detail during our last Investor Day, we believe our integrated product and technology platform will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. 
Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we see an opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $12 for the full calendar year 2017.

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. 
After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal third quarter financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter.
We reported strong financial performance in the March quarter, enabled by excellent operational execution by our team and favorable trends across all of our end markets. We reported revenue of $4.6 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 39% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.39.
With 3 consecutive quarters of strong financial results following the completion of the SanDisk acquisition, we are seeing continued validation of our growth strategy and our ongoing transformation into a comprehensive provider of diversified storage products and technologies. 
We have constructed a powerful platform with the broadest set of products enabling us to be a leader in the storage industry. 
Our transformation over the last several years provides us with the opportunity to not only compete in today's marketplace, but to be strongly positioned to grow and thrive into the future. 
And, I would remind you that the results we are achieving today do not yet reflect the full impact of our targeted synergies from our HGST and SanDisk integrations.
The healthy current demand environment underscores the unabated growth in data and its increasing value in our professional and personal lives. 
As the new Western Digital, we are enjoying increasingly strategic relationships with our customers as they contemplate pivotal technology and architectural transitions, strengthening our ability to play a leading role in the storage industry. 
Our team continues to execute very well on 2 key strategic priorities: the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD; and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology, each of which Mark and Mike will elaborate on.
I want to share some thoughts on Toshiba's efforts to divest their memory business. Since 2000, Western Digital has been a partner with Toshiba, driving flash memory innovation and contributing significant value to our respective stakeholders through our joint venture in Japan. 
Our goals throughout the current process have remained consistent and resolute. First, to protect and preserve the health of the JV, which we believe is one of the most successful in the technology industry and in which we have invested more than $13 billion over a 17-year duration.
Second, to protect our interest with respect to any transaction involving the JV, interest or assets, none of which could be completed without our consent. 
And finally, to explore potential long-term value creation opportunities for both Western Digital's and Toshiba's stakeholders.
We are committed to continuing this storied partnership in Japan. As we have communicated directly to Toshiba, we believe Western Digital is best positioned to lead and implement a transaction that will achieve the goals of all of Toshiba's stakeholders and we are working with them to develop a win-win solution. 
We have been communicating with key stakeholders and partners to evaluate a full range of potential alternatives to this challenging situation.
I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the March quarter."

Our March quarter results reflect continued strong demand for our products and focused operational execution. 
Industry-wide demand for NAND flash remained very strong and the industry-wide hard drive demand was stable, together contributing to a favorable environment for our overall business. 
Demand was healthy across all of our end markets and this helped mitigate typical seasonality. 
We made further progress in our ongoing conversion to the 3D NAND technology and our helium hard drives achieved new milestones as well.
In Client Devices, we saw strength for embedded products and for hard drives and surveillance applications, while traditional compute demand was softer as expected. 
Demand for our solid state drives for client applications increased sequentially, reflecting expansion of attached rates of SSDs to PCs and the ongoing adoption of our client SSDs enabling us to expand our market presence. 
We commenced shipments of our 64-layer 3D NAND and client SSD form factor, and we expect to further expand the usage of this industry-leading technology across our product portfolio during the remainder of calendar 2017.
In the mobile embedded category, we further deepened our OEM customer engagement through increased acceptance of our eMMC solutions, including our 3-bit per cell X3 offerings. 
Our design win pipeline expanded within the traditional mobile categories, as well as in emerging growth areas such as auto, connected home and the Internet of Things.
Turning to Client Solutions. Our comprehensive portfolio of flash and HDD products performed strongly and it significantly mitigated typical seasonal revenue decline. 
The strong market appeal of our WD, SanDisk and G-Technology brands continues, demonstrated by ongoing consumer preference for our products on a global basis.
In Data Center Devices & Solutions, we saw a sustained strength for enterprise-class SSDs and a growing requirement from hyperscale customers for our 10-terabyte helium capacity hard drive. 
We completed several additional key qualifications for the 10-terabyte drive with these customers during the March quarter.
Yesterday, we announced that we have begun customer shipments of our 12-terabyte drive, our fourth generation helium product underscoring our generational lead in this category. 
I am pleased to note that we have now shipped approximately 15 million helium hard drives cumulatively since the platform's launch 4 years ago.
From a memory technology and operations perspective, we are ahead of our previously communicated expectations. 
First, we have already achieved cost crossover for our 64-layer 3D NAND versus our 15-nanometer X3 node. 
Second, we now plan to produce more than 75% of our total 3D NAND bit output based on the 64-layer architecture in calendar 2017. 
These achievements are particularly noteworthy, indicating that our joint venture remains focused on executing our technology, manufacturing and operational strategies.
Looking forward, our estimates for NAND industry bit growth rates for calendar 2017 are at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%; and for calendar 2018, somewhat higher than in 2017. 
When combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we believe that the NAND industry supply-demand environment will likely remain favorable through at least the first half of calendar 2018.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial overview."
314057,427313141,1183672,"Western Digital Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike.

I'm pleased with our financial performance in the March quarter. 
Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalized on our diversified product offerings, achieved cost targets, and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow generation.
Our revenue for the March quarter was $4.6 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. 
Revenue in Data Center Devices and Solutions was $1.3 billion. Client Devices was $2.3 billion; and Client Solutions was $1 billion. 
Our revenue was only down 5% from our December quarter versus the typical decline of approximately 15% on a pro forma basis, which underscores our strong performance.
Our Data Center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. 
Our March quarter revenue for Data Center Devices & Solutions declined 2% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. 
We saw a sustained strength in capacity enterprise hard drives and sequential growth for our enterprise SSDs, offset by a decline in performance enterprise hard drives.
Client Devices revenue for the March quarter increased 23% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, primarily driven by significant strength in embedded flash, surveillance HDD and client SSD.
Client Solutions revenue for the March quarter increased 6% year-over-year on a pro forma basis due to strong demand for removable and other flash-based products.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 39.3%, up 260 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 650 basis points year-over-year on a pro forma basis. 
This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment, product cost improvements, and a higher mix of flash-based revenue.
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $811 million. 
We were slightly above guidance due to higher performance-based compensation driven by our better-than-expected financial results. 
We continue to make progress towards our integration synergy targets while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, and IT projects, as part of our transformation to enable future growth.
Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the March quarter was $206 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. 
In our March quarter, we successfully repriced both our euro-denominated Term Loan B and our U.S. dollar Term Loan B. 
The aggregate annual savings from these 2 repricings will result in approximately $42 million of annual interest savings, starting in our June quarter.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the March quarter was approximately 11%. 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the March quarter was $716 million or $2.39 per share. 
On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $248 million or $0.83 per share. 
The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges associated with our acquisitions, and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the March quarter, we generated $1 billion in operating cash flow, with $257 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $741 million. 
We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. 
We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $144 million during the quarter, and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.8 billion, resulting in approximately $6.8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion undrawn revolver capacity. 
Our net debt outstanding has decreased approximately $1.5 billion since the beginning of the fiscal year, mostly driven by strong cash flow generated by the business. 
We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also assessing value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.
As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration activities. 
We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. 
As of the end of our fiscal third quarter this year, we achieved approximately $300 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $325 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run-rate basis.
With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal third quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $150 million on an annual run-rate basis, toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.
I will now provide our guidance for the June quarter on a non-GAAP basis. 
We expect revenue for our June quarter to be approximately $4.8 billion, which would represent double-digit, year-over-year growth, on a pro forma basis. 
As a result, for fiscal 2017, we expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that will be in line with our long-term financial model of 4% to 8%. 
We expect gross margin to be approximately 40%. 
Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to be similar to our March quarter results. 
Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $200 million. 
We expect an effective tax rate in the 10% to 13% range. 
As a result, we expect earnings per share between $2.55 and $2.65, with an estimated share count of 302 million diluted shares.
As we described in detail during our last Investor Day, we believe our integrated product and technology platform will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. 
Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we see an opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $12 for the full calendar year 2017.

After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal fourth quarter and full year financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal first quarter before we take your questions.
We reported strong financial performance in the June quarter to complete an outstanding fiscal 2017. Our unique platform of diverse, storage technologies and value-added products helped drive this performance as we address a broader set of markets following the SanDisk acquisition. On a pro-forma basis, we operated near the top of our revenue growth model with 7% year-over-year top line growth. And we delivered very healthy margins. As a result of our unique platform, relationships with our customers are more strategic in recognition of our changing role in the data storage ecosystem. 
For the June quarter, we reported revenue of $4.8 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 41%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.93. We generated strong operating cash flow reflecting continued healthy demand in many of our end markets. Our financial performance in fiscal 2017 demonstrates the differentiated value we can deliver as a comprehensive data storage solutions leader. With industry-leading technologies and demonstrated ability to quickly productize them, we have been able to strategically fulfilled the markets growing storage requirements. Our flexible business model also allows us to realize differentiated financial performance in varying market conditions giving us greater capability to navigate a range of market conditions than what our legacy companies could achieve on a standalone basis. In addition to our strong financial performance, our team continues to execute very well on the ramp of 3D NAND technology and on the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD, each of which Mike and Mark will elaborate on. 
I would also like to provide a brief update on our ongoing discussions with Toshiba. Our goal has always been to protect and preserve the health and future of our successful joint ventures. We and our subsidiaries have operated the JVs with Toshiba for the last 17 years. It is a partnership that has been highly successful for both parties and for Japan. As you may have seen in media reports, Mark and I were in Japan last week to continue our dialogue with Toshiba and its stakeholders. Our discussions were constructive, and we will continue to work to seek a solution that is in the best interest of all parties. Beyond that, we will not get into more detail on this matter until we have a material update to share with you. We know this is an important topic for the investment community and we are committed to keeping you apprised. Rest assured this has the full attention of our team as we are committed to the continued success of the joint ventures. 
In closing, I want to thank our employees for all that we have done and accomplished over the course of the last several years. We are building a great company with a strong foundation for our future as a differentiated leader in the storage industry. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the June quarter."
314057,528599998,1256066,"Western Digital Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. To build on Steve's remarks, I'm very pleased with the strong finish to our fiscal 2017 with several milestones achieved across the various areas of our business. All of our reported revenue categories grew both",758,"Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. To build on Steve's remarks, I'm very pleased with the strong finish to our fiscal 2017 with several milestones achieved across the various areas of our business. All of our reported revenue categories grew both sequentially and year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Results from our NAND flash products were strong in the midst of a continued constrained supply environment and HDD results were largely within our expectations. 
We made further progress towards our 3D NAND technology transition objectives and our operational advancements remained on track. Most importantly, our results since the close of the SanDisk acquisition last year illustrate the power of our platform. Our Client Devices business grew by 36% year-over-year on a pro-forma basis despite the PC market being slightly weaker-than-expected in the quarter. This growth was driven by our progress in diversifying our customer base and continued expansion of our product portfolio with the gains being most pronounced in mobility and client SSD. Combined revenue from emerging growth applications such as connected home, gaming and industrial also delivered strong sequential growth. We have begun multiple sampling activities for embedded products designed for the automotive market, a compelling long-term growth opportunity. 
In Client Solutions, the strength of our WD HGST and SanDisk brands combined with our global distribution capabilities allowed us to deliver strong performance in what has historically been a relatively weaker period in retail. This enabled us to achieve a 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter on a pro-forma basis. The ability to serve customers with the broadest array of products and solutions is a key element of our strategy. 
Turning to Data Center Devices & Solutions. Shipments of our 10-terabyte helium drives increased significantly on a sequential basis as our industry-leading product made further inroads in hyperscale data centers. The storage and efficiency requirements of data center customers are driving a sustained shift to the 10-terabyte capacity point, and we believe we further increased our market presence in this category. On a cumulative basis, since the launch of our Helium platform 4 years ago, we have shipped margin 18 million helium drives. Qualification activities for our 12-terabyte helium drives began at key hyperscale and OEM customers in the June quarter. With the success of our 10-terabyte platform and our expectation generation lead with a 12-terabyte platform, we are well positioned to maintain product leadership over the next several years. 
For the nearline drive market, our expectation for the long-term industry exabyte growth at the 40% annual rate remains unchanged. Industry-wide component shortages, we now estimate the industry exabyte growth to be approximately 30% for calendar 2017. However, we expect our own growth rate will be approximately 40% given the strong adoption of our nearline offerings. 
In our JV fab operations, we continue the strong ramp on our 64-layer 3D NAND X3 technology during the quarter with a significant portion of our product shipments now using this industry-leading technology. Manufacturing yields of X3 continue to meet our expectations, and we are maintaining our projection for the combined JV output of 64-layer 3D NAND to be the highest in the industry in calendar 2017. Development work on BiCS4, our recently announced 96-layer 3D NAND technology, is ongoing and we expect to begin sampling in calendar 2017 with meaningful production volumes in calendar 2018. In addition to the solid progress on our fix portfolio, we're delivering innovative new technology capabilities such as the recently announced 4-bits per cell 3D NAND. 
From a future fab perspective, we intend to participate in the JVs fab 6 to provide additional clean room space to support the further conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect production output from the new clean room facility to begin in calendar 2018. From a NAND industry supply standpoint, our estimate for bit growth rate for calendar 2017 remains at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45% and for calendar 2018, somewhat higher than in 2017. Combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we continue to believe that the favorable NAND industry conditions will persist at least through the first half of calendar 2018. 
In closing, our strong fiscal 2017 results highlight the power of our platform. The various ingredients that make up this platform, including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities and our team are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes. 
I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."

Our revenue for the June quarter was $4.8 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue and Data Center Devices & Solutions was $1.4 billion. Client Devices was $2.4 billion, and Client Solutions was $1 billion. Our revenue for the June quarter was up 4% from our March quarter and increased 21% year-over-year on a pro-forma basis. All of my year-over-year comparisons cited today are on a pro-forma basis. 
Our Data Center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our June quarter revenue for Data Center Devices & Solutions increased 7% year-over-year. We saw a sustained strength in Capacity Enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by a decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client Devices revenue for the June quarter increased 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs. Client Solutions revenue for the June quarter increased 14% year-over-year driven mostly by our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash space products. The execution of our strategy and strength of our broad platform enabled us to achieve 7% year-over-year total revenue growth for our full year fiscal 2017. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 41.3%, up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 950 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based product, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue and the strength of our Capacity Enterprise HDD lineup. 
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $812 million. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy target while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the June quarter was $197 million, inclusive of $201 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased from the previous quarter driven by the March repricings and was partially offset by the increase in labor rates during the period. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the June quarter was approximately 11%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the June quarter was $881 million or $2.93 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $280 million or $0.93 per share. The GAAP income for the peer includes intangible amortization, charges related integration activities, and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges. 
In the June quarter, we generated $939 million in operating cash flow with $178 million spent on capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $761 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $146 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $6.5 billion, resulting in approximately $7.5 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $2.1 billion to $6.9 billion at the end of the fiscal year, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also assessing the value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise. 
We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter this year, we achieved approximately $350 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $350 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run-rate basis. With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $200 million on an annual run-rate basis toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million total run rate synergies on an annualized basis. 
I will now provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue for our September quarter to be approximately $5.1 billion, which would represent approximately 8% year-over-year growth. We expect gross margin to be approximately 41%. 
Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to be similar to our June quarter results. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $208 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 7% to 9% range. Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately $307 million, an increase from the June quarter driven mostly by a new accounting standard. As a result, we expect earnings per share between $3.25 and $3.35. We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we now see the opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share that exceeds our prior guidance of $12 per share for the full calendar year 2017. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?"

But if we bring it down to some more sort of specific elements, we obviously feel very good about where we are with our 10-terabyte. We had significant quarter-over-quarter growth in terms of our output and our volume and our revenue. And we think we're in a very good position, as I stated in my prepared remarks, to continue to gain momentum through the back half of the year. And that's from 10- to 12-terabyte. So to give you a little more color, I think 1 thing we've seen is the sort of top line of our hard drive business is showing more favorable, flat to slightly up dimensions.

After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal fourth quarter and full year financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal first quarter before we take your questions.
We reported strong financial performance in the June quarter to complete an outstanding fiscal 2017. Our unique platform of diverse, storage technologies and value-added products helped drive this performance as we address a broader set of markets following the SanDisk acquisition. On a pro-forma basis, we operated near the top of our revenue growth model with 7% year-over-year top line growth. And we delivered very healthy margins. As a result of our unique platform, relationships with our customers are more strategic in recognition of our changing role in the data storage ecosystem.
For the June quarter, we reported revenue of $4.8 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 41%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.93. We generated strong operating cash flow, reflecting continued healthy demand in many of our end markets. Our financial performance in fiscal 2017 demonstrates the differentiated value we can deliver as a comprehensive data storage solutions leader. With industry-leading technologies and demonstrated ability to quickly productize them, we have been able to strategically fulfilled the market's growing storage requirements. Our flexible business model also allows us to realize differentiated financial performance in varied market conditions, giving us greater capability to navigate a range of market conditions than what our legacy companies could achieve on a standalone basis. In addition to our strong financial performance, our team continues to execute very well on the ramp of 3D NAND technology and on the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD, each of which Mike and Mark will elaborate on.
I would also like to provide a brief update on our ongoing discussions with Toshiba. Our goal has always been to protect and preserve the health and future of our successful joint ventures. We and our subsidiaries have operated the JVs with Toshiba for the last 17 years. It is a partnership that has been highly successful for both parties and for Japan. As you may have seen in media reports, Mark and I were in Japan last week to continue our dialogue with Toshiba and its stakeholders. Our discussions were constructive, and we will continue to work to seek a solution that is in the best interest of all parties. Beyond that, we will not get into more detail on this matter until we have a material update to share with you. We know this is an important topic for the investment community and we are committed to keeping you apprised. Rest assured, this has the full attention of our team as we are committed to the continued success of the joint ventures.
In closing, I want to thank our employees for all that we have done and accomplished over the course of the last several years. We are building a great company with a strong foundation for our future as a differentiated leader in the storage industry.
I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the June quarter."

Most importantly, our results since the close of the SanDisk acquisition last year illustrate the power of our platform. Our Client Devices business grew by 36% year-over-year on a pro-forma basis, despite the PC market being slightly weaker-than-expected in the quarter. This growth was driven by our progress in diversifying our customer base and continued expansion of our product portfolio with the gains being most pronounced in mobility and client SSD. Combined revenue from emerging growth applications such as connected home, gaming and industrial also delivered strong sequential growth. We have begun multiple sampling activities for embedded products designed for the automotive market, a compelling long-term growth opportunity.
In Client Solutions, the strength of our WD HGST and SanDisk brands combined with our global distribution capabilities allowed us to deliver strong performance in what has historically been a relatively weaker period in retail. This enabled us to achieve a 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter on a pro-forma basis. The ability to serve customers with the broadest array of products and solutions is a key element of our strategy.
Turning to Datacenter Devices and Solutions. Shipments of our 10-terabyte helium drives increased significantly on a sequential basis as our industry-leading product made further inroads in hyperscale data centers. The storage and efficiency requirements of data center customers are driving a sustained shift to the 10-terabyte capacity point, and we believe we further increased our market presence in this category. On a cumulative basis, since the launch of our helium platform 4 years ago, we have shipped more than 18 million helium drives. Qualification activities for our 12-terabyte Helium drives began at key hyperscale and OEM customers in the June quarter. With the success of our 10-terabyte platform and our expectation to generate additional lead with the 12-terabyte platform, we are well positioned to maintain product leadership over the next several years.
For the nearline drive market, our expectation for the long-term industry exabyte growth at the 40% annual rate remains unchanged. [indiscernible] industry-wide component shortages, we now estimate the industry exabyte growth to be approximately 30% for calendar 2017. However, we expect our own growth rate will be approximately 40% given the strong adoption of our nearline offerings.
In our JV fab operations, we continue the strong ramp on our 64-layer 3D NAND BiCS3 technology during the quarter, with a significant portion of our product shipments now using this industry-leading technology. Manufacturing yields of BiCS3 continue to meet our expectations, and we are maintaining our projection for the combined JV output of 64-layer 3D NAND to be the highest in the industry in calendar 2017. Development work on BiCS4, our recently announced 96-layer 3D NAND technology, is ongoing and we expect to begin sampling in calendar 2017 with meaningful production volumes in calendar 2018. In addition to the solid progress on our BiCS portfolio, we are delivering innovative new technology capabilities such as the recently announced 4-bits-per-cell 3D NAND.
From a future fab perspective, we intend to participate in the JV's fab 6 to provide additional clean room space to support the further conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect production output from the new clean room facility to begin in calendar 2018. From a NAND industry supply standpoint, our estimate for bit growth rate for calendar 2017 remains at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45% and for calendar 2018, somewhat higher than in 2017. Combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we continue to believe that the favorable NAND industry conditions will persist at least through the first half of calendar 2018.
In closing, our strong fiscal 2017 results highlight the power of our platform. The various ingredients that make up this platform, including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities and our team are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes.
I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."
314057,528599998,1256405,"Western Digital Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the June quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of markets as we capitalized on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense ta",916,"Thank you, Mike. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the June quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of markets as we capitalized on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense targets, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the fiscal year with an improved liquidity position as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation.
Our revenue for the June quarter was $4.8 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in Datacenter Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion. Client Devices was $2.4 billion, and Client Solutions was $1 billion. Our revenue for the June quarter was up 4% from our March quarter and increased 21% year-over-year on a pro-forma basis. All of my year-over-year comparisons cited today are on a pro-forma basis.
Our Data Center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our June quarter revenue for Datacenter Devices and Solutions increased 7% year-over-year. We saw a sustained strength in capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by a decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client Devices revenue for the June quarter increased 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs. Client Solutions revenue for the June quarter increased 14% year-over-year, driven mostly by our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash-based products. The execution of our strategy and strength of our broad platform enabled us to achieve 7% year-over-year total revenue growth for our full year fiscal 2017.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 41.3%, up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 950 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue and the strength of our capacity enterprise HDD lineup. 
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $812 million. We continue to make progress toward our integration and synergy targets while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the June quarter was $197 million, inclusive of $201 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased from the previous quarter driven by the March repricings and was partially offset by the increase in LIBOR rates during the period. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the June quarter was approximately 11%.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the June quarter was $881 million or $2.93 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $280 million or $0.93 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges related to integration activities and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the June quarter, we generated $939 million in operating cash flow with $178 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $761 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $146 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $6.5 billion, resulting in approximately $7.5 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $2.1 billion to $6.9 billion at the end of the fiscal year, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also assessing value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.
We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter this year, we achieved approximately $350 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $350 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run-rate basis. With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $200 million on an annual run-rate basis toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.
I will now provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue for our September quarter to be approximately $5.1 billion, which would represent approximately 8% year-over-year growth. We expect gross margin to be approximately 41%. Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to be similar to our June quarter results. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $208 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 7% to 9% range. Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately $307 million, an increase from the June quarter driven mostly by a new accounting standard. As a result, we expect earnings per share between $3.25 and $3.35.
We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we now see the opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share that exceeds our prior guidance of $12 per share for the full calendar year 2017.

I think for some time we've been adjusting both our product roadmap and our product investment to try to get that optimized versus how we see the market evolving over time. That is one dimension. The other dimension is how we're working on our cost basis in our factory footprint. So we've been taking actions for some time to put ourselves in an optimal position given our broader strategy. But if we bring it down to some more sort of specific elements, we obviously feel very good about where we are with our 10-terabyte. We had significant quarter-over-quarter growth in terms of our output and our volume and our revenue. And we think we're in a very good position, as I stated in my prepared remarks, to continue to gain momentum through the back half of the year. And that's from 10- to 12-terabyte. So to give you a little more color, I think one thing we've seen is the sort of top line of our hard drive business is showing more favorable flat to slightly up dimensions. And just to give you a bit of our reference point, to feed our legacy hard drive-only model, we're operating somewhere near the higher end of that model, to give you a little more flavor."

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal fourth quarter and full year financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal first quarter before we take your questions.
We reported strong financial performance in the June quarter, to complete an outstanding fiscal 2017. Our unique platform of diverse storage technologies and value-added products helped drive this performance as we addressed a broader set of markets following the SanDisk acquisition. On a pro-forma basis, we operated near the top of our revenue growth model with 7% year-over-year top line growth. And we delivered very healthy margins. As a result of our unique platform, relationships with our customers are more strategic in recognition of our changing role in the data storage ecosystem.
For the June quarter, we reported revenue of $4.8 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 41%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.93. We generated strong operating cash flow, reflecting continued healthy demand in many of our end markets. Our financial performance in fiscal 2017 demonstrates the differentiated value we can deliver as a comprehensive data storage solutions leader. With industry-leading technologies and demonstrated ability to quickly productize them, we have been able to strategically fulfill the market's growing storage requirements. Our flexible business model also allows us to realize differentiated financial performance in varied market conditions, giving us greater capability to navigate a range of market conditions than what our legacy companies could achieve on a standalone basis. In addition to our strong financial performance, our team continues to execute very well on the ramp of 3D NAND technology and on the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD, each of which Mike and Mark will elaborate on.
I would also like to provide a brief update on our ongoing discussions with Toshiba. Our goal has always been to protect and preserve the health and future of our successful joint ventures. We and our subsidiaries have operated the JVs with Toshiba for the last 17 years. It is a partnership that has been highly successful for both parties and for Japan. As you may have seen in media reports, Mark and I were in Japan last week to continue our dialogue with Toshiba and its stakeholders. Our discussions were constructive, and we will continue to work to seek a solution that is in the best interest of all parties. Beyond that, we will not get into more detail on this matter until we have a material update to share with you. We know this is an important topic for the investment community and we are committed to keeping you apprised. Rest assured, this has the full attention of our team as we are committed to the continued success of the joint ventures.
In closing, I want to thank our employees for all that we have done and accomplished over the course of the last several years. We are building a great company with a strong foundation for our future as a differentiated leader in the storage industry.
I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the June quarter."
314057,528599998,1256457,"Western Digital Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve.

To build on Steve's remarks, I'm very pleased with the strong finish to our fiscal 2017, with several milestones achieved across the various areas of our business. All of our reported revenue categories grew both sequentially and year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Results from our NAND flash products were strong in the midst of a continued constrained supply environment, and HDD results were largely within our expectations.
We made further progress towards our 3D NAND technology transition objectives and our operational advancements remained on track. Most importantly, our results since the close of the SanDisk acquisition last year illustrate the power of our platform. Our Client Devices business grew by 36% year-over-year on a pro-forma basis, despite the PC market being slightly weaker-than-expected in the quarter. This growth was driven by our progress in diversifying our customer base and continued expansion of our product portfolio with the gains being most pronounced in mobility and client SSD. Combined revenue from emerging growth applications such as connected home, gaming and industrial also delivered strong sequential growth. We have begun multiple sampling activities for embedded products designed for the automotive market, a compelling long-term growth opportunity.
In Client Solutions, the strength of our WD, HGST and SanDisk brands combined with our global distribution capabilities allowed us to deliver strong performance in what has historically been a relatively weaker period in retail. This enabled us to achieve a 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter on a pro-forma basis. The ability to serve customers with the broadest array of products and solutions is a key element of our strategy.
Turning to Datacenter Devices and Solutions. Shipments of our 10-terabyte helium drives increased significantly on a sequential basis as our industry-leading product made further inroads in hyperscale data centers. The storage and efficiency requirements of data center customers are driving a sustained shift to the 10-terabyte capacity point, and we believe we further increased our market presence in this category. On a cumulative basis, since the launch of our helium platform 4 years ago, we have shipped more than 18 million helium drives. Qualification activities for our 12-terabyte Helium drives began at key hyperscale and OEM customers in the June quarter. With the success of our 10-terabyte platform and our expectation to generate additional leads with the 12-terabyte platform, we are well positioned to maintain product leadership over the next several years.
For the nearline drive market, our expectation for the long-term industry exabyte growth at the 40% annual rate remains unchanged. Given industry-wide component shortages, we now estimate the industry exabyte growth to be approximately 30% for calendar 2017. However, we expect our own growth rate will be approximately 40% given the strong adoption of our nearline offerings.
In our JV fab operations, we continue the strong ramp on our 64-layer 3D NAND BiCS3 technology during the quarter, with a significant portion of our product shipments now using this industry-leading technology. Manufacturing yields of BiCS3 continue to meet our expectations, and we are maintaining our projection for the combined JV output of 64-layer 3D NAND to be the highest in the industry in calendar 2017. Development work on BiCS4, our recently announced 96-layer 3D NAND technology, is ongoing and we expect to begin sampling in calendar 2017, with meaningful production volumes in calendar 2018. In addition to the solid progress on our BiCS portfolio, we are delivering innovative new technology capabilities such as the recently announced 4-bits-per-cell 3D NAND.
From a future fab perspective, we intend to participate in the JV's fab 6 to provide additional clean room space to support the further conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect production output from the new clean room facility to begin in calendar 2018. From a NAND industry supply standpoint, our estimate for bit growth rate for calendar 2017 remains at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45% and for calendar 2018, somewhat higher than in 2017. Combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we continue to believe that the favorable NAND industry conditions will persist at least through the first half of calendar 2018.
In closing, our strong fiscal 2017 results highlight the power of our platform. The various ingredients that make up this platform, including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities and our team are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes.
I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."

I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the June quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of markets as we capitalized on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense targets, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the fiscal year with an improved liquidity position as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation.
Our revenue for the June quarter was $4.8 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in Datacenter Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion; client Devices was $2.4 billion, and Client Solutions was $1 billion. Our revenue for the June quarter was up 4% from our March quarter and increased 21% year-over-year on a pro-forma basis. All of my year-over-year comparisons cited today are on a pro-forma basis.
Our Data Center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our June quarter revenue for Datacenter Devices and Solutions increased 7% year-over-year. We saw a sustained strength in capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by a decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client Devices revenue for the June quarter increased 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs. Client Solutions revenue for the June quarter increased 14% year-over-year, driven mostly by our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash-based products. The execution of our strategy and strength of our broad platform enabled us to achieve 7% year-over-year total revenue growth for our full year fiscal 2017.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 41.3%, up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 950 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue and the strength of our capacity enterprise HDD lineup. 
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $812 million. We continue to make progress toward our integration and synergy targets while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the June quarter was $197 million, inclusive of $201 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased from the previous quarter driven by the March repricings and was partially offset by the increase in LIBOR rates during the period. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the June quarter was approximately 11%.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the June quarter was $881 million or $2.93 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $280 million or $0.93 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges related to integration activities and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the June quarter, we generated $939 million in operating cash flow with $178 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $761 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $146 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $6.5 billion, resulting in approximately $7.5 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $2.1 billion to $6.9 billion at the end of the fiscal year, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also assessing value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.
We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter this year, we achieved approximately $350 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $350 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run-rate basis. With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $200 million on an annual run-rate basis toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.
I will now provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue for our September quarter to be approximately $5.1 billion, which would represent approximately 8% year-over-year growth. We expect gross margin to be approximately 41%. Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to be similar to our June quarter results. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $208 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 7% to 9% range. Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately $307 million, an increase from the June quarter driven mostly by a new accounting standard. As a result, we expect earnings per share between $3.25 and $3.35.
We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we now see the opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share that exceeds our prior guidance of $12 per share for the full calendar year 2017.

I think for some time we've been adjusting both our product roadmap and our product investment to try to get that optimized versus how we see the market evolving over time. That is one dimension. The other dimension is how we're working on our cost basis in our factory footprint. So we've been taking actions for some time to put ourselves in an optimal position given our broader strategy. But if we bring it down to some more sort of specific elements, we obviously feel very good about where we are with our 10-terabyte. We had significant quarter-over-quarter growth in terms of our output and our volume and our revenue. And we think we're in a very good position, as I stated in my prepared remarks, to continue to gain momentum through the back half of the year. And that's from 10- to 12-terabyte. So to give you a little more color, I think one thing we've seen is the sort of top line of our hard drive business is showing more favorable flat to slightly up dimensions. And just to give you a bit of a reference point to [ fute ] our legacy hard drive-only model, we're operating somewhere near the higher end of that model, to give you a little more flavor."

It is component supply shortages and then correspondingly in some instances, the cost of components. So those 2 things are demand headwinds for us in the hyperscale market or for the industry. As I also stated, we think we will grow at the predicted 40% rate. And that's really based on our product portfolio and advantage we have there. To some extent, we also would say, it's a similar trend in PCs. We saw PCs being a little softer, maybe down 2%. We think the same thing is in affect there.
[Audio Gap]
Both cost and availability is really creating some headwinds for PC makers."

That being said -- this is a factual comment and not meant to alarm anybody -- the reality is, is that subsequent to when we acquired SanDisk, we have been dealing with very favorable market conditions as it relates to NAND. We all know that supply and demand will even out a bit more and it will become less of a constrained environment. That will -- or historically when that happens is that puts a little bit more downward pressure on your margins. As we go through, call it, that sort of a cycle, we'll have a better idea of what happens in that kind of an environment.

I think -- just in general, it would seem -- not when we've seen these kinds of combinations, but just like over the years, it seems like a very classic, even non -- less strategic than this revenue synergy for companies would be at least 5% or a 10% kind of revenue synergy.

After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal fourth quarter and full year financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal first quarter before we take your questions.
We reported strong financial performance in the June quarter, to complete an outstanding fiscal 2017. Our unique platform of diverse storage technologies and value-added products helped drive this performance as we addressed a broader set of markets following the SanDisk acquisition. On a pro-forma basis, we operated near the top of our revenue growth model with 7% year-over-year top line growth. And we delivered very healthy margins. As a result of our unique platform, relationships with our customers are more strategic in recognition of our changing role in the data storage ecosystem.
For the June quarter, we reported revenue of $4.8 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 41%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.93. We generated strong operating cash flow, reflecting continued healthy demand in many of our end markets. Our financial performance in fiscal 2017 demonstrates the differentiated value we can deliver as a comprehensive data storage solutions leader. With industry-leading technologies and demonstrated ability to quickly productize them, we have been able to strategically fulfill the market's growing storage requirements. Our flexible business model also allows us to realize differentiated financial performance in varied market conditions, giving us greater capability to navigate a range of market conditions than what our legacy companies could achieve on a standalone basis. In addition to our strong financial performance, our team continues to execute very well on the ramp of 3D NAND technology and on the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD, each of which Mike and Mark will elaborate on.
I would also like to provide a brief update on our ongoing discussions with Toshiba. Our goal has always been to protect and preserve the health and future of our successful joint ventures. We and our subsidiaries have operated the JVs with Toshiba for the last 17 years. It is a partnership that has been highly successful for both parties and for Japan. As you may have seen in media reports, Mark and I were in Japan last week to continue our dialogue with Toshiba and its stakeholders. Our discussions were constructive, and we will continue to work to seek a solution that is in the best interest of all parties. Beyond that, we will not get into more detail on this matter until we have a material update to share with you. We know this is an important topic for the investment community and we are committed to keeping you apprised. Rest assured, this has the full attention of our team as we are committed to the continued success of the joint ventures.
In closing, I want to thank our employees for all that we have done and accomplished over the course of the last several years. We are building a great company with a strong foundation for our future as a differentiated leader in the storage industry.
I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the June quarter."

To build on Steve's remarks, I'm very pleased with the strong finish to our fiscal 2017 with several milestones achieved across the various areas of our business. All of our reported revenue categories grew both sequentially and year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Results from our NAND flash products were strong in the midst of a continued constrained supply environment, and HDD results were largely within our expectations.
We made further progress towards our 3D NAND technology transition objectives and our operational advancements remained on track. Most importantly, our results since the close of the SanDisk acquisition last year illustrate the power of our platform. Our Client Devices business grew by 36% year-over-year on a pro-forma basis, despite the PC market being slightly weaker-than-expected in the quarter. This growth was driven by our progress in diversifying our customer base and continued expansion of our product portfolio with the gains being most pronounced in mobility and client SSD. Combined revenue from emerging growth applications such as connected home, gaming and industrial also delivered strong sequential growth. We have begun multiple sampling activities for embedded products designed for the automotive market, a compelling long-term growth opportunity.
In Client Solutions, the strength of our WD, HGST and SanDisk brands combined with our global distribution capabilities allowed us to deliver strong performance in what has historically been a relatively weaker period in retail. This enabled us to achieve a 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter on a pro-forma basis. The ability to serve customers with the broadest array of products and solutions is a key element of our strategy.
Turning to Datacenter Devices and Solutions. Shipments of our 10-terabyte helium drives increased significantly on a sequential basis as our industry-leading product made further inroads in hyperscale data centers. The storage and efficiency requirements of data center customers are driving a sustained shift to the 10-terabyte capacity point, and we believe we further increased our market presence in this category. On a cumulative basis, since the launch of our helium platform 4 years ago, we have shipped more than 18 million helium drives. Qualification activities for our 12-terabyte Helium drives began at key hyperscale and OEM customers in the June quarter. With the success of our 10-terabyte platform and our expectation to generate additional leads with the 12-terabyte platform, we are well positioned to maintain product leadership over the next several years.
For the nearline drive market, our expectation for the long-term industry exabyte growth at the 40% annual rate remains unchanged. Given industry-wide component shortages, we now estimate the industry exabyte growth to be approximately 30% for calendar 2017. However, we expect our own growth rate will be approximately 40% given the strong adoption of our nearline offerings.
In our JV fab operations, we continue the strong ramp on our 64-layer 3D NAND BiCS3 technology during the quarter with a significant portion of our product shipments now using this industry-leading technology. Manufacturing yields of BiCS3 continue to meet our expectations, and we are maintaining our projection for the combined JV output of 64-layer 3D NAND to be the highest in the industry in calendar 2017. Development work on BiCS4, our recently announced 96-layer 3D NAND technology, is ongoing and we expect to begin sampling in calendar 2017 with meaningful production volumes in calendar 2018. In addition to the solid progress on our BiCS portfolio, we are delivering innovative new technology capabilities such as the recently announced 4-bits-per-cell 3D NAND.
From a future fab perspective, we intend to participate in the JV's fab 6 to provide additional clean room space to support the further conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect production output from the new clean room facility to begin in calendar 2018. From a NAND industry supply standpoint, our estimate for bit growth rate for calendar 2017 remains at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45% and for calendar 2018, somewhat higher than in 2017. Combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we continue to believe that the favorable NAND industry conditions will persist at least through the first half of calendar 2018.
In closing, our strong fiscal 2017 results highlight the power of our platform. The various ingredients that make up this platform, including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities and our team are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes.
I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."

I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the June quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of markets as we capitalized on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense targets, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the fiscal year with an improved liquidity position as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation.
Our revenue for the June quarter was $4.8 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in Datacenter Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion; client Devices was $2.4 billion, and Client Solutions was $1 billion. Our revenue for the June quarter was up 4% from our March quarter and increased 21% year-over-year on a pro-forma basis. All of my year-over-year comparisons cited today are on a pro-forma basis.
Our Data Center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our June quarter revenue for Datacenter Devices and Solutions increased 7% year-over-year. We saw a sustained strength in capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by a decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client Devices revenue for the June quarter increased 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs. Client Solutions revenue for the June quarter increased 14% year-over-year, driven mostly by our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash-based products. The execution of our strategy and strength of our broad platform enabled us to achieve 7% year-over-year total revenue growth for our full year fiscal 2017.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 41.3%, up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 950 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue and the strength of our capacity enterprise HDD lineup. 
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $812 million. We continue to make progress toward our integration and synergy targets while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the June quarter was $197 million, inclusive of $201 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased from the previous quarter driven by the March repricings and was partially offset by the increase in LIBOR rates during the period. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the June quarter was approximately 11%.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the June quarter was $881 million or $2.93 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $280 million or $0.93 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges related to integration activities and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the June quarter, we generated $939 million in operating cash flow with $178 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $761 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $146 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $6.5 billion, resulting in approximately $7.5 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $2.1 billion to $6.9 billion at the end of the fiscal year, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also assessing value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.
We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter this year, we achieved approximately $350 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $350 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run-rate basis. With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $200 million on an annual run-rate basis toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.
I will now provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue for our September quarter to be approximately $5.1 billion, which would represent approximately 8% year-over-year growth. We expect gross margin to be approximately 41%. Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to be similar to our June quarter results. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $208 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 7% to 9% range. Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately $307 million, an increase from the June quarter driven mostly by a new accounting standard. As a result, we expect earnings per share between $3.25 and $3.35.
We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we now see the opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share that exceeds our prior guidance of $12 per share for the full calendar year 2017.

The other dimension is how we're working on our cost basis in our factory footprint. So we've been taking actions for some time to put ourselves in an optimal position given our broader strategy. But if we bring it down to some more sort of specific elements, we obviously feel very good about where we are with our 10-terabyte. We had significant quarter-over-quarter growth in terms of our output and our volume and our revenue. And we think we're in a very good position, as I stated in my prepared remarks, to continue to gain momentum through the back half of the year. And that's from 10- to 12-terabyte. So to give you a little more color, I think one thing we've seen is the sort of top line of our hard drive business is showing more favorable flat to slightly up dimensions.

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter and wrap up with our guidance. We will then take your questions.
We reported continued strong financial performance in the September quarter, demonstrating the power of our platform and underscoring the differentiated value we can deliver as a comprehensive data storage solutions either. For the September quarter, we reported revenue of $5.2 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 42% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.56. We generated strong operating cash flow, reflecting continued healthy demand in our end markets, most notably in our flash-based businesses. With unabated growth in data creation leading to new challenges and opportunities for our customers, our transformation continues to resonate in the marketplace.
I would now like to spend a few minutes reviewing where we are with Toshiba. There has been significant media coverage around this situation and a lot of it is speculative. So as a starting point, I want to emphasize that the JVs continue to operate efficiently and productively, which we intend to maintain. The JVs benefit from the best talent in the industry and we are deeply appreciative of the professionalism, focus and dedication exhibited by the teams from Toshiba and SanDisk.
From the beginning, our #1 priority has been in stirring the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. That is why we have invested so much time and energy in defining the resolution, one that respects our partnership and resolves this matter so we can move forward in the spirit of collaboration and innovation that has been the hallmark of the 17-year relationship.
Throughout the course of the negotiations, we made numerous allowances to meet the needs of Toshiba and other stakeholders such as lenders, customers, suppliers and government agencies. Most notably, we withdrew from the INCJ/KKR consortium. This eliminated our participation in TMC equity ownership, thus minimizing regulatory risk and directly addressing key concerns of TMC's management. It also would have meant that TMC would remain under full control of Japanese stakeholders.
While we believe we provided the best potential solution to Toshiba and their stakeholders, Toshiba announced the transaction with a consortium, led by SKU Hynix and [ Bain Capital ]. We have made our concerns regarding their consortium clear, and continues to be our position that the transaction is not permitted without our consent. That leads to where we are today.
There are 2 potential paths for resolution, the stakeholders will either engage in constructive dialogue in the near future, or this matter will be resolved through the objective arbitration process. With respect to arbitration, we are moving forward with strong momentum following our successful track record in the California courts. On October 5, the International Court of Arbitration confirmed the 3-member arbitration panel. Shortly thereafter, we informed the panel of our intention to seek injunctive relief to prevent Toshiba from transferring its JV interest to the SK Hynix-Bain consortium without SanDisk's consent. The panel will set a hearing schedule soon, at which point we will officially file our motion. SanDisk consent rights are clear and explicit and we therefore, feel confident in our request for injunctive relief. We expect a ruling in the first part of 2018, in advance of Toshiba's announced time frame to close the proposed transaction.
Just to be clear, we do not take -- we do not undertake litigation lightly. We are not litigious and it should only be a last resort especially in the context of this joint venture relationship.
With respect to Fab 6, you may recall that over the summer during negotiations for the first investment tranche, Toshiba announced that it would do unilaterally invest in Fab 6. This was a surprise to us. In fact, when Toshiba made its announcement, we had more meetings scheduled to further discuss our joint investment. This was the first time that SanDisk was prevented from participating in a new fad investment. To remind you, Toshiba's actions associated with the first tranche, are already the subject of arbitration. The negotiations regarding the second investment tranche for Fab 6 are ongoing. Just as we did during the negotiations for the first investment tranche, we intend to jointly participate in the investment, and we are agreeing to all good faith commercially reasonable terms proposed by Toshiba. However, we will not agree to terms such as SanDisk unilaterally waiving or negating its consent rights as a condition to participate, which is what Toshiba has proposed.
Consequently, at this time, we are not confident that an agreement will be reached on this next investment tranche either. As we have noted, Toshiba's planned initial investment in Fab 6 is solely for its directly owned capacity that is outside of the JVs. If Toshiba proceeds unilaterally with the second investment tranche, it would also be for Toshiba's directly owned capacity, not joint venture capacity. It is also important to remember that the JVs are obligated to provide us our entitled share of flash supply through 2029. Based on the JV agreements, we remain confident in our planned supply bid growth rate of 35% to 45% for calendar 2018 and calendar 2019, irrespective of these initial investments in Fab 6.
In closing, I want to emphasize the following: First, our board and management are focused on resolving our differences with Toshiba, whether that is through a negotiated agreement or the arbitration process; second, we are steadfast in our commitment to protect our interests and those of Western Digital's stakeholders. We are confident in our fact-based legal positions and our right to injunctive relief. Third, as I mentioned earlier, there has been a great deal of misinformation provided into the marketplace through various channels. We expect this activity to persist contributing to potential confusion about this situation and our legal rights. Western Digital will continue to communicate consistently and transparently as we did with the recently filed FAQ and through public forums like this call. And finally, I want to reiterate that our #1 priority has been to ensure the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. From day 1, we have not changed this priority or our commitment to acting in the best interest of our stakeholders. 
I also want to thank the outstanding Western Digital team. You have maintained your focus and continued innovating in delivering for our customers in spectacular fashion. 
With that, I will ask Mike and Mark to share the highlights of our quarter."

Our September quarter results were better-than-expected with demand for our products remaining strong. The joint venture fab operations in [ Yokaichi ] continued as planned and we made further progress in the ongoing conversion to 3D NAND technology.
In Client Devices, revenue grew nicely from the year-ago quarter, driven by increased demand for our embedded flash products and client SSDs. Our embedded flash product, such as [ iNAND ] further adoption within the mobile OEM ecosystem and our design win pipeline for these solutions deepen further for both current and emerging growth applications. Demand for our client SSDs grew due to increased adoption within our OEMs, product portfolios, coinciding with the expansion of our product offering. We began ramping our 64 layer base client SSDs for OEMs in the September quarter. And in the December quarter, we expect to launch our 64 layer in the eMMC solutions for the mobile and compute markets. 
Our Client Solutions revenue grow strongly from the prior year driven by the diversity of our portfolio of HDD and flash-based products. During the quarter, we launched 2 new mobile lifestyle products, IXpand base and My Cloud home, as well as the world's highest capacity microSD card at 400 gigabytes. The strength and appeal of our retail brands along with the broadening product portfolio is enabling us to continue to deliver differentiated value to the global consumer marketplace.
In Datacenter Devices and Solutions, our September quarter revenue was similar to the year-ago quarter as combined revenue growth in enterprise SSDs and Capacity Enterprise hard drives was offset by the expected secular decline in performance enterprise hard drives.
In Capacity Enterprise, as we previously commented, demand continues to be muted due to the ongoing industry-wide shortage of key components, principally DRAM, resulting in a slower industry petabyte growth in calendar 2017. As we look into calendar 2018, which is increasingly informed by our joint planning with hyperscale customers, we expect the petabyte growth will reaccelerate to the 40% annual rate. This will be driven by planned market migration to higher capacities such as our 12-terabyte offering to handle the growth of varied workloads and as the component shortages ease.
In the September quarter, we saw a continued shift in our Capacity Enterprise to 10-terabyte drives, gaining further traction with our third-generation helium offering. Customer qualification activities on our fourth generation helium offering, our 12-terabyte drive remained on track and we expect its commercial ramp will accelerate in the December quarter. We are pleased to note that we have shipped more than 20 million helium drives since our introduction of this platform in 2012.
Just over 2 weeks ago, we hosted a very successful technology event to formally announce important breakthroughs we have achieved to make microwave-assisted magnetic recording, also known as MAMR, a commercial reality. We have been the leader in Capacity Enterprise with innovative solutions, the most recent being HelioSeal technology. The commercial availability of MAMR technology is a significant next step in maintaining this leadership. MAMR substantially leverages past investments in perpendicular magnetic recording technology making the justification for choosing this next-generation drive technology even more compelling.
Further, an additional advantage of MAMR is that it requires almost no ecosystem changes in both our internal manufacturing processes or in customer infrastructure. As we have previously stated, we are planning to take MAMR production in calendar 2019. We believe the aerial density that MAMR can deliver will enable us to provide helium drives at 40 terabytes and higher capacities for this growing market and years ahead. 
In the September quarter, we completed the acquisition of [indiscernible] System, a leading provider of flash storage systems for the enterprise data center application. With TJL and teleflash products focusing on past data and our active skilled products addressing be get on the combined company is in a stronger position to fully address diverse customer workloads. The acquisition also will enable us to accelerate our efforts to move up the stack provide increasingly differentiated value for our customers. 
In our flash joint ventures during the September quarter, we achieved bid output crossover for 3D NAND versus 2D NAND. Manufacturing yields of the BiCS3, our 64-layer 3D NAND, continued to improve and we met our ramp objectives of this industry-leading technology. We are also pleased to report that our entire retail portfolio has been enabled on BiCS3 already and we are well underway in expanding the use of this technology into our OEM offerings, positioning us to deliver the industry's richest mix of 64 layer products in calendar 2017.
From a flash industry standpoint, our estimate for bit growth for calendar 2017 remains at the low-end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%. For calendar 2018, we expect overall industry bit growth to continue to be in that long-term range. Given that the secular growth drivers for flash remain strong, we continue to believe that the favorable industry conditions will persist through the first half of calendar 2018.
Furthermore, as we've previously indicated, our bit supply requirements for calendar 2018 are secure, and we are confident to based on the JV agreements in our ability to bit growth in calendar 2019 within our long-term range.
In closing, our strong September quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our platform, the various ingredients that make up this platform, including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities and our team are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes. The combination of our strong competitive position with our Capacity Enterprise helium drives and the continued ramp of our BiCS3 products could provide a solid base to drive year-over-year revenue growth in our current fiscal year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."

I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the September quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of markets as we capitalize on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margin",884,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the September quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of markets as we capitalize on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense targets, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the September quarter with an improved liquidity position as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation.
It is important to note that our fiscal 2017 financial performance included SanDisk's operating results for the full fiscal year. So any year-over-year comparisons I reference today will be a direct comparison. Our revenue for the September quarter was $5.2 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in Datacenter Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion, Client Devices was $2.7 billion and Client Solutions was $1.1 billion.
Our Data Center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our September quarter revenue for Datacenter Devices and Solutions was flat year-over-year. We saw a sustained strength from Capacity Enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by an expected decline in performance enterprise hard drives.
Client Devices revenue for the September quarter increased 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs. Client Solutions revenue for the September quarter increased 16% year-over-year, mostly as a result of the strength of our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash-based product.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 42.3%, up 840 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue and the strength of our Capacity Enterprise HDD line up.
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $819 million. This included ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, IT transformation projects and operating expenses related to our recently acquired companies. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy targets while also making investments in our future capabilities.
Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the September quarter was $200 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased $31 million year-over-year, primarily from the repricing savings, which were partially offset by LIBOR increases. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 7%. 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $1.1 billion or $3.56 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $681 million or $2.23 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges related to integration activities and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the September quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 158% year-over-year. We continue to reinvest on our businesses with $286 million spent on capital investments resulting in free cash flow up $847 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $147 million during the quarter, and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $7 billion, resulting in approximately $8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $600 million to $6.3 billion at the end of the September quarter, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our deleveraging plans and we'll continue to optimize our cost of capital and capital structure while retaining sufficient liquidity and flexibility.
We remain on track to achieve our planned synergy targets from both the HGT and SanDisk integrations in the time commitments we previously established. The combined savings of the programs have contributed to our strong financial results and validated our strategy for the acquisition. 
I will now provide our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue to be between $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be slightly higher than the prior quarter.
Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to be approximately $830 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 6% to 8% range. Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately 309 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.60 and $3.70, resulting in EPS for the calendar quarter -- or calendar year 2017 of approximately $12.50.
We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. While we expect to see our normal seasonal decline in the second half of fiscal 2018, we see the opportunity to achieve revenue growth at the high end of our long-term model of 4% to 8% for fiscal 2018. Also, based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $13 for fiscal 2018.

So the demand is there, sufficient to consume our bit output. Relative to the mix and penetration of SSD, I think that is somewhat slowed based upon NAND constraints at an industry basis.

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter and wrap up with our guidance. We will then take your questions.
We reported continued strong financial performance in the September quarter, demonstrating the power of our platform and underscoring the differentiated value we can deliver as a comprehensive data storage solutions leader. For the September quarter, we reported revenue of $5.2 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 42% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.56. We generated strong operating cash flow, reflecting continued healthy demand in our end markets, most notably in our flash-based businesses. With unabated growth in data creation, leading to new challenges and opportunities for our customers, our transformation continues to resonate in the marketplace.
I would now like to spend a few minutes reviewing where we are with Toshiba. There has been significant media coverage around this situation, and a lot of it is speculative. So as a starting point, I want to emphasize that the JVs continue to operate efficiently and productively, which we intend to maintain. The JVs benefit from the best talent in the industry, and we are deeply appreciative of the professionalism, focus and dedication exhibited by the teams from Toshiba and SanDisk.
From the beginning, our #1 priority has been ensuring the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. That is why we have invested so much time and energy in defining a resolution, one that respects our partnership and resolves this matter so we can move forward in the spirit of collaboration and innovation that has been the hallmark of this 17-year relationship.
Throughout the course of the negotiations, we made numerous allowances to meet the needs of Toshiba and other stakeholders such as lenders, customers, suppliers and government agencies. Most notably, we withdrew from the INCJ/KKR consortium. This eliminated our participation in TMC equity ownership, thus minimizing regulatory risk and directly addressing key concerns of TMC's management. It also would have meant that TMC would remain under full control of Japanese stakeholders.
While we believe we provided the best potential solution to Toshiba and their stakeholders, Toshiba announced the transaction with a consortium led by SK Hynix and Bain Capital. We have made our concerns regarding their consortium clear. It continues to be our position that the transaction is not permitted without our consent. That leads to where we are today.
There are 2 potential paths for resolution, the stakeholders will either engage in constructive dialogue in the near future or this matter will be resolved through the objective arbitration process. With respect to arbitration, we are moving forward with strong momentum following our successful track record in the California courts. On October 5, the International Court of Arbitration confirmed the 3-member arbitration panel. Shortly thereafter, we informed the panel of our intention to seek injunctive relief to prevent Toshiba from transferring its JV interest to the SK Hynix-Bain consortium without SanDisk's consent. The panel will set a hearing schedule soon, at which point, we will officially file our motion. SanDisk consent rights are clear and explicit, and we therefore feel confident in our request for injunctive relief. We expect a ruling in the first part of 2018, in advance of Toshiba's announced time frame to close the proposed transaction. Just to be clear, we do not take -- we do not undertake litigation lightly. We are not litigious, and it should only be a last resort, especially in the context of this joint venture relationship.
With respect to Fab 6, you may recall that over the summer, during negotiations for the first investment tranche, Toshiba announced that it would unilaterally invest in Fab 6. This was a surprise to us. In fact, when Toshiba made its announcement, we had more meetings scheduled to further discuss our joint investment. This was the first time that SanDisk was prevented from participating in a new fab investment. To remind you, Toshiba's actions associated with the first tranche are already the subject of arbitration. The negotiations regarding the second investment tranche for Fab 6 are ongoing. Just as we did during the negotiations for the first investment tranche, we intend to jointly participate in the investment, and we are agreeing to all good faith commercially reasonable terms proposed by Toshiba. However, we will not agree to terms such as SanDisk unilaterally waiving or negating its consent rights as a condition to participate, which is what Toshiba has proposed.
Consequently, at this time, we are not confident that an agreement will be reached on this next investment tranche either. As we have noted, Toshiba's planned initial investment in Fab 6 is solely for its directly owned capacity that is outside of the JVs. If Toshiba proceeds unilaterally with the second investment tranche, it would also be for Toshiba's directly owned capacity, not joint venture capacity. It is also important to remember that the JVs are obligated to provide us our entitled share of flash supply through 2029. Based on the JV agreements, we remain confident in our planned supply bit growth rate of 35% to 45% for calendar 2018 and calendar 2019, irrespective of these initial investments in Fab 6.
In closing, I want to emphasize the following: first, our board and management are focused on resolving our differences with Toshiba, whether that is through a negotiated agreement or the arbitration process; second, we are steadfast in our commitment to protect our interests and those of Western Digital's stakeholders. We are confident in our fact-based legal positions and our right to injunctive relief; third, as I mentioned earlier, there has been a great deal of misinformation provided into the marketplace through various channels. We expect this activity to persist, contributing to potential confusion about this situation and our legal rights. Western Digital will continue to communicate consistently and transparently as we did with the recently filed FAQ and through public forums like this call; and finally, I want to reiterate that our #1 priority has been to ensure the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. From day 1, we have not changed this priority or our commitment to acting in the best interest of our stakeholders. 
I also want to thank the outstanding Western Digital team. You have maintained your focus and continued innovating and delivering for our customers in spectacular fashion. 
With that, I will ask Mike and Mark to share the highlights of our quarter."

Our September quarter results were better-than-expected, with demand for our products remaining strong. The joint venture fab operations in Yokkaichi continued as planned, and we made further progress in the ongoing conversion to 3D NAND technology.
In Client Devices, revenue grew nicely from the year-ago quarter, driven by increased demand for our embedded flash products and client SSDs. Our embedded flash products such as iNAND gained further adoption within the mobile OEM ecosystem, and our design win pipeline for these solutions deepened further for both current and emerging growth applications. Demand for our client SSDs grew due to increased adoption within our OEMs, product portfolios, coinciding with the expansion of our product offering. We began ramping our 64-layer-based client SSDs for OEMs in the September quarter. And in the December quarter, we expect to launch our 64-layer eMMC solutions for the mobile and compute markets. 
Our Client Solutions revenue grow strongly from the prior year, driven by the diversity of our portfolio of HDD and flash-based products. During the quarter, we launched 2 new mobile lifestyle products, iXpand base and My Cloud home, as well as the world's highest capacity microSD card at 400 gigabytes. The strength and appeal of our retail brands, along with the broadening product portfolio, is enabling us to continue to deliver differentiated value to the global consumer marketplace.
In Datacenter Devices and Solutions, our September quarter revenue was similar to the year-ago quarter as combined revenue growth in enterprise SSDs and capacity enterprise hard drives was offset by the expected secular decline in performance enterprise hard drives.
In capacity enterprise, as we previously commented, demand continues to be muted due to the ongoing industry-wide shortage of key components, principally DRAM, resulting in slower industry petabyte growth in calendar 2017. As we look into calendar 2018, which is increasingly informed by our joint planning with hyperscale customers, we expect the petabyte growth will reaccelerate to the 40% annual rate. This will be driven by planned market migration to higher capacities such as our 12-terabyte offering to handle the growth of varied workloads and as the component shortages ease.
In the September quarter, we saw a continued shift in capacity enterprise to 10-terabyte drives, gaining further traction with our third-generation helium offering. Customer qualification activities on our fourth-generation helium offering, our 12-terabyte drive remained on track, and we expect its commercial ramp will accelerate in the December quarter. We are pleased to note that we have shipped more than 20 million helium drives since our introduction of this platform in 2012.
Just over 2 weeks ago, we hosted a very successful technology event to formally announce important breakthroughs we have achieved to make microwave-assisted magnetic recording, also known as MAMR, a commercial reality. We have been the leader in capacity enterprise with innovative solutions, the most recent being HelioSeal technology. The commercial availability of MAMR technology is a significant next step in maintaining this leadership. MAMR substantially leverages past investments in perpendicular magnetic recording technology, making the justification for choosing this next-generation drive technology even more compelling.
Further, an additional advantage of MAMR is that it requires almost no ecosystem changes in both our internal manufacturing processes or in customer infrastructure. As we have previously stated, we are planning to take MAMR into production in calendar 2019. We believe the areal density advantages that MAMR can deliver will enable us to provide helium drives at 40 terabytes and higher capacities for this growing market and years ahead. 
In the September quarter, we completed the acquisition of Tegile Systems, a leading provider of flash storage systems for the enterprise data center application. With Tegile's IntelliFlash products focusing on fast data and our ActiveScale products addressing big data, combined company is in a stronger position to fully address diverse customer workloads. The Tegile acquisition also -- will also enable us to accelerate our efforts to move up the stack, provide increasingly differentiated value for our customers. 
In our flash joint ventures during the September quarter, we achieved bit output crossover for 3D NAND versus 2D NAND. Manufacturing yields of BiCS3, our 64-layer 3D NAND, continued to improve, and we met our ramp objectives of this industry-leading technology. We are also pleased to report that our entire retail portfolio has been enabled on BiCS3 already, and we are well underway in expanding the use of this technology into our OEM offerings, positioning us to deliver the industry's richest mix of 64-layer-based products in calendar 2017.
From a flash industry standpoint, our estimate for bit growth for calendar 2017 remains at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%. For calendar 2018, we expect overall industry bit growth to continue to be in that long-term range. Given that the secular growth drivers for flash remain strong, we continue to believe that the favorable industry conditions will persist through the first half of calendar 2018.
Furthermore, as we've previously indicated, our bit supply requirements for calendar 2018 are secure, and we are confident based on the JV agreements and our ability to achieve bit growth in calendar 2019 within our long-term range.
In closing, our strong September quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our platform. The various ingredients that make up this platform, including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities and our team, are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes. The combination of our strong competitive position with our capacity enterprise helium drives and the continued ramp of our BiCS3 products should provide a solid base to drive year-over-year revenue growth in our current fiscal year. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."

I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the September quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of markets as we capitalize on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margin",883,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the September quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of markets as we capitalize on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense targets, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the September quarter with an improved liquidity position as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation.
It is important to note that our fiscal 2017 financial performance included SanDisk's operating results for the full fiscal year. So any year-over-year comparisons I reference today will be a direct comparison. 
Our revenue for the September quarter was $5.2 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in Datacenter Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion, Client Devices was $2.7 billion and Client Solutions was $1.1 billion.
Our Datacenter business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our September quarter revenue for Datacenter Devices and Solutions was flat year-over-year. We saw a sustained strength from capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by an expected decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client Devices revenue for the September quarter increased 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs. Client Solutions revenue for the September quarter increased 16% year-over-year, mostly as a result of the strength of our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash-based products.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 42.3%, up 840 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue and the strength of our capacity enterprise HDD lineup.
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $819 million. This included ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, IT transformation projects and operating expenses related to our recently acquired companies. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy targets while also making investments in our future capabilities.
Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the September quarter was $200 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased $31 million year-over-year, primarily from the repricing savings, which were partially offset by LIBOR increases. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 7%. 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $1.1 billion or $3.56 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $681 million or $2.23 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges related to integration activities and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the September quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 158% year-over-year. We continue to reinvest in our businesses with $286 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $847 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $147 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $7 billion, resulting in approximately $8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $600 million to $6.3 billion at the end of the September quarter, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our deleveraging plans, and we'll continue to optimize our cost of capital and capital structure while retaining sufficient liquidity and flexibility.
We remain on track to achieve our planned synergy targets from both the HGST and SanDisk integrations in the time commitments we previously established. The combined savings of the programs have contributed to our strong financial results and validated our strategy for the acquisition. 
I will now provide our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue to be between $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be slightly higher than the prior quarter.
Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to be approximately $830 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 6% to 8% range. Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately 309 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.60 and $3.70, resulting in EPS for the calendar quarter -- or calendar year 2017 of approximately $12.50.
We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. While we expect to see our normal seasonal decline in the second half of fiscal 2018, we see the opportunity to achieve revenue growth at the high end of our long-term model of 4% to 8% for fiscal 2018. Also, based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $13 for fiscal 2018.

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter and wrap up with our guidance. We will then take your questions.
We reported continued strong financial performance in the September quarter, demonstrating the power of our platform and underscoring the differentiated value we can deliver as a comprehensive data storage solutions leader. For the September quarter, we reported revenue of $5.2 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 42% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.56. We generated strong operating cash flow, reflecting continued healthy demand in our end markets, most notably in our flash-based businesses. With unabated growth in data creation leading to new challenges and opportunities for our customers, our transformation continues to resonate in the marketplace.
I would now like to spend a few minutes reviewing where we are with Toshiba. There has been significant media coverage around this situation, and a lot of it is speculative. So as a starting point, I want to emphasize that the JVs continue to operate efficiently and productively, which we intend to maintain. The JVs benefit from the best talent in the industry, and we are deeply appreciative of the professionalism, focus and dedication exhibited by the teams from Toshiba and SanDisk.
From the beginning, our #1 priority has been ensuring the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. That is why we have invested so much time and energy into finding a resolution, one that respects our partnership and resolves this matter so we can move forward in the spirit of collaboration and innovation that has been the hallmark of this 17-year relationship.
Throughout the course of the negotiations, we made numerous allowances to meet the needs of Toshiba and other stakeholders such as lenders, customers, suppliers and government agencies. Most notably, we withdrew from the INCJ/KKR consortium. This eliminated our participation in TMC equity ownership, thus minimizing regulatory risk and directly addressing key concerns of TMC's management. It also would have meant that TMC would remain under full control of Japanese stakeholders.
While we believe we provided the best potential solution to Toshiba and their stakeholders, Toshiba announced the transaction with a consortium led by SK Hynix and Bain Capital. We have made our concerns regarding their consortium clear. It continues to be our position that the transaction is not permitted without our consent. That leads to where we are today.
There are 2 potential paths for resolution: The stakeholders will either engage in constructive dialogue in the near future; or this matter will be resolved through the objective arbitration process. With respect to arbitration, we are moving forward with strong momentum following our successful track record in the California courts. On October 5, the International Court of Arbitration confirmed the 3-member arbitration panel. Shortly thereafter, we informed the panel of our intention to seek injunctive relief to prevent Toshiba from transferring its JV interests to the SK Hynix-Bain consortium without SanDisk's consent. The panel will set a hearing schedule soon, at which point, we will officially file our motion. SanDisk consent rights are clear and explicit, and we therefore feel confident in our request for injunctive relief. We expect a ruling in the first part of 2018, in advance of Toshiba's announced time frame to close the proposed transaction. Just to be clear, we do not take -- we do not undertake litigation lightly. We are not litigious, and it should only be a last resort, especially in the context of this joint venture relationship.
With respect to Fab 6, you may recall that over the summer, during negotiations for the first investment tranche, Toshiba announced that it would unilaterally invest in Fab 6. This was a surprise to us. In fact, when Toshiba made its announcement, we had more meetings scheduled to further discuss our joint investment. This was the first time that SanDisk was prevented from participating in a new fab investment. To remind you, Toshiba's actions associated with the first tranche are already the subject of arbitration. The negotiations regarding the second investment tranche for Fab 6 are ongoing. Just as we did during the negotiations for the first investment tranche, we intend to jointly participate in the investment, and we are agreeing to all good faith, commercially-reasonable terms proposed by Toshiba. However, we will not agree to terms such as SanDisk unilaterally waiving or negating its consent rights as a condition to participate, which is what Toshiba has proposed.
Consequently, at this time, we are not confident that an agreement will be reached on this next investment tranche either. As we have noted, Toshiba's planned initial investment in Fab 6 is solely for its directly owned capacity that is outside of the JVs. If Toshiba proceeds unilaterally with the second investment tranche, it would also be for Toshiba's directly owned capacity, not joint venture capacity. It is also important to remember that the JVs are obligated to provide us our entitled share of flash supply through 2029. Based on the JV agreements, we remain confident in our planned supply bit growth rate of 35% to 45% for calendar 2018 and calendar 2019, irrespective of these initial investments in Fab 6.
In closing, I want to emphasize the following: First, our board and management are focused on resolving our differences with Toshiba, whether that is through a negotiated agreement or the arbitration process; second, we are steadfast in our commitment to protect our interests and those of Western Digital's stakeholders. We are confident in our fact-based legal positions and our right to injunctive relief; third, as I mentioned earlier, there has been a great deal of misinformation provided into the marketplace through various channels. We expect this activity to persist, contributing to potential confusion about this situation and our legal rights. Western Digital will continue to communicate consistently and transparently, as we did with the recently filed FAQ and through public forums like this call. And finally, I want to reiterate that our #1 priority has been to ensure the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. From day 1, we have not changed this priority or our commitment to acting in the best interest of our stakeholders. 
I also want to thank the outstanding Western Digital team. You have maintained your focus and continued innovating and delivering for our customers in spectacular fashion. 
With that, I will ask Mike and Mark to share the highlights of our quarter."

Our September quarter results were better than expected, with demand for our products remaining strong. The joint venture fab operations in Yokkaichi continued as planned, and we made further progress in the ongoing conversion to 3D NAND technology.
In Client Devices, revenue grew nicely from the year-ago quarter, driven by increased demand for our embedded flash products and client SSDs. Our embedded flash products, such as iNAND, gained further adoption within the mobile OEM ecosystem, and our design win pipeline for these solutions deepened further for both current and emerging growth applications. Demand for our client SSDs grew due to increased adoption within our OEMs' product portfolios, coinciding with the expansion of our product offering. We began ramping our 64-layer-based client SSDs for OEMs in the September quarter. And in the December quarter, we expect to launch our 64-layer eMMC solutions for the mobile and compute markets. 
Our Client Solutions revenue grew strongly from the prior year, driven by the diversity of our portfolio of HDD and flash-based products. During the quarter, we launched 2 new mobile lifestyle products, iXpand Base and My Cloud Home, as well as the world's highest capacity microSD card at 400 gigabytes. The strength and appeal of our retail brands, along with the broadening product portfolio, is enabling us to continue to deliver differentiated value to the global consumer marketplace.
In Datacenter Devices and Solutions, our September quarter revenue was similar to the year-ago quarter, as combined revenue growth in enterprise SSDs and capacity enterprise hard drives was offset by the expected secular decline in performance enterprise hard drives.
In capacity enterprise, as we previously commented, demand continues to be muted due to the ongoing industry-wide shortage of key components, principally DRAM, resulting in slower industry petabyte growth in calendar 2017. As we look into calendar 2018, which is increasingly informed by our joint planning with hyperscale customers, we expect the petabyte growth will reaccelerate to the 40% annual rate. This will be driven by planned market migration to higher capacities, such as our 12-terabyte offering, to handle the growth of varied workloads and as the component shortages ease.
In the September quarter, we saw a continued shift in capacity enterprise to 10-terabyte drives, gaining further traction with our third-generation Helium offering. Customer qualification activities on our fourth-generation Helium offering, our 12-terabyte drive, remain on track, and we expect its commercial ramp will accelerate in the December quarter. We are pleased to note that we have shipped more than 20 million Helium drives since our introduction of this platform in 2012.
Just over 2 weeks ago, we hosted a very successful technology event to formally announce important breakthroughs we have achieved to make microwave-assisted magnetic recording, also known as MAMR, a commercial reality. We have been the leader in capacity enterprise with innovative solutions, the most recent being HelioSeal technology. The commercial availability of MAMR technology is a significant next step in maintaining this leadership. MAMR substantially leverages past investments in perpendicular magnetic recording technology, making the justification for choosing this next-generation drive technology even more compelling.
Further, an additional advantage of MAMR is that it requires almost no ecosystem changes in both our internal manufacturing processes or in customer infrastructure. As we have previously stated, we are planning to take MAMR into production in calendar 2019. We believe the areal density advantages that MAMR can deliver will enable us to provide Helium drives at 40 terabytes and higher capacities for this growing market in years ahead. 
In the September quarter, we completed the acquisition of Tegile Systems, a leading provider of flash storage systems for the enterprise data center application. With Tegile's IntelliFlash products focusing on fast data and our ActiveScale products addressing big data, the combined company is in a stronger position to fully address diverse customer workloads. The Tegile acquisition also -- will also enable us to accelerate our efforts to move up the stack, provide increasingly differentiated value for our customers. 
In our flash joint ventures during the September quarter, we achieved bit output crossover for 3D NAND versus 2D NAND. Manufacturing yields of BiCS3, our 64-layer 3D NAND, continued to improve, and we met our ramp objectives of this industry-leading technology. We are also pleased to report that our entire retail portfolio has been enabled on BiCS3 already, and we are well underway in expanding the use of this technology into our OEM offerings, positioning us to deliver the industry's richest mix of 64-layer-based products in calendar 2017.
From a flash industry standpoint, our estimate for bit growth for calendar 2017 remains at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%. For calendar 2018, we expect overall industry bit growth to continue to be in that long-term range. Given that the secular growth drivers for flash remain strong, we continue to believe that the favorable industry conditions will persist through the first half of calendar 2018.
Furthermore, as we've previously indicated, our bit supply requirements for calendar 2018 are secure, and we are confident based on the JV agreements and our ability to achieve bit growth in calendar 2019 within our long-term range.
In closing, our strong September quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our platform. The various ingredients that make up this platform, including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities and our team, are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes. The combination of our strong competitive position, with our capacity enterprise Helium drives and the continued ramp of our BiCS3 products, should provide a solid base to drive year-over-year revenue growth in our current fiscal year. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."

I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the September quarter.

I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the September quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of markets, as we capitalized on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense targets, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the September quarter with an improved liquidity position as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation.
It is important to note that our fiscal 2017 financial performance included SanDisk's operating results for the full fiscal year. So any year-over-year comparisons I reference today will be a direct comparison. 
Our revenue for the September quarter was $5.2 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in Datacenter Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion, Client Devices was $2.7 billion and Client Solutions was $1.1 billion.
Our Datacenter business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our September quarter revenue for Datacenter Devices and Solutions was flat year-over-year. We saw a sustained strength from capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by an expected decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client Devices revenue for the September quarter increased 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs. Client Solutions revenue for the September quarter increased 16% year-over-year, mostly as a result of the strength of our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash-based products.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 42.3%, up 840 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue and the strength of our capacity enterprise HDD lineup.
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $819 million. This included ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, IT transformation projects and operating expenses related to our recently acquired companies. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy targets while also making investments in our future capabilities.
Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the September quarter was $200 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased $31 million year-over-year, primarily from the repricing savings, which were partially offset by LIBOR increases. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 7%. 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $1.1 billion or $3.56 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $681 million or $2.23 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges related to integration activities and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the September quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 158% year-over-year. We continue to reinvest in our businesses, with $286 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $847 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $147 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $7 billion, resulting in approximately $8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $600 million to $6.3 billion at the end of the September quarter, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our deleveraging plans, and we'll continue to optimize our cost of capital and capital structure while retaining sufficient liquidity and flexibility.
We remain on track to achieve our planned synergy targets from both the HGST and SanDisk integrations in the time commitments we previously established. The combined savings of the programs have contributed to our strong financial results and validated our strategy for the acquisitions. 
I will now provide our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue to be between $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be slightly higher than the prior quarter.
Turning to operating expenses, we expect those to be approximately $830 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 6% to 8% range. Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately 309 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.60 and $3.70, resulting in EPS for the calendar quarter -- or calendar year 2017 of approximately $12.50.
We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. While we expect to see our normal seasonal decline in the second half of fiscal 2018, we see the opportunity to achieve revenue growth at the high end of our long-term model of 4% to 8% for fiscal 2018. Also, based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $13 for fiscal 2018.

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter and wrap up with our guidance. We will then take your questions.
We reported continued strong financial performance in the September quarter, demonstrating the power of our platform and underscoring the differentiated value we can deliver as a comprehensive data storage solutions leader. For the September quarter, we reported revenue of $5.2 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 42% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.56. We generated strong operating cash flow, reflecting continued healthy demand in our end markets, most notably in our flash-based businesses. With unabated growth in data creation leading to new challenges and opportunities for our customers, our transformation continues to resonate in the marketplace.
I would now like to spend a few minutes reviewing where we are with Toshiba. There has been significant media coverage around this situation, and a lot of it is speculative. So as a starting point, I want to emphasize that the JVs continue to operate efficiently and productively, which we intend to maintain. The JVs benefit from the best talent in the industry, and we are deeply appreciative of the professionalism, focus and dedication exhibited by the teams from Toshiba and SanDisk.
From the beginning, our #1 priority has been ensuring the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. That is why we have invested so much time and energy into finding a resolution, one that respects our partnership and resolves this matter so we can move forward in the spirit of collaboration and innovation that has been the hallmark of this 17-year relationship.
Throughout the course of the negotiations, we made numerous allowances to meet the needs of Toshiba and other stakeholders such as lenders, customers, suppliers and government agencies. Most notably, we withdrew from the INCJ/KKR consortium. This eliminated our participation in TMC equity ownership, thus minimizing regulatory risk and directly addressing key concerns of TMC's management. It also would have meant that TMC would remain under full control of Japanese stakeholders.
While we believe we provided the best potential solution to Toshiba and their stakeholders, Toshiba announced the transaction with a consortium led by SK Hynix and Bain Capital. We have made our concerns regarding their consortium clear. It continues to be our position that the transaction is not permitted without our consent. That leads to where we are today.
There are 2 potential paths for resolution: The stakeholders will either engage in constructive dialogue in the near future; or this matter will be resolved through the objective arbitration process. With respect to arbitration, we are moving forward with strong momentum following our successful track record in the California courts. On October 5, the International Court of Arbitration confirmed the 3-member arbitration panel. Shortly thereafter, we informed the panel of our intention to seek injunctive relief to prevent Toshiba from transferring its JV interests to the SK Hynix-Bain consortium without SanDisk's consent. The panel will set a hearing schedule soon, at which point, we will officially file our motion. SanDisk consent rights are clear and explicit, and we therefore feel confident in our request for injunctive relief. We expect a ruling in the first part of 2018, in advance of Toshiba's announced time frame to close the proposed transaction. Just to be clear, we do not take -- we do not undertake litigation lightly. We are not litigious, and it should only be a last resort, especially in the context of this joint venture relationship.
With respect to Fab 6, you may recall that over the summer, during negotiations for the first investment tranche, Toshiba announced that it would unilaterally invest in Fab 6. This was a surprise to us. In fact, when Toshiba made its announcement, we had more meetings scheduled to further discuss our joint investment. This was the first time that SanDisk was prevented from participating in a new fab investment. To remind you, Toshiba's actions associated with the first tranche are already the subject of arbitration. The negotiations regarding the second investment tranche for Fab 6 are ongoing. Just as we did during the negotiations for the first investment tranche, we intend to jointly participate in the investment, and we are agreeing to all good faith, commercially-reasonable terms proposed by Toshiba. However, we will not agree to terms such as SanDisk unilaterally waiving or negating its consent rights as a condition to participate, which is what Toshiba has proposed.
Consequently, at this time, we are not confident that an agreement will be reached on this next investment tranche either. As we have noted, Toshiba's planned initial investment in Fab 6 is solely for its directly owned capacity that is outside of the JVs. If Toshiba proceeds unilaterally with the second investment tranche, it would also be for Toshiba's directly owned capacity, not joint venture capacity. It is also important to remember that the JVs are obligated to provide us our entitled share of flash supply through 2029. Based on the JV agreements, we remain confident in our planned supply bit growth rate of 35% to 45% for calendar 2018 and calendar 2019, irrespective of these initial investments in Fab 6.
In closing, I want to emphasize the following: First, our board and management are focused on resolving our differences with Toshiba, whether that is through a negotiated agreement or the arbitration process; second, we are steadfast in our commitment to protect our interests and those of Western Digital's stakeholders. We are confident in our fact-based legal positions and our right to injunctive relief; third, as I mentioned earlier, there has been a great deal of misinformation provided into the marketplace through various channels. We expect this activity to persist, contributing to potential confusion about this situation and our legal rights. Western Digital will continue to communicate consistently and transparently, as we did with the recently filed FAQ and through public forums like this call. And finally, I want to reiterate that our #1 priority has been to ensure the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. From day 1, we have not changed this priority or our commitment to acting in the best interest of our stakeholders. 
I also want to thank the outstanding Western Digital team. You have maintained your focus and continued innovating and delivering for our customers in spectacular fashion. 
With that, I will ask Mike and Mark to share the highlights of our quarter."

Our September quarter results were better than expected, with demand for our products remaining strong. The joint venture fab operations in Yokkaichi continued as planned, and we made further progress in the ongoing conversion to 3D NAND technology.
In Client Devices, revenue grew nicely from the year-ago quarter, driven by increased demand for our embedded flash products and client SSDs. Our embedded flash products, such as iNAND, gained further adoption within the mobile OEM ecosystem, and our design win pipeline for these solutions deepened further for both current and emerging growth applications. Demand for our client SSDs grew due to increased adoption within our OEMs' product portfolios, coinciding with the expansion of our product offering. We began ramping our 64-layer-based client SSDs for OEMs in the September quarter. And in the December quarter, we expect to launch our 64-layer eMMC solutions for the mobile and compute markets. 
Our Client Solutions revenue grew strongly from the prior year, driven by the diversity of our portfolio of HDD and flash-based products. During the quarter, we launched 2 new mobile lifestyle products, iXpand Base and My Cloud Home, as well as the world's highest capacity microSD card at 400 gigabytes. The strength and appeal of our retail brands, along with the broadening product portfolio, is enabling us to continue to deliver differentiated value to the global consumer marketplace.
In Datacenter Devices and Solutions, our September quarter revenue was similar to the year-ago quarter, as combined revenue growth in enterprise SSDs and capacity enterprise hard drives was offset by the expected secular decline in performance enterprise hard drives.
In capacity enterprise, as we previously commented, demand continues to be muted due to the ongoing industry-wide shortage of key components, principally DRAM, resulting in slower industry petabyte growth in calendar 2017. As we look into calendar 2018, which is increasingly informed by our joint planning with hyperscale customers, we expect the petabyte growth will reaccelerate to the 40% annual rate. This will be driven by planned market migration to higher capacities, such as our 12-terabyte offering, to handle the growth of varied workloads and as the component shortages ease.
In the September quarter, we saw a continued shift in capacity enterprise to 10-terabyte drives, gaining further traction with our third-generation Helium offering. Customer qualification activities on our fourth-generation Helium offering, our 12-terabyte drive, remain on track, and we expect its commercial ramp will accelerate in the December quarter. We are pleased to note that we have shipped more than 20 million Helium drives since our introduction of this platform in 2012.
Just over 2 weeks ago, we hosted a very successful technology event to formally announce important breakthroughs we have achieved to make microwave-assisted magnetic recording, also known as MAMR, a commercial reality. We have been the leader in capacity enterprise with innovative solutions, the most recent being HelioSeal technology. The commercial availability of MAMR technology is a significant next step in maintaining this leadership. MAMR substantially leverages past investments in perpendicular magnetic recording technology, making the justification for choosing this next-generation drive technology even more compelling.
Further, an additional advantage of MAMR is that it requires almost no ecosystem changes in both our internal manufacturing processes or in customer infrastructure. As we have previously stated, we are planning to take MAMR into production in calendar 2019. We believe the areal density advantages that MAMR can deliver will enable us to provide Helium drives at 40 terabytes and higher capacities for this growing market in years ahead. 
In the September quarter, we completed the acquisition of Tegile Systems, a leading provider of flash storage systems for the enterprise data center application. With Tegile's IntelliFlash products focusing on fast data and our ActiveScale products addressing big data, the combined company is in a stronger position to fully address diverse customer workloads. The Tegile acquisition also -- will also enable us to accelerate our efforts to move up the stack, provide increasingly differentiated value for our customers. 
In our flash joint ventures during the September quarter, we achieved bit output crossover for 3D NAND versus 2D NAND. Manufacturing yields of BiCS3, our 64-layer 3D NAND, continued to improve, and we met our ramp objectives of this industry-leading technology. We are also pleased to report that our entire retail portfolio has been enabled on BiCS3 already, and we are well underway in expanding the use of this technology into our OEM offerings, positioning us to deliver the industry's richest mix of 64-layer-based products in calendar 2017.
From a flash industry standpoint, our estimate for bit growth for calendar 2017 remains at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%. For calendar 2018, we expect overall industry bit growth to continue to be in that long-term range. Given that the secular growth drivers for flash remain strong, we continue to believe that the favorable industry conditions will persist through the first half of calendar 2018.
Furthermore, as we've previously indicated, our bit supply requirements for calendar 2018 are secure, and we are confident based on the JV agreements and our ability to achieve bit growth in calendar 2019 within our long-term range.
In closing, our strong September quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our platform. The various ingredients that make up this platform, including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities and our team, are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes. The combination of our strong competitive position, with our capacity enterprise Helium drives and the continued ramp of our BiCS3 products, should provide a solid base to drive year-over-year revenue growth in our current fiscal year. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion."

I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the September quarter.

I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the September quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of markets, as we capitalized on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense targets, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the September quarter with an improved liquidity position as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation.
It is important to note that our fiscal 2017 financial performance included SanDisk's operating results for the full fiscal year. So any year-over-year comparisons I reference today will be a direct comparison. 
Our revenue for the September quarter was $5.2 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in Datacenter Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion, Client Devices was $2.7 billion and Client Solutions was $1.1 billion.
Our Datacenter business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our September quarter revenue for Datacenter Devices and Solutions was flat year-over-year. We saw a sustained strength from capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by an expected decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client Devices revenue for the September quarter increased 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs. Client Solutions revenue for the September quarter increased 16% year-over-year, mostly as a result of the strength of our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash-based products.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 42.3%, up 840 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue and the strength of our capacity enterprise HDD lineup.
Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $819 million. This included ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, IT transformation projects and operating expenses related to our recently acquired companies. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy targets while also making investments in our future capabilities.
Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the September quarter was $200 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased $31 million year-over-year, primarily from the repricing savings, which were partially offset by LIBOR increases. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 7%. 
On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $1.1 billion or $3.56 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $681 million or $2.23 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges related to integration activities and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of noncash charges.
In the September quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 158% year-over-year. We continue to reinvest in our businesses, with $286 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $847 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $147 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.
We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $7 billion, resulting in approximately $8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $600 million to $6.3 billion at the end of the September quarter, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our deleveraging plans, and we'll continue to optimize our cost of capital and capital structure while retaining sufficient liquidity and flexibility.
We remain on track to achieve our planned synergy targets from both the HGST and SanDisk integrations in the time commitments we previously established. The combined savings of the programs have contributed to our strong financial results and validated our strategy for the acquisitions. 
I will now provide our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue to be between $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be slightly higher than the prior quarter.
Turning to operating expenses, we expect those to be approximately $830 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 6% to 8% range. Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately 309 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.60 and $3.70, resulting in EPS for the calendar quarter -- or calendar year 2017 of approximately $12.50.
We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. While we expect to see our normal seasonal decline in the second half of fiscal 2018, we see the opportunity to achieve revenue growth at the high end of our long-term model of 4% to 8% for fiscal 2018. Also, based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $13 for fiscal 2018.
