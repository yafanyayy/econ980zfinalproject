I'll then review guidance for Q4, and then I'll turn the call over to Mark and then Larry. Just so you all know, we're not all in the same place today, so we may all answer at once. So just give us a chance.
Clearly, we are delighted with our results as Software and Cloud revenue was at the high end of my guidance and earnings per share was $0.06 above the high end of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud is now clearly in full swing. We continue to see outsized growth rates in our cloud business, especially when compared with our key competitors who are all seeing slowing growth.
But more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business has overtaken new software license declines on an annual basis. Next year, I expect our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue. The investments we've made to transition our business to the cloud have been important to ensure that Oracle remains a technology leader, and we're now beginning to see the benefits in our results.
With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business. That is growing revenue with disciplined cost management that results in EPS and cash flow to grow even faster. I expect EPS growth to ramp up throughout next year.
We continue to use constant dollar rates on our quarterly calls so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movements were largely in line with my guidance of 1% currency headwind for revenue and $0.01 negative impact to EPS.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 86% from last year. You can also see the continued strength of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The growth deferred revenue balance is now over $2 billion, up 75% in U.S. dollars, and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 111% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
When you add together Cloud SaaS, PaaS revenues and new software license revenue together, we grew 11% in constant currency. This is a significant milestone in our transformation, where the combination of our cloud and new software license business added together are growing.
As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flows following along. As our SaaS, PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q3 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 65%, up from 51% last year, and I expect it to be about the same in the same region in Q4. I expect that our total SaaS, PaaS gross margin will continue to trend toward 80% over time.
Cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue was $178 million, up 19% from last year. The Q3 gross margin was 30% as we continue to make the necessary investments to scale out this business. As we make additional investments, the expenses hit immediately while the revenue is recognized over time, so the gross margin in this part of the business could decline to roughly about 20% over the next few quarters, after which I expect gross margins will climb to more than 40% as the business scales.
Total cloud revenue in the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, with growth modestly accelerating to 72% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.2 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our installed base of customers continue to grow. In fact, they actually increased.
New software license revenues were nearly $1.4 billion, down 15%, reflecting the continued emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 9% with hardware system product revenue of $520 million and hardware support revenue of $508 million, again, reflecting our focus on the move to the cloud.
For the company, total revenues for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.9 billion, up 4% from last year, and the operating margin was 43%, up from 42% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% as the rate was favorably impacted by some onetime benefits and some other factors, including favorable geographic mix this quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was USD 0.69, up from $0.64 and up 8% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 17%, and the GAAP EPS was USD 0.53, up from $0.50 last year.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.5 billion, which was lower because of the rapid growth we're seeing as we transition to cloud is having on impact on our working capital. Our operational metrics like DSO and days payable are stable, so it's just largely an effect of growth on working capital and timing.
Capital expenditures for Q3 were $440 million with about 1/3 of this from real estate, while most of the rest was about -- was cloud build-out and internal use. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.8 billion. We now have approximately $59 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $5 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares for a total of $500 million. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 124 million shares for a total of $5 billion and paid out dividends of $2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 27% from $0.15 to $0.19 per share.
Now let me go to the guidance. Because we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates, we do also expect to see significant currency headwinds. I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if the current exchange rates remain the same throughout the quarter as they are right now, we actually expect to see currency headwind of 2% on revenue and $0.02 negative impact on EPS. These currency headwinds are higher than last quarter, meaning that most of your Q4 estimates do not yet reflect the incremental revenue and EPS headwind of an additional negative impact of 1% and $0.01 to EPS.
All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that, my guidance is as follows: SaaS and PaaS revenue, including NetSuite, is expected to grow 69% to 73%, effectively raising my full year guidance from 80% to 81% for the year. We're beginning to see an increasing and favorable attach between our PaaS and IaaS orders, so I'm going to provide guidance on IaaS as well this quarter. IaaS is expected to grow 25% to 29%.
Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow 1% to 3%. Total revenue is expected to grow from negative 1% to positive 2%. EPS is expected to be between $0.78 and $0.82 in constant currency. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%, but of course, the Q4 tax rate could end up being different.
With that, I'm going to turn this over to Mark, and then Larry follows him."

I'm going to give you a bunch of numbers here and try to give you a little bit more insight to the quarter.First in ARR, we booked USD 5",495,"All right. Thanks, Safra. We thought Q3 would be strong going in, and as you can see, it turned out to be just that. I'm going to give you a bunch of numbers here and try to give you a little bit more insight to the quarter.
First in ARR, we booked USD 545 million. Every number I'm going to give you was actually in CD unless I say differently. USD 545 million, CAD 557 million [ph] . That is up 73% and the second best quarter we have ever had. SaaS bookings were USD 322 million, and PaaS infrastructure bookings were USD 223 million. Cloud revenue was up 72%, and we're now in an annualized $5 billion run rate. SaaS, PaaS revenue was up 86%. We're the fastest growing scaled cloud business in the world, and that is on top -- that growth rate is on top of last year's 60%.
In ERP, we were up 280% organically, and with NetSuite, ERP is now our largest pillar. Fusion HCM was up 106%. That's more than 3x the growth rate of Workday. CX was up 16% with marketing and service both over $100 million in quarterly revenue. Our verticals up [ph] were 109% and also over $100 million in quarterly revenue. 
Database as a Service was up 427%. Our database business, including all of our on-premise business, is now growing. PaaS was up 375% year-to-date with middleware cloud services up 300%. As Safra mentioned, SaaS, PaaS billings were up 111% in USD. SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue was up 75% in USD.
Now some customer metrics: 1,125 new SaaS customers in the quarter, 908 expansions, 210 customers who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. CX, we had 480 new customers and 586 expansions. In HCM, we had 206 new customers and 217 expansions. In ERP, we had 564 new customers that does not include NetSuite. We got 120 expansions. 50% of our new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before they bought this quarter.
Our active base of ERP customers is now approaching 3,700. 1,465 are live, 10x Workday. In total, we now have 13,103 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 with NetSuite. 2/3 of our new customer wins were for Fusion. 283 Go-Lives for Fusion, 2,444 customers are now live on Fusion. We have 200 -- 2,380 new PaaS customers in the quarter and 2,586 new customers buying stand-alone Infrastructure as a Service. As a point of clarity, PaaS and Infrastructure customers are counted for each service that they buy.
Lastly, this was an excellent quarter. Bookings, billings and revenue were all extremely solid. Now a few predictions. Q3 bookings growth was strong, as I mentioned, 73%. We will book at least $2 billion in ARR this year. Q3 revenue growth was impressive at 72%, and with revenue now at an annualized run rate of $5 billion, we are clearly the fastest-growing cloud company at scale. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Generation2 of Oracle's Infrastructure as a Service cloud now has the ability to run our customer's largest databases, something that is impossible to do using Amazon Web Services. Amazon can only run relatively small Oracle databases in their cloud. 
Gen2 of Oracle IaaS also delivers ultrahigh database performance and reliability in the cloud. Many Oracle workloads now run 10x faster than the Oracle cloud versus the Amazon cloud. It also costs less to run Oracle workloads in the Oracle cloud than the Amazon cloud. Now as a result, some of our largest customers are negotiating huge Infrastructure as a Service contracts to move all their databases to the Oracle cloud. You can expect some of those big deals to be announced in the coming weeks.
Fast growth in the Infrastructure as a Service business is new for us. We've done well in SaaS and in PaaS over the past few years, but this is the first time we've ever had a technology lead in Infrastructure as a Service. We are now in position to help our hundreds of thousands of database customers move millions of Oracle databases to our Infrastructure as a Service cloud.
SaaS and PaaS are large, rapidly growing businesses for us. Together, SaaS and PaaS grew 85% this past quarter. But soon, Infrastructure as a Service will be growing even faster. And before long, Infrastructure as a Service will become Oracle's largest cloud business.
In summary, all of Oracle's cloud businesses are growing rapidly and IaaS will be leading the way in the future. Thanks."

As I mentioned earlier, we had incredible growth in ERP, 280% organically. We had 106% growth in HCM. We had strong growth in our sales automation business. So -- and it wasn't unique to one geography. So in the quarter, broad-based, across pillar, across geography. In terms of going forward, our pipeline is big. I mean, I said it before, I'll say it again. Our pipeline's growth, if you looked at it year-over-year, resembles all of the growth rates you've heard in terms of what you've seen in terms of our bookings growth this quarter. And I think our execution just continues to get better. So I will also add in the quarter that NetSuite's performance accelerated. So from our last reported quarter in terms of bookings growth, their growth in the quarter, which for them was an odd thing because they're not used to having a December, January, February quarter, but when you compare it apples-to-apples, they grew faster than their last reported quarter in terms of bookings as well.

So I don't think, Kash, it's really more of a cycle. I think it's really more of just an inflection point for us in terms of, we're now at a place where we have almost 4,000 customers in ERP SaaS. Many of our on-prem customers have not moved and yet we're in a position where we can go get a whole set of customers that we never had access to before. Mid-market customers, we can do that globally, and we can go now for customers that want to move to a SaaS application in the cloud and get all of those benefits.

An awful lot of our customers are planning to move their database workloads to our cloud, but they are going to bring their own license. In other words, they own a bunch of Oracle licenses and they're just going to move those licenses to our Infrastructure as a Service. So we've spent our database license business to continue to grow, to continue to respond kind of as it has in the past. In other words, as cool new features become available like faster in-memory processing, the ability to take an existing single tenant application, automatically turn it into a multi-tenant application, to be very attractive to our customers and our ISVs. They'll buy more licenses. They may then in turn bring those licenses to the cloud. So we expect our on-premise, or better said, our database license business to continue to grow and accelerate because of 12.2.

And as a general matter, when they're running a database workload, they probably got something else too and so they're going to need some IaaS to actually run their applications when they're not our SaaS application. So we're seeing these together very often. And so I figured as we've now moved -- as we're moving to our more advanced IaaS from what you used to have, I thought I would break it out for you so you'd see it."

And we have millions and millions of applications that run on the Oracle Database. Most of those databases and most of those customers will move most of the databases and most of the workloads to the cloud. And we think our cloud will be -- right now, we have a huge technology lead over both Amazon and Azure with our new Generation2 Infrastructure as a Service. We can deliver ultrahigh performance. People have been buying these Exadata database machines and are getting used to running very large databases very, very fast. And we can deliver comparable, ultrahigh performance at very, very low cost in our cloud. So we think how long does it take to migrate several hundred thousand customers and several million databases to the Oracle cloud? And I think the rate of migration is going to accelerate over the years, but it's going to be at least a 5-year run of very, very rapid growth as our database business begins to move. You've seen what it's like. Our application business began to move to the cloud several years ago. And -- but that's a little bit different. I mean, that was -- we built all new applications and they migrated from an old application, either an old SAP application or an old PeopleSoft obligation or the E-Business Suite and they migrated to our new Fusion ERP suite. That's very different than simply lifting up an Oracle Database workload and moving it over to Oracle -- the application goes to Infrastructure as a Service and then the database goes to Platform as a Service. That's a faster process but a much larger installed base. Again, my estimate is that business will move over -- the majority will move up in the next 5 years, and that's going to give us enormous growth rate over that 5-year period."

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4, and then I'll turn the call over to Mark and then Larry.

I'll then review guidance for Q4, and then I'll turn the call over to Mark and then Larry. Just so you all know, we're not all in the same place today, so we may all answer at once. So just give us a chance.
Clearly, we are delighted with our results as Software and Cloud revenue was at the high end of my guidance and earnings per share was $0.06 above the high end of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud is now clearly in full swing. We continue to see outsized growth rates in our cloud business, especially when compared with our key competitors who are all seeing slowing growth.
But more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business has overtaken new software license declines on an annual basis. Next year, I expect our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue. The investments we've made to transition our business to the cloud have been important to ensure that Oracle remains a technology leader, and we're now beginning to see the benefits in our results.
With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business. That is growing revenue with disciplined cost management that results in EPS and cash flow to grow even faster. I expect EPS growth to ramp up throughout next year.
We continue to use constant dollar rates on our quarterly calls so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movements were largely in line with my guidance of 1% currency headwind for revenue and $0.01 negative impact to EPS.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 86% from last year. You can also see the continued strength of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The growth deferred revenue balance is now over $2 billion, up 75% in U.S. dollars, and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 111% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
When you add together Cloud SaaS, PaaS revenues and new software license revenue together, we grew 11% in constant currency. This is a significant milestone in our transformation, where the combination of our cloud and new software license business added together are growing.
As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flows following along. As our SaaS, PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q3 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 65%, up from 51% last year, and I expect it to be about the same in the same region in Q4. I expect that our total SaaS, PaaS gross margin will continue to trend toward 80% over time.
Cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue was $178 million, up 19% from last year. The Q3 gross margin was 30% as we continue to make the necessary investments to scale out this business. As we make additional investments, the expenses hit immediately while the revenue is recognized over time, so the gross margin in this part of the business could decline to roughly about 20% over the next few quarters, after which I expect gross margins will climb to more than 40% as the business scales.
Total cloud revenue in the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, with growth modestly accelerating to 72% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.2 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our installed base of customers continue to grow. In fact, they actually increased.
New software license revenues were nearly $1.4 billion, down 15%, reflecting the continued emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 9% with hardware system product revenue of $520 million and hardware support revenue of $508 million, again, reflecting our focus on the move to the cloud.
For the company, total revenues for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.9 billion, up 4% from last year, and the operating margin was 43%, up from 42% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% as the rate was favorably impacted by some onetime benefits and some other factors, including favorable geographic mix this quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was USD 0.69, up from $0.64 and up 8% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 17%, and the GAAP EPS was USD 0.53, up from $0.50 last year.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.5 billion, which was lower because of the rapid growth we're seeing as we transition to cloud is having on impact on our working capital. Our operational metrics like DSO and days payable are stable, so it's just largely an effect of growth on working capital and timing.
Capital expenditures for Q3 were $440 million with about 1/3 of this from real estate, while most of the rest was about -- was cloud build-out and internal use. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.8 billion. We now have approximately $59 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $5 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares for a total of $500 million. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 124 million shares for a total of $5 billion and paid out dividends of $2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 27% from $0.15 to $0.19 per share.
Now let me go to the guidance. Because we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates, we do also expect to see significant currency headwinds. I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if the current exchange rates remain the same throughout the quarter as they are right now, we actually expect to see currency headwind of 2% on revenue and $0.02 negative impact on EPS. These currency headwinds are higher than last quarter, meaning that most of your Q4 estimates do not yet reflect the incremental revenue and EPS headwind of an additional negative impact of 1% and $0.01 to EPS.
All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that, my guidance is as follows: SaaS and PaaS revenue, including NetSuite, is expected to grow 69% to 73%, effectively raising my full year guidance from 80% to 81% for the year. We're beginning to see an increasing and favorable attach between our PaaS and IaaS orders, so I'm going to provide guidance on IaaS as well this quarter. IaaS is expected to grow 25% to 29%.
Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow 1% to 3%. Total revenue is expected to grow from negative 1% to positive 2%. EPS is expected to be between $0.78 and $0.82 in constant currency. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%, but of course, the Q4 tax rate could end up being different.
With that, I'm going to turn this over to Mark, and then Larry follows him."

We thought Q3 would be strong going in, and as you can see, it turned out to be just that. I'm going to give you a bunch of numbers here and try to give you a little bit more insight to the quarter.
First in ARR, we booked USD 545 million. Every number I'm going to give you was actually in CD unless I say differently. USD 545 million, CAD 557 million, that is up 73% and the second best quarter we have ever had. SaaS bookings were USD 322 million, and PaaS infrastructure bookings were USD 223 million. Cloud revenue was up 72%, and we're now in an annualized $5 billion run rate. SaaS, PaaS revenue was up 86%. We're the fastest growing scaled cloud business in the world, and that is on top -- that growth rate is on top of last year's 60%.
In ERP, we were up 280% organically, and with NetSuite, ERP is now our largest pillar. Fusion HCM was up 106%. That's more than 3x the growth rate of Workday. CX was up 16% with marketing and service both over $100 million in quarterly revenue. Our verticals up [ph] were 109% and also over $100 million in quarterly revenue. 
Database as a Service was up 427%. Our database business, including all of our on-premise business, is now growing. PaaS was up 375% year-to-date with middleware cloud services up 300%. As Safra mentioned, SaaS, PaaS billings were up 111% in USD. SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue was up 75% in USD.
Now some customer metrics: 1,125 new SaaS customers in the quarter, 908 expansions, 210 customers who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. CX, we had 480 new customers and 586 expansions. In HCM, we had 206 new customers and 217 expansions. In ERP, we had 564 new customers that does not include NetSuite. We got 120 expansions. 50% of our new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before they bought this quarter.
Our active base of ERP customers is now approaching 3,700. 1,465 are live, 10x Workday. In total, we now have 13,103 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 with NetSuite. 2/3 of our new customer wins were for Fusion. 283 Go-Lives for Fusion, 2,444 customers are now live on Fusion. We have 200 -- 2,380 new PaaS customers in the quarter and 2,586 new customers buying stand-alone Infrastructure as a Service. As a point of clarity, PaaS and infrastructure customers are counted for each service that they buy.
Lastly, this was an excellent quarter. Bookings, billings and revenue were all extremely solid. Now a few predictions. Q3 bookings growth was strong, as I mentioned, 73%. We will book at least $2 billion in ARR this year. Q3 revenue growth was impressive at 72%, and with revenue now at an annualized run rate of $5 billion, we are clearly the fastest growing cloud company at scale.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Generation2 of Oracle's Infrastructure as a Service cloud now has the ability to run our customers' largest databases, something that is impossible to do using Amazon Web Services. Amazon can only run relatively small Oracle databases in their cloud. 
Gen2 of Oracle IaaS also delivers ultra-high database performance and [indiscernible] reliability in the cloud. Many Oracle workloads now run 10x faster in the Oracle cloud versus the Amazon cloud. It also costs less to run Oracle workloads in the Oracle cloud than the Amazon cloud. Now as a result, some of our largest customers are negotiating huge Infrastructure as a Service contracts to move all their databases to the Oracle cloud. You can expect some of those big deals to be announced in the coming weeks.
Fast growth in the Infrastructure as a Service business is new for us. We've done well in SaaS and in PaaS over the past few years, but this is the first time we've ever had a technology lead in Infrastructure as a Service. We are now in position to help our hundreds of thousands of database customers move millions of Oracle databases to our Infrastructure as a Service cloud.
SaaS and PaaS are large, rapidly growing businesses for us. Together, SaaS and PaaS grew 85% this past quarter. But soon, Infrastructure as a Service will be growing even faster, and before long, Infrastructure as a Service will become Oracle's largest cloud business.
In summary, all of Oracle's cloud businesses are growing rapidly, and IaaS will be leading the way in the future. Thanks."

Could you talk about what changed, if anything, in the quarter versus the third quarter -- or the second quarter either in terms of the macro backdrop or better execution?

I don't have time to tell you all of these deals. But we saw it going in. We felt it would happen. It did, and I think our team executed well. I would say, Kirk, that there was no -- it wasn't geographically centered, and it wasn't pillar centered. As I mentioned earlier, we had incredible growth in ERP, 280% organically. We had 106% growth in HCM. We had strong growth in our sales automation business. So -- and it wasn't unique to one geography. So in the quarter, broad based, across pillar, across geography. In terms of going forward, our pipeline is big. I mean, I've said it before. I'll say it again. Our pipeline's growth, if you looked at it year-over-year, resembles all of the growth rates you've heard in terms of what you've seen in terms of our bookings growth this quarter. And I think our execution just continues to get better. So I will also add, in the quarter, that NetSuite's performance accelerated. So from their last reported quarter in terms of bookings growth, their growth in the quarter, which for them was an odd thing because they're not used to having a December, January, February quarter, but when you compare it apples to apples, they grew faster than their last reported quarter in terms of bookings as well. So it's a very good quarter for us."

And what's happened is our total available market has just become incredibly large. If you looked at the persona of our customers that are in ERP cloud today, they were not -- most of them, more than 50% of them today were not an Oracle ERP customer before they bought from us. So I don't think, Kash, it's really more of a cycle. I think it's really more of just an inflection point for us in terms of we're now at a place where we have almost 4,000 customers in ERP SaaS. Many of our on-prem customers have not moved, and yet we're in a position where we can go get a whole set of customers that we never had access to before. Mid-market customers, we can do that globally, and we can go now for customers that want to move to a SaaS application in the cloud and get all of those benefits. Frankly, our competitors' user bases have all opened up to us.

So we've spent our database license business to continue to grow, to continue to respond kind of as it has in the past, in other words, as cool new features become available like faster in-memory processing, the ability to take an existing single tenant application, automatically turn it into a multi-tenant application, to be very attractive to our customers and our ISVs. They'll buy more licenses. They may then in turn bring those licenses to the cloud.

When somebody buys a SaaS application, they buy PaaS. I think part of what we're talking about with attach with infrastructure is it becomes a bit hard to differentiate, in some cases, what is a pure infrastructure and what is PaaS because a customer now buys the computer or buys the computing, buys the storage, et cetera, along with PaaS. And so you begin to get a blurring, to a degree, of the infrastructure business and the database business. But no question about it.

We have hundreds of thousands of database customers, and we have millions and millions of applications that run on the Oracle Database. Most of those databases -- most of those customers will move most of their data to the [ph] databases and most of those workloads to the cloud. And we think our cloud will be -- right now we have a huge technology lead over both Amazon and Azure with our new Generation2 Infrastructure as a Service. We can deliver ultra-high performance. People have been buying these Exadata database machines and are getting used to running very large databases very, very fast. And we can deliver comparable, ultra-high performance at very, very low cost in our cloud. So we think how long does it take to migrate several hundred thousand customers and several million databases to the Oracle cloud? And I think the rate of migration is going to accelerate over the years, but it's going to be at least a 5-year run of very, very rapid growth as our database business begins to move. You've seen what it's like. Our application business began to move to the cloud several years ago. And -- but that's a little bit different. I mean, that was -- we build all new applications, and they migrated from an old application, either an old SAP application or an old PeopleSoft obligation or the E-Business Suite, and they migrated to our new Fusion ERP suite. That's very different than simply lifting up an Oracle Database workload and moving it over to Oracle. The application goes to Infrastructure as a Service, and then the database goes to Platform as a Service. That's a faster process but a much larger installed base. Again, my estimate is that business will move over -- the majority of it will move over in the next 5 years, and that's going to give us enormous growth rates over that 5-year period."

I'll then review guidance for Q4, and then I'll turn the call over to Mark and then Larry. Just so you all know, we're not all in the same place today, so we may all answer at once. So just give us a chance.
Clearly, we are delighted with our results as Software and Cloud revenue was at the high end of my guidance and earnings per share was $0.06 above the high end of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud is now clearly in full swing. We continue to see outsized growth rates in our cloud business, especially when compared with our key competitors who are all seeing slowing growth.
But more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business has overtaken new software license declines on an annual basis. Next year, I expect our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue. The investments we've made to transition our business to the cloud have been important to ensure that Oracle remains a technology leader, and we're now beginning to see the benefits in our results.
With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business. That is growing revenue with disciplined cost management that results in EPS and cash flow to grow even faster. I expect EPS growth to ramp up throughout next year.
We continue to use constant dollar rates on our quarterly calls so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movements were largely in line with my guidance of 1% currency headwind for revenue and $0.01 negative impact to EPS.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 86% from last year. You can also see the continued strength of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The growth deferred revenue balance is now over $2 billion, up 75% in U.S. dollars, and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 111% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
When you add together Cloud SaaS, PaaS revenues and new software license revenue together, we grew 11% in constant currency. This is a significant milestone in our transformation, where the combination of our cloud and new software license business added together are growing.
As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flows following along. As our SaaS, PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q3 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 65%, up from 51% last year, and I expect it to be about the same -- in the same region in Q4. I expect that our total SaaS, PaaS gross margin will continue to trend toward 80% over time.
Cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue was $178 million, up 19% from last year. The Q3 gross margin was 30% as we continue to make the necessary investments to scale out this business. As we make additional investments, the expenses hit immediately while the revenue is recognized over time, so the gross margin in this part of the business could decline to roughly about 20% over the next few quarters, after which I expect gross margins will climb to more than 40% as the business scales.
Total cloud revenue in the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, with growth modestly accelerating to 72% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.2 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our installed base of customers continue to grow. In fact, they actually increased.
New software license revenues were nearly $1.4 billion, down 15%, reflecting the continued emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 9% with hardware system product revenue of $520 million and hardware support revenue of $508 million, again, reflecting our focus on the move to the cloud.
For the company, total revenues for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.9 billion, up 4% from last year, and the operating margin was 43%, up from 42% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% as the rate was favorably impacted by some onetime benefits and some other factors, including favorable geographic mix this quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up from $0.64 and up 8% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 17%, and the GAAP EPS was $0.53, up from $0.50 last year.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.5 billion, which was lower because of the rapid growth we're seeing as we transition to cloud is having on impact on our working capital. Our operational metrics like DSO and days payable are stable, so it's just largely an effect of growth on working capital and timing.
Capital expenditures for Q3 were $440 million with about 1/3 of this from real estate, while most of the rest was about -- was cloud build-out and internal use. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.8 billion. We now have approximately $59 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $5 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares for a total of $500 million. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 124 million shares for a total of $5 billion and paid out dividends of $2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 27% from $0.15 to $0.19 per share.
Now let me go to the guidance. Because we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates, we do also expect to see significant currency headwinds. I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if the current exchange rates remain the same throughout the quarter as they are right now, we actually expect to see currency headwind of 2% on revenue and $0.02 negative impact on EPS. These currency headwinds are higher than last quarter, meaning that most of your Q4 estimates do not yet reflect the incremental revenue and EPS headwinds of an additional negative impact of 1% and $0.01 to EPS.
All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that, my guidance is as follows: SaaS and PaaS revenue, including NetSuite, is expected to grow 69% to 73%, effectively raising my full year guidance from 80% to 81% for the year. We're beginning to see an increasing and favorable attach between our PaaS and IaaS orders, so I'm going to provide guidance on IaaS as well this quarter. IaaS is expected to grow 25% to 29%.
Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow 1% to 3%. Total revenue is expected to grow from negative 1% to positive 2%. EPS is expected to be between $0.78 and $0.82 in constant currency. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%, but of course, the Q4 tax rate could end up being different.
With that, I'm going to turn this over to Mark, and then Larry follows him."

I'm going to give you a bunch of numbers here and try to give you a little bit more insight to the quarter.First in ARR, we booked USD 5",496,"All right. Thanks, Safra. We thought Q3 would be strong going in, and as you can see, it turned out to be just that. I'm going to give you a bunch of numbers here and try to give you a little bit more insight to the quarter.
First in ARR, we booked USD 545 million. Every number I'm going to give you was actually in CD unless I say it differently. USD 545 million, 557 million in CD, that is up 73% and the second best quarter we have ever had. SaaS bookings were USD 322 million, and PaaS infrastructure bookings were USD 223 million. Cloud revenue was up 72%, and we're now in an annualized $5 billion run rate. SaaS, PaaS revenue was up 86%. We're the fastest growing scaled cloud business in the world, and that is on top -- that growth rate is on top of last year's 60%.
In ERP, we were up 280% organically, and with NetSuite, ERP is now our largest pillar. Fusion HCM was up 106%. That's more than 3x the growth rate of Workday. CX was up 16% with marketing and service both over $100 million in quarterly revenue. Our verticals up [ph] were 109% and also over $100 million in quarterly revenue. 
Database as a Service was up 427%. Our database business, including all of our on-premise business, is now growing. PaaS was up 375% year-to-date with middleware cloud services up 300%. As Safra mentioned, SaaS, PaaS billings were up 111% in USD. SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue was up 75% in USD.
Now some customer metrics: 1,125 new SaaS customers in the quarter, 908 expansions, 210 customers who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. CX, we had 480 new customers and 586 expansions. In HCM, we had 206 new customers and 217 expansions. In ERP, we had 564 new customers that does not include NetSuite. We got 120 expansions. 50% of our new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before they bought this quarter.
Our active base of ERP customers is now approaching 3,700. 1,465 are live, 10x Workday. In total, we now have 13,103 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 with NetSuite. 2/3 of our new customer wins were for Fusion. 283 Go-Lives for Fusion, 2,444 customers are now live on Fusion. We have 200 -- 2,380 new PaaS customers in the quarter and 2,586 new customers buying stand-alone Infrastructure as a Service. As a point of clarity, PaaS and infrastructure customers are counted for each service that they buy.
Lastly, this was an excellent quarter. Bookings, billings and revenue were all extremely solid. 
Now a few predictions. Q3 bookings growth was strong, as I mentioned, 73%. We will book at least $2 billion in ARR this year. Q3 revenue growth was impressive at 72%, and with revenue now at an annualized run rate of $5 billion, we are clearly the fastest growing cloud company at scale.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Generation2 of Oracle's Infrastructure as a Service cloud now has the ability to run our customers' largest databases, something that is impossible to do using Amazon Web Services. Amazon can only run relatively small Oracle databases in their cloud. 
Gen2 of Oracle IaaS also delivers ultra-high database performance and fault-tolerant reliability in the cloud. Many Oracle workloads now run 10x faster in the Oracle cloud versus the Amazon cloud. It also costs less to run Oracle workloads in the Oracle cloud than the Amazon cloud. Now as a result, some of our largest customers are negotiating huge Infrastructure as a Service contracts to move all their databases to the Oracle cloud. You can expect some of those big deals to be announced in the coming weeks.
Fast growth in the Infrastructure as a Service business is new for us. We've done well in SaaS and in PaaS over the past few years, but this is the first time we've ever had a technology lead in Infrastructure as a Service. We are now in position to help our hundreds of thousands of database customers move millions of Oracle databases to our Infrastructure as a Service cloud.
SaaS and PaaS are large, rapidly growing businesses for us. Together, SaaS and PaaS grew 85% this past quarter. But soon, Infrastructure as a Service will be growing even faster, and before long, Infrastructure as a Service will become Oracle's largest cloud business.
In summary, all of Oracle's cloud businesses are growing rapidly, and IaaS will be leading the way in the future. Thanks."

I don't have time to tell you all of these deals. But we saw it going in. We felt it would happen. It did, and I think our team executed well. I would say, Kirk, that there was no -- it wasn't geographically centered, and it wasn't pillar centered. As I mentioned earlier, we had incredible growth in ERP, 280% organically. We had 106% growth in HCM. We had strong growth in our sales automation business. So -- and it wasn't unique to one geography. So in the quarter, broad based, across pillar, across geography. 
In terms of going forward, our pipeline is big. I mean, I've said it before. I'll say it again. Our pipeline's growth, if you looked at it year-over-year, resembles all of the growth rates you've heard in terms of what you've seen in terms of our bookings growth this quarter. And I think our execution just continues to get better. 
So I will also add, in the quarter, that NetSuite's performance accelerated. So from their last reported quarter in terms of bookings growth, their growth in the quarter -- which for them was an odd thing because they're not used to having a December, January, February quarter, but when you compare it apples to apples, they grew faster than their last reported quarter in terms of bookings as well. So it was a very good quarter for us."

So I don't think, Kash, it's really more of a cycle. I think it's really more of just an inflection point for us in terms of we're now at a place where we have almost 4,000 customers in ERP SaaS. Many of our on-prem customers have not moved, and yet we're in a position where we can go get a whole set of customers that we never had access to before. Mid-market customers, we can do that globally, and we can go now for customers that want to move to a SaaS application in the cloud and get all of those benefits.

An awful lot of our customers are planning to move their database workloads to our cloud, but they're going to bring their own license. In other words, they own a bunch of Oracle licenses, and they're just going to move those licenses to our Infrastructure as a Service. So we expect our database license business to continue to grow, to continue to respond kind of as it has in the past, in other words, as cool new features become available like faster in-memory processing, the ability to take an existing single tenant application, automatically turn it into a multi-tenant application, to be very attractive to our customers and our ISVs. They'll buy more licenses. They may then in turn bring those licenses to the cloud.

And so you begin to get a blurring, to a degree, of the infrastructure business and the database business. But no question about it.

And as a general matter, when they're running a database workload, they probably got something else too, and so they're going to need some IaaS to actually run their applications when they're not our SaaS application. So we're seeing these together very often.

We have hundreds of thousands of database customers, and we have millions and millions of applications that run on the Oracle Database. Most of those databases -- most of those customers will move most of the databases and most of those workloads to the cloud. And we think our cloud will be -- right now we have a huge technology lead over both Amazon and Azure with our new Generation2 Infrastructure as a Service. We can deliver ultra-high performance. People have been buying these Exadata database machines and are getting used to running very large databases very, very fast. And we can deliver comparable, ultra-high performance at very, very low cost in our cloud. So we think -- how long does it take to migrate several hundred thousand customers and several million databases to the Oracle cloud? And I think the rate of migration is going to accelerate over the years, but it's going to be at least a 5-year run of very, very rapid growth as our database business begins to move. You've seen what it's like. Our application business began to move to the cloud several years ago. And -- but that's a little bit different. I mean, that was -- we built all new applications, and they migrated from an old application, either an old SAP application or an old PeopleSoft obligation or the E-Business Suite, and they migrated to our new Fusion ERP suite. That's very different than simply lifting up an Oracle Database workload and moving it over to Oracle. The application goes to Infrastructure as a Service, and then the database goes to Platform as a Service. That's a faster process but a much larger installed base. Again, my estimate is that business will move over -- the majority of it will move over in the next 5 years, and that's going to give us enormous growth rates over that 5-year period."

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4, and then I'll turn the call over to Mark and then Larry.

I'll then review guidance for Q4, and then I'll turn the call over to Mark and then Larry. Just so you all know, we're not all in the same place today, so we may all answer at once. So just give us a chance.
Clearly, we are delighted with our results as Software and Cloud revenue was at the high end of my guidance and earnings per share was $0.06 above the high end of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud is now clearly in full swing. We continue to see outsized growth rates in our cloud business, especially when compared with our key competitors who are all seeing slowing growth.
But more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business has overtaken new software license declines on an annual basis. Next year, I expect our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue. The investments we've made to transition our business to the cloud have been important to ensure that Oracle remains a technology leader, and we're now beginning to see the benefits in our results.
With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business. That is growing revenue with disciplined cost management that results in EPS and cash flow to grow even faster. I expect EPS growth to ramp up throughout next year.
We continue to use constant dollar rates on our quarterly calls so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movements were largely in line with my guidance of 1% currency headwind for revenue and $0.01 negative impact to EPS.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 86% from last year. You can also see the continued strength of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The growth deferred revenue balance is now over $2 billion, up 75% in U.S. dollars, and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 111% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
When you add together Cloud SaaS, PaaS revenues and new software license revenue together, we grew 11% in constant currency. This is a significant milestone in our transformation, where the combination of our cloud and new software license business added together are growing.
As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flows following along. As our SaaS, PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q3 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 65%, up from 51% last year, and I expect it to be about the same -- in the same region in Q4. I expect that our total SaaS, PaaS gross margin will continue to trend toward 80% over time.
Cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue was $178 million, up 19% from last year. The Q3 gross margin was 30% as we continue to make the necessary investments to scale out this business. As we make additional investments, the expenses hit immediately while the revenue is recognized over time, so the gross margin in this part of the business could decline to roughly about 20% over the next few quarters, after which I expect gross margins will climb to more than 40% as the business scales.
Total cloud revenue in the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, with growth modestly accelerating to 72% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.2 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our installed base of customers continue to grow. In fact, they actually increased.
New software license revenues were nearly $1.4 billion, down 15%, reflecting the continued emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support, was down 9% with hardware system product revenue of $520 million and hardware support revenue of $508 million, again, reflecting our focus on the move to the cloud.
For the company, total revenues for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.9 billion, up 4% from last year, and the operating margin was 43%, up from 42% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% as the rate was favorably impacted by some onetime benefits and some other factors, including favorable geographic mix this quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up from $0.64 and up 8% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 17%, and the GAAP EPS was $0.53, up from $0.50 last year.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.5 billion, which was lower because of the rapid growth we're seeing as we transition to cloud is having on impact on our working capital. Our operational metrics like DSO and days payable are stable, so it's just largely an effect of growth on working capital and timing.
Capital expenditures for Q3 were $440 million with about 1/3 of this from real estate, while most of the rest was about -- was cloud build-out and internal use. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.8 billion. We now have approximately $59 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $5 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares for a total of $500 million. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 124 million shares for a total of $5 billion and paid out dividends of $2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 27% from $0.15 to $0.19 per share.
Now let me go to the guidance. Because we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates, we do also expect to see significant currency headwinds. I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if the current exchange rates remain the same throughout the quarter as they are right now, we actually expect to see currency headwind of 2% on revenue and $0.02 negative impact on EPS. These currency headwinds are higher than last quarter, meaning that most of your Q4 estimates do not yet reflect the incremental revenue and EPS headwinds of an additional negative impact of 1% and $0.01 to EPS.
All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that, my guidance is as follows: SaaS and PaaS revenue, including NetSuite, is expected to grow 69% to 73%, effectively raising my full year guidance from 80% to 81% for the year. We're beginning to see an increasing and favorable attach between our PaaS and IaaS orders, so I'm going to provide guidance on IaaS as well this quarter. IaaS is expected to grow 25% to 29%.
Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow 1% to 3%. Total revenue is expected to grow from negative 1% to positive 2%. EPS is expected to be between $0.78 and $0.82 in constant currency. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%, but of course, the Q4 tax rate could end up being different.
With that, I'm going to turn this over to Mark, and then Larry follows him."

We thought Q3 would be strong going in, and as you can see, it turned out to be just that. I'm going to give you a bunch of numbers here and try to give you a little bit more insight to the quarter.
First in ARR, we booked USD 545 million. Every number I'm going to give you was actually in CD unless I say it differently. USD 545 million, 557 million in CD, that is up 73% and the second best quarter we have ever had. SaaS bookings were USD 322 million, and PaaS infrastructure bookings were USD 223 million. Cloud revenue was up 72%, and we're now in an annualized $5 billion run rate. SaaS, PaaS revenue was up 86%. We're the fastest growing scaled cloud business in the world, and that is on top -- that growth rate is on top of last year's 60%.
In ERP, we were up 280% organically, and with NetSuite, ERP is now our largest pillar. Fusion HCM was up 106%. That's more than 3x the growth rate of Workday. CX was up 16% with marketing and service both over $100 million in quarterly revenue. Our verticals up [ph] were 109% and also over $100 million in quarterly revenue. 
Database as a Service was up 427%. Our database business, including all of our on-premise business, is now growing. PaaS was up 375% year-to-date with middleware cloud services up 300%. As Safra mentioned, SaaS, PaaS billings were up 111% in USD. SaaS, PaaS deferred revenue was up 75% in USD.
Now some customer metrics: 1,125 new SaaS customers in the quarter, 908 expansions, 210 customers who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. CX, we had 480 new customers and 586 expansions. In HCM, we had 206 new customers and 217 expansions. In ERP, we had 564 new customers that does not include NetSuite. We got 120 expansions. 50% of our new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before they bought this quarter.
Our active base of ERP customers is now approaching 3,700. 1,465 are live, 10x Workday. In total, we now have 13,103 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 with NetSuite. 2/3 of our new customer wins were for Fusion. 283 Go-Lives for Fusion, 2,444 customers are now live on Fusion. We have 200 -- 2,380 new PaaS customers in the quarter and 2,586 new customers buying stand-alone Infrastructure as a Service. As a point of clarity, PaaS and infrastructure customers are counted for each service that they buy.
Lastly, this was an excellent quarter. Bookings, billings and revenue were all extremely solid. 
Now a few predictions. Q3 bookings growth was strong, as I mentioned, 73%. We will book at least $2 billion in ARR this year. Q3 revenue growth was impressive at 72%, and with revenue now at an annualized run rate of $5 billion, we are clearly the fastest growing cloud company at scale.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Generation2 of Oracle's Infrastructure as a Service cloud now has the ability to run our customers' largest databases, something that is impossible to do using Amazon Web Services. Amazon can only run relatively small Oracle databases in their cloud. 
Gen2 of Oracle IaaS also delivers ultra-high database performance and fault-tolerant reliability in the cloud. Many Oracle workloads now run 10x faster in the Oracle cloud versus the Amazon cloud. It also costs less to run Oracle workloads in the Oracle cloud than the Amazon cloud. Now as a result, some of our largest customers are negotiating huge Infrastructure as a Service contracts to move all their databases to the Oracle cloud. You can expect some of those big deals to be announced in the coming weeks.
Fast growth in the Infrastructure as a Service business is new for us. We've done well in SaaS and in PaaS over the past few years, but this is the first time we've ever had a technology lead in Infrastructure as a Service. We are now in position to help our hundreds of thousands of database customers move millions of Oracle databases to our Infrastructure as a Service cloud.
SaaS and PaaS are large, rapidly growing businesses for us. Together, SaaS and PaaS grew 85% this past quarter. But soon, Infrastructure as a Service will be growing even faster, and before long, Infrastructure as a Service will become Oracle's largest cloud business.
In summary, all of Oracle's cloud businesses are growing rapidly, and IaaS will be leading the way in the future. Thanks."

It's just really the timing of when bookings closed. I mean, we had a very strong set of quality wins. I mean, if you went into HCM, I mean, just to give you some idea, Kirk, I mean, we closed America Movil in the quarter, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Ford, Emerson, Hilton, Hyundai Motor, Jefferies, Rogers Communications. I mean, we had a very strong set of logos in the quarter. I mean, in ERP, we closed Charter and ClubCorp, Cummins, Lufthansa, DISH Network. I mean, it's just a -- I could go on. I don't have time to tell you all of these deals. But we saw it going in. We felt it would happen. It did, and I think our team executed well. I would say, Kirk, that there was no -- it wasn't geographically centered, and it wasn't pillar centered. As I mentioned earlier, we had incredible growth in ERP, 280% organically. We had 106% growth in HCM. We had strong growth in our sales automation business. So -- and it wasn't unique to one geography. So in the quarter, broad based, across pillar, across geography. 
In terms of going forward, our pipeline is big. I mean, I've said it before. I'll say it again. Our pipeline's growth, if you looked at it year-over-year, resembles all of the growth rates you've heard in terms of what you've seen in terms of our bookings growth this quarter. And I think our execution just continues to get better. 
So I will also add, in the quarter, that NetSuite's performance accelerated. So from their last reported quarter in terms of bookings growth, their growth in the quarter -- which for them was an odd thing because they're not used to having a December, January, February quarter, but when you compare it apples to apples, they grew faster than their last reported quarter in terms of bookings as well. So it was a very good quarter for us."

This is not the world of 2 providers and us talking about upgrade cycles. I mean, what's happened to us in ERP -- and I go back to the fact that 50% of our customers in the quarter were just brand new to us. They never had bought ERP from us before. And what's happened is our total available market has just become incredibly large. If you looked at the persona of our customers that are in ERP cloud today, they were not -- most of them, more than 50% of them today were not an Oracle ERP customer before they bought from us. So I don't think, Kash, it's really more of a cycle. I think it's really more of just an inflection point for us in terms of we're now at a place where we have almost 4,000 customers in ERP SaaS. Many of our on-prem customers have not moved, and yet we're in a position where we can go get a whole set of customers that we never had access to before. Mid-market customers, we can do that globally, and we can go now for customers that want to move to a SaaS application in the cloud and get all of those benefits. Frankly, our competitors' user bases have all opened up to us. And so I don't see it quite as a cycle as I see is a big change in the opportunity for us in terms of the total available market we can go after.

An awful lot of our customers are planning to move their database workloads to our cloud, but they're going to bring their own license. In other words, they own a bunch of Oracle licenses, and they're just going to move those licenses to our Infrastructure as a Service. So we expect our database license business to continue to grow, to continue to respond kind of as it has in the past, in other words, as cool new features become available like faster in-memory processing, the ability to take an existing single tenant application, automatically turn it into a multi-tenant application, to be very attractive to our customers and our ISVs. They'll buy more licenses. They may then in turn bring those licenses to the cloud.

When somebody buys a SaaS application, they buy PaaS. I think part of what we're talking about with attach with infrastructure is it becomes a bit hard to differentiate, in some cases, what is a pure infrastructure and what is PaaS because a customer now buys the computer or buys the computing, buys the storage, et cetera, along with PaaS. And so you begin to get a blurring, to a degree, of the infrastructure business and the database business. But no question about it.

We have hundreds of thousands of database customers, and we have millions and millions of applications that run on the Oracle Database. Most of those databases -- most of those customers will move most of the databases and most of those workloads to the cloud. And we think our cloud will be -- right now we have a huge technology lead over both Amazon and Azure with our new Generation2 Infrastructure as a Service. We can deliver ultra-high performance. People have been buying these Exadata database machines and are getting used to running very large databases very, very fast. And we can deliver comparable, ultra-high performance at very, very low cost in our cloud. So we think -- how long does it take to migrate several hundred thousand customers and several million databases to the Oracle cloud? And I think the rate of migration is going to accelerate over the years, but it's going to be at least a 5-year run of very, very rapid growth as our database business begins to move. You've seen what it's like. Our application business began to move to the cloud several years ago. And -- but that's a little bit different. I mean, that was -- we built all new applications, and they migrated from an old application, either an old SAP application or an old PeopleSoft obligation or the E-Business Suite, and they migrated to our new Fusion ERP suite. That's very different than simply lifting up an Oracle Database workload and moving it over to Oracle. The application goes to Infrastructure as a Service, and then the database goes to Platform as a Service. That's a faster process but a much larger installed base. Again, my estimate is that business will move over -- the majority of it will move over in the next 5 years, and that's going to give us enormous growth rates over that 5-year period."

As you can see, we had a tremendous quarter in just about every way, as cloud revenue, new software license and earnings were all much better than expected. The adoption by our customers of our products and services is at an all-time high. 
But before going into more detail about Q4, you can also see that we have made significant improvement in our financial reporting to align with how we are running the business now the cloud has become our predominant growth vehicle. As you can see in our press release supplemental pages, we have given you tons of detail. We've given you the detail in our new presentation format, and we've also provided the reporting in our old format going back through fiscal 2016 and 2017 so you can see the numbers the new way, the old way, all including history to help your transition this quarter.
I'll first walk you through the reporting changes then go over the Q4 results using the new format and recap Q4 using the old format for comparability to my previous guidance. Then, I'll sum up fiscal year '17 results using the new additional detail before moving on to my guidance for Q1. So please be patient as I'm going to be giving you a lot of numbers today. But as I said, it's all in the press release tables that are on file so you don't have to catch every number. After all that, I'll turn the call over to Larry and then Mark for their comments.
In making these reporting changes, we are now recording SaaS revenue separately as our tremendous growth resulted in SaaS revenue crossing the $1 billion a quarter threshold in Q4, having grown 76% in constant currency. We've also combined Platform and Infrastructure as a Service as the synergies and cross-selling between these 2 businesses is very high, and this is also how we are measuring our internal organization.
On Page 10, you can see GAAP applications revenue, which is SaaS and on-premise application software revenues. And further down the page, GAAP platform and infrastructure revenues, which is PaaS and IaaS and on-premise revenues. For hardware, we've gone ahead and consolidated hardware products and hardware support into a single line item of hardware. And we've also aligned the expense line where appropriate.
I'm now going to go over our non-GAAP Q4 results with our new format and use constant dollar growth rate unless I state otherwise. This quarter, by the way, the effect of currency movements resulted in a 1% headwind on both total software revenue, including cloud, as well as total revenue. Currency movements had a $0.01 negative impact on non-GAAP EPS and $0.02 negative impact on GAAP EPS.
All right, well clearly, we're absolutely thrilled with our Q4 results as Software and Cloud revenues were 4 points above the high end of my guidance, and earnings per share was $0.08 above the high end of my guidance. As I mentioned earlier, Cloud SaaS revenues for the quarter were more than $1 billion for the first time and up 76% from last year. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 45% from last year. You can see the continuing revenue momentum of our cloud business in the cloud billings and deferred revenue. 
The growth deferred revenue balance is now over $2.4 billion, up 63% in U.S. dollars. Cloud billings grew 42% in U.S. dollars this quarter, and once again, we put the cloud billings number up on our website for you to see the detail this quarter and frankly, you probably don't need to keep doing it since many of the numbers you can derive. 
As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded. The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 65%, up from 54% last Q4. We expect to see further improvement in FY '18 and remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins over time. Now the graph -- the gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 47%, down from 54% last Q4 as we invested in our geographic buildout ahead of the bulk of the revenue recognition. When we approach scale, I expect to see improvements in gross margins there, too.
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 66% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $7.5 billion, essentially unchanged from last year. And while new software license revenues were $2.6 billion, down 4%, reflecting the increasing preference of customers for cloud, software updates and product support revenues were $4.9 billion, up 3%, reflecting the continued high attach and renewal rates that show the stability of our installed base of on-premise customers. 
Total Software and Cloud revenues were $8.9 billion, up 7% and 4 points above the high end of guidance. In addition, the total on-premise Software and Cloud revenues for both our Applications and Platform and Infrastructure businesses are growing very well now. Applications total revenue were $2.9 billion, up 10% non-GAAP, 8% GAAP. And Platform and Infrastructure total revenues were $6 billion, up 6%, both GAAP and non-GAAP. 
In particular, our database business grew, in aggregate, grew 8%. Hardware revenues were $1.1 billion, down 12%, and services revenue were $894 million, up 4%. Total revenues for the quarter were $10.9 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5 billion, up 7% from last year. And the operating margin was 46%, which was up from 45% last year. 
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20% as we saw some onetime benefits and EPS was $0.89 in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 14.1% and GAAP EPS was $0.76 in U.S. dollars. Because of currency movements, non-GAAP EPS was lowered $0.01 and GAAP EPS was lowered by $0.02.
Q4, using our old format against my guidance, you can see that SaaS, PaaS revenues were $1.2 billion, up 75% and above the high end of the guidance I gave last quarter. IaaS revenues were $214 million, up 29% and at the high end of my guidance.
Now moving on to the full fiscal year. Software and Cloud revenues totaled $30.4 billion, growing 6% in constant currency, with $24 billion or 79% of it being recurring revenue, up from 75% last year. Cloud SaaS was $3.4 billion, growing 70%. Cloud PaaS and IaaS was $1.4 billion, growing 63%. Total cloud revenues totaled $4.7 billion, growing 68%. On-premise software declined 1% to $25.6 billion as the 3% growth rate in software support was offset by cloud-related declines in new software license, which were down 11%. Hardware revenues were $4.2 billion, declining 10%, and services revenue were $3.4 billion, up 1%.
Total company revenues for the year grew 3% to $37.9 billion. And operating income was $16.2 billion, up 3%. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 43%, up slightly from last year. Non-GAAP EPS, earnings per share, were $2.74 in U.S. dollars, up 6%. Because of currency movements, non-GAAP EPS was $0.03 lower.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.1 billion, up 3%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $525 million. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.1 billion. I expect our cloud CapEx spending to be about $1 billion next year, roughly equivalent to this year's level. We now have approximately $66.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $8.2 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we always have a disciplined approach to finding the right companies at the right time at the right valuations that make both strategic and financial sense.
This quarter, we repurchased 11 million shares for a total of nearly $500 million. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 86 million shares for a total of $3.5 billion and paid out dividends of $2.6 billion. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for FY '18. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency, but assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency shouldn't have -- should not have an effect on total revenues or EPS. 
So for Q1, cloud revenues, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, are expected to grow between 48% and 52%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 4% to 6%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.59 and $0.61, up from $0.55 last Q1. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. Of course, the tax rate could end up being different. Over the full year of FY '18, I expect continued high growth in cloud revenues, with cloud revenues materially surpassing new software license revenues.
Operating income growth will accelerate and the continued expansion of cloud gross margins and the return of operating margin expansion. Over the last 2 quarters, we exceeded the high end of my EPS guidance by $0.14. And as we begin FY '18, our compare is now that much higher. But even with this higher compare, I expect EPS growth will be double-digit next year.
As I mentioned earlier, we will continue to invest in capital in our cloud data centers expansion, but I do expect our overall CapEx will be lower as the CapEx for real estate should be somewhat lower.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

This is the second year in a row that we sold more cloud ARR than Salesforce.com. We are now well on our way to passing them and becoming #1 in the enterprise SaaS market. Our rapid SaaS growth is the driving force behind Oracle's revenue and earnings growth in Q4.
The reason we're confident that we'll pass Salesforce is because we have 3 full SaaS application suites: for ERP, for HCM and for CRM, including financials, procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, human resources, payroll, marketing, sales and service. Salesforce, in contrast, only competes in 3 of these 9 market areas. Furthermore, Oracle is now the clear leader in cloud ERP. And ERP is, by far, the largest application market, not CRM.
In addition to our demonstrated strength in SaaS, Oracle also competes in Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service. Here, our primary competitor is Amazon AWS. During this new fiscal year, we expect both our PaaS and IaaS businesses to accelerate into hyper-growth, the same kind of growth we're seeing with SaaS as our customers begin to migrate their millions of Oracle databases to Generation2 of the Oracle Public Cloud. The AT&T deal is just the beginning. We expect that our Oracle PaaS and IaaS businesses will grow so fast that they will be even bigger than our SaaS business. Over to you, Mark."

First, I'd like to congratulate Safra for getting through all of that material. That was a [indiscernible] to get through fast. Listen, thanks, Larry. Good quarter for us, obviously. We tracked ahead of virtually every metric that I track,",583,"Thanks, Larry. First, I'd like to congratulate Safra for getting through all of that material. That was a [indiscernible] to get through fast. Listen, thanks, Larry. Good quarter for us, obviously. We tracked ahead of virtually every metric that I track, whether it was cloud bookings, cloud revenue, EPS. Really everything on my KPI list was at a record level. 
Starting with cloud bookings, $855 million. It's the best quarter we have ever had. It's up 43% over what was a very strong Q4 last year. We had a goal of $2 billion in ARR, we finished with nearly $2.1 billion. Next year, we will sell more. By the way, booking revenue growth rate [indiscernible] CD unless otherwise said. 
SaaS bookings were $486 million, PaaS and Infrastructure bookings, $369 million. As Safra said, cloud revenue growth at 66%, we're now at a $6 billion annualized run rate. Total and software -- for total Software and Cloud, to Safra's point, 80% -- roughly 80% of our trailing 12-months revenue is now recurring in nature. SaaS revenue all up 76% was an acceleration from 40% growth last year. 
ERP was up 156% organically. That did not include NetSuite. Overall, ERP is now over a $1.2 billion annualized run rate. HCM was up 96%, more than twice the growth rate of Workday. And our front office solution sales marketing and service were all up double digits organically.
Our verticals were up 111% and over $140 million in quarterly revenue. Our PaaS infrastructure revenue was up 45%. Database as a Service was up 62%. Our database business, including Database as a Service and our on-premise licenses and support, were up 8%.
Cloud billings grew 42%, as Safra said, and deferred revenue up 53%. Both of those are in USD. I am going to just name a few customers so you get an idea of some of the customer mix we had in the quarter. I'm not going to hit everything, I'm just going to hit a few representative customers. 
I'll start a little bit -- I'll start with ERP. Allianz, Ball Corporation, BNP Paribas, GE, the Corporation, Juniper, NetLife, Minerals Technology, Motorola, Electronics, NCR, Netflix, Newell-Rubbermaid, Orange, Pearson, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Textron, University of Maryland, Vanderbilt University, Volkswagen. In HCM: ABM Industries, AutoZone, Fannie Mae, Fujitsu, Garden Fresh Restaurants, Landmark, Mary Kay, the National Football League, NTT, Raymond James Associates, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Staples, University of Pittsburgh, the University of Texas System, Vanderbilt and a very large investment bank in New York City who switched vendors to our HCM. Those are just a few representative customers across just a couple of pillars in the quarter.
Lastly, as I mentioned, it was overall a very strong quarter. Bookings, billings and revenue all at record levels. We announced an exciting deal with AT&T, and while it provided no revenue at all in Q4, it's a very strategic win as a reference to all of our customers about the modernization of databases and the movement of them to the cloud.
Looking forward, just a couple of predictions. FY '17 bookings were $2.1 billion. Our pipeline is very large and ARR will be higher in FY '18. I do expect our application ecosystem of on-premise, that would include licenses and support and SaaS, will grow roughly 10% next year. With revenue now at an annualized run rate of $6 billion and a growth rate of 66%, we're clearly the fastest growing cloud company at scale. With that, we'll take your questions."

We had a little less than 1,600 new SaaS customers, 1,575 in the quarter. We had 1,138 expansions in the quarter. Roughly 400 of those customers who bought SaaS also bought Platform as a Service, so again the attach rate between Apps and PaaS continues to strengthen. ERP, we had 868 new customer -- by the way, that doesn't include NetSuite so that's just inside the traditional Oracle ERP business. We had almost 200 expansions. That's a big deal because as we start to sell, in many cases, financials, we're now being able to sell supply chain, procurement and manufacturing into that base as well. Another good thing for us in the quarter is roughly 2/3 of the new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before. So again, this is again 66%, 65% brand-new logos to Oracle. So HCM, we had about 325, 326 new customers and 300 expansions, a little over 600 in marketing, sales and service and about 670 expansions. So sort of all in, we have now about 13,550 customers in our SaaS active base. If you do include NetSuite, that number gets to 25,000. About 75% everything we did in the quarter was Fusion.

Really interested in hearing some of these larger logo wins you cited in SaaS, in ERP and HCM in particular. And yet you're still seeing and we're still continuing to hear about a lot of traction for you in the mid-market reflected in some of your other comments. So I'm trying to wrap my head around some of these larger logos that we're hearing pick up, especially on the ERP vertical, given it's your size. And I'm hoping you can guide us as to where we are with some of those large logos in terms of go-live, pipeline, et cetera, that would be really tremendously helpful."

In fact, what you should see, as this goes on, is we will have less drag from the transition and the base will continue to grow. And so this should really accelerate and understand that in our PaaS-IaaS business, we're not even at scale. So as we really scale that up, profitability is going to increase more quickly and revenues will be built on the base of another recurring revenue -- of the recurring revenue business. So we've been basically turning and we've had the drag of the move away from our historic business, to some extent, and revenue recognition that's not upfront but ratable. Then all of a sudden, you're going to see less of a drag as that side of the business is smaller compared to our cloud business. So we're obviously very optimistic. We indicated to you all during last year, this past year that this thing was coming, and it has clearly come in Q4. And this next year and years after that are now going to be building on that base."

I mean, today, we've got Airtel, they're probably 30,000 users; American Eagle, 40,000 users; Fairmont, Raffles hotels, 42,000 users; Siemens, 60,000 users; Wells, 275,000 users;",278,"To your other question, yes, we've got some very large active HCM customers.

And these are big, big customers. And so those are just HCM. So those are obviously very big scale customers. Now that said, in ERP, you're right in what you said. I mean, we have a lot of mid-market -- upper mid-market wins and a lot of new logos to Oracle who were not doing business with Oracle before they made this acquisition. And that's certainly been a fantastic strength. I mean, our cloud is made up of a lot of new logos in addition to some existing customers. Now in terms of scaled ERP customers though, I mean, Orange is -- they're using financials, procurement, projects, supply chain management; GE Digital, Qualcomm, Hearst, Tesco, Caesars. I mean, these are just sort of so These are big scaled ERP customers. Now to Larry's point and I'll make it a little bit about HCM and ERP, the TAM in ERP is materially bigger than the TAM in HCM. So the TAM in ERP is 3x to 4x bigger in ERP. And additionally, ERP drags HCM or can drag HCM in the transaction. So these big ERP references that we have, and obviously, with the number we closed in Q4 and we're going live now every quarter, more to come. We've seen increasing poll of HCM in these big ERP transactions, and they are through in the mid-market and in the upmarket. I hope that helps."

Did AT&T give us any incremental revenue in Q4? No. So is this deal ratable over time? Yes. Is it a long-term agreement? Yes. It's a very long-term agreement. Let me try to give you a little bit more color. First, it is a long-term deal. AT&T has over 10,000 Oracle databases. They have several hundred. And you might say, John, that's a small percent of their overall databases but they have several hundred large databases that have 70%, 75% of all of their company's data. They badly wanted to get the benefits of cloud, provisioning a lot of provisioning and all new features that come with the product modernization, consolidation of that infrastructure. Yet in many case, they've got regulatory pressures on what they can put in the public cloud and what they can't. This is an example where we talked about this before. We take our Oracle Cloud machine and we are able now to do all of that with them on their premise and give them all the benefits of the cloud. We manage, we patch. We basically run the cloud for them and we help them get all of that done. And so it's great a deal as this is, this is even a bigger deal, John, in what it represents for our entire customer base. This is a bigger deal to us than the transaction. It is the opportunity for us to now do this for hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of customers. The opportunity for us in the quarter and the reason we somewhat put a press release out was AT&T being so effusive about their opportunity now and what it meant for them internal to AT&T. But it's just -- it's not more important for us in what we can do for all of our customers. Just to give you a little bit more data, not in any hardware numbers is we did in excess of 100 Oracle Cloud machines in the quarter, which are again us bringing all of the capabilities of our public cloud to our customers in their data centers. So that's some detail although not the financial details of the deal. But frankly, John, I think it's just as important what it means to our customers going forward on a bigger picture level."

The old IaaS was, as you know, a slower growing business. Our Gen2 IaaS, much faster. PaaS, much faster. As it gets sort of completely overwhelms the base of our old IaaS, you're going to see acceleration. You must see acceleration because it is inevitable as we do more and more transactions and bookings, which turn into revenues as people bring their Oracle licenses, their Oracle workloads to us. So you're going to see that's a very big area. Now as far as margins, remember, in our PaaS business or our IaaS business, the system itself is the same. However, what you see though is there's enormous value in both our automation and in our technology, whether it's the different pieces of software that are in there. And depending on the mix, the margin can be extremely high. We have always -- it's still the Oracle you know in that we watch every nickel around here. And we all sign off on every data center expansion and all the hardware that goes in it. So we really are very, very careful on not getting too far ahead of our revenues but also benefiting from massive economies of scale. This past year, we did a lot of build-out for which the revenue has not been showing up yet in the financial statement. But it will be. So depending on how the different pieces roll in, we expect margins, by the time it's the end of the year, we expect even PaaS and IaaS margins to be better and -- but we do feel we can do it within our CapEx envelope."

The we don't ship computers to any of our data centers until we have pretty firm orders for capacity. Also measuring how much data centers are used.

But we do it in such a way that once we ship, we know that we're going to have a very, very high utilization rate at our data centers. So just-in-time shipments. And we only ship when they cross something like a 75% or 80% utilization at that data center. So we don't have a lot of unused capacity. So if, let's just say, if our CapEx was double what Safra forecast next year, that's great news because then our PaaS revenues and Infrastructure revenues would be much higher and make up or -- much higher profit. So I don't know if that's clear. We don't make it until essential we've already sold it."

So you'll see some shift in our specialization. That's sort of one point. Second, we are building out, as we told you over the past couple of years, big hubs that are doing a lot of our selling. And so we have the by-product of that is that our sales force is actually increasing in numbers, but our cost per salesperson is actually declining. So our overall productivity is actually inclining. Those phenomena occur simultaneously. So anything about -- that you hear about we're reducing our sales force, again, fake news. Nothing that's going on here.

Well, all of it's baked into our view so there's no new news here. So let me flip the metric on you. If 65%, which is not an uncommon number we've given you over the past several quarters, is coming from net new logos, then the flip of that is 35% is coming from our existing base. So we have seen our existing base move. They just, to your point, moved slower than what the new logos have. I actually think this is a good thing because I believe that we will get all of our existing customers on-prem, roughly speaking, moving to our cloud infrastructure over time. Now in addition, when we do move and I want to make sure I'm clear and say because we have a lot more data than I would've had 2 years ago, when a customer who's on-prem paying us support moves to the cloud, they pay us more money. They don't pay us 1:1, They don't pay us 2:1, they pay us more like 3:1, in some cases, more than 3:1. In some cases, we also get the attach of platform SaaS that we get as well and that is not included in the 3:1 that I'm giving you. So we are actually very positive about the fact that if people move from our application support to our SaaS revenue, we get more money. And to Safra's point about what's going on with our gross margins, we now produce better performance at the bottom line because we get more revenue at a very high margin rate. So I expect that to continue. As we get more references, Mark, in ERP, et cetera, you're going to see that accelerate. We want that to accelerate and that acceleration is a good thing for our customers, and it's a good thing for our shareholders. Now the reason we made the deal that we made, a big deal we made over AT&T is because of the implication that has on our database business. That is -- and Safra couldn't have said it but this is now a customer who is now a reference in the public domain explaining why. And now I think you will see that same migration as time goes on, we have more customers like them who are in the middle of the process of moving now. I gave you an example of how much infrastructure was bought in Q4. Oracle cloud machines just as -- that is one surrogate for what's happening. And if that occurs, we will get more revenue as well and I predict we will be able to deliver higher levels of service, more functionality, more capability, more modernization as we do it. So I think you begin to see it in the application business. We love what we see in the applications business so far, and I think you're at the beginning of seeing it in the database business as well."

As you can see, we had a tremendous quarter in just about every way, as cloud revenue, new software license and earnings were all much better than expected. The adoption by our customers of our products and services is at an all-time high.
But before going into more detail about Q4, you can also see that we have made significant improvement in our financial reporting to align with how we are running the business now. The cloud has become our predominant growth vehicle. As you can see in our press release supplemental pages, we have given you tons of detail. We've given you the detail in our new presentation format, and we've also provided the reporting in our old format going back through fiscal 2016 and 2017 so you can see the numbers the new way, the old way, all including history to help your transition this quarter.
I'll first walk you through the reporting changes then go over the Q4 results using the new format and recap Q4 using the old format for comparability to my previous guidance. Then I'll sum up fiscal year '17 results using the new additional detail, before moving on to my guidance for Q1. So please be patient as I'm going to be giving you a lot of numbers today. But as I said, it's all in the press release tables that are on file, so you don't have to catch every number. After all that, I'll turn the call over to Larry and then Mark for their comments.
In making these reporting changes, we are now recording SaaS revenue separately as our tremendous growth resulted in SaaS revenue crossing the $1 billion a quarter threshold in Q4, having grown 76% in constant currency. We've also combined Platform and Infrastructure as a Service as the synergies and cross-selling between these 2 businesses is very high, and this is also how we are measuring our internal organization.
On Page 10, you can see GAAP applications revenue, which is SaaS and on-premise application software revenues. And further down the page, GAAP platform and infrastructure revenues, which is PaaS and IaaS and on-premise revenues. For hardware, we've gone ahead and consolidated hardware products and hardware support into a single line item of hardware. And we've also aligned the expense line where appropriate.
I'm now going to go over our non-GAAP Q4 results with our new format and use constant dollar growth rates, unless I state otherwise. This quarter, by the way, the effect of currency movements resulted in a 1% headwind on both total software revenue, including cloud, as well as total revenue. Currency movements had a $0.01 negative impact on non-GAAP EPS and $0.02 negative impact on GAAP EPS.
All right. Well, clearly, we're absolutely thrilled with our Q4 results as Software and Cloud revenues were 4 points above the high end of my guidance, and earnings per share was $0.08 above the high end of my guidance. As I mentioned earlier, Cloud SaaS revenues for the quarter were more than $1 billion for the first time and up 76% from last year. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 45% from last year. You can see the continuing revenue momentum of our cloud business in the cloud billings and deferred revenue. 
The growth deferred revenue balance is now over $2.4 billion, up 63% in U.S. dollars. Cloud billings grew 42% in U.S. dollars this quarter, and once again, we've put the cloud billings number up on our website for you to see the detail this quarter and, frankly, you probably don't need to keep doing it since many of the numbers you can derive.
As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded. The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 65%, up from 54% last Q4. We expect to see further improvement in FY '18 and remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins over time. Now the graph -- the gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 47%, down from 54% last Q4, as we invested in our geographic build-out ahead of the bulk of the revenue recognition. When we approach scale, I expect to see improvements in gross margins there, too.
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 66% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $7.5 billion, essentially unchanged from last year. And while new software license revenues were $2.6 billion, down 4%, reflecting the increasing preference of customers for cloud; software updates and product support revenues were $4.9 billion, up 3%, reflecting the continued high attach and renewal rates that show the stability of our installed base of on-premise customers. 
Total software and cloud revenues were $8.9 billion, up 7% and 4 points above the high end of guidance. In addition, the total on-premise software and cloud revenues for both our Applications and Platform and Infrastructure businesses are growing very well now. Applications total revenue were $2.9 billion, up 10% non-GAAP, 8% GAAP. And Platform and Infrastructure total revenues were $6 billion, up 6%, both GAAP and non-GAAP. In particular, our database business grew -- in aggregate, grew 8%. 
Hardware revenues were $1.1 billion, down 12%, and services revenue were $894 million, up 4%. Total revenues for the quarter were $10.9 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5 billion, up 7% from last year. And the operating margin was 46%, which was up from 45% last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20% as we saw some onetime benefits, and EPS was $0.89 in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 14.1% and GAAP EPS was $0.76 in U.S. dollars. Because of currency movements, non-GAAP EPS was lowered $0.01 and GAAP EPS was lowered by $0.02.
Q4, using our old format against my guidance, you can see that SaaS, PaaS revenues were $1.2 billion, up 75% and above the high end of the guidance I gave last quarter. IaaS revenues were $214 million, up 29%, and at the high end of my guidance.
Now moving on to the full fiscal year. software and cloud revenues totaled $30.4 billion, growing 6% in constant currency, with $24 billion or 79% of it being recurring revenue, up from 75% last year. Cloud SaaS was $3.4 billion, growing 70%. Cloud PaaS and IaaS was $1.4 billion, growing 63%. Total cloud revenues totaled $4.7 billion, growing 68%. On-premise software declined 1% to $25.6 billion as the 3% growth rate in software support was offset by cloud-related declines in new software license, which were down 11%. 
Hardware revenues were $4.2 billion, declining 10%; and services revenue were $3.4 billion, up 1%. Total company revenues for the year grew 3% to $37.9 billion. And operating income was $16.2 billion, up 3%. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 43%, up slightly from last year. Non-GAAP EPS, earnings per share, were $2.74 in U.S. dollars, up 6%. Because of currency movements, non-GAAP EPS was $0.03 lower.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.1 billion, up 3%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $525 million. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.1 billion. I expect our cloud CapEx spending to be about $1 billion next year, roughly equivalent to this year's level. We now have approximately $66.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $8.2 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we always have a disciplined approach to finding the right companies at the right time at the right valuations that make both strategic and financial sense.
This quarter, we repurchased 11 million shares for a total of nearly $500 million. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 86 million shares for a total of $3.5 billion and paid out dividends of $2.6 billion. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for FY '18. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. But assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency shouldn't have -- should not have an effect on total revenues or EPS.
So for Q1, cloud revenues, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, are expected to grow between 48% and 52%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 4% to 6%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.59 and $0.61, up from $0.55 last Q1. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. Of course, the tax rate could end up being different. Over the full year of FY '18, I expect continued high growth in cloud revenues, with cloud revenues materially surpassing new software license revenues.
Operating income growth will accelerate and the continued expansion of cloud gross margins and the return of operating margin expansion. Over the last 2 quarters, we exceeded the high end of my EPS guidance by $0.14. And as we begin FY '18, our compare is now that much higher. But even with this higher compare, I expect EPS growth will be double-digit next year.
As I mentioned earlier, we will continue to invest in capital in our cloud data centers expansions, but I do expect our overall CapEx will be lower as the CapEx for real estate should be somewhat lower.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

This is the second year in a row that we sold more cloud ARR than Salesforce.com. We are now well on our way to passing them and becoming #1 in the enterprise SaaS market. Our rapid SaaS growth is the driving force behind Oracle's revenue and earnings growth in Q4.
The reason we're confident that we'll pass Salesforce is because we have 3 full SaaS application suites: for ERP, for HCM and for CRM, including financials, procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, human resources, payroll, marketing, sales and service. Salesforce, in contrast, only competes in 3 of these 9 market areas. Furthermore, Oracle is now the clear leader in cloud ERP. And ERP is, by far, the largest application market, not CRM.
In addition to our demonstrated strength in SaaS, Oracle also competes in Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service. Here, our primary competitor is Amazon AWS. During this new fiscal year, we expect both our PaaS and IaaS businesses to accelerate into hyper-growth, the same kind of growth we're seeing with SaaS, as our customers begin to migrate their millions of Oracle databases to Generation2 of the Oracle Public Cloud. The AT&T deal is just the beginning. We expect that our Oracle PaaS and IaaS businesses will grow so fast that they will be even bigger than our SaaS business.
Over to you, Mark."

That was a [ difficult ] thing to get through. But listen. Thanks, Larry. Good quarter for us, obviously. We tracked ahead of virtually every metric that I track, whether it was cloud bookings, cloud revenue, EPS. Really everything on my KPI list was at a record level.
Starting with cloud bookings, $855 million. It's the best quarter we have ever had. It's up 43% over what was a very strong Q4 last year. We had a goal of $2 billion in ARR, and we finished with nearly $2.1 billion. Next year, we will sell more. By the way, booking revenue growth rates [ are given in ] CD unless otherwise said.
SaaS bookings were $486 million, PaaS and Infrastructure bookings, $369 million. As Safra said, cloud revenue growth at 66%, we're now at a $6 billion annualized run rate. Total and software -- for total software and cloud, to Safra's point, 80% -- roughly 80% of our trailing 12-months revenue is now recurring in nature. SaaS revenue, all up 76%, was an acceleration from 40% growth last year. 
ERP was up 156% organically. That did not include NetSuite. Overall, ERP is now over a $1.2 billion annualized run rate. Fusion HCM was up 96%, more than twice the growth rate of Workday. And our front office solution sales marketing and service were all up double digits organically.
Our verticals were up 111% and over $140 million in quarterly revenue. Our PaaS infrastructure revenue was up 45%. Database as a Service was up 62%. Our database business, including Database as a Service and our on-premise licenses and support, were up 8%. Cloud billings grew 42%, as Safra said, and deferred revenue up 63%. Both of those are in USD.
I am going to just name a few customers, so you get an idea of some of the customer wins we had in the quarter. I'm not going to hit everything, I'm just going to hit a few representative customers. And I'll start a little bit -- I'll start with ERP: Allianz, Ball Corporation, BNP Paribas, GE, the Kraft Heinz Corporation, Juniper, NetLife, Minerals Technology, Motorola, Mouser Electronics, NCR, Netflix, Newell Rubbermaid, Orange, Pearson, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Textron, University of Maryland, Vanderbilt University, Volkswagen.
In HCM: ABM Industries, AutoZone, Fannie Mae, Fujitsu, Garden Fresh Restaurants, Landmark, Mary Kay, the National Football League, NTT, Raymond James Associates, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Staples, University of Pittsburgh, the University of Texas System, Vanderbilt and a very large investment bank in New York City who switched vendors to our HCM. Those are just a few representative customers across just a couple of pillars in the quarter.
Lastly, as I mentioned, it was overall a very strong quarter. Bookings, billings and revenue all at record levels. We announced an exciting deal with AT&T, and while it provided no revenue at all in Q4, it's a very strategic win as a reference to all of our customers about the modernization of databases and the movement of them to the cloud.
Looking forward, just a couple of predictions. FY '17 bookings were $2.1 billion. Our pipeline is very large and ARR will be higher in FY '18. I do expect our application ecosystem of on-premise, that would include licenses and support and SaaS, will grow roughly 10% next year. With revenue now at an annualized run rate of $6 billion and a growth rate of 66%, we're clearly the fastest-growing cloud company at scale.
With that, we'll take your questions."

We had a little less than 1,600 new SaaS customers, 1,575 in the quarter. We had 1,138 expansions in the quarter. Roughly 400 of those customers who bought SaaS also bought Platform as a Service. So again, the attach rate between apps and PaaS continues to strengthen. ERP, we had 868 new customers. Now, by the way, Kirk, that doesn't include NetSuite, so that's just inside the traditional Oracle ERP business. We had almost 200 expansions. That's a big deal because as we start to sell, in many cases, financials, we're now being able to sell supply chain, procurement and manufacturing into that base as well. Another good thing for us in the quarter is roughly 2/3 of the new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before. So again, this is again 66%, 65% brand-new logos to Oracle. So HCM, we had about 325, 326 new customers and 300 expansions. A little over 600 in marketing, sales and service and about 670 expansions. So sort of all in, we have now about 13,550 customers in our SaaS active base. If you do include NetSuite, that number gets to 25,000. About 75% of everything we did in the quarter was Fusion. Again, that would not include NetSuite. So that's, roughly speaking, how the metrics worked out in the quarter. I hope that helps."

Really interested in hearing some of these larger logo wins you cited in SaaS, in ERP and HCM in particular. And yet you're still seeing and we're still continuing to hear about a lot of traction for you in the mid-market reflected in some of your other comments. So I'm trying to wrap my head around some of these larger logos that we're hearing pick up, especially on the ERP vertical given it's your size. And I'm hoping you can guide us as to where we are with some of those large logos in terms of Go-Live, pipeline, et cetera, that would be really tremendously helpful."

In fact, what you should see, as this goes on, is we will have less drag from the transition and the base will continue to grow. And so this should really accelerate. And understand that in our PaaS-IaaS business, we're not even at scale. So as we really scale that up, profitability is going to increase more quickly and revenues will be built on, on the base of another recurring revenue -- of the recurring revenue business. So we've been basically turning and we've had the drag of the move away from our historic business, to some extent, and revenue recognition that's not upfront but ratable. Then all of a sudden, you're going to see less of a drag as that side of the business is smaller compared to our cloud business. So we're obviously very optimistic. We indicated to you all during last year, this past year, that this thing was coming, and it has clearly come in Q4. And this next year and years after that are now going to be building on that base."

I mean, today, we've got Airtel, they're probably 30,000 users; American Eagle, 40,000 users; Fairmont, Raffles hotels, 42,000 users; Siemens, 60,000 users; Wells, 275,000 users;",285,"To your other question, yes, we've got some very large active HCM customers.

And these are big, big customers. And so those are just HCM. So those are obviously big -- very big scale customers. Now that said, in ERP, you're right in what you said. I mean, we have a lot of mid-market -- upper mid-market wins and a lot of new logos to Oracle who were not doing business with Oracle before they made this acquisition. And that's certainly been a fantastic strength. I mean, our cloud is made up of a lot of new logos in addition to some existing customers. Now in terms of scaled ERP customers though, I mean, Orange is -- they're using financials, procurement, projects, supply chain management; GE Digital, Qualcomm, Hearst, Tesco, Caesars. I mean, these are just sort of off the top of my head. So these are big-scaled ERP customers. Now to Larry's point, and I'll make it a little bit about HCM and ERP, the TAM in ERP is materially bigger than the TAM in HCM. So the TAM in ERP is 3x to 4x bigger in ERP. And additionally, ERP drags HCM or can drag HCM in the transaction. So these big ERP references that we have, and obviously with the number we closed in Q4 and are going live now every quarter, more to come. We've seen increasing pull of HCM in these big ERP transactions, and they are through in the mid-market and in the upmarket. I hope that helps."

Mark, I'd like -- if you could, talk a little bit more about the AT&T deal. AT&T, as you've pointed out in the press release, when that came out, has been a customer of Oracle and we all know that. So I guess the question is how incremental is this deal to Oracle? Is it a price uplift because you're providing the entire infrastructure with cloud versus just a software? Or does it also include new workloads? And I guess, can you give us any idea about how much incremental business, assuming there is some, which I think there obviously is, this means for you versus your previous relationship with AT&T?"

So as your point, was AT&T a good customer before this happened? Yes. Is AT&T going to be an even better customer going forward? Yes. Is AT&T giving us more revenue than before? Yes. Did AT&T give us any incremental revenue in Q4? No. So is this deal ratable over time? Yes. Is it a long-term agreement? Yes. It's a very long-term agreement. Let me try to give you a little bit more color. First, it is a long-term deal. AT&T has over 10,000 Oracle databases. They have several hundred. And you might say, John, that's a small percent of their overall databases, but they have several hundred large databases that have 70%, 75% of all of their company's data. They badly wanted to get the benefits of cloud, provisioning -- a lot of provisioning and all new features that come with the product, modernization, consolidation of that infrastructure. Yet in many case, they've got regulatory pressures on what they can put in the public cloud and what they can't. This is an example where we talked about this before. We take our Oracle Cloud machine and we are able now to do all of that with them on their premise and give them all the benefits of the cloud. We manage. We patch. We basically run the cloud for them and we help them get all of that done. And so it's great a deal as this is, this is even a bigger deal, John, in what it represents for our entire customer base. This is a bigger deal to us than the transaction. It is the opportunity for us to now do this for hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of customers. The opportunity for us in the quarter -- and the reason we somewhat put a press release out was AT&T being so effusive about their opportunity now and what it meant for them internal to AT&T. But it's just, if not, more important for us in what we can do for all of our customers. Just to give you a little bit more data, not in any or hardware numbers, is we did in excess of 100 Oracle Cloud machines in the quarter, which are again us bringing all of the capabilities of our public cloud to our customers in their data centers. So that's some detail, although not the financial details of the deal. But frankly, John, I think it's just as important what it means to our customers going forward on a bigger picture level."

The old IaaS was, as you know, a slower growing business. Our Gen2 IaaS, much faster. PaaS, much faster. As it gets sort of completely overwhelms the base of our old IaaS, you're going to see acceleration. You must see acceleration because it is inevitable as we do more and more transactions and bookings, which turn into revenues as people bring their Oracle licenses, their Oracle workloads to us. So you're going to see that's a very big area. Now as far as margins, remember, in our PaaS business or our IaaS business, the system itself is the same. However, what you see though is there's enormous value in both our automation and in our technology, whether it's the different pieces of software that are in there. And depending on the mix, the margin can be extremely high. We have always -- it's still the Oracle you know in that we watch every nickel around here. And we all sign off on every data center expansion and all the hardware that goes in it. So we really are very, very careful on not getting too far ahead of our revenues, but also benefiting from massive economies of scale. This past year, we did a lot of build-out for which the revenue has not been showing up yet in the financial statement. But it will be. So depending on how the different pieces roll in, we expect margins -- by the time it's the end of the year, we expect even PaaS, IaaS margins to be better. And -- but we do feel we can do it within our CapEx envelope."

The -- we just don't ship -- [ you see, ] we don't ship computers to any of our data centers until we have pretty firm orders for capacity. We're honestly measuring how much our data centers are used. As our data centers reach, let's say, I'll pick a number, 75%, 80% utilization, we would get to some threshold, then we start to replenish and add compute and storage capacity to the data centers. It's a just-in-time system. Those components that [indiscernible] grow and go to Frankfurt or go to London or go to Singapore or go to any of our data centers around the world. But we do it in such a way that once we ship, we know that we're going to have a very, very high utilization rate at our data centers, so the just-in-time shipments. And we only ship when they cross something like a 75% or 80% utilization at that data center. So we don't have a lot of unused capacity. So if, let's just say, if our CapEx was double what Safra forecast next year, that's great news because then our PaaS revenues and Infrastructure revenues would be much higher and make up for much higher profit. So I don't know if that's clear. We don't make it until essentially we've already sold it."

If 65%, which is not an uncommon number we've given you over the past several quarters, is coming from net new logos, then the flip of that is 35% is coming from our existing base. So we have seen our existing base move. They just, to your point, moved slower than what the new logos have. I actually think this is a good thing because I believe that we will get all of our existing customers on-prem, roughly speaking, moving to our cloud infrastructure over time. Now in addition, when we do move, and I want to make sure I'm clear and say it again because we have a lot more data than I would've had 2 years ago, when a customer who's on-prem paying us support moves to the cloud, they pay us more money. They don't pay us 1:1, they don't pay us 2:1, they pay us more like 3:1. In some cases, more than 3:1. In some cases, we also get the attach of platform for the SaaS that we get as well, and that is not included in the 3:1 that I'm giving you. So we are actually very positive about the fact that if people move from our application support to our SaaS revenue, we get more money. And to Safra's point about what's going on with our gross margins, we now produce better performance at the bottom line because we get more revenue at a very high margin rate. So I expect that to continue. As we get more references, Mark, in ERP, et cetera, you're going to see that accelerate. We want that to accelerate and that acceleration is a good thing for our customers, and it's a good thing for local shareholders. Now the reason we made the deal that we made, a big deal we made over AT&T, is because of the implication that has on our database business. That is a -- and Safra couldn't have said it better, this is now a customer who is now a reference in the public domain explaining why. And now, I think you will see that same migration as time goes on. We have more customers like them who are in the middle of the process of moving now. And I gave you an example of how much infrastructure was bought in Q4 of Oracle cloud machines just as -- that is one surrogate for what's happening. And if that occurs, we will get more revenue as well and I predict we will be able to deliver higher levels of service, more functionality, more capability, more modernization as we do it. So I think you've begun to see it in the application business. We love what we see in the applications business so far. And I think you're at the beginning of seeing it in the database business as well."

As you can see, we had a tremendous quarter in just about every way, as cloud revenue, new software license and earnings were all much better than expected. The adoption by our customers of our products and services is at an all-time high.
But before going into more detail about Q4, you can also see that we have made significant improvement in our financial reporting to align with how we are running the business now. The cloud has become our predominant growth vehicle. 
As you can see in our press release supplemental pages, we have given you tons of detail. We've given you the detail in our new presentation format, and we've also provided the reporting in our old format going back through fiscal 2016 and 2017 so you can see the numbers the new way, the old way, all including history to help your transition this quarter.
I'll first walk you through the reporting changes then go over the Q4 results using the new format and recap Q4 using the old format for comparability to my previous guidance. Then I'll sum up fiscal year '17 results using the new additional detail, before moving on to my guidance for Q1. 
So please be patient as I'm going to be giving you a lot of numbers today. But as I said, it's all in the press release tables that are on file, so you don't have to catch every number. After all that, I'll turn the call over to Larry and then Mark for their comments.
In making these reporting changes, we are now recording SaaS revenue separately as our tremendous growth resulted in SaaS revenue crossing the $1 billion a quarter threshold in Q4, having grown 76% in constant currency. We've also combined Platform and Infrastructure as a Service as the synergies and cross-selling between these 2 businesses is very high, and this is also how we are measuring our internal organization.
On Page 10, you can see GAAP applications revenue, which is SaaS and on-premise application software revenues. And further down the page, GAAP platform and infrastructure revenues, which is PaaS and IaaS and on-premise revenues. For hardware, we've gone ahead and consolidated hardware products and hardware support into a single line item of hardware. And we've also aligned the expense lines where appropriate.
I'm now going to go over our non-GAAP Q4 results with our new format and use constant dollar growth rates, unless I state otherwise. This quarter, by the way, the effect of currency movements resulted in a 1% headwind on both total software revenue, including cloud, as well as total revenue. Currency movements had a $0.01 negative impact on non-GAAP EPS and $0.02 negative impact on GAAP EPS.
All right. Well, clearly, we're absolutely thrilled with our Q4 results as Software and Cloud revenues were 4 points above the high end of my guidance, and earnings per share was $0.08 above the high end of my guidance. As I mentioned earlier, Cloud SaaS revenues for the quarter were more than $1 billion for the first time and up 76% from last year. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 45% from last year. You can see the continuing revenue momentum of our cloud business in the cloud billings and deferred revenue. 
The growth deferred revenue balance is now over $2.4 billion, up 63% in U.S. dollars. Cloud billings grew 42% in U.S. dollars this quarter, and once again, we've put the cloud billings number up on our website for you to see the detail this quarter and, frankly, probably don't need to keep doing it since many of the numbers you can derive.
As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded. The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 65%, up from 54% last Q4. We expect to see further improvement in FY '18 and remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins over time. Now the graph -- the gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 47%, down from 54% last Q4, as we invested in our geographic build-out ahead of the bulk of the revenue recognition. When we approach scale, I expect to see improvements in gross margins there, too.
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 66% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $7.5 billion, essentially unchanged from last year. And while new software license revenues were $2.6 billion, down 4%, reflecting the increasing preference of customers for cloud, software updates and product support revenues were $4.9 billion, up 3%, reflecting the continued high attach and renewal rates that show the stability of our installed base of on-premise customers. 
Total software and cloud revenues were $8.9 billion, up 7%, and 4 points above the high end of guidance. In addition, the total on-premise software and cloud revenues for both our Applications and Platform and Infrastructure businesses are growing very well now. Applications total revenue were $2.9 billion, up 10% non-GAAP, 8% GAAP. And Platform and Infrastructure total revenues were $6 billion, up 6%, both GAAP and non-GAAP. In particular, our database business grew -- in aggregate, grew 8%. 
Hardware revenues were $1.1 billion, down 12%, and services revenue were $894 million, up 4%. Total revenues for the quarter were $10.9 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5 billion, up 7% from last year. And the operating margin was 46%, which was up from 45% last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20% as we saw some onetime benefits, and EPS was $0.89 in U.S. dollars. 
The GAAP tax rate was 14.1% and GAAP EPS was $0.76 in U.S. dollars. Because of currency movements, non-GAAP EPS was lowered $0.01 and GAAP EPS was lowered by $0.02.
Q4, using our old format against my guidance, you can see that SaaS, PaaS revenues were $1.2 billion, up 75% and above the high end of the guidance I gave last quarter. IaaS revenues were $214 million, up 29%, and at the high end of my guidance.
Now moving on to the full fiscal year. Software and cloud revenues totaled $30.4 billion, growing 6% in constant currency, with $24 billion or 79% of it being recurring revenue, up from 75% last year. 
Cloud SaaS was $3.4 billion, growing 70%. Cloud PaaS and IaaS was $1.4 billion, growing 63%. Total cloud revenues totaled $4.7 billion, growing 68%. On-premise software declined 1% to $25.6 billion as the 3% growth rate in software support was offset by cloud-related declines in new software license, which were down 11%. 
Hardware revenues were $4.2 billion, declining 10%, and services revenue were $3.4 billion, up 1%. 
Total company revenues for the year grew 3% to $37.9 billion. And operating income was $16.2 billion, up 3%. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 43%, up slightly from last year. Non-GAAP EPS, earnings per share, were $2.74 in U.S. dollars, up 6%. Because of currency movements, non-GAAP EPS was $0.03 lower.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.1 billion, up 3%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $525 million. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.1 billion. I expect our cloud CapEx spending to be about $1 billion next year, roughly equivalent to this year's level. 
We now have approximately $66.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $8.2 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we always have a disciplined approach to finding the right companies at the right time at the right valuations that make both strategic and financial sense.
This quarter, we repurchased 11 million shares for a total of nearly $500 million. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 86 million shares for a total of $3.5 billion and paid out dividends of $2.6 billion. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for FY '18. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. But assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should not have an effect on total revenues or EPS.
So for Q1, cloud revenues, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, are expected to grow between 48% and 52%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 4% to 6%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.59 and $0.61, up from $0.55 last Q1. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. Of course, the tax rate could end up being different. 
Over the full year of FY '18, I expect continued high growth in cloud revenues, with cloud revenues materially surpassing new software license revenues.
Operating income growth will accelerate and the continued expansion of cloud gross margins and the return of operating margin expansion. Over the last 2 quarters, we exceeded the high end of my EPS guidance by $0.14. And as we begin FY '18, our compare is now that much higher. But even with this higher compare, I expect EPS growth will be double-digit next year.
As I mentioned earlier, we will continue to invest in capital in our cloud data centers expansion, but I do expect our overall CapEx will be lower as the CapEx for real estate should be somewhat lower.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

This is the second year in a row that we sold more cloud ARR than Salesforce.com. We are now well on our way to passing them and becoming #1 in the enterprise SaaS market. Our rapid SaaS growth is the driving force behind Oracle's revenue and earnings growth in Q4.
The reason we're confident that we'll pass Salesforce is because we have 3 full SaaS application suites: for ERP, for HCM and for CRM, including financials, procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, human resources, payroll, marketing, sales and service. Salesforce, in contrast, only competes in 3 of these 9 market areas. Furthermore, Oracle is now the clear leader in cloud ERP. And ERP is, by far, the largest application market, not CRM.
In addition to our demonstrated strength in SaaS, Oracle also competes in Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service. Here, our primary competitor is Amazon AWS. During this new fiscal year, we expect both our PaaS and IaaS businesses to accelerate into hyper-growth, the same kind of growth we're seeing with SaaS, as our customers begin to migrate their millions of Oracle databases to Generation2 of the Oracle Public Cloud. The AT&T deal is just the beginning. We expect that our Oracle PaaS and IaaS businesses will grow so fast that they will be even bigger than our SaaS business.
Over to you, Mark."

That was a [ difficult ] thing to get through. So thanks, Larry. Good quarter for us, obviously. We tracked ahead of virtually every metric that I track, whether it was cloud bookings, cloud revenue, EPS. Really everything on my KPI list was at a record level.
Starting with cloud bookings, $855 million. It's the best quarter we have ever had. It's up 43% over what was a very strong Q4 last year. We had a goal of $2 billion in ARR, and we finished with nearly $2.1 billion. Next year, we will sell more. By the way, booking revenue growth rates that I give are in CD unless otherwise said.
SaaS bookings were $486 million, PaaS and Infrastructure bookings, $369 million. As Safra said, cloud revenue growth at 66%, we're now at a $6 billion annualized run rate. Total and software -- for total software and cloud, to Safra's point, 80% -- roughly 80% of our trailing 12-months revenue is now recurring in nature. SaaS revenue, all up 76%, was an acceleration from 40% growth last year. 
ERP was up 156% organically. That did not include NetSuite. Overall, ERP is now over a $1.2 billion annualized run rate. 
Fusion HCM was up 96%, more than twice the growth rate of Workday. And our front office solution sales, marketing and service were all up double digits organically.
Our verticals were up 111% and over $140 million in quarterly revenue. Our PaaS infrastructure revenue was up 45%. Database as a Service was up 62%. Our database business, including Database as a Service and our on-premise licenses and support, were up 8%. Cloud billings grew 42%, as Safra said, and deferred revenue up 63%. Both of those are in USD.
I am going to just name a few customers, so you get an idea of some of the customer wins we had in the quarter. I'm not going to hit everything, I'm just going to hit a few representative customers. And I'll start a little bit -- I'll start with ERP: Allianz, Ball Corporation, BNP Paribas, GE, the Kraft Heinz Corporation, Juniper, MetLife, Minerals Technologies, Motorola, Mouser Electronics, NCR, Netflix, Newell Rubbermaid, Orange, Pearson, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Textron, University of Maryland, Vanderbilt University, Volkswagen.
In HCM: ABM Industries, AutoZone, Fannie Mae, Fujitsu, Garden Fresh Restaurants, Landmark, Mary Kay, the National Football League, NTT, Raymond James & Associates, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Staples, University of Pittsburgh, the University of Texas System, Vanderbilt and a very large investment bank in New York City who switched vendors to our HCM. Those are just a few representative customers across just a couple of pillars in the quarter.
Lastly, as I mentioned, it was an overall -- a very strong quarter. Bookings, billings and revenue all at record levels. We announced an exciting deal with AT&T, and while it provided no revenue at all in Q4, it's a very strategic win as a reference to all of our customers about the modernization of databases and the movement of them to the cloud.
Looking forward, just a couple of predictions. FY '17 bookings were $2.1 billion. Our pipeline is very large and ARR will be higher in FY '18. I do expect our application ecosystem of on-premise, that would include licenses and support and SaaS, will grow roughly 10% next year. With revenue now at an annualized run rate of $6 billion and a growth rate of 66%, we're clearly the fastest-growing cloud company at scale.
With that, we'll take your questions."

So again, the attach rate between apps and PaaS continues to strengthen. ERP, we had 868 new customers. Now, by the way, Kirk, that doesn't include NetSuite, so that's just inside the traditional Oracle ERP business. We had almost 200 expansions. That's a big deal because as we start to sell, in many cases, financials, we're now being able to sell supply chain, procurement and manufacturing into that base as well. Another good thing for us in the quarter is roughly 2/3 of the new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before. So again, this is again 66%, 65% brand-new logos to Oracle. So HCM, we had about 325, 326 new customers and 300 expansions. A little over 600 in marketing, sales and service and about 670 expansions. So sort of all in, we have now about 13,550 customers in our SaaS active base. If you do include NetSuite, that number gets to 25,000. About 75% of everything we did in the quarter was Fusion.

So as we really scale that up, profitability is going to increase more quickly and revenues will be built on the base of another recurring revenue -- of the recurring revenue business. So we've been basically turning and we've had the drag of the move away from our historic business, to some extent, and revenue recognition that's not upfront but ratable. Then all of a sudden, you're going to see less of a drag as that side of the business is smaller compared to our cloud business. So we're obviously very optimistic.

I mean, we have a lot of mid-market -- upper mid-market wins and a lot of new logos to Oracle who were not doing business with Oracle before they made this acquisition. And that's certainly been a fantastic strength. I mean, our cloud is made up of a lot of new logos in addition to some existing customers. Now in terms of scaled ERP customers though, I mean, Orange is -- they're using financials, procurement, projects, supply chain management; GE Digital, Qualcomm, Hearst, Tesco, Caesars. I mean, these are just sort of off the top of my head. So these are big-scaled ERP customers. Now to Larry's point, and I'll make it a little bit about HCM and ERP, the TAM in ERP is materially bigger than the TAM in HCM. So the TAM in ERP is 3x to 4x bigger in ERP. And additionally, ERP drags HCM or can drag HCM in the transaction. So these big ERP references that we have, and obviously with the number we closed in Q4 and are going live now every quarter, more to come. We've seen increasing pull of HCM in these big ERP transactions, and they are true in the mid-market and in the upmarket. I hope that helps."

Now AT&T, as you've pointed out in the press release, when that came out, has been a customer of Oracle and we all know that. So I guess the question is how incremental is this deal to Oracle? Is it a price uplift because you're providing the entire infrastructure with cloud versus just the software? Or does it also include new workloads?

So as your point, was AT&T a good customer before this happened? Yes. Is AT&T going to be an even better customer going forward? Yes. Is AT&T giving us more revenue than before? Yes. Did AT&T give us any incremental revenue in Q4? No. So is this deal ratable over time? Yes. Is it a long-term agreement? Yes. It's a very long-term agreement. Let me try to give you a little bit more color. First, it is a long-term deal. AT&T has over 10,000 Oracle databases. They have several hundred -- and you might say, John, that's a small percent of their overall databases, but they have several hundred large databases that have 70%, 75% of all of their company's data. They badly wanted to get the benefits of cloud, provisioning, auto provisioning and all the  features that come with the product, modernization, consolidation of that infrastructure. Yet in many cases, they've got regulatory pressures on what they can put in the public cloud and what they can't. This is an example where we've talked about this before. We take our Oracle Cloud machine and we are able now to do all of that with them on their premise and give them all the benefits of the cloud. We manage. We patch. We basically run the cloud for them and we help them get all of that done. And so as great a deal as this is, this is even a bigger deal, John, in what it represents for our entire customer base. This is a bigger deal to us than the transaction. It is the opportunity for us to now do this for hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of customers. The opportunity for us in the quarter -- and the reason we put the press release out was AT&T being so effusive about their opportunity now and what it meant for them internal to AT&T. But it's just, if not, more important for us in what we can do for all of our customers. Just to give you a little bit more data, not in any of our hardware numbers, is we did in excess of 100 Oracle Cloud machines in the quarter, which are again us bringing all of the capabilities of our public cloud to our customers in their data center. So that's some details, although not the financial details of the deal. But frankly, John, I think it's just as important what it means to our customers going forward on a bigger picture level."

The old IaaS was, as you know, a slower growing business. Our Gen2 IaaS, much faster. PaaS, much faster. As it gets -- sort of completely overwhelms the base of our old IaaS, you're going to see acceleration. You must see acceleration because it is inevitable as we do more and more transactions and bookings, which turn into revenues as people bring their Oracle licenses, their Oracle workloads to us. So you're going to see that's a very big area. Now as far as margins, remember, in our PaaS business or our IaaS business, the system itself is the same. However, what you see though is that there's enormous value in both our automation and in our technology, whether it's the different pieces of software that are in there. And depending on the mix, the margin can be extremely high. We have always -- it's still the Oracle you know in that we watch every nickel around here. And we all sign off on every data center expansion and all the hardware that goes in it. So we really are very, very careful on not getting too far ahead of our revenues, but also benefiting from massive economies of scale. This past year, we did a lot of build-out for which the revenue has not been showing up yet in the financial statement. But it will be. So depending on how the different pieces roll in, we expect margins -- by the time it's the end of the year, we expect even PaaS, IaaS margins to be better. And -- but we do feel we can do it within our CapEx envelope."

The -- we don't ship -- [ CD, ] we don't ship computers to any of our data centers until we have pretty firm orders for capacity. We're honestly measuring how much our data centers are used. As our data centers reach, let's say, I'll pick a number, 75%, 80% utilization, we get to some threshold, then we start to replenish and add compute and storage capacity to the data centers. It's a just-in-time system. Those components that grow and go to Frankfurt or go to London or go to Singapore or go to any of our data centers around the world. But we do it in such a way that once we ship, we know that we're going to have a very, very high utilization rate in our data centers. And with the just-in-time shipments, and we only ship when they cross something like a 75% or 80% utilization at that data center. So we don't have a lot of unused capacity. So if -- let's just say, if our CapEx was double what Safra forecasts next year, that's great news because then our PaaS revenues and Infrastructure revenues would be much higher and make up for it with much higher profit.

And lastly, which of the -- what of the migration is baked into your confidence for FY '18 cloud ARR?"
22247,432943169,1232917,"Oracle Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 21, 2017",2017-06-21,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Okay. Well, all of it's baked into our view, so there's no new news here. So let me flip the metric on you. If 65%, which is not an uncommon number we've given you over the past several quarters, is coming from net new logos, then the flip of that is 35%",501,"Okay. Well, all of it's baked into our view, so there's no new news here. So let me flip the metric on you. If 65%, which is not an uncommon number we've given you over the past several quarters, is coming from net new logos, then the flip of that is 35% is coming from our existing base. So we have seen our existing base move. They just, to your point, moved slower than what the new logos have. I actually think this is a good thing because I believe that we will get all of our existing customers on-prem, roughly speaking, moving to our cloud infrastructure over time. Now in addition, when we do move, and I want to make sure I'm clear and say it again, because we now have a lot more data than I would've had 2 years ago, when a customer who's on-prem paying us support moves to the cloud, they pay us more money. They don't pay us 1:1, they don't pay us 2:1, they pay us more like 3:1. In some cases, more than 3:1. In some cases, we also get the attach of platform, so the SaaS that we get as well, and that is not included in the 3:1 that I'm giving you. So we are actually very positive about the fact that if people move from our application support to our SaaS revenue, we get more money. And to Safra's point about what's going on with our gross margins, we now produce better performance at the bottom line because we get more revenue at a very high margin rate. So I expect that to continue. As we get more references, Mark, in ERP, et cetera, you're going to see that accelerate. We want that to accelerate and that acceleration is a good thing for our customers, and it's a good thing for Oracle shareholders. Now the reason we made the deal that we made, a big deal we made over AT&T, is because of the implication that has on our database business. That is a -- and Safra couldn't have said it better, this is now a customer who is now a reference in the public domain explaining why. And now, I think you will see that same migration as time goes on. We have more customers like them who are in the middle of the process of moving now. And I gave you an example of how much infrastructure was bought in Q4 of Oracle cloud machines just as -- that is one surrogate for what's happening. And if that occurs, we will get more revenue as well and I predict we will be able to deliver higher levels of service, more functionality, more capability, more modernization as we do it. So I think you've begun to see it in the application business. We love what we see in the applications business so far. And I think you're at the beginning of seeing it in the database business as well."

As you can see, we had a tremendous quarter in just about every way, as cloud revenue, new software license and earnings were all much better than expected. The adoption by our customers of our products and services is at an all-time high.
But before going into more detail about Q4, you can also see that we have made significant improvement in our financial reporting to align with how we are running the business now. The cloud has become our predominant growth vehicle. 
As you can see in our press release supplemental pages, we have given you tons of detail. We've given you the detail in our new presentation format, and we've also provided the reporting in our old format going back through fiscal 2016 and 2017 so you can see the numbers the new way, the old way, all including history to help your transition this quarter.
I'll first walk you through the reporting changes then go over the Q4 results using the new format and recap Q4 using the old format for comparability to my previous guidance. Then I'll sum up fiscal year '17 results using the new additional detail, before moving on to my guidance for Q1. 
So please be patient as I'm going to be giving you a lot of numbers today. But as I said, it's all in the press release tables that are on file, so you don't have to catch every number. After all that, I'll turn the call over to Larry and then Mark for their comments.
In making these reporting changes, we are now recording SaaS revenue separately as our tremendous growth resulted in SaaS revenue crossing the $1 billion a quarter threshold in Q4, having grown 76% in constant currency. We've also combined Platform and Infrastructure as a Service as the synergies and cross-selling between these 2 businesses is very high, and this is also how we are measuring our internal organization.
On Page 10, you can see GAAP applications revenue, which is SaaS and on-premise application software revenues. And further down the page, GAAP platform and infrastructure revenues, which is PaaS and IaaS and on-premise revenues. For hardware, we've gone ahead and consolidated hardware products and hardware support into a single line item of hardware. And we've also aligned the expense lines where appropriate.
I'm now going to go over our non-GAAP Q4 results with our new format and use constant dollar growth rates, unless I state otherwise. This quarter, by the way, the effect of currency movements resulted in a 1% headwind on both total software revenue, including cloud, as well as total revenue. Currency movements had a $0.01 negative impact on non-GAAP EPS and $0.02 negative impact on GAAP EPS.
All right. Well, clearly, we're absolutely thrilled with our Q4 results as Software and Cloud revenues were 4 points above the high end of my guidance, and earnings per share was $0.08 above the high end of my guidance. As I mentioned earlier, Cloud SaaS revenues for the quarter were more than $1 billion for the first time and up 76% from last year. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 45% from last year. You can see the continuing revenue momentum of our cloud business in the cloud billings and deferred revenue. 
The growth deferred revenue balance is now over $2.4 billion, up 63% in U.S. dollars. Cloud billings grew 42% in U.S. dollars this quarter, and once again, we've put the cloud billings number up on our website for you to see the detail this quarter and, frankly, probably don't need to keep doing it since many of the numbers you can derive.
As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded. The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 65%, up from 54% last Q4. We expect to see further improvement in FY '18 and remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins over time. Now the graph -- the gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 47%, down from 54% last Q4, as we invested in our geographic build-out ahead of the bulk of the revenue recognition. When we approach scale, I expect to see improvements in gross margins there, too.
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 66% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $7.5 billion, essentially unchanged from last year. And while new software license revenues were $2.6 billion, down 4%, reflecting the increasing preference of customers for cloud, software updates and product support revenues were $4.9 billion, up 3%, reflecting the continued high attach and renewal rates that show the stability of our installed base of on-premise customers. 
Total software and cloud revenues were $8.9 billion, up 7%, and 4 points above the high end of guidance. In addition, the total on-premise software and cloud revenues for both our Applications and Platform and Infrastructure businesses are growing very well now. Applications total revenue were $2.9 billion, up 10% non-GAAP, 8% GAAP. And Platform and Infrastructure total revenues were $6 billion, up 6%, both GAAP and non-GAAP. In particular, our database business grew -- in aggregate, grew 8%. 
Hardware revenues were $1.1 billion, down 12%, and services revenue were $894 million, up 4%. Total revenues for the quarter were $10.9 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5 billion, up 7% from last year. And the operating margin was 46%, which was up from 45% last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20% as we saw some onetime benefits, and EPS was $0.89 in U.S. dollars. 
The GAAP tax rate was 14.1% and GAAP EPS was $0.76 in U.S. dollars. Because of currency movements, non-GAAP EPS was lowered $0.01 and GAAP EPS was lowered by $0.02.
Q4, using our old format against my guidance, you can see that SaaS, PaaS revenues were $1.2 billion, up 75% and above the high end of the guidance I gave last quarter. IaaS revenues were $214 million, up 29%, and at the high end of my guidance.
Now moving on to the full fiscal year. Software and cloud revenues totaled $30.4 billion, growing 6% in constant currency, with $24 billion or 79% of it being recurring revenue, up from 75% last year. 
Cloud SaaS was $3.4 billion, growing 70%. Cloud PaaS and IaaS was $1.4 billion, growing 63%. Total cloud revenues totaled $4.7 billion, growing 68%. On-premise software declined 1% to $25.6 billion as the 3% growth rate in software support was offset by cloud-related declines in new software license, which were down 11%. 
Hardware revenues were $4.2 billion, declining 10%, and services revenue were $3.4 billion, up 1%. 
Total company revenues for the year grew 3% to $37.9 billion. And operating income was $16.2 billion, up 3%. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 43%, up slightly from last year. Non-GAAP EPS, earnings per share, were $2.74 in U.S. dollars, up 6%. Because of currency movements, non-GAAP EPS was $0.03 lower.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.1 billion, up 3%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $525 million. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.1 billion. I expect our cloud CapEx spending to be about $1 billion next year, roughly equivalent to this year's level. 
We now have approximately $66.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $8.2 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we always have a disciplined approach to finding the right companies at the right time at the right valuations that make both strategic and financial sense.
This quarter, we repurchased 11 million shares for a total of nearly $500 million. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 86 million shares for a total of $3.5 billion and paid out dividends of $2.6 billion. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for FY '18. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. But assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should not have an effect on total revenues or EPS.
So for Q1, cloud revenues, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, are expected to grow between 48% and 52%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 4% to 6%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.59 and $0.61, up from $0.55 last Q1. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. Of course, the tax rate could end up being different. 
Over the full year of FY '18, I expect continued high growth in cloud revenues, with cloud revenues materially surpassing new software license revenues.
Operating income growth will accelerate and the continued expansion of cloud gross margins and the return of operating margin expansion. Over the last 2 quarters, we exceeded the high end of my EPS guidance by $0.14. And as we begin FY '18, our compare is now that much higher. But even with this higher compare, I expect EPS growth will be double-digit next year.
As I mentioned earlier, we will continue to invest in capital in our cloud data centers expansion, but I do expect our overall CapEx will be lower as the CapEx for real estate should be somewhat lower.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

This is the second year in a row that we sold more cloud ARR than Salesforce.com. We are now well on our way to passing them and becoming #1 in the enterprise SaaS market. Our rapid SaaS growth is the driving force behind Oracle's revenue and earnings growth in Q4.
The reason we're confident that we'll pass Salesforce is because we have 3 full SaaS application suites: for ERP, for HCM and for CRM, including financials, procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, human resources, payroll, marketing, sales and service. Salesforce, in contrast, only competes in 3 of these 9 market areas. Furthermore, Oracle is now the clear leader in cloud ERP. And ERP is, by far, the largest application market, not CRM.
In addition to our demonstrated strength in SaaS, Oracle also competes in Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service. Here, our primary competitor is Amazon AWS. During this new fiscal year, we expect both our PaaS and IaaS businesses to accelerate into hyper-growth, the same kind of growth we're seeing with SaaS, as our customers begin to migrate their millions of Oracle databases to Generation2 of the Oracle Public Cloud. The AT&T deal is just the beginning. We expect that our Oracle PaaS and IaaS businesses will grow so fast that they will be even bigger than our SaaS business.
Over to you, Mark."

That was a [ difficult ] thing to get through. So thanks, Larry. Good quarter for us, obviously. We tracked ahead of virtually every metric that I track, whether it was cloud bookings, cloud revenue, EPS. Really everything on my KPI list was at a record level.
Starting with cloud bookings, $855 million. It's the best quarter we have ever had. It's up 43% over what was a very strong Q4 last year. We had a goal of $2 billion in ARR, and we finished with nearly $2.1 billion. Next year, we will sell more. By the way, booking revenue growth rates that I give are in CD unless otherwise said.
SaaS bookings were $486 million, PaaS and Infrastructure bookings, $369 million. As Safra said, cloud revenue growth at 66%, we're now at a $6 billion annualized run rate. Total and software -- for total software and cloud, to Safra's point, 80% -- roughly 80% of our trailing 12-months revenue is now recurring in nature. SaaS revenue, all up 76%, was an acceleration from 40% growth last year. 
ERP was up 156% organically. That did not include NetSuite. Overall, ERP is now over a $1.2 billion annualized run rate. 
Fusion HCM was up 96%, more than twice the growth rate of Workday. And our front office solution sales, marketing and service were all up double digits organically.
Our verticals were up 111% and over $140 million in quarterly revenue. Our PaaS infrastructure revenue was up 45%. Database as a Service was up 62%. Our database business, including Database as a Service and our on-premise licenses and support, were up 8%. Cloud billings grew 42%, as Safra said, and deferred revenue up 63%. Both of those are in USD.
I am going to just name a few customers, so you get an idea of some of the customer wins we had in the quarter. I'm not going to hit everything, I'm just going to hit a few representative customers. And I'll start a little bit -- I'll start with ERP: Allianz, Ball Corporation, BNP Paribas, GE, the Kraft Heinz Corporation, Juniper, MetLife, Minerals Technologies, Motorola, Mouser Electronics, NCR, Netflix, Newell Rubbermaid, Orange, Pearson, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Textron, University of Maryland, Vanderbilt University, Volkswagen.
In HCM: ABM Industries, AutoZone, Fannie Mae, Fujitsu, Garden Fresh Restaurants, Landmark, Mary Kay, the National Football League, NTT, Raymond James & Associates, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Staples, University of Pittsburgh, the University of Texas System, Vanderbilt and a very large investment bank in New York City who switched vendors to our HCM. Those are just a few representative customers across just a couple of pillars in the quarter.
Lastly, as I mentioned, it was an overall -- a very strong quarter. Bookings, billings and revenue all at record levels. We announced an exciting deal with AT&T, and while it provided no revenue at all in Q4, it's a very strategic win as a reference to all of our customers about the modernization of databases and the movement of them to the cloud.
Looking forward, just a couple of predictions. FY '17 bookings were $2.1 billion. Our pipeline is very large and ARR will be higher in FY '18. I do expect our application ecosystem of on-premise, that would include licenses and support and SaaS, will grow roughly 10% next year. With revenue now at an annualized run rate of $6 billion and a growth rate of 66%, we're clearly the fastest-growing cloud company at scale.
With that, we'll take your questions."

So again, the attach rate between apps and PaaS continues to strengthen. ERP, we had 868 new customers. Now, by the way, Kirk, that doesn't include NetSuite, so that's just inside the traditional Oracle ERP business. We had almost 200 expansions. That's a big deal because as we start to sell, in many cases, financials, we're now being able to sell supply chain, procurement and manufacturing into that base as well. Another good thing for us in the quarter is roughly 2/3 of the new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before. So again, this is again 66%, 65% brand-new logos to Oracle. So HCM, we had about 325, 326 new customers and 300 expansions. A little over 600 in marketing, sales and service and about 670 expansions. So sort of all in, we have now about 13,550 customers in our SaaS active base. If you do include NetSuite, that number gets to 25,000. About 75% of everything we did in the quarter was Fusion.

In fact, what you should see, as this goes on, is we will have less drag from the transition and the base will continue to grow. And so this should really accelerate. And understand that in our PaaS-IaaS business, we're not even at scale. So as we really scale that up, profitability is going to increase more quickly and revenues will be built on the base of another recurring revenue -- of the recurring revenue business. So we've been basically turning and we've had the drag of the move away from our historic business, to some extent, and revenue recognition that's not upfront but ratable. Then all of a sudden, you're going to see less of a drag as that side of the business is smaller compared to our cloud business. So we're obviously very optimistic. We indicated to you all during last year, this past year, that this thing was coming, and it has clearly come in Q4. And this next year and years after that are now going to be building on that base."

I mean, these are big, big customers. And, Sarah, those are just HCM. So those are obviously big -- very big scale customers. Now that said, in ERP, you're very -- you're right in what you said. I mean, we have a lot of mid-market -- upper mid-market wins and a lot of new logos to Oracle who were not doing business with Oracle before they made this acquisition. And that's certainly been a fantastic strength. I mean, our cloud is made up of a lot of new logos in addition to some existing customers. Now in terms of scaled ERP customers though, I mean, Orange is -- they're using financials, procurement, projects, supply chain management; GE Digital, Qualcomm, Hearst, Tesco, Caesars. I mean, these are just sort of off the top of my head. So these are big-scaled ERP customers. Now to Larry's point, and I'll make it a little bit about HCM and ERP, the TAM in ERP is materially bigger than the TAM in HCM. So the TAM in ERP is 3x to 4x bigger in ERP. And additionally, ERP drags HCM or can drag HCM in the transaction. So these big ERP references that we have, and obviously with the number we closed in Q4 and are going live now every quarter, more to come. We've seen increasing pull of HCM in these big ERP transactions, and they are true in the mid-market and in the upmarket. I hope that helps."

Did AT&T give us any incremental revenue in Q4? No. So is this deal ratable over time? Yes. Is it a long-term agreement? Yes. It's a very long-term agreement. Let me try to give you a little bit more color. First, it is a long-term deal. AT&T has over 10,000 Oracle databases. They have several hundred -- and you might say, John, that's a small percent of their overall databases, but they have several hundred large databases that have 70%, 75% of all of their company's data. They badly wanted to get the benefits of cloud, provisioning, auto provisioning and all the  features that come with the product, modernization, consolidation of that infrastructure. Yet in many cases, they've got regulatory pressures on what they can put in the public cloud and what they can't. This is an example where we've talked about this before. We take our Oracle Cloud machine and we are able now to do all of that with them on their premise and give them all the benefits of the cloud. We manage. We patch. We basically run the cloud for them and we help them get all of that done. And so as great a deal as this is, this is even a bigger deal, John, in what it represents for our entire customer base. This is a bigger deal to us than the transaction. It is the opportunity for us to now do this for hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of customers. The opportunity for us in the quarter -- and the reason we put the press release out was AT&T being so effusive about their opportunity now and what it meant for them internal to AT&T. But it's just, if not, more important for us in what we can do for all of our customers. Just to give you a little bit more data, not in any of our hardware numbers, is we did in excess of 100 Oracle Cloud machines in the quarter, which are again us bringing all of the capabilities of our public cloud to our customers in their data center. So that's some details, although not the financial details of the deal. But frankly, John, I think it's just as important what it means to our customers going forward on a bigger picture level."

The old IaaS was, as you know, a slower growing business. Our Gen2 IaaS, much faster. PaaS, much faster. As it gets -- sort of completely overwhelms the base of our old IaaS, you're going to see acceleration. You must see acceleration because it is inevitable as we do more and more transactions and bookings, which turn into revenues as people bring their Oracle licenses, their Oracle workloads to us. So you're going to see that's a very big area. Now as far as margins, remember, in our PaaS business or our IaaS business, the system itself is the same. However, what you see though is that there's enormous value in both our automation and in our technology, whether it's the different pieces of software that are in there. And depending on the mix, the margin can be extremely high. We have always -- it's still the Oracle you know in that we watch every nickel around here. And we all sign off on every data center expansion and all the hardware that goes in it. So we really are very, very careful on not getting too far ahead of our revenues, but also benefiting from massive economies of scale. This past year, we did a lot of build-out for which the revenue has not been showing up yet in the financial statement. But it will be. So depending on how the different pieces roll in, we expect margins -- by the time it's the end of the year, we expect even PaaS, IaaS margins to be better.

The -- we don't ship -- [ CD, ] we don't ship computers to any of our data centers until we have pretty firm orders for capacity. We're honestly measuring how much our data centers are used. As our data centers reach, let's say, I'll pick a number, 75%, 80% utilization, we get to some threshold, then we start to replenish and add compute and storage capacity to the data centers. It's a just-in-time system. Those components that grow and go to Frankfurt or go to London or go to Singapore or go to any of our data centers around the world. But we do it in such a way that once we ship, we know that we're going to have a very, very high utilization rate in our data centers. And with the just-in-time shipments, and we only ship when they cross something like a 75% or 80% utilization at that data center. So we don't have a lot of unused capacity. So if -- let's just say, if our CapEx was double what Safra forecasts next year, that's great news because then our PaaS revenues and Infrastructure revenues would be much higher and make up for it with much higher profit.

So as you guys know, as I told you, we spent quite a bit of money on NetSuite and so I needed to pay that back. And I've got a couple quarters of still paying that back. And as a general matter, we like to buy back quite a lot of our stock, significantly more than at the $500 million a quarter that we've been on since we bought NetSuite. So once I've paid all that back, assuming that I don't buy anything else big, I expect that we will do what we always do, which is send the money back to you all because it's your money. And so we will buy out your partners and so share repurchases should go up. However, our stock price is going up also so we may be spending more. But lucky us, lucky all of us, the stock price is going up, which means sometimes I will get less shares. So once I've paid back NetSuite, I do expect to spend more than $500 million a quarter, assuming I don't buy anything else and -- anything else really significant. And -- but I don't know how many shares I'll get back because, of course, I don't know what the stock price will be at that time."

Well, all of it's baked into our view, so there's no new news here. So let me flip the metric on you. If 65%, which is not an uncommon number we've given you over the past several quarters, is coming from net new logos, then the flip of that is 35%",501,"Okay. Well, all of it's baked into our view, so there's no new news here. So let me flip the metric on you. If 65%, which is not an uncommon number we've given you over the past several quarters, is coming from net new logos, then the flip of that is 35% is coming from our existing base. So we have seen our existing base move. They just, to your point, moved slower than what the new logos have. I actually think this is a good thing because I believe that we will get all of our existing customers on-prem, roughly speaking, moving to our cloud infrastructure over time. Now in addition, when we do move, and I want to make sure I'm clear and say it again, because we now have a lot more data than I would've had 2 years ago, when a customer who's on-prem paying us support moves to the cloud, they pay us more money. They don't pay us 1:1, they don't pay us 2:1, they pay us more like 3:1. In some cases, more than 3:1. In some cases, we also get the attach of platform, so the SaaS that we get as well, and that is not included in the 3:1 that I'm giving you. So we are actually very positive about the fact that if people move from our application support to our SaaS revenue, we get more money. And to Safra's point about what's going on with our gross margins, we now produce better performance at the bottom line because we get more revenue at a very high margin rate. So I expect that to continue. As we get more references, Mark, in ERP, et cetera, you're going to see that accelerate. We want that to accelerate and that acceleration is a good thing for our customers, and it's a good thing for Oracle shareholders. Now the reason we made the deal that we made, a big deal we made over AT&T, is because of the implication that has on our database business. That is a -- and Safra couldn't have said it better, this is now a customer who is now a reference in the public domain explaining why. And now, I think you will see that same migration as time goes on. We have more customers like them who are in the middle of the process of moving now. And I gave you an example of how much infrastructure was bought in Q4 of Oracle cloud machines just as -- that is one surrogate for what's happening. And if that occurs, we will get more revenue as well and I predict we will be able to deliver higher levels of service, more functionality, more capability, more modernization as we do it. So I think you've begun to see it in the application business. We love what we see in the applications business so far. And I think you're at the beginning of seeing it in the database business as well."

Customer adoption of our",923,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can see, we had another good quarter. Customer adoption of our cloud products and services continue to be very, very strong, and our on-premise business remains very resilient. The result was that total revenue were at the high end of my guidance, and earnings per share beat my guidance by $0.01.
Today, I'm going to do what I always do, which is use constant dollar growth rate on this call so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. The effects of currency movements in Q1 were a little better than expected with a 1% tailwind to total revenue. Total cloud and software revenue were $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency and 9% in U.S. dollars. GAAP applications total revenue were $2.6 billion, up 17%, and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenue were $4.7 billion, up 3%.
Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 61% from last year. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 28% from last year. As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded. The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 67%, up from 59% last Q1. We expect to see further improvement in FY '18 and remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins, possibly as soon as sometime in FY '19. 
The gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 44%, down 58 -- down from 58% last quarter as our geographic build-out goes forward in response to demand but ahead of the bulk of new revenue recognition. When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in PaaS and IaaS gross margin.
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 51% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $5.9 billion, up 1% from last year, reflecting continued high attach of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of on-premise customers. Hardware revenues were $943 million, down 6%, and services revenue were $860 million, up 5%. Total revenue for the company were $9.2 billion, up 6% from last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 10% from last year. And it's been a while since we last reported double-digit operating income growth as we undertook the cloud transformation that affected our income statement, trading upfront -- on upfront revenue recognition of on-premise license revenue for recurring subscription cloud revenue. With cloud now in larger and more predictable share of the revenue mix, I expect that we'll see additional strong operating income growth. The operating margin was 41%, which was up from 39% last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 25%, which was over 1 point higher than my guidance, negatively impacting EPS by $0.01 or so, and EPS was still up 12% in USD and 11% in CD to $0.62. The GAAP tax rate was 14.5% and GAAP EPS was up 19% to $0.62 in U.S. dollars.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.8 billion, up 8%, and free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.6 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $473 million. I expect that cloud CapEx spending will be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS, IaaS build-out that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, should we see higher-than-expected ARR growth, we'd expect to see higher CapEx investments as well.
We now have nearly $67 billion in cash and marketable securities, but net of our debt, our cash position is about $13.6 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $10.3 billion, up 9% in U.S. dollars.
As we said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares for a total of nearly $500 million. We're currently planning on bringing that rate up significantly for Q2.
Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 46.6 million shares for a total of $2 billion, and we also paid out dividends of $2.8 billion. The Oracle Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.
Now to the guidance, and I'm going to give you guidance for Q2, and my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. However, there has been some currency movement, and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue and $0.02 positive on EPS.
So here we go, Q2. Cloud revenues -- remember, these are constant currency numbers so you're going to be adjusting them for U.S. dollars. Cloud revenues, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, are expected to grow 39% to 43%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.64 and $0.68, up from $0.61 last Q2. That puts the USD number in the range between $0.66 and $0.70 at today's exchange rates. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere between 23.5% and 25.5%. Of course, as usual, tax rate could end up being different as it was this quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

In USD, total revenue was up 7%, operating income was up 11% and EPS up 12%. In cloud bookings, it was a strong quarter. Overall growth was above 40%. That was an acceleration from our growth rate last year. By the way, all numbers are in CD unless I say otherwise. Cloud revenue up 51% now at a $6 billion annual run rate. 80% of our TTM, trailing 12-month, Software and Cloud revenue is now recurring. 
Now I'm going to give you some SaaS revenue numbers by pillar. We're up 61%, as Safra said, accelerating from 55% growth last year. ERP was up 90% organically. Overall ERP is now over $1.3 billion annualized run rate. Fusion HCM up 109%, more than double the growth rate of Workday. 
CX, all of our category sales, marketing and service were up double digits organically. as a service was up 53%. The business is now over $0.5 billion annualized run rate. Our verticals are up 20%. And compare, by the way, of 115% growth last year. And as good as all these SaaS numbers are, our application ecosystem, let me go through again what that is, that's our on-premise license, non-premise support and SaaS, was together up 17%. When you look at any industry growth metric of the applications industry, you'll find numbers like 1%, 2%, 3% in the marketplace. The market share gains we have are astounding.
In PaaS infrastructure, our revenue was up 28%. Business analytics were up 130%, integration up 221%. Our database ecosystem, including the same metrics I described earlier, Database as a Service, on-premise support, on-premise license, was up 3% in USD, in line with industry market growth. Storage and compute industry as a service were both up triple digits. Cloud deferred revenue was up 53%. So as I described, it was a solid quarter for us and top line growth of 7% USD and 12 -- in revenue and 12% EPS growth in USD. 
A couple of predictions. I expect Q2 cloud booking growth to be strong or stronger than our Q1 growth rate. Our cloud bookings were executing well on a very big and growing pipeline. We expect the cloud FY '18 full year cloud booking growth to be quite strong. Revenue growth now at an annualized rate of $6 billion, our growth rate of 51%, and we are the fastest-growing cloud company at scale. 
I do want to read off to you a few logos of wins we had in the quarter, just to give you some context for some of the companies that we're selling product to and I'll just mention a few. But in HCM, this is HCM Cloud SaaS: 7-Eleven, Aon, Group, Baptist Health of South Florida, Cantor Fitzgerald, China State Construction Engineering Corporation, Cook County, Habitat for Humanity, Liberty Mutual Insurance, state of Nebraska, Supervalu, The Southern Company, an unnamed large financial services firm in New York. That's also different from the large unnamed financial services firm we sell to in Q4. 
Just a few ERP names: Advanced Auto Parts, Adeo, Coach, Aerostar International, GlaxoSmithKline, Gruppo, Hilton, Honda Motor, Modine Manufacturing, Nestlé, Tata Communications, United States Steel, World Fuel Services Corp, I could go on. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

On October 1 at Oracle OpenWorld, we'll announce the next generation of the Oracle Database. When we deliver it by the end of this calendar year, Oracle will become the world's first fully autonomous database. 
Based on machine learning, this new version of Oracle is totally automated, a self-driving system that does not require a human being of either to manage the database or tune the database. artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error, enables Oracle to deliver unprecedented reliability in the cloud. 
We will be authoring public cloud SLAs, service level agreements, for the Oracle Database that guarantee 99.995% systems availability time. 99.995% availability means less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year. To achieve that level of reliability, Oracle has to automatically tune, patch and upgrade itself while the system is running. AWS can't do any of this stuff. 
But perhaps the most interesting aspect of autonomous systems like self-driving cars and our new self-driving database, are the economics that surround total automation. Self-driving cars eliminate the labor cost of driving plus the high cost associated with human driving errors. Self-driving database eliminates the labor cost of tuning, managing and upgrading the database, thus avoiding all of the costly downtime associated with human error. 
Self-driving taxis are much cheaper to operate than taxis with human drivers. Running Oracle's autonomous database is much, much cheaper than running traditional human-driven databases like Amazon's Redshift. Customers moving from Amazon's Redshift to Oracle's autonomous databases can expect to cut their costs in half or more. And Oracle will be providing SLAs that guarantee those cost savings to customers that move."

But your question to your point that when you can come out with references like we have publicly with Bank of America, AT&T and others, it makes the next opportunity easy when you can reference customers at that level. So I think again, and we said this before but it probably bears saying again, that this sort of every aspect of selling in the cloud, I think, the company holistically is getting better at. We're better -- our products are better, our sales force is better, our ability to implement is better, our ability to do all of these things has just continued to improve quarter by quarter by quarter, and it manifests itself in the type of results we're talking about this afternoon."

As we move our application customers from on-prem to cloud, we're asking them to migrate from the E-Business Suite to Fusion. As they move from our HR or asking them migrate from Oracle HR or PeopleSoft HR to Fusion HR in the cloud. So they're really changing applications. In the case of our technology business, where you're running the Oracle Database on-prem, we're just asking you to look to move your data into our cloud. There really is no technology transition at all. So you really can't look at these transitions as being similar things. The interesting thing, it's very difficult but let's say, Microsoft. Microsoft, they took their existing Microsoft Office customers and moved them to the cloud, so you suddenly can save documents in the cloud, Word documents or Excel documents, you moved them to the cloud. That's what they meant by Office 365. That's very close to our database business, where we're just beginning to move them to the cloud. That's just taking existing applications. Actually, the new version of our database, as I mentioned, is greatly enhanced in the cloud and there's real motives to move it from on-prem into the cloud. We have lots and lots of benefit but it's not a technology change. In our apps transition, you actually move to a whole new technology stack. It looks like almost moving to a new vendor, if you will. You move from Oracle E-Business Suite or PeopleSoft Financials and JD Edwards, all of these on-prem customers that we have is on-prem business we have and you move to Fusion Financial. That was a -- that required a new implementation, retraining your people and we did that. But that transition, as Mark just said, is just beginning. Most of our Fusion ERP customers, our Fusion HCM customers are new logos. And we don't expect when people move from their database from on-prem in the cloud, we don't expect support to go away. We expect them just to bring their licenses into our cloud. And they're paying support, you have the license, you own the license. Now you run it in our cloud and you pay us additionally for in our cloud just when we move the Oracle Database and the Amazon Cloud you pay them additionally. So it is simply lifting up your existing license. Therefore, you keep paying support, you keep paying support. And you add on to that. Infrastructure as a Service or Platform as a Service fees associated with running it in our cloud. So we think that's a much easier transition for us than the transition we're making on the apps side of the business. And look how well the transition on the apps side of the business is going."

We had another acceleration just in terms of logos. We had acceleration of ERP logos this Q1 versus last Q1. So we had more closures in terms of numbers of accounts and we have bigger companies looking. So it's significant to the point of your question. We also have more modules coming out live. So if you look at what we've got in ERP now, we have more localizations across more geographies. And we now have our full suite of ERP, supply chain, procurement, manufacturing, now budget and planning all available. So it's the full suite now across almost all of our geographies. What -- to Larry's point, I think it's worth stating, a lot of our ERP customers now are new logos. Lots of new financials customers and lots of companies that, to be very blunt with you, Kirk, we would never have sold to 5 or 6 years ago. Companies that are really -- when you come to Oracle Open World, you'll see another string of customers who never had an Oracle application before until they bought Oracle financials in the cloud. So it's that. Then in addition to that, I think what really helps us is the fact that we are the only suite provider. So the fact that now a company, instead of having a bunch of point solutions, can have a suite of applications and the opportunity for us to now bring HCM and ERP together to a customer, gives us an incredible advantage across basically all of our customers. So you see now in the names I've read off to you, lots of what I would call high-end mid-market, low-end enterprise customers that are really the common persona of who we sell too, most of them new logos. I think you'll see that continue as we go forward. The best news I can give you is that when we start to bring our larger customers over, Oracle will get materially more revenue as we move that support because we do everything for them. We do the hardware, we do the operating system, we do -- it's our data center. We do really everything for them and we get the extra revenue as a result of that."

The reason we can lower costs is we just automate more. There's a big difference between -- what Amazon basically does, what they pioneered was this notion of we will rank you based on what you use, compute and storage, and you can kind of bring whatever -- and they offer a couple of databases. They offer Aurora, which is MySQL, their version of MySQL. And they offer Redshift, which is another -- their version of an Open Source database. They've made some changes to it. It's no longer Open Source, it's from Amazon [indiscernible] queries and OLTP. But these are technologies that are not automated. These are, if you will, old-fashioned technologies in a newfangled cloud data center and available for rental. So it's kind of an interesting new business model but their database technologies are not very advanced at all. They just picked them up off of Open Source. And our database, especially the latest generation of our database, totally automates everything. So you don't -- you push a button, load your data and you're done. You don't have lots of tuning parameters and lots of things to set up like you do with Amazon. Amazon requires a lot of labor to set up an online transaction processing system based on Aurora. That's a lot of labor. It's MySQL, it's kind of our -- it's code that we maintain. We know it very, very well. Very different than Oracle. You press a button, load your data, run your analytics. It tunes itself, it backs itself up, it patches itself. It never goes down. And it's much, much, much faster. Now I keep saying much, much, much faster and then someone says, ""Well, we don't need that speed."" Well, let me translate. If it's much, much, much faster, in other words, if it does in 1 hour what Redshift does in 10 hours, it's 1/10 the cost of running at Amazon because we charge the same amount per hour. So we take out the labor costs. And because we consume less CPU and we compress the data and we consume less storage, it's much -- we're much more frugal about using compute and storage resources and we eliminate the labor cost and the associate -- the costs associated with human error. So the -- we're not even trying to do the same thing as Amazon."

You know about all those with multi-tenant within memory, et cetera. Obviously, our security options are very important, given the world that we live in today. We have a desire for many of our customers to get out of all its work, to get out of patching, to look at modernizing their infrastructure. You may have heard what AT&T talked about. They'll also be at Oracle Open World and you'll hear a lot more directly from them. But the need to not just consolidate, not just get the new features to modernize those applications but to get out of all this work, the point Larry just describing about now the fact that I can't deal with the amount of time it takes to patch all of these hybrid environments that I've got. Now somebody -- Oracle is going to do that for me. They're going modernize the database give me all these features but take all that work off of my shoulders. So there's a tremendous amount of this. Now to Larry's other point, remember, most of our customers, I'll stick with someone like AT&T, they have over 10,000 Oracle databases in that company, 10,000. So you're going to have a handful of those big ones move to the cloud. There's still going to be quite a few of those that stay on-premise for a period of time.

And now we're closing in on the $80 so much so that I actually went ahead and gave you sometime next year for that hitting. PaaS and IaaS are very much, at least at this point, in the expansion period. We expect this to be a very large business that we remain very conscious of the margins. And so we're trying not to invest too much ahead of revenue recognition. But as you see in this quarter alone, we have a lot that have yet to be deployed, fully deployed even though fully provisioned even though the equipment is all bought and being capitalized. So this is really -- I can't give you an exact time because we're going to be very much monitoring demand and reacting to that.

I mean, everything from at the very highest level to in our HR systems, our recruiting systems to look at a bunch of candidates and kind of inspect the data of people that this company has hired that have been very successful and people who have been less successful, so we can actually start to bucket the candidates. This group -- these 200 people you're looking at hiring and the 50 over here look very much like the 50 people that you hired over the last 5 years that have been enormously successful for the company. And that's machine learning -- using machine learning just look at the profile of individual, companies hired over a period of time and make recommendations of who -- how to prioritize candidates that goal [indiscernible] looking at making offers to. All the way from that level to our new security systems, which are going in now, where we're doing log inspection, where we're looking at people. And the logs we look at, unlike anybody else, we are in the applications business, we are in the database business, and we're in the cloud infrastructure business looking at network logs and operating system logs and storage hardware logs. We're also looking at database logs. We're looking at people trying to log onto applications systems with passwords they're using. We have all of these logs. And we're processing all of these logs in our cloud to, for example, looking -- trying to find people who are going to attack a database and steal passwords and steal data. And we think we do this better than anybody because we look at more data. We look at application data. In other words, we certainly know that there are CFOs in the Ukraine trying to log on 50,000 times in the middle of the night. Maybe your CFO is not vacationing in the Ukraine and that's not her. And there could be a problem someone's trying to break in. We look at that level of data all the way down to IP addresses that are strange IP addresses trying to figure out look at SQL. Anyway, we do much -- we look at 10x more log information than someone like a Splunk, who is inspecting IP addresses but not log-in information. So we get a much bigger picture of all the activity of what's going on inside your data center and use machine learning to inspect this vast amount of data and see if someone's in the reconnaissance phase of prior to an attack where we can shut them off while they're just looking around before they actually attack anything and start stealing passwords and starts stealing data. Again, that's also all machine learning. We're offering that technology again in Open World. We're offering the customers can shift their logs from their data center and into our cloud. And we'll do all of that security reconnaissance and security work for them. And the more of this information we have, the better equipped we are to find malware. You find malware showing up in, let's say, Germany. And we know what it looks like in. And suddenly, we have worldwide alerts because worldwide alerts to recognize that malware that show up in California or at -- and as we know, there's a lot of -- security is getting more and more important these days. The event that Equifax, very unfortunate event at Equifax is not going to be an isolated incident. You're going to see more and more things like this. You saw it as a government officer personal management, which was disastrous for our intelligence community. We've got to do a better job. We've got to do a better job of securing not only our cloud but our customers' data centers, getting all of that log data, using machine learning to -- and basically, what is a cyber war that's going to be ongoing for a long, long time. So everything from helping companies using AI to help companies hire the right people, to helping data centers, both private data centers and public data centers, protect against intrusions. It's an important new technology and it's at the center of what we're doing with database automation, security and our applications."

Customer adoption of our",935,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can see, we had another good quarter. Customer adoption of our cloud products and services continue to be very, very strong, and our on-premise business remains very resilient. The result was that total revenue were at the high end of my guidance, and earnings per share beat my guidance by $0.01.
Today, I'm going to do what I always do, which is use constant dollar growth rates on this call, so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. The effects of currency movements in Q1 were a little better than expected with a 1% tailwind to total revenue. Total cloud and software revenue were $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency and 9% in U.S. dollars. GAAP applications total revenue were $2.6 billion, up 17%, and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenue were $4.7 billion, up 3%.
Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 61% (sic) [ 62% ] from last year. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 28% from last year. As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded. The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 67%, up from 59% last Q1. We expect to see further improvement in FY '18 and remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins, possibly as soon as sometime in FY '19.
The gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 44%, down 58% -- down from 58% last quarter as our geographic build-out goes forward in response to demand but ahead of the bulk of the revenue recognition. When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in PaaS and IaaS gross margin.
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 51% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $5.9 billion, up 1% from last year, reflecting continued high attach of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of on-premise customers. Hardware revenues were $943 million, down 6%, and services revenue were $860 million, up 5%. Total revenue for the company were $9.2 billion, up 6% (sic) [ 7% ] from last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 10% (sic) [ 11% ] from last year, and it's been a while since we last reported double-digit operating income growth as we undertook the cloud transformation that affected our income statement, trading upfront -- on upfront revenue recognition of on-premise license revenue for recurring subscription cloud revenue. With cloud now in larger and more predictable share of the revenue mix, I expect that we'll see additional strong operating income growth. The operating margin was 41%, which was up from 39% last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 25%, which was over 1 point higher than my guidance, negatively impacting EPS by $0.01 or so, and EPS was still up 12% in USD and 11% in CD to $0.62. The GAAP tax rate was 14.5%, and GAAP EPS was up 19% to $0.52 in U.S. dollars.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.8 billion, up 8%, and free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.6 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $473 million. I expect that cloud CapEx spending will be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS, IaaS build-out that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, should we see higher-than-expected ARR growth, we'd expect to see higher CapEx investments as well.
We now have nearly $67 billion in cash and marketable securities, but net of our debt, our cash position is about $13.6 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $10.3 billion, up 9% in U.S. dollars.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares for a total of nearly $500 million. We're currently planning on bringing that rate up significantly for Q2. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 46.6 million shares for a total of $2 billion, and we also paid out dividends of $2.8 billion. The Oracle Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.
Now to the guidance. And I'm going to give you guidance for Q2, and my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. However, there has been some currency movement, and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue and $0.02 positive on EPS.
So here we go, Q2. Cloud revenues -- remember, these are constant currency numbers, so you're going to be adjusting them for U.S. dollars. Cloud revenues, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, are expected to grow 39% to 43%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.64 and $0.68, up from $0.61 last Q2. That puts the USD number in the range between $0.66 and $0.70 at today's exchange rates. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere between 23.5% and 25.5%. Of course, as usual, tax rate could end up being different as it was this quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

Operating income was up 11% and EPS up 12%. In cloud bookings, it was a strong quarter. Overall growth was above 40%. That was an acceleration from our growth rate last year. By the way, all numbers are in CD unless I say otherwise. Cloud revenue up 51% now at a $6 billion annual run rate. 80% of our TTM, trailing 12-month, software and cloud revenue is now recurring.
Now I'm going to give you some SaaS revenue numbers by pillar. We're up 61%, as Safra said, accelerating from 55% growth last year. ERP was up 90% organically. Overall ERP is now over $1.3 billion annualized run rate. Fusion HCM, up 109%, more than double the growth rate of Workday. CX, all of our category sales, marketing and service were up double digits organically. Data as a service was up 53%. The business is now over $0.5 billion annualized run rate. Our verticals are up 20% on a compare, by the way, of 115% growth last year.
And as good as all these SaaS numbers are, our application ecosystem -- let me go through again what that is. That's our on-premise license, on-premise support and SaaS -- was together up 17%. When you look at any industry growth metric of the applications industry, you'll find numbers like 1%, 2%, 3% in the marketplace. The market share gains we have are astounding.
In PaaS infrastructure, our revenue was up 28%. Business analytics were up 130%, data integration up 221%. Our database ecosystem, including the same metrics I described earlier, Database as a Service, on-premise support, on-premise license, was up 3% in USD in line with industry market growth. Storage and compute industry as a service were both up triple digits. Cloud deferred revenue was up 53%. So as I described, it was a solid quarter for us on top line growth of 7% USD in 12 -- in revenue and 12% EPS growth in USD.
A couple of predictions. I expect Q2 cloud booking growth to be strong or stronger than our Q1 growth rate. Our cloud bookings were executing well on a very big and growing pipeline. We expect the cloud FY '18 full year cloud booking growth to be quite strong. Revenue growth now at an annualized rate of $6 billion or growth rate of 51%, and we are the fastest growing cloud company at scale.
I do want to read off to you a few logos of wins we had in the quarter just to give you some context for some of the companies that we're selling product to, and I'll just mention a few. But in HCM, this is HCM Cloud SaaS: 7-Eleven, Aon, [ Aries ] Group, Baptist Health of South Florida, Cantor Fitzgerald, China State Construction Engineering Corporation, Cook County, [ eBolt ], Habitat for Humanity, Liberty Mutual Insurance, state of Nebraska, SUPERVALU, the Southern Company, an unnamed large financial services firm in New York. That's also different from the large unnamed financial services firm we sell to in Q4. Just a few ERP names: Advance Auto Parts, ADEO, Coach, Eurostar International, GlaxoSmithKline, Grupo Bimbo, Hilton, Honda Motor, Modine Manufacturing, Nestlé, Tata Communications, United States Steel, World Fuel Services Corp. I could go on.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

On October 1 at Oracle OpenWorld, we'll announce the next generation of the Oracle Database. When we deliver it by the end of this calendar year, Oracle will become the world's first fully autonomous database.
Based on machine learning, this new version of Oracle is totally automated self-driving system that does not require a human being either to manage the database or tune the database. Using artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error enables Oracle to deliver unprecedented reliability in the cloud.  We will be authoring public cloud SLAs, service level agreements, for the Oracle Database that guarantee 99.995% systems availability time. 99.995% availability means less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year. To achieve that level of reliability, Oracle has to automatically tune, patch and upgrade itself while the system is running. AWS can't do any of this stuff.
But perhaps the most interesting aspect of autonomous systems like self-driving cars and our new self-driving database are the economics that surround total automation. Self-driving cars eliminate the labor cost of driving plus the high cost associated with human driving errors. Self-driving database eliminates the labor cost of tuning, managing and upgrading the database, thus, avoiding all of the costly downtime associated with human error.
Self-driving taxis are much cheaper to operate than taxis with human drivers. Running Oracle's autonomous database is much, much cheaper than running traditional human-driven databases like Amazon's Redshift. Customers moving from Amazon's Redshift to Oracle's autonomous databases can expect to cut their cost in half or more, and Oracle will be providing SLAs that guarantee those cost savings to customers that move."

So I think, again -- and we said this before, but it probably bears saying again that just sort of every aspect of selling in the cloud, I think the company holistically is getting better at.

So we're seeing our best growth in technology that we've developed internally. Our Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM, which is the mid-market and the high-end of ERP and the mid-market and high end of HCM, these are all internally developed systems. They're -- HCM and ERP, I think, blended rate is growing triple digits. The size of these markets are enormous, and we think we'll be able to ride that horse, pursue that organic growth and meet our targets. So I think it's going to primarily come from internally developed technologies, the growth of those technologies and us gaining dramatic amounts of share and applications in the cloud and with our new autonomous database also and Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service. We have to get all cylinders firing, but the bulk of our technologies that will determine our success, things like our Database and our Fusion Applications suite, all organically internally developed."

As we move our application customers from on-prem to cloud, we're asking them to migrate from the E-Business Suite to Fusion. As they move from our HR, we're asking them migrate from Oracle HR or PeopleSoft HR to Fusion HR in the cloud. So they're really changing applications. In the case of our technology business, where you're running the Oracle Database on-prem, we're just asking you to look to move your data into our cloud. There really is no technology transition at all. So you really can't look at these transitions as being similar things. The interesting thing, it's very different than, let's say, Microsoft. Microsoft, they took their existing Microsoft Office customers and moved them to the cloud, so you suddenly can save documents in the cloud, Word documents or Excel documents. You move them to the cloud. That's what's meant by Office 365. That's very close to our Database business, where we're just beginning to move them to the cloud. That's just taking existing applications. Actually, the new version of our database, as I mentioned, is greatly enhanced in the cloud and there's real motives to move it from on-prem into the cloud. You get lots and lots of benefits, but it's not a technology change. In our apps transition, you actually move to a whole new technology stack. It looks like almost moving to a new vendor if you will. You move from Oracle E-Business Suite or PeopleSoft Financials and JD Edwards, all of these on-prem customers that we have is on-prem business we have, and you move to Fusion Financial. That was a -- that required a new implementation, retraining your people, and we did that. But we -- that transition, as Mark just said, is just beginning. Most of our Fusion ERP customers, our Fusion HCM customers are new logos. And we don't expect, when people move from their database from on-prem in the cloud, we don't expect support to go away. We expect them just to bring their licenses into our cloud. And you're paying support. You have the license. You own the license. Now you run it in our cloud, and you pay us additionally for running in our cloud just like when you move the Oracle Database in the Amazon Cloud, you pay them additionally. So it is simply lifting up your existing license. Therefore, you keep paying support. You keep paying support, and you add on to that. You -- Infrastructure as a Service or Platform as a Service fees associated with running it in our cloud. So we think that's a much easier transition for us than the transition we're making on the apps side of the business. And look how well the transition on the apps side of the business is going."

We had another acceleration just in terms of logos. We had acceleration of ERP logos this Q1 versus last Q1. So we had more closures in terms of numbers of accounts, and we have bigger companies looking. So it's significant to the point of your question. We also have more modules coming online. So if you look at what we've got in ERP now, we have more localizations across more geographies, and we now have our full suite of ERP, supply chain, procurement, manufacturing, now budgeting, planning all available. So it's the full suite now across almost all of our geographies. What -- to Larry's point, I think it's worth stating a lot of our ERP customers now are new logos, lots of new financials customers and lots of companies that, to be very blunt with you, Kirk, we would never have sold to 5 or 6 years ago, companies that are really named -- when you come to Oracle OpenWorld, you'll see another string of customers who never had an Oracle application before until they bought Oracle Financials in the cloud. So it's that. Then, in addition to that, I think what really helps us is the fact that we are the only suite provider. So the fact that now a company, instead of having a bunch of point solutions, can have a suite of applications and the opportunity for us to now bring HCM and ERP together to a customer gives us an incredible advantage across basically all of our customers. So you see now in the names I wrote -- I read off to you lots of what I would call high-end mid-market, low-end enterprise customers that are really the common persona of who we sell to, most of them new logos. I think you'll see that continue as we go forward. The best news I can give you is that as we start to bring our larger customers over, Oracle will get materially more revenue as we move that support because we do everything for them. We do the hardware. We do the operating system. We do -- it's our data center. We do really everything for them, and we get the extra revenue as a result of that."

I guess, they want me to go first. The reason we can lower costs is we just automate more. There's a big difference between -- what Amazon basically does, what they pioneered was this notion of we will rent you based on what you use, compute and storage, and you can kind of bring whatever -- and they offer a couple of databases. They offer Aurora, which is MySQL, their version of MySQL. And they offer Redshift, which is another -- their version of an Open Source database. They had made some changes to it. It's no longer Open Source. It's from Amazon for queries and OLTP. But these are technologies that are not automated. These are, if you will, old-fashioned technologies in a newfangled cloud data center and available for rental. So it's kind of an interesting new business model, but their database technologies are not very advanced at all. They just picked them up out of Open Source. And our database, our -- the new latest -- especially the latest generation of our database, totally automates everything. So you don't -- you push a button, load your data and you're done. You don't have lots of tuning parameters and lots of things to set up like you do with Amazon. Amazon requires a lot of labor to set up an online transaction processing system based on Aurora. That's a lot of labor. It's MySQL. It's kind of our -- it's code that we maintain. We know it very, very well. Very different than Oracle. You press a button, load your data, run your analytics. It tunes itself. It backs itself up. It patches itself. It never goes down. And it's much, much, much faster. Now I keep saying it's much, much, much faster and then someone will say, ""Well, we don't need that speed."" Well, let me translate. If it's much, much, much faster, in other words, if it does in 1 hour what Redshift does in 10 hours, it's 1/10 the cost of running an Amazon because we charge the same amount per hour. So we take out the labor cost. And because we're -- we consume less CPU and we compress the data and we consume less storage, it's much -- we're much more frugal about using compute and storage resources, and we eliminate the labor cost and the associate -- the cost associated with human error. So there is -- we're not even trying to do the same thing as Amazon."

They'll also be at Oracle OpenWorld, and you'll hear a lot more directly from them. But the need to not just consolidate, not just get the new features to modernize those applications but to get out of all this work. To the point Larry's describing about now the fact that I can't deal with the amount of time it takes to patch all these hybrid environments that I've got, now somebody -- Oracle is going to do that for me. You're not going to modernize the database. You're not going to give me all these features, but you're not going to take all that work off my shoulders. So there's a tremendous amount of this. Now to Larry's other point, remember, most of our customers, I'll stick with somebody like AT&T, they have over 10,000 Oracle databases in that company, 10,000. So you're going to have a handful of those big ones move to the cloud. There's still going to be quite a few of those that stay on-premise for a period of time.

And now we're closing in on the $80 so much so that I actually went ahead and gave you sometime next year for that hitting. PaaS and IaaS are very much, at least at this point, in the expansion period. We expect this to be a very large business, though we remain very conscious of the margins. And so we're trying not to invest too much ahead of revenue recognition. But as you see in this quarter alone, we have a lot that has yet to be deployed, fully deployed, even though it's fully provisioned, even though the equipment is all bought and being capitalized. So this is really -- I can't give you an exact time because we're going to be very much monitoring demand and reacting to that. And for us, it's much more important that we expand quickly, of course, mindful of margin dollars, sometimes not as mindful necessarily of any inter-quarter margin percentages.

So think of it as you have a baseline of X and then I get a booking. And then I have a little bit of capacity per booking so to speak. It's not exactly how it works but for the sake of your analytics at how it works. And we know what that increment of capacity is for that booking. And then it's just a question of scale from there. So you take the unused space, and then for each booking, you get so few -- a couple of few cents on the dollar that you have to add for internal capacity and then just becomes the time it takes to get to scale. That's it."

So we can actually start to bucket the candidates. This group -- these 200 people, you're looking at hiring, and the 50 over here look very much like the 50 people that you hired over the last 5 years that have been enormously successful for the company. And that's a matter of machine learning -- using machine learning to just look at the profiles of individuals a company's hired over a period of time and make recommendations of who -- how to prioritize candidates that they're looking at making offers to. All the way from that level to our new security systems, which are going in now, where we're doing log inspection, where we're looking at people. And the logs we look at, unlike anybody else, we are in the applications business. We are in the database business, and we're in the cloud infrastructure business looking at network logs and operating system logs and storage hardware logs. We're also looking at database logs. We're looking at people trying to log on to application systems and the passwords they're using. We have all of these logs, and we're processing all of these logs in our cloud to, for example, looking -- trying to find people who are going to attack a database and steal passwords and steal data. And we think we do this better than anybody because we look at more data. We look at application data. In other words, we suddenly know that your CFO's in the Ukraine trying to log on 50,000 times in the middle of the night. Maybe your CFO is not vacationing in the Ukraine, and that's not her. And there could be a problem. Someone's trying to break in. We look at that level of data all the way down to IP addresses that are strange IP addresses, trying to figure out [indiscernible] we look at strange SQL [ terms ]. Anyway, we do much -- we look at 10x more log information than someone like a Splunk, who is inspecting IP addresses but not log-in information. So we get a much better picture of all the activity of what's going on inside your data center and use machine learning to inspect this vast amount of data and see if someone's in the reconnaissance phase of -- prior to an attack, where we can shut them off while they're just looking around before they actually attack anything and start stealing passwords and starts stealing data. Again, that's also all machine learning. We're offering that technology, again, in OpenWorld. We're offering the customers can shift their logs from their data center and into our cloud. And we'll do all of that security reconnaissance and security work for them. And the more of this information we have, the better equipped we are to find malware. You find malware showing up in, let's say, Germany, and we know what it looks like. And suddenly, we have worldwide alerts because worldwide alerts that -- to recognize that malware if it should show up in California or at a -- and as we know, there's a lot of -- security is getting more and more important these days. The events at Equifax -- very unfortunate events at Equifax is not going to be an isolated incident. You're going to see more and more things like this. You saw it at the government office of personnel management, which was disastrous for our intelligence community. We've got to do a better job. We got to do a better job of securing not only our cloud but our customers' data centers, getting all of that log data, using machine learning to -- and basically, what is a cyber war that's going to be ongoing for a long, long time. So everything from helping companies using AI to help companies hire the right people to helping data centers, both private data centers and public data centers, protect against intrusions. It's an important new technology, and it's at the center of what we're doing with database automation, security and our application."

Customer adoption of our",935,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can see, we had another good quarter. Customer adoption of our cloud products and services continue to be very, very strong, and our on-premise business remains very resilient. The result was that total revenue were at the high end of my guidance, and earnings per share beat my guidance by $0.01.
Today, I'm going to do what I always do, which is use constant dollar growth rates on this call, so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. The effects of currency movements in Q1 were a little better than expected with a 1% tailwind to total revenue. Total cloud and software revenue were $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency and 9% in U.S. dollars. GAAP applications total revenue were $2.6 billion, up 17%, and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenue were $4.7 billion, up 3%.
Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 61% (sic) [ 62% ] from last year. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 28% from last year. As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded. The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 67%, up from 59% last Q1. We expect to see further improvement in FY '18 and remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins, possibly as soon as sometime in FY '19.
The gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 44%, down 58% -- down from 58% last quarter as our geographic build-out goes forward in response to demand but ahead of the bulk of new revenue recognition. When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in PaaS and IaaS gross margin.
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 51% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $5.9 billion, up 1% from last year, reflecting continued high attach of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of on-premise customers. Hardware revenues were $943 million, down 6%, and services revenue were $860 million, up 5%. Total revenue for the company were $9.2 billion, up 6% (sic) [ 7% ] from last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 10% (sic) [ 11% ] from last year, and it's been a while since we last reported double-digit operating income growth as we undertook the cloud transformation that affected our income statement, trading upfront -- on upfront revenue recognition of on-premise license revenue for recurring subscription cloud revenue. With cloud now a larger and more predictable share of the revenue mix, I expect that we'll see additional strong operating income growth. The operating margin was 41%, which was up from 39% last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 25%, which was over 1 point higher than my guidance, negatively impacting EPS by $0.01 or so, and EPS was still up 12% in USD and 11% in CD to $0.62. The GAAP tax rate was 14.5%, and GAAP EPS was up 19% to $0.52 in U.S. dollars.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.8 billion, up 8%, and free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.6 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $473 million. I expect that cloud CapEx spending will be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS, IaaS build-out that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, should we see higher-than-expected ARR growth, we'd expect to see higher CapEx investments as well.
We now have nearly $67 billion in cash and marketable securities, but net of our debt, our cash position is about $13.6 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $10.3 billion, up 9% in U.S. dollars.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares for a total of nearly $500 million. We're currently planning on bringing that rate up significantly for Q2. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 46.6 million shares for a total of $2 billion, and we also paid out dividends of $2.8 billion. The Oracle Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.
Now to the guidance. And I'm going to give you guidance for Q2, and my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. However, there has been some currency movement, and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue and $0.02 positive on EPS.
So here we go, Q2. Cloud revenues -- remember, these are constant currency numbers, so you're going to be adjusting them for U.S. dollars. Cloud revenues, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, are expected to grow 39% to 43%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.64 and $0.68, up from $0.61 last Q2. That puts the USD number in the range between $0.66 and $0.70 at today's exchange rates. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere between 23.5% and 25.5%. Of course, as usual, tax rate could end up being different as it was this quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

Operating income was up 11% and EPS up 12%. In cloud bookings, it was a strong quarter. Overall growth was above 40%. That was an acceleration from our growth rate last year. By the way, all numbers are in CD unless I say otherwise. Cloud revenue up 51% now at a $6 billion annual run rate. 80% of our TTM, trailing 12-month, software and cloud revenue is now recurring.
Now I'm going to give you some SaaS revenue numbers by pillar. We're up 61%, as Safra said, accelerating from 55% growth last year. ERP was up 90% organically. Overall ERP is now over $1.3 billion annualized run rate. Fusion HCM, up 109%, more than double the growth rate of Workday. [ CX, ] all of our category sales, marketing and service were up double digits organically. Data as a service was up 53%. The business is now over $0.5 billion annualized run rate. Our verticals are up 20% on a compare, by the way, of 115% growth last year.
And as good as all these SaaS numbers are, our application ecosystem -- let me go through again what that is. That's our on-premise license, on-premise support and SaaS -- was together up 17%. When you look at any industry growth metric of the applications industry, you'll find numbers like 1%, 2%, 3% in the marketplace. The market share gains we have are astounding.
In PaaS infrastructure, our revenue was up 28%. Business analytics were up 130%, data integration up 221%. Our database ecosystem, including the same metrics I described earlier, Database as a Service, on-premise support, on-premise license, was up 3% in USD in line with industry market growth. Storage and compute industry as a service were both up triple digits. Cloud deferred revenue was up 53%. So as I described, it was a solid quarter for us on top line growth of 7% USD in 12 -- in revenue and 12% EPS growth in USD.
A couple of predictions. I expect Q2 cloud booking growth to be strong or stronger than our Q1 growth rate. Our cloud bookings were executing well on a very big and growing pipeline. We expect the cloud FY '18 full year cloud booking growth to be quite strong. Revenue growth now at an annualized rate of $6 billion or growth rate of 51%, and we are the fastest growing cloud company at scale.
I do want to read off to you a few logos of wins we had in the quarter just to give you some context for some of the companies that we're selling product to, and I'll just mention a few. But in HCM, this is HCM Cloud SaaS: 7-Eleven, Aon, [ Aries ] Group, Baptist Health of South Florida, Cantor Fitzgerald, China State Construction Engineering Corporation, Cook County, [ eBolt ], Habitat for Humanity, Liberty Mutual Insurance, state of Nebraska, SUPERVALU, the Southern Company, an unnamed large financial services firm in New York. That's also different from the large unnamed financial services firm we sold to in Q4. Just a few ERP names: Advance Auto Parts, ADEO, Coach, Eurostar International, GlaxoSmithKline, Grupo Bimbo, Hilton, Honda Motor, Modine Manufacturing, Nestlé, Tata Communications, United States Steel, World Fuel Services Corp. I could go on.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

On October 1 at Oracle OpenWorld, we'll announce the next generation of the Oracle Database. When we deliver it by the end of this calendar year, Oracle will become the world's first fully autonomous database.
Based on machine learning, this new version of Oracle is totally automated self-driving system that does not require a human being either to manage the database or tune the database. Using artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error enables Oracle to deliver unprecedented reliability in the cloud.  We will be authoring public cloud SLAs, service level agreements, for the Oracle Database that guarantee 99.995% systems availability time. 99.995% availability means less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year. To achieve that level of reliability, Oracle has to automatically tune, patch and upgrade itself while the system is running. AWS can't do any of this stuff.
But perhaps the most interesting aspect of autonomous systems like self-driving cars and our new self-driving database are the economics that surround total automation. Self-driving cars eliminate the labor cost of driving plus the high cost associated with human driving errors. Self-driving database eliminates the labor cost of tuning, managing and upgrading the database, thus, avoiding all of the costly downtime associated with human error.
Self-driving taxis are much cheaper to operate than taxis with human drivers. Running Oracle's autonomous database is much, much cheaper than running traditional human-driven databases like Amazon's Redshift. Customers moving from Amazon's Redshift to Oracle's autonomous databases can expect to cut their cost in half or more, and Oracle will be providing SLAs that guarantee those cost savings to customers that move."

So I think, again -- and we said this before, but it probably bears saying again that just sort of every aspect of selling in the cloud, I think the company holistically is getting better at.

As we move our application customers from on-prem to cloud, we're asking them to migrate from the E-Business Suite to Fusion. As they move from our HR, we're asking them migrate from Oracle HR or PeopleSoft HR to Fusion HR in the cloud. So they're really changing applications. In the case of our technology business, where you're running the Oracle Database on-prem, we're just asking you to look to move your data into our cloud. There really is no technology transition at all. So you really can't look at these transitions as being similar things. The interesting thing, it's very different than, let's say, Microsoft. Microsoft, they took their existing Microsoft Office customers and moved them to the cloud, so you suddenly can save documents in the cloud, Word documents or Excel documents. You move them to the cloud. That's what's meant by Office 365. That's very close to our Database business, where we're just beginning to move them to the cloud. That's just taking existing applications. Actually, the new version of our database, as I mentioned, is greatly enhanced in the cloud and there's real motives to move it from on-prem into the cloud. You get lots and lots of benefits, but it's not a technology change. In our apps transition, you actually move to a whole new technology stack. It looks like almost moving to a new vendor if you will. You move from Oracle E-Business Suite or PeopleSoft Financials or JD Edwards, all of these on-prem customers that we have -- this on-prem business we have, and you move to Fusion Financial. That was a -- that required a new implementation, retraining your people, and we did that. But we -- that transition, as Mark just said, is just beginning. Most of our Fusion ERP customers, our Fusion HCM customers are new logos. And we don't expect, when people move from their database from on-prem in the cloud, we don't expect support to go away. We expect them just to bring their licenses into our cloud. And you're paying support. You have the license. You own the license. Now you run it in our cloud, and you pay us additionally for running in our cloud just like when you move the Oracle Database in the Amazon Cloud, you pay them additionally. So it is simply lifting up your existing license. Therefore, you keep paying support. You keep paying support, and you add on to that. You -- Infrastructure as a Service or Platform as a Service fees associated with running it in our cloud. So we think that's a much easier transition for us than the transition we're making on the apps side of the business. And look how well the transition on the apps side of the business is going."

We had another acceleration just in terms of logos. We had acceleration of ERP logos this Q1 versus last Q1. So we had more closures in terms of numbers of accounts, and we have bigger companies looking. So it's significant to the point of your question. We also have more modules coming online. So if you look at what we've got in ERP now, we have more localizations across more geographies, and we now have our full suite of ERP, supply chain, procurement, manufacturing, now budgeting, planning all available. So it's the full suite now across almost all of our geographies. What -- to Larry's point, I think it's worth stating a lot of our ERP customers now are new logos, lots of new financials customers and lots of companies that, to be very blunt with you, Kirk, we would never have sold to 5 or 6 years ago, companies that are really named -- when you come to Oracle OpenWorld, you'll see another string of customers who never had an Oracle application before until they bought Oracle Financials in the cloud. So it's that. Then, in addition to that, I think what really helps us is the fact that we are the only suite provider. So the fact that now a company, instead of having a bunch of point solutions, can have a suite of applications and the opportunity for us to now bring HCM and ERP together to a customer gives us an incredible advantage across basically all of our customers. So you see now in the names I wrote -- I read off to you lots of what I would call high-end mid-market, low-end enterprise customers that are really the common persona of who we sell to, most of them new logos. I think you'll see that continue as we go forward. The best news I can give you is that as we start to bring our larger customers over, Oracle will get materially more revenue as we move that support because we do everything for them. We do the hardware. We do the operating system. We do -- it's our data center. We do really everything for them, and we get the extra revenue as a result of that."

I guess, they want me to go first. The reason we can lower costs is we just automate more. There's a big difference between -- what Amazon basically does, what they pioneered was this notion of we will rent you based on what you use, compute and storage, and you can kind of bring whatever -- and they offer a couple of databases. They offer Aurora, which is MySQL, their version of MySQL. And they offer Redshift, which is another -- their version of an Open Source database. They had made some changes to it. It's no longer Open Source. It's from Amazon for queries and OLTP. But these are technologies that are not automated. These are, if you will, old-fashioned technologies in a newfangled cloud data center and available for rental. So it's kind of an interesting new business model, but their database technologies are not very advanced at all. They just picked them up out of Open Source. And our database, our -- the new latest -- especially the latest generation of our database, totally automates everything. So you don't -- you push a button, load your data and you're done. You don't have lots of tuning parameters and lots of things to set up like you do with Amazon. Amazon requires a lot of labor to set up an online transaction processing system based on Aurora. That's a lot of labor. It's MySQL. It's kind of our -- it's code that we maintain. We know it very, very well. Very different than Oracle. You press a button, load your data, run your analytics. It tunes itself. It backs itself up. It patches itself. It never goes down. And it's much, much, much faster. Now I keep saying it's much, much, much faster and then someone will say, ""Well, we don't need that speed."" Well, let me translate. If it's much, much, much faster, in other words, if it does in 1 hour what Redshift does in 10 hours, it's 1/10 the cost of running at Amazon because we charge the same amount per hour. So we take out the labor cost. And because we're -- we consume less CPU and we compress the data and we consume less storage, it's much -- we're much more frugal about using compute and storage resources, and we eliminate the labor cost and the associate -- the cost associated with human error. So there is -- we're not even trying to do the same thing as Amazon."

And now we're closing in on the 80 so much so that I actually went ahead and gave you sometime next year for that hitting. PaaS and IaaS are very much, at least at this point, in the expansion period. We expect this to be a very large business, though we remain very conscious of the margins. And so we're trying not to invest too much ahead of revenue recognition. But as you see in this quarter alone, we have a lot that has yet to be deployed, fully deployed, even though it's fully provisioned, even though the equipment is all bought and being capitalized. So this is really -- I can't give you an exact time because we're going to be very much monitoring demand and reacting to that.

So think of it as you have a baseline of X and then I get a booking. And then I have a little bit of capacity per booking so to speak. It's not exactly how it works but for the sake of your analytics it's how it works. And we know what that increment of capacity is for that booking. And then it's just a question of scale from there. So you take the unused space, and then for each booking, you get so few -- a couple of few cents on the dollar that you have to add for internal capacity and then just becomes the time it takes to get to scale.

So we can actually start to bucket the candidates. This group -- these 200 people, you're looking at hiring, and the 50 over here look very much like the 50 people that you hired over the last 5 years that have been enormously successful for the company. And that's a matter of machine learning -- using machine learning to just look at the profiles of individuals a company's hired over a period of time and make recommendations of who -- how to prioritize candidates that they're looking at making offers to. All the way from that level to our new security systems, which are going in now, where we're doing log inspection, where we're looking at people. And the logs we look at, unlike anybody else, we are in the applications business. We are in the database business, and we're in the cloud infrastructure business looking at network logs and operating system logs and storage hardware logs. We're also looking at database logs. We're looking at people trying to log on to application systems and the passwords they're using. We have all of these logs, and we're processing all of these logs in our cloud to, for example, looking -- trying to find people who are going to attack a database and steal passwords and steal data. And we think we do this better than anybody because we look at more data. We look at application data. In other words, we suddenly know that your CFO's in the Ukraine trying to log on 50,000 times in the middle of the night. Maybe your CFO is not vacationing in the Ukraine, and that's not her. And there could be a problem. Someone's trying to break in. We look at that level of data all the way down to IP addresses that are strange IP addresses, trying to figure out [indiscernible] we look at strange SQL [ terms ]. Anyway, we do much -- we look at 10x more log information than someone like a Splunk, who is inspecting IP addresses but not log-in information. So we get a much better picture of all the activity of what's going on inside your data center and use machine learning to inspect this vast amount of data and see if someone's in the reconnaissance phase of -- prior to an attack, where we can shut them off while they're just looking around before they actually attack anything and start stealing passwords and start stealing data. Again, that's also all machine learning. We're offering that technology, again, in OpenWorld. We're offering the customers can shift their logs from their data center and into our cloud. And we'll do all of that security reconnaissance and security work for them. And the more of this information we have, the better equipped we are to find malware. You find malware showing up in, let's say, Germany, and we know what it looks like. And suddenly, we have worldwide alerts because worldwide alerts that -- to recognize that malware if it should show up in California or at a -- and as we know, there's a lot of -- security is getting more and more important these days. The events at Equifax -- very unfortunate events at Equifax is not going to be an isolated incident. You're going to see more and more things like this. You saw it at the government Office of Personnel Management, which was disastrous for our intelligence community. We've got to do a better job. We got to do a better job of securing not only our cloud but our customers' data centers, getting all of that log data, using machine learning to -- and basically, what is a cyber war that's going to be ongoing for a long, long time. So everything from helping companies using AI to help companies hire the right people to helping data centers, both private data centers and public data centers, protect against intrusions. It's an important new technology, and it's at the center of what we're doing with database automation, security and our application."

Customer adoption of our",935,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can see, we had another good quarter. Customer adoption of our cloud products and services continue to be very, very strong, and our on-premise business remains very resilient. The result was that total revenue were at the high end of my guidance, and earnings per share beat my guidance by $0.01.
Today, I'm going to do what I always do, which is use constant dollar growth rates on this call, so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. The effects of currency movements in Q1 were a little better than expected with a 1% tailwind to total revenue. Total cloud and software revenue were $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency and 9% in U.S. dollars. GAAP applications total revenue were $2.6 billion, up 17%, and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenue were $4.7 billion, up 3%.
Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 61% (sic) [ 62% ] from last year. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 28% from last year. As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded. The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 67%, up from 59% last Q1. We expect to see further improvement in FY '18 and remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins, possibly as soon as sometime in FY '19.
The gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 44%, down 58% -- down from 58% last quarter as our geographic build-out goes forward in response to demand but ahead of the bulk of new revenue recognition. When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in PaaS and IaaS gross margin.
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 51% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $5.9 billion, up 1% from last year, reflecting continued high attach of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of on-premise customers. Hardware revenues were $943 million, down 6%, and services revenue were $860 million, up 5%. Total revenue for the company were $9.2 billion, up 6% (sic) [ 7% ] from last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 10% (sic) [ 11% ] from last year, and it's been a while since we last reported double-digit operating income growth as we undertook the cloud transformation that affected our income statement, trading upfront -- on upfront revenue recognition of on-premise license revenue for recurring subscription cloud revenue. With cloud now a larger and more predictable share of the revenue mix, I expect that we'll see additional strong operating income growth. The operating margin was 41%, which was up from 39% last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 25%, which was over 1 point higher than my guidance, negatively impacting EPS by $0.01 or so, and EPS was still up 12% in USD and 11% in CD to $0.62. The GAAP tax rate was 14.5%, and GAAP EPS was up 19% to $0.52 in U.S. dollars.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.8 billion, up 8%, and free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.6 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $473 million. I expect that cloud CapEx spending will be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS, IaaS build-out that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, should we see higher-than-expected ARR growth, we'd expect to see higher CapEx investments as well.
We now have nearly $67 billion in cash and marketable securities, but net of our debt, our cash position is about $13.6 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $10.3 billion, up 9% in U.S. dollars.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million shares for a total of nearly $500 million. We're currently planning on bringing that rate up significantly for Q2. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 46.6 million shares for a total of $2 billion, and we also paid out dividends of $2.8 billion. The Oracle Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.
Now to the guidance. And I'm going to give you guidance for Q2, and my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. However, there has been some currency movement, and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue and $0.02 positive on EPS.
So here we go, Q2. Cloud revenues -- remember, these are constant currency numbers, so you're going to be adjusting them for U.S. dollars. Cloud revenues, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, are expected to grow 39% to 43%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.64 and $0.68, up from $0.61 last Q2. That puts the USD number in the range between $0.66 and $0.70 at today's exchange rates. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere between 23.5% and 25.5%. Of course, as usual, tax rate could end up being different as it was this quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

Operating income was up 11% and EPS up 12%. In cloud bookings, it was a strong quarter. Overall growth was above 40%. That was an acceleration from our growth rate last year. By the way, all numbers are in CD unless I say otherwise. Cloud revenue up 51% now at a $6 billion annual run rate. 80% of our TTM, trailing 12-month, software and cloud revenue is now recurring.
Now I'm going to give you some SaaS revenue numbers by pillar. We're up 61%, as Safra said, accelerating from 55% growth last year. ERP was up 90% organically. Overall ERP is now over $1.3 billion annualized run rate. Fusion HCM, up 109%, more than double the growth rate of Workday. [ CX, ] all of our category sales, marketing and service were up double digits organically. Data as a service was up 53%. The business is now over $0.5 billion annualized run rate. Our verticals are up 20% on a compare, by the way, of 115% growth last year.
And as good as all these SaaS numbers are, our application ecosystem -- let me go through again what that is. That's our on-premise license, on-premise support and SaaS -- was together up 17%. When you look at any industry growth metric of the applications industry, you'll find numbers like 1%, 2%, 3% in the marketplace. The market share gains we have are astounding.
In PaaS infrastructure, our revenue was up 28%. Business analytics were up 130%, data integration up 221%. Our database ecosystem, including the same metrics I described earlier, Database as a Service, on-premise support, on-premise license, was up 3% in USD in line with industry market growth. Storage and compute industry as a service were both up triple digits. Cloud deferred revenue was up 53%. So as I described, it was a solid quarter for us on top line growth of 7% USD in 12 -- in revenue and 12% EPS growth in USD.
A couple of predictions. I expect Q2 cloud booking growth to be strong or stronger than our Q1 growth rate. Our cloud bookings were executing well on a very big and growing pipeline. We expect the cloud FY '18 full year cloud booking growth to be quite strong. Revenue growth now at an annualized rate of $6 billion or growth rate of 51%, and we are the fastest growing cloud company at scale.
I do want to read off to you a few logos of wins we had in the quarter just to give you some context for some of the companies that we're selling product to, and I'll just mention a few. But in HCM, this is HCM Cloud SaaS: 7-Eleven, Aon, [ Aries ] Group, Baptist Health of South Florida, Cantor Fitzgerald, China State Construction Engineering Corporation, Cook County, [ eBolt ], Habitat for Humanity, Liberty Mutual Insurance, state of Nebraska, SUPERVALU, the Southern Company, an unnamed large financial services firm in New York. That's also different from the large unnamed financial services firm we sold to in Q4. Just a few ERP names: Advance Auto Parts, ADEO, Coach, Eurostar International, GlaxoSmithKline, Grupo Bimbo, Hilton, Honda Motor, Modine Manufacturing, Nestlé, Tata Communications, United States Steel, World Fuel Services Corp. I could go on.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

On October 1 at Oracle OpenWorld, we'll announce the next generation of the Oracle Database. When we deliver it by the end of this calendar year, Oracle will become the world's first fully autonomous database.
Based on machine learning, this new version of Oracle is totally automated self-driving system that does not require a human being either to manage the database or tune the database. Using artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error enables Oracle to deliver unprecedented reliability in the cloud.  We will be authoring public cloud SLAs, service level agreements, for the Oracle Database that guarantee 99.995% systems availability time. 99.995% availability means less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year. To achieve that level of reliability, Oracle has to automatically tune, patch and upgrade itself while the system is running. AWS can't do any of this stuff.
But perhaps the most interesting aspect of autonomous systems like self-driving cars and our new self-driving database are the economics that surround total automation. Self-driving cars eliminate the labor cost of driving plus the high cost associated with human driving errors. Self-driving database eliminates the labor cost of tuning, managing and upgrading the database, thus, avoiding all of the costly downtime associated with human error.
Self-driving taxis are much cheaper to operate than taxis with human drivers. Running Oracle's autonomous database is much, much cheaper than running traditional human-driven databases like Amazon's Redshift. Customers moving from Amazon's Redshift to Oracle's autonomous databases can expect to cut their cost in half or more, and Oracle will be providing SLAs that guarantee those cost savings to customers that move."

So I think, again -- and we said this before, but it probably bears saying again that just sort of every aspect of selling in the cloud, I think the company holistically is getting better at.

So we expect the margins in our businesses to go up, the stock price to go up for us to distance ourselves from our, if you will, our legacy competitors and join the ranks of the new generation of tech companies like as Microsoft has done and smaller companies like Salesforce and Workday. That's where we position ourselves. So we think these are stretch targets. And it will take several years to achieve them, but we think we are well on our way.

As we move our application customers from on-prem to cloud, we're asking them to migrate from the E-Business Suite to Fusion. As they move from our HR, we're asking them migrate from Oracle HR or PeopleSoft HR to Fusion HR in the cloud. So they're really changing applications. In the case of our technology business, where you're running the Oracle Database on-prem, we're just asking you to look to move your data into our cloud. There really is no technology transition at all. So you really can't look at these transitions as being similar things. The interesting thing, it's very different than, let's say, Microsoft. Microsoft, they took their existing Microsoft Office customers and moved them to the cloud, so you suddenly can save documents in the cloud, Word documents or Excel documents. You move them to the cloud. That's what's meant by Office 365. That's very close to our Database business, where we're just beginning to move them to the cloud. That's just taking existing applications. Actually, the new version of our database, as I mentioned, is greatly enhanced in the cloud and there's real motives to move it from on-prem into the cloud. You get lots and lots of benefits, but it's not a technology change. In our apps transition, you actually move to a whole new technology stack. It looks like almost moving to a new vendor if you will. You move from Oracle E-Business Suite or PeopleSoft Financials or JD Edwards, all of these on-prem customers that we have -- this on-prem business we have, and you move to Fusion Financial. That was a -- that required a new implementation, retraining your people, and we did that. But we -- that transition, as Mark just said, is just beginning. Most of our Fusion ERP customers, our Fusion HCM customers are new logos. And we don't expect, when people move from their database from on-prem in the cloud, we don't expect support to go away. We expect them just to bring their licenses into our cloud. And you're paying support. You have the license. You own the license. Now you run it in our cloud, and you pay us additionally for running in our cloud just like when you move the Oracle Database in the Amazon Cloud, you pay them additionally. So it is simply lifting up your existing license. Therefore, you keep paying support. You keep paying support, and you add on to that. You -- Infrastructure as a Service or Platform as a Service fees associated with running it in our cloud. So we think that's a much easier transition for us than the transition we're making on the apps side of the business. And look how well the transition on the apps side of the business is going."

We had another acceleration just in terms of logos. We had acceleration of ERP logos this Q1 versus last Q1. So we had more closures in terms of numbers of accounts, and we have bigger companies looking. So it's significant to the point of your question. We also have more modules coming online. So if you look at what we've got in ERP now, we have more localizations across more geographies, and we now have our full suite of ERP, supply chain, procurement, manufacturing, now budgeting, planning all available. So it's the full suite now across almost all of our geographies. What -- to Larry's point, I think it's worth stating a lot of our ERP customers now are new logos, lots of new financials customers and lots of companies that, to be very blunt with you, Kirk, we would never have sold to 5 or 6 years ago, companies that are really named -- when you come to Oracle OpenWorld, you'll see another string of customers who never had an Oracle application before until they bought Oracle Financials in the cloud. So it's that. Then, in addition to that, I think what really helps us is the fact that we are the only suite provider. So the fact that now a company, instead of having a bunch of point solutions, can have a suite of applications and the opportunity for us to now bring HCM and ERP together to a customer gives us an incredible advantage across basically all of our customers. So you see now in the names I wrote -- I read off to you lots of what I would call high-end mid-market, low-end enterprise customers that are really the common persona of who we sell to, most of them new logos. I think you'll see that continue as we go forward. The best news I can give you is that as we start to bring our larger customers over, Oracle will get materially more revenue as we move that support because we do everything for them. We do the hardware. We do the operating system. We do -- it's our data center. We do really everything for them, and we get the extra revenue as a result of that."

I guess, they want me to go first. The reason we can lower costs is we just automate more. There's a big difference between -- what Amazon basically does, what they pioneered was this notion of we will rent you based on what you use, compute and storage, and you can kind of bring whatever -- and they offer a couple of databases. They offer Aurora, which is MySQL, their version of MySQL. And they offer Redshift, which is another -- their version of an Open Source database. They had made some changes to it. It's no longer Open Source. It's from Amazon for queries and OLTP. But these are technologies that are not automated. These are, if you will, old-fashioned technologies in a newfangled cloud data center and available for rental. So it's kind of an interesting new business model, but their database technologies are not very advanced at all. They just picked them up out of Open Source. And our database, our -- the new latest -- especially the latest generation of our database, totally automates everything. So you don't -- you push a button, load your data and you're done. You don't have lots of tuning parameters and lots of things to set up like you do with Amazon. Amazon requires a lot of labor to set up an online transaction processing system based on Aurora. That's a lot of labor. It's MySQL. It's kind of our -- it's code that we maintain. We know it very, very well. Very different than Oracle. You press a button, load your data, run your analytics. It tunes itself. It backs itself up. It patches itself. It never goes down. And it's much, much, much faster. Now I keep saying it's much, much, much faster and then someone will say, ""Well, we don't need that speed."" Well, let me translate. If it's much, much, much faster, in other words, if it does in 1 hour what Redshift does in 10 hours, it's 1/10 the cost of running at Amazon because we charge the same amount per hour. So we take out the labor cost. And because we're -- we consume less CPU and we compress the data and we consume less storage, it's much -- we're much more frugal about using compute and storage resources, and we eliminate the labor cost and the associate -- the cost associated with human error. So there is -- we're not even trying to do the same thing as Amazon."

And now we're closing in on the 80 so much so that I actually went ahead and gave you sometime next year for that hitting. PaaS and IaaS are very much, at least at this point, in the expansion period. We expect this to be a very large business, though we remain very conscious of the margins. And so we're trying not to invest too much ahead of revenue recognition. But as you see in this quarter alone, we have a lot that has yet to be deployed, fully deployed, even though it's fully provisioned, even though the equipment is all bought and being capitalized. So this is really -- I can't give you an exact time because we're going to be very much monitoring demand and reacting to that.

There's a start-up cost to getting in these businesses. We're past that in SaaS. We're deployed in now virtually all of the critical geographies, and we now have scale in most of the critical geographies. And so you see it just show up in the margin rate as it has. We're going through that same process in infrastructure. The great news for us now, we know how this works. We know how to get it done. We know how to measure it. We know how to get from here to there, and so you'll see the same results. So it's just a factor of timing, scale and bookings and to Safra's last point, the ability then for us to get a provision so we can then recognize the revenue. So this is going to happen, John."

So think of it as you have a baseline of X and then I get a booking. And then I have a little bit of capacity per booking so to speak. It's not exactly how it works but for the sake of your analytics it's how it works. And we know what that increment of capacity is for that booking. And then it's just a question of scale from there. So you take the unused space, and then for each booking, you get so few -- a couple of few cents on the dollar that you have to add for internal capacity and then just becomes the time it takes to get to scale.

So we can actually start to bucket the candidates. This group -- these 200 people, you're looking at hiring, and the 50 over here look very much like the 50 people that you hired over the last 5 years that have been enormously successful for the company. And that's a matter of machine learning -- using machine learning to just look at the profiles of individuals a company's hired over a period of time and make recommendations of who -- how to prioritize candidates that they're looking at making offers to. All the way from that level to our new security systems, which are going in now, where we're doing log inspection, where we're looking at people. And the logs we look at, unlike anybody else, we are in the applications business. We are in the database business, and we're in the cloud infrastructure business looking at network logs and operating system logs and storage hardware logs. We're also looking at database logs. We're looking at people trying to log on to application systems and the passwords they're using. We have all of these logs, and we're processing all of these logs in our cloud to, for example, looking -- trying to find people who are going to attack a database and steal passwords and steal data. And we think we do this better than anybody because we look at more data. We look at application data. In other words, we suddenly know that your CFO's in the Ukraine trying to log on 50,000 times in the middle of the night. Maybe your CFO is not vacationing in the Ukraine, and that's not her. And there could be a problem. Someone's trying to break in. We look at that level of data all the way down to IP addresses that are strange IP addresses, trying to figure out [indiscernible] we look at strange SQL [ terms ]. Anyway, we do much -- we look at 10x more log information than someone like a Splunk, who is inspecting IP addresses but not log-in information. So we get a much better picture of all the activity of what's going on inside your data center and use machine learning to inspect this vast amount of data and see if someone's in the reconnaissance phase of -- prior to an attack, where we can shut them off while they're just looking around before they actually attack anything and start stealing passwords and start stealing data. Again, that's also all machine learning. We're offering that technology, again, in OpenWorld. We're offering the customers can shift their logs from their data center and into our cloud. And we'll do all of that security reconnaissance and security work for them. And the more of this information we have, the better equipped we are to find malware. You find malware showing up in, let's say, Germany, and we know what it looks like. And suddenly, we have worldwide alerts because worldwide alerts that -- to recognize that malware if it should show up in California or at a -- and as we know, there's a lot of -- security is getting more and more important these days. The events at Equifax -- very unfortunate events at Equifax is not going to be an isolated incident. You're going to see more and more things like this. You saw it at the government Office of Personnel Management, which was disastrous for our intelligence community. We've got to do a better job. We got to do a better job of securing not only our cloud but our customers' data centers, getting all of that log data, using machine learning to -- and basically, what is a cyber war that's going to be ongoing for a long, long time. So everything from helping companies using AI to help companies hire the right people to helping data centers, both private data centers and public data centers, protect against intrusions. It's an important new technology, and it's at the center of what we're doing with database automation, security and our application."

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3, and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. Customer adoption",1148,"Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3, and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. Customer adoption of our cloud products and services continues to be very strong. And what we have called our on-premise business remains robust. Bottom line, our transition to the cloud is going well.  Despite the currency benefit being less than my guidance, total revenue was more than the high end of my guidance range. And earnings per share was at the high end, even at a higher tax rate than expected. 
Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 47% from last year. Fusion cloud revenue was up 56% for the quarter. Cloud Paas and IaaS revenue for the quarter was $398 million, up 20% from last year. But just as a reminder, part of the cloud Paas and IaaS business is our legacy hosting services, which don't share the same high growth characteristic as PaaS and next-gen IaaS services. This portion of PaaS IaaS saw growth of 46% in CD and 49% in USD, while the traditional hosting services which we are defocusing, were down nearly 10%. As traditional hosting services become a smaller part of PaaS and IaaS, the underlying growth of PaaS and next-gen IaaS will be more visible. 
I want to also take a moment to review the announcements we made in October of bring your own licenses, what we call BYOL, and autonomous database. Unlike the applications business where customers move to SaaS subscriptions, stock buying upfront licenses and [shelf their] application support, BYOL customers can leverage their years of investment in Oracle Database and technology software and bring those licenses to the Oracle cloud infrastructure instead of canceling their licenses and support and moving to run new licenses. With BYOL, we are seeing a strong increase in our technology installed base as customers renew their unlimited license agreements, invest in more licenses and options and renew support. Because BYOL is now available and customers better understand their transition options to move to the Oracle cloud, technology new software license revenue is dramatically improving from the declines we were seeing previously. We expect this trend to continue as we roll out autonomous database as customers license the options and technology they need. We expect to continue to take share in database. 
Now total cloud and software revenues were $7.8 billion, up 7% in constant currency and up 9% in U.S. dollars. In fact, we've consistently overachieved our software and cloud revenue forecast the last 7 quarters. I focus on these numbers, which we refer to as the ecosystem revenues, because that is where all of our software assets come together and you can the start to see the powerful dynamics of the business, especially with our BYOL model. Total cloud revenue in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 39% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.3 billion, up 1% from last year, reflecting stable software license and continued high attach of support -- of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of customers.  GAAP application total revenues, which is new licenses and support and SaaS, were $2.7 billion, up 13%. And GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenue, which includes new licenses and support and PaaS and IaaS were $5.1 billion, up 4%. 
As for cloud margins, our SaaS business continues to scale and grow, and the gross margin has expanded to 66%, up from 59% last Q2. We expect to see further improvement in FY 2018, and we remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins. 
The gross margin of Paas and IaaS was 40%, down from 44% last quarter as our geographic build-out goes forward in response to demand, but ahead of the bulk of new revenue recognition. When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in Paas and IaaS gross margin. 
Hardware revenues were $940 million, down 9%. And service revenues were $856 million, essentially unchanged in constant currency. Total non-GAAP revenues for the company were $9.6 billion, up 4% from last year and 6% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 8% from last year, 10% in U.S. dollars.
The operating margin was 44%, which was up from 42% last year. The operating margin has now increased year-over-year for 5 consecutive quarters. And while I can't promise this will happen every quarter, I do expect that operating margins will continue to expand.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was slightly higher than expected at 25.2%. As a result, EPS was $0.01 less at $0.70 a share in U.S. dollars, up 14% in USD, 12% in CD. The GAAP tax rate was 22.1% and GAAP EPS was $0.52. 
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.6 billion, up 2%. And free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.5 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $599 million. I expect the cloud CapEx spending will be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS and IaaS build-out that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, should we see higher-than-expected ARR growth, we'd expect to see higher CapEx investments as well.
Now we have more than $71 billion in cash and marketable securities, but net of debt, our cash position is $10.9 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, up 6% in constant currency. 
This quarter, we repurchased nearly 41 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 74.5 million shares for a total of $3.5 billion. We also paid out dividends of nearly $3 billion. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by 12 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. 
Now to the guidance for Q3. Our guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. However, there have been -- there has been some current currency movement. And assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue or $0.03 positive on EPS. So for Q3 in constant currency, cloud revenue including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS are expected to grow 21% to 25%. Total revenue is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.68 and $0.70. That puts the USD earnings per share at $0.71 to $0.73. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere around 24%. Of course with the current and very real possibility of tax reform, the Q3 tax rate could easily end up being very different, especially to the extent that there is repatriation. 
With that, I will turn over to Mark for his comments."

Operating income was up 10%. Net income was up 16%. EPS grew 14%. That's 3 quarters in a row where EPS growth has been over double digits. 
To Safra's point about our apps ecosystem, our application revenue was up 13%. That is a GAAP CD number. We're growing roughly 3x as fast as the market. Now I've seen market numbers of 2, 3, 3.5. So depending on how you look at those numbers, we're more than 3x as fast as the market, maybe 4 with nearly 90% of that revenue in recurring on a trailing 12-month basis. 
SaaS bookings was a strong quarter for us. We grew 42% in USD. That 42% accelerated, meaning the growth rate was higher than prior year. Thus, revenue was up 47 and over a $4.5 billion annualized run rate. ERP was up 66% organically. Overall, ERP is now at $1.4 billion annual run rate. Fusion HCM, up 77%, more than double the growth rate at Workday. CX double-digit growth with CX now at $1.1 billion annualized run rate. Data as a service up 47%.  Our verticals were up 19%. Now that's on a compare of last year's growth of 125%. Our technologies ecosystem, that's on-premise license, on-premise support and our Paas and infrastructure revenue all together, was up 4% with solid cloud growth and new software license, which was essentially flat in the quarter.  
In terms of our platform and infrastructure revenue, that was up 20%. there are a couple of things the call out here. And as was mentioned first inside our Paas and infrastructure is the legacy hosting business, which is declining. Second, we have Oracle cloud machine revenue, which is not yet reported, which we discussed last quarter. If we put it all together, the 49% growth Safra mentioned earlier, if all of that Oracle cloud machine had been provisioned, our revenue growth rate would have been [above] 55% in USD. 
Business analytics was up 104%, data integration up 88%, storage and compute Infrastructure as a Service both up triple digits. Cloud revenue grew 41% in USD, now over a $6 billion run rate. And 80% of that trailing 12 months software and cloud revenue is now recurring. Our cloud deferred revenue was up 33%. 
Now just closing and looking forward, we're executing well on a big -- and our pipeline is the biggest we'd ever had. And we expect to sell around $2 billion in SaaS ARR over the next 4 quarters, that being the second half of '18 and the first half of fiscal '19.  Lastly, this was again another solid quarter from top line growth of 6% USD all the way down to the bottom of 14% EPS growth. 
let me give you a few customer names, wins we had in the quarter. And I'll just try to run through these quickly, but I think it's important for you to hear these brand names.

This coming January, Oracle will deliver the world's first autonomous database. We expect this innovative new technology to dramatically accelerate the growth of our PaaS and SaaS businesses and keep our database license business strong as well. People are buying database licenses to run on-premise and in the cloud. You can run them either place options around on-premise and in the cloud. 
Okay, based on machine learning, the new autonomous version of the Oracle database is totally automated, a self-driving system that does not require a human being to either manage or tune the database. Using artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error, the Oracle autonomous database delivers an unprecedented 99.995% system availability. That's less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year. To achieve that level of reliability, the Oracle autonomous database automatically tunes and operates itself without human intervention. If a security vulnerability is detected, the database automatically and immediately [catches] itself while the system is running. 
AWS database can't do any of these.  Even more compelling is the cost comparison between running the Oracle autonomous database versus running an Amazon database like Redshift. In a series of published benchmark tests, the Amazon Redshift database on average costs 5x more to run the same exact amount of work as the Oracle autonomous database. Let me repeat that. If you take a workload from Amazon running on Redshift and move it over to Oracle, your Amazon bill will drop by 80%. You're 5 times -- it costs you 5x more to run Redshift than to run the Oracle autonomous. And this is not total cost of ownership. This is not labor. This is your Amazon bill, what you pay Amazon to do a -- to do this, a piece of work. You can run on the Oracle cloud and take 20 cents on the dollar by moving from Amazon to Oracle.
We're so confident of our cost advantages over Amazon that Oracle will provide our customers with written service level agreements that guarantee, that guarantee moving to the Oracle cloud will cut Amazon's customer database bill in half or substantially more than half. Okay."

And so in many cases, it's easier for of the big banks, some of the pharma companies, and frankly even in telecommunications where you see it's easier to get it's going to get through those legs. we're taking all advantages of the cloud. So let me just go through this, Mark. You get really all the price advantages. You're are buying variably. You think -- we do all of the work, we do all of the patching. The customer really doesn't touch this. So they get the benefits of cloud on one hand, while not having to deal with some of what the regulatory issues might be on the other hand. the downside is what Larry went through. we have to physically go in and implement this. And there's some extra work that might be done as opposed to just hooking up directly into our cloud. Does that help you?"

One, I was not trying to confuse what I thought this year's physical bookings in cloud would be with rolling 4 quarters SaaS ARR bookings would be. So those are 2 separate numbers. and I'm glad the way you worded it, so I must have said it right. The $2 billion is a forward-looking next rolling 4 quarters of SaaS bookings. And I think that's more than anybody's going to be even close to that sort of bookings number, but obviously we'll see. So we think that's going to be very, very impressive. What is going to happen on the overall ecosystem? As you probably know, I know I've said before, most of what's in our revenue base that they did not come from our on-prem user base. Most came from competitors or came from companies that really are in their first set of applications, mid-market companies, fast-growth companies, et cetera. So I think what's happened, just to make sure you understand, I think we said that before. But Oracle actually goes live on cloud financials right at the turn of the calendar year. So our E-Business Suite base, which is not the predominant piece of our cloud SaaS base, we'll see this as a big, big move. So we are hopeful when we talk about the entire ecosystem that actually, we'll start to see a higher degree of Oracle's user base moving. And I want to start emphasize again, that is a good thing. We get materially more revenue when a customer moves from support of their existing on-prem applications to now SaaS. And that is roughly 3x or more ARR. And the 3x, I want to emphasize again, is the equivalent of a like-for-like support compared to their new applications in the cloud. So what do I expect happens in ecosystem? I think the ecosystem actually grows faster as a result of everything I described. Most of our base did not come from the Oracle base. The Oracle base now with more and more references to move certainly. Our latest releases, which is now release 13, more feature-rich than we -- anything we obviously have ever had before, Heather. And as that support base moves to cloud, we actually get more revenue. As a result, the ecosystem grows faster."

And then the build-out is a little bit less because there's a starting block. So I think we -- and what happens is you start to get really major economies of scale as you -- once your setup is basically set up straight and ready to go.  So I feel like last year, a lot of growth, about half of that is in real estate, which I don't expect to continue necessarily as much on that side.

So all of that, that BYOL, is a fundamental change and is significantly different from how SaaS works, and that's what I tried to explain. In fact, you're not doing a SaaS subscription. You are no longer using your license. You don't need to buy more licenses, and you shelve your support. With BYOL, you buy a new -- you buy additional licenses. you bring them to the cloud and you continue to pay support. And that is going to be very significant going forward.

They would have certified those licenses and stopped buying additional and renewing unlimited agreements. So what they've now seen is their pathway with BYOL gives them complete flexibility when they are ready to move to the cloud, but that there is a benefit in owning your licenses and buying more and renewing support. So customers move to the cloud when it makes sense for them.

There's been no big migration any place of Oracle databases into anyone's cloud, including ours. There's been some, but it's a relatively  very, very small business.

Remember, when you bring your own license the Oracle IaaS, you -- the service you purchase is more expensive than the basic IaaS. Because you get all of the autonomous, all of the capability you wouldn't otherwise get, first of all. But you cannot divorce the margin of just IaaS without remembering that both licenses are being purchased and support is continuously paid. That's why you heard me say, maybe you heard me say the so-called on-premise license. Because it's actually, now that we've launched BYOL, it is actually a misnomer. Because the customer is -- it's currently categorized on our income statement as on-premise software and support, for that matter. Those are called on-premise, but there's nothing on-premise about that. You can bring them to the cloud. So you have to understand how much money that is in that pool. Because with SaaS on the application side, remember, we don't sell you a new license. You no longer renew your support, and you start renting SaaS licenses and the service all bundled together. So in this case, to the extent that -- and by the way, I just want to be clear. Customers have the option, if they don't want to bring their own license, want to buy, to rent licensees through PaaS. That's also available to them. But financially for both them and us, it actually works out best if they bring those licenses. And the unlimited agreements can bring in unlimited amount of licenses into our cloud as well as continued to use whatever they've got still on private's at their own site, while continuing to pay support and buying additional licensees.  So the math is more complete and very profitable for both us and the customer."

So to the point that Safra's bringing up, I mean, you have a choice to using whatever currency you'd like. You can buy as a license, which means customers buy us one time as a traditional license agreement and can bring that to the cloud. Then you can bring it to the cloud in a couple of different ways. If you're one of these highly regulated environments , you can bring to the cloud, utilizing the cloud machine, which is a very effective way of getting most of the benefits of the cloud, without having to go through some of the hoops I just described a few minutes ago. Or you can bring that license all the way to the Oracle public cloud.  Some customers frankly use it as a continuum. Because back to Larry's earlier point about the autonomous database, it isn't just about the flexibility of how you pay for it. The benefits now, most of our customers have the opportunity to the autonomous database is just simply get out of patching. that makes it sound like a really trivial issue when you say that on a conference call . it is huge for our customers. I've sit in rooms with CEOs talking about, how the heck do I get out of this damn patching? Some of our customers have 12-month lag time between the release of a patch and when they can get it implemented, at least ] a patch from us when they get it implemented. This autonomous database actually eliminates all of that. It eliminates all of the labor they may have on-premise actually with DBAs and so forth that are actually running these databases. And we're trying to give the customer we think now exactly what they want. They can take advantage of this either on-premise. They can now take advantage of the Oracle cloud and their data center with cloud machine. Or they can bring it to the Oracle public cloud. if you want to buy it as a license, you want to buy as a cloud service, it's totally up to you. So that's been our strategy, . And frankly to Safra's point about the economic model, we're fine either way the customer wants to do it. And so that's our strategy. And I think my opinion, for what it's worth, is whether that shows up on the license and then brought to [ our cloud], that's great for us. Whether it's deployed on the cloud machine, and granted Larry's point about the latency between order, booking and eventual deployment, it is what it is for a short period of time. But that's just yet another thing that differentiates us from what anybody else can do in the marketplace today. I hope that helps."

So our pipeline is bigger than it's -- actually, growth in pipeline is as it sits this second toward the end of the year is just superb. I don't want to go further than that. I'm just really pleased with the progress and the number of opportunities we're getting to participate in. And that gets to competitive dynamics. If a customer wants SaaS ERP, there really isn't a competitive dynamic. So it's really us. So we really lead in that category. the era son we lead is because there's in the because there's nobody else, full stop. Now to the degree that HCM and HCM is combined with ERP, which is just becoming more and more the fashion of what you're seeing, then we're obviously significantly advantaged. We have a competitor in SaaS HCM. We don't have a competitor in SaaS ERP. Now the other thing I'd say that's an issue is for us over the last couple of years is getting out of our traditional base. We're getting better and better at now, because historically if you went back 6, 7 years ago, we typically call on the Oracle base of customers. And the other traditional older on-premise ERP company, SAP, once you bought SAP, once you bought Oracle, those people didn't move calling on the other customers. That's all changing now. So now it's customers getting more aware of the difference between the traditional on-premise ERP and a new SaaS ERP. We get a chance now to compete for their -- these competitor customers that frankly, we haven't had that a chance to compete for, if you will, in the older generation of applications. so I don't have [indiscernible]. those dynamics change because all [indiscernible] on this call think about the United States of America. The further you get from the United States of America, the better the dynamics become for us. Because of our global distribution, because of our global footprint, because of our global presence, because of our global references, because of our ability to deploy in multiple SaaS data centers around the world we're even more advantaged with the further away you got from the United States. So why am optimistic? I'm optimistic because we got great products. We got a competitive product lead in the most important application segment in the world, which is ERP. We're about to go live with our applications internally and financials, which now we've gone with HCM. we've gone live with other applications. Now we have our product in Oracle. We're just in a great position. I know that's sounds like hype, and I hope that -- I actually believe this. So this is what's going on in the marketplace, and one of the reasons why in our company, if you were inside our company and our apps group, you'd feel the sort of confidence and swagger you see around our apps group today."

I'll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. Customer adoption of our cloud products and services continues to be very strong, and what we have called our on-premise business remains robust. Bottom line, our transition to the cloud is going well.  Despite the currency benefit being less than my guidance, total revenue was more than the high end of my guidance range, and earnings per share was at the high end, even at a higher tax rate than expected.
Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 47% from last year. Fusion cloud revenue was up 56% for the quarter. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter was $398 million, up 20% from last year. But just as a reminder, part of the Cloud Paas and IaaS business is our legacy hosting services, which don't share the same high growth characteristics as PaaS and next-gen IaaS services. This portion of PaaS, IaaS saw growth of 46% in CD and 49% in USD, while the traditional hosting services, which we are defocusing, were down nearly 10%. As traditional hosting services become a smaller part of total PaaS and IaaS, the underlying growth of PaaS and next-gen IaaS will be more visible. 
I want to also take a moment to review the announcements we made in October of bring your own licenses, what we call BYOL, and autonomous database. Unlike the applications business, where customers move to SaaS subscriptions, stock buying upfront licenses and shelve their application support, BYOL customers can leverage their years of investment in Oracle Database and technology software and bring those licenses to the Oracle Cloud infrastructure instead of canceling their licenses and support and moving to rent new licenses. With BYOL, we are seeing a strong increase in our technology installed base as customers renew their unlimited license agreements, invest in more licenses and options and renew support.
Because BYOL is now available and customers better understand their transition options to move to the Oracle Cloud, technology new software license revenue is dramatically improving from the declines we were seeing previously. We expect this trend to continue as we roll out autonomous database as customers license the options and technology they need. We expect to continue to take share in database.
Now total cloud and software revenues were $7.8 billion, up 7% in constant currency and up 9% in U.S. dollars. In fact, we've consistently overachieved our software and cloud revenue forecast the last 7 quarters. I focus on these numbers, which we refer to as the ecosystem revenues because that is where all of our software assets come together, and you can the start to see the powerful dynamics of the business, especially with our BYOL model.
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 39% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.3 billion, up 1% from last year, reflecting stable software license and continued high attach of support -- of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of customers.
GAAP application total revenues, which is new licenses and support and SaaS, were $2.7 billion, up 13%. And GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenues, which includes new license and support and PaaS and IaaS, were $5.1 billion, up 4%.
As for cloud margins, our SaaS business continues to scale and grow, and the gross margin has expanded to 66%, up from 59% last Q2. We expect to see further improvement in FY 2018, and we remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins.
The gross margin of Paas and IaaS was 40%, down from 44% last quarter as our geographic build-out goes forward in response to demand but ahead of the bulk of new revenue recognition. When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in Paas and IaaS gross margin.
Hardware revenues were $940 million, down 9%, and service revenues were $856 million, essentially unchanged in constant currency. Total non-GAAP revenues for the company were $9.6 billion, up 4% from last year and 6% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 8% from last year, 10% in U.S. dollars.
The operating margin was 44%, which was up from 42% last year. The operating margin has now increased year-over-year for 5 consecutive quarters, and while I can't promise this will happen every quarter, I do expect that operating margins will continue to expand.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was slightly higher than expected at 25.2%. As a result, EPS was $0.01 less at $0.70 a share in U.S. dollars, up 14% in USD, 12% in CD. The GAAP tax rate was 22.1% and GAAP EPS was $0.52.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.6 billion, up 2%, and free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.5 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $599 million. I expect the Cloud CapEx spending will be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS, IaaS build-out that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, should we see higher-than-expected ARR growth, we'd expect to see higher CapEx investments as well.
Now we have more than $71 billion in cash and marketable securities, but net of debt, our cash position is $10.9 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, up 6% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased nearly 41 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 74.5 million shares for a total of $3.5 billion. We also paid out dividends of nearly $3 billion. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by $12 billion and again, declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.
Now to the guidance for Q3. My guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. However, there have been some current -- there has been some current currency movement, and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue or $0.03 positive on EPS. So for Q3 in constant currency, cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, are expected to grow 21% to 25%. Total revenue is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.68 and $0.70. That puts the USD earnings per share at $0.71 to $0.73. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere around 24%. Of course, with the current and very real possibility of tax reform, the Q3 tax rate could easily end up being very different, especially to the extent that there is repatriation.
With that, I will turn over to Mark for his comments."

Just a few numbers: USD revenue was up 6%; Software and cloud revenue was up 9%; Operating income was up 10%; Net income was up 16%; EPS grew 14%. That's 3 quarters in a row where EPS growth has been over double digits.
To Safra's point about our apps ecosystem, our application revenue was up 13%. That is a GAAP CD number. We're growing roughly 3x as fast as the market. Now I've seen market numbers of 2, 3, 3.5, so depending on how you look at those numbers, we're more than 3x as fast as the market, maybe 4 with nearly 90% of that revenue being recurring on a trailing 12-month basis.
SaaS bookings was a strong quarter for us. We grew 42% in USD. That 42% accelerated, meaning the growth rate was higher than prior year. SaaS revenue was up 47 and over a $4.5 billion annualized run rate. ERP was up 66% organically. Overall ERP is now a $1.4 billion annual run rate. Fusion HCM, up 77%, more than double the growth rate of Workday. CX, double-digit growth with CX now at $1.1 billion annualized run rate. Data as a Service, up 47%. Our verticals were up 19%. That's on a compare of last year's growth of 125%. Our technologies ecosystem, that's on-premise license, on-premise support and our Paas and infrastructure revenue all together, was up 4% with solid cloud growth and new software license, which was essentially flat in the quarter.
In terms of our platform and infrastructure revenue, that was up 20%. Now there are a couple of things to call out here. As was mentioned first, inside our Paas and infrastructure is the legacy hosting business, which is declining. Second, we have Oracle Cloud Machine revenue, which is not yet reported, which we discussed last quarter. If we put it all together, the 49% growth Safra mentioned earlier, if all of that Oracle Cloud Machine had been provisioned, our revenue growth rate would have been above 55% in USD.
Business Analytics was up 104%, data integration up 88%, storage and compute Infrastructure as a Service both up triple digits. Cloud revenue grew 41% in USD, now over a $6 billion run rate, and 80% of that trailing 12-month software and cloud revenue is now recurring. Our cloud deferred revenue was up 33%.
Now just closing and looking forward, we're executing well on a big -- and our pipeline is the biggest we've ever had. And we expect to sell around $2 billion in SaaS ARR over the next 4 quarters, that being the second half of '18 and the first half of fiscal '19. Lastly, this was again another solid quarter from top line growth of 6% USD all the way down to the bottom of 14% EPS growth.
Let me give you a few customer names, wins we had in the quarter, and I'll just try to run through these quickly. But I think it's important for you to hear these brand names. In ERP cloud: Adventist Health, AXA, Banco Santander, CaixaBank, city of Las Vegas, ClubCorp, Emirates airlines, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, John Hancock, Johnson Controls, Intel, News Corp, Nissan Motor, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, the Bank of Nova Scotia, UCLA, Williams-Sonoma. In HCM: Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Association Générale, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Chicago Transit Authority, the city of Atlanta, Deutsche Post, EmblemHealth, Emirates air, Henry Ford Health System, Mars, Shell, Southwestern Energy Company, Treasury Wine Estate, Williams-Sonoma. Just a couple on the infrastructure platform side: Akamai, Allianz, Arconic, Baptist Healthcare System, city of Palm Beach, CEDS, Los Angeles County, Orange, SoftBank, Telia, University of Durham, U.S. Census Bureau, oilfield services, Zurich Insurance Group, a lot of logos. I could have gone on for a lot longer, but I just wanted to give you some context of the sorts of brands that are buying our cloud technologies.
With that, Larry's got some comments."

This coming January, Oracle will deliver the world's first autonomous database. We expect this innovative new technology to dramatically accelerate the growth of our PaaS and SaaS businesses and keep our database license business strong as well. People are buying database licenses to run on-premise and in the cloud. You can run them either place. They're buying options to run on-premise and in the cloud.
Okay, based on machine learning, the new autonomous version of the Oracle Database is totally automated, a self-driving system that does not require human beings to either manage or tune the database. Using artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error, the Oracle Autonomous Database delivers an unprecedented 99.995% system availability. That's less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year.
To achieve that level of reliability, the Oracle Autonomous Database automatically tunes and upgrades itself without human intervention. If a security vulnerability is detected, the database automatically and immediately [ patches ] itself while the system is running. AWS databases can't do any of this.
Even more compelling is the cost comparison between running the Oracle Autonomous Database versus running an Amazon database like Redshift. In a series of published benchmark tests, the Amazon Redshift database on average costs 5x more to run the same exact amount of work as the Oracle Autonomous Database. Let me repeat that. If you take out workload from Amazon running on Redshift and move it over to Oracle, your Amazon bill will drop by 80%. You're 5x -- it costs you 5x more to run Redshift than to run the Oracle Autonomous. And not -- this is not total cost of ownership. This is not labor. This is your Amazon bill, what you pay Amazon to do a -- to do this -- a piece of work you can run on the Oracle Cloud and take 20 cents on the dollar by moving from Amazon to Oracle.
We're so confident of our cost advantages over Amazon that Oracle will provide our customers with written service level agreements that guarantee, that guarantee moving to the Oracle Cloud will cut Amazon's customer's database bills in half or substantially more than in half.
So Ken, all good."

Well, listen, I mean, the good thing is it's sort of all of our technologies when you started. So we have customers that use it for ERP, for HCM. And it really, Mark, fits more into markets where industries, where you have regulatory issues. So if you get into banking and pharma, you have more of these security issues. I won't go through all of them in detail. And so in many cases, it's easier for some of the big banks, some of the big pharma companies and frankly, even in telecommunications where you see it's easier to get -- instead of getting through those rags. We're just taking all the advantages of cloud. So let me just go through this, Mark. You get really all of the price advantages. You're buying variably. You take -- we do all of the work. We do all of the patching. The customer really doesn't touch this, so they get the benefits of cloud on one hand while not having to deal with some of what the regulatory issues might be on the other hand. The downside is what Larry went through. We have to actually physically go in and implement this, and there's some extra work that might be done as opposed to just hooking up directly into our cloud. Does that help you?"

One, I was not trying to confuse what I thought this year's physical bookings in cloud would be with rolling 4 quarters' SaaS ARR bookings would be. So those are 2 separate numbers. And I'm glad the way you worded it because I must have said it right. The $2 billion is a forward-looking next rolling 4 quarters of SaaS bookings. And I think that's more than anybody's going to be even close to that sort of bookings number, but obviously, we'll see. So we think that's going to be very, very impressive. What is going to happen on the overall ecosystem? As you probably know, and I know I've said before, most of what's in our revenue base today did not come from our on-prem user base. Most came from competitors or came from companies that really are in their first set of applications, mid-market companies, fast growth companies, et cetera. So what I think does happen is -- just to make sure you understand, I think we said it before, but Oracle actually goes live on cloud financials right at the turn of the calendar year. So our E-Business Suite base, which is not the predominant piece of our Cloud SaaS base, we'll see this as a big, big move. So we are hopeful, when you talk about the entire ecosystem, that, actually, we'll start to see a higher degree of Oracle's user base moving. And I want to emphasize again, that is a good thing. We get materially more revenue when a customer moves from support of their existing on-prem applications to now SaaS. And that is roughly 3x or more the ARR. And the 3x, I want to emphasize again, is the equivalent of a like-for-like support compared to their new applications in the cloud. So what do I expect happens in the ecosystem? I think the ecosystem actually goes faster as a result of everything I described. Most of our base today did not come from the Oracle base, the Oracle base now with more and more references to move certainly our latest releases, which is now Release 13, more feature rich than we -- anything obviously we ever had before, Heather. And as that support base moves to cloud, we actually get more revenue, and as a result, the ecosystem grows faster."

So every, Oh, let me move out the Oracle Database.

By the way, Brad, one important thing to note is I don't really care whether we denominate that in Platform-as-a-Service or, if you will, Database-as-a-Service licenses, Larry went into one example of a license deal, and/or database support. And I think when you look at that aggregated the ecosystem, I just -- with these stories, I'd just love somebody show up with something more than a story. Just show up with a number, and I -- all we do is keep showing up every single quarter with math that says, okay, could be true, but whether it's -- Larry's talking about Redshift, I brought up this other guy, just look at the list of competitors out there, and I just don't see growth rates that, certainly, nobody gaining share over us.

So I think we -- and what happens is you start to get really major economies of scale as you -- once your setup is basically set up straight and ready to go.

So all of that, that BYOL is a fundamental change and is significantly different from how SaaS works. And that's what I tried to explain. In SaaS, you are now doing a SaaS subscription. You are no longer using your license. You don't need to buy more licenses, and you shelve your support. With BYOL, you buy a new -- you buy additional licenses. You bring them to our cloud, and you continue to pay support. And that is going to be very significant going forward.

So as our unlimited agreements are starting to expire, that they could have historically -- if they thought, ""Oh, I'm going to rent all my licenses going forward. There's no point in owning them,"" they would have certified those licenses and stopped buying additional and renewing unlimited agreements. So what they've now seen is their pathway with BYOL gives them complete flexibility of when they are ready to move to the cloud but that there is a benefit in owning your licenses and buying more and renewing support. So customers move to the cloud when it makes sense for them. Autonomous database, which is coming out just in a little while here, that's going to be of an enormous driver for customers to actually move their important workloads to the cloud.

And then the Autonomous Database then the rolls out and begins to scale in January. So a lot of customers, their first experience moving -- the first big move of Oracle customers' databases to the cloud really will begin in January. There's been no big migration any place of Oracle databases into anyone's cloud, including ours. There's been some, but it's a relatively very, very small business. This all begins to happen starting in January, where the capabilities in the cloud are so much better, the economics in the cloud are so much better than what's available on-premise that we think our customers are going to move very, very rapidly to the cloud.

So there are a few things going on here. Remember, when you bring your own license to Oracle IaaS, you -- the service you purchase is more expensive than the basic IaaS because you get all of the autonomous -- all of the capability you wouldn't otherwise get, first of all. But you cannot divorce the margin of just IaaS without remembering that both licenses are being purchased and support is continuously paid. That's why you heard me say -- maybe you heard me say the so-called on-premise license because it's actually -- now that we've launched BYOL, it is actually a misnomer because the customer is -- it's currently categorized on our income statement as on-premise software and support for that matter. Those are called on-premise, but there's nothing on-premise about them. You can bring them to the cloud. So you have to understand how much money in that pool because with SaaS on the application side, remember, we don't sell you a new license. You no longer renew your support, and you start renting SaaS licenses and the service all bundled together. So in this case, to the extent that -- and by the way, I just want to be clear. Customers have the option, if they don't want to bring their own license, to buy, to rent licenses through PaaS. That's also available to them. But financially for both them and us, it actually works out best if they bring those licenses. And those with unlimited agreements can bring in unlimited amount of licenses to our cloud as well as continue to use whatever they've got still on-premise at their own site while continuing to pay support and buying additional licensees. So the math is more complete and very profitable for both us and the customer."

So to the point that Safra's bringing up, I mean, you have a choice to using whatever currency you'd like. You can buy as a license, which means the customers buys onetime as a traditional license transaction and can bring that to the cloud. And you can bring it to the cloud a couple of different ways. If you're in one of these highly regulated environments like I described, you can bring it to the cloud, utilizing the Cloud Machine, which is a very effective way of getting most of the benefits of the cloud without having to go through some of the hoops I described a few minutes ago, or you can bring that license all the way to the Oracle Public Cloud. Some customers, frankly, use it as a continuum because back to Larry's earlier point about the Autonomous Database, it isn't just about the flexibility of how you pay for it. The benefits now -- most of our customers now have the opportunity with the Autonomous Database to simply get out of patching. That may sound like a really trivial issue when you say that on a conference call, an analyst. It is huge to all our customers. I sit in rooms with CEOs talking about, ""How the heck do I get out of this damn patching?"" Some of our customers have 12-month lag time between the release of a patch and when they can get it implemented. The release of a patch from us and when they get it implemented, this Autonomous Database actually eliminates all of that. It eliminates all of the labor they may have on-premise, actually DBAs and so forth that are actually running these databases, and we try and give the customer, we think, now exactly what they want. They can take advantage of this either on-premise. They can now take advantage of the Oracle Cloud in their data center with a Cloud Machine, or they can bring it to the Oracle Public Cloud. And if you want to buy it as a license, you want to buy it as a cloud service, it's totally up to you. So that's been our strategy, Phil. And frankly, to Safra's point about the economic model, we're fine either way the customer wants to do it. And so that's our strategy. And I think my opinion, for what it's worth, is whether that shows up on a license and then brought to our cloud, that's great for us. Whether deployed on the Cloud Machine and granted Larry's point about the latency between order, booking and eventual deployment, it is what it is for a short period of time. But that's just yet another thing that differentiates us from what anybody else can do in the market today. I hope that helps."

I'm not sure that the final rate has been set and whether it'll actually even stay in the bill. So we hope it does. We hope they do move to a territorial system. It will make us more competitive, and we look forward to that."

Well, as I've said several times, I really look through starting with [ like just our ] pipeline. So our pipeline is bigger than it's -- or actually, growth in pipeline, Kirk, is just, as it sits this second towards the end of the year, is just superb. I don't want to go farther than that. I'm just really pleased with the progress in the number of opportunities we're getting to participate in. And that gets to competitive dynamics. If a customer wants SaaS ERP, there really isn't a competitive dynamic. So it's really us. So we really lead in that category. And the reason we lead is because there's nobody else, full stop. Now to the degree in HCM that HCM is combined with an ERP, which is becoming more and more the fashion of what you're seeing, then we're obviously significantly advantaged. We have a competitor in SaaS HCM. We don't have a competitor in SaaS ERP. Now the other thing I'd say that's an issue is for us, over the last couple years, is getting out of our traditional base. We're getting better and better at now because, historically, if you went back 6, 7 years ago, we typically call on the Oracle base of customers. And the other traditional older on-premise ERP company, SAP, once you bought SAP, once you bought Oracle, those people didn't move calling on the other customers. That's all changing now. So now it's customers getting more aware of the difference between a traditional on-premise ERP and a new, modern SaaS ERP. We get a chance now to compete for their -- these competitor customers that, frankly, we haven't had a chance to compete for, if you will, in the older generation of applications. So I don't know if that helps in the dynamics. By the way, those dynamics change because all of us usually on this call think about the United States of America. The farther you get from the United States of America, the better the dynamics become for us. Because of our global distribution, because of our global footprint, because of our global presence, because of our global references, because of our ability to deploy in multiple SaaS data centers around the world, we're even more advantaged the farther away you get from the United States. So why am I optimistic? I'm optimistic because we have great products. We got a competitive product lead in the most important application segment in the world, which is ERP. We're about to go live with our applications internally in Financials, which now we've already gone live with HCM. We've gone live with other applications. Now we'll have our flagship product automating Oracle. We're just in a great position. I know that sounds like hype, and I hope -- I actually believe this. So this is what's going on in the marketplace and one of the reasons why, in our company, if you were inside our company and our apps group, you'd feel the sort of confidence and swagger that you see around our apps group today."

I'll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. Customer adoption of our cloud products and services continues to be very strong, and what we have called our on-premise business remains robust. Bottom line, our transition to the cloud is going well. Despite the currency benefit being less than my guidance, total revenue was more than the high end of my guidance range, and earnings per share was at the high end, even at a higher tax rate than expected.
Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 47% from last year. Fusion cloud revenue was up 56% for the quarter. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter was $398 million, up 20% from last year. But just as a reminder, part of the Cloud Paas and IaaS business is our legacy hosting services, which don't share the same high growth characteristics as PaaS and next-gen IaaS services. This portion of PaaS, IaaS saw growth of 46% in CD and 49% in USD, while the traditional hosting services, which we are defocusing, were down nearly 10%. As traditional hosting services become a smaller part of total PaaS and IaaS, the underlying growth of PaaS and next-gen IaaS will be more visible. 
I want to also take a moment to review the announcements we made in October of bring your own licenses, what we call BYOL, and autonomous database. Unlike the applications business, where customers move to SaaS subscriptions, stock buying upfront licenses and shelve their application support, BYOL customers can leverage their years of investment in Oracle Database and technology software and bring those licenses to the Oracle Cloud infrastructure instead of canceling their licenses and support and moving to rent new licenses. With BYOL, we are seeing a strong increase in our technology installed base as customers renew their unlimited license agreements, invest in more licenses and options and renew support.
Because BYOL is now available and customers better understand their transition options to move to the Oracle Cloud, technology new software license revenue is dramatically improving from the declines we were seeing previously. We expect this trend to continue as we roll out autonomous database as customers license the options and technology they need. We expect to continue to take share in database.
Now total cloud and software revenues were $7.8 billion, up 7% in constant currency and up 9% in U.S. dollars. In fact, we've consistently overachieved our software and cloud revenue forecast the last 7 quarters. I focus on these numbers, which we refer to as the ecosystem revenues because that is where all of our software assets come together, and you can the start to see the powerful dynamics of the business, especially with our BYOL model.
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 39% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.3 billion, up 1% from last year, reflecting stable software license and continued high attach of support -- of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of customers.
GAAP application total revenues, which is new licenses and support and SaaS, were $2.7 billion, up 13%. And GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenues, which includes new license and support and PaaS and IaaS, were $5.1 billion, up 4%.
As for cloud margins, our SaaS business continues to scale and grow, and the gross margin has expanded to 66%, up from 59% last Q2. We expect to see further improvement in FY 2018, and we remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins.
The gross margin of Paas and IaaS was 40%, down from 44% last quarter as our geographic build-out goes forward in response to demand but ahead of the bulk of new revenue recognition. When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in Paas and IaaS gross margin.
Hardware revenues were $940 million, down 9%, and service revenues were $856 million, essentially unchanged in constant currency. Total non-GAAP revenues for the company were $9.6 billion, up 4% from last year and 6% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 8% from last year, 10% in U.S. dollars.
The operating margin was 44%, which was up from 42% last year. The operating margin has now increased year-over-year for 5 consecutive quarters, and while I can't promise this will happen every quarter, I do expect that operating margins will continue to expand.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was slightly higher than expected at 25.2%. As a result, EPS was $0.01 less at $0.70 a share in U.S. dollars, up 14% in USD, 12% in CD. The GAAP tax rate was 22.1% and GAAP EPS was $0.52.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.6 billion, up 2%, and free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.5 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $599 million. I expect the Cloud CapEx spending will be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS, IaaS build-out that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, should we see higher-than-expected ARR growth, we'd expect to see higher CapEx investments as well.
Now we have more than $71 billion in cash and marketable securities, but net of debt, our cash position is $10.9 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, up 6% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased nearly 41 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 74.5 million shares for a total of $3.5 billion. We also paid out dividends of nearly $3 billion. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by $12 billion and again, declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.
Now to the guidance for Q3. My guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. However, there have been some current -- there has been some current -- there has been some currency movement, and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue or $0.03 positive on EPS. 
So for Q3 in constant currency, cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, are expected to grow 21% to 25%. Total revenue is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.68 and $0.70. That puts the USD earnings per share at $0.71 to $0.73. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere around 24%. Of course, with the current and very real possibility of tax reform, the Q3 tax rate could easily end up being very different, especially to the extent that there is repatriation.
With that, I will turn over to Mark for his comments."

Just a few numbers: USD revenue was up 6%; software and cloud revenue was up 9%; operating income was up 10%; net income was up 16%; EPS grew 14%. That's 3 quarters in a row where EPS growth has been over double digits.
To Safra's point about our apps ecosystem, our application revenue was up 13%. That is a GAAP CD number. We're growing roughly 3x as fast as the market. 
[Audio Gap]
Now I've seen market numbers of 2, 3, 3.5, so depending on how you look at those numbers, we're more than 3x as fast as the market, maybe 4 with nearly 90% of that revenue being recurring on a trailing 12-month basis.
SaaS bookings was a strong quarter for us. We grew 42% in USD. That 42% accelerated, meaning the growth rate was higher than prior year. SaaS revenue was up 47 and over a $4.5 billion annualized run rate. ERP was up 66% organically. Overall ERP is now a $1.4 billion annual run rate. Fusion HCM, up 77%, more than double the growth rate of Workday. CX, double-digit growth with CX now at $1.1 billion annualized run rate. Data as a Service, up 47%. Our verticals were up 19%. That's on a compare of last year's growth of 125%. 
Our Technologies ecosystem, that's on-premise license, on-premise support and our PaaS and infrastructure revenue all together, was up 4% with solid cloud growth and new software license, which was essentially flat in the quarter.
In terms of our platform and infrastructure revenue, that was up 20%. Now there are a couple of things to call out here. As was mentioned first, inside our Paas and infrastructure is the legacy hosting business, which is declining. Second, we have Oracle Cloud Machine revenue, which is not yet reported, which we discussed last quarter. If we put it all together, the 49% growth Safra mentioned earlier, if all of that Oracle Cloud Machine had been provisioned, our revenue growth rate would have been above 55% in USD.
Business Analytics was up 104%, data integration up 88%, storage and compute Infrastructure as a Service both up triple digits. Cloud revenue grew 41% in USD, now over a $6 billion run rate, and 80% of that trailing 12-month software and cloud revenue is now recurring. Our cloud deferred revenue was up 33%.
Now just closing and looking forward, we're executing well on a big -- and our pipeline is the biggest we've ever had. And we expect to sell around $2 billion in SaaS ARR over the next 4 quarters, that being the second half of '18 and the first half of fiscal '19. Lastly, this was again another solid quarter from top line growth of 6% USD all the way down to the bottom of 14% EPS growth.
Let me give you a few customer names, wins we had in the quarter, and I'll just try to run through these quickly. But I think it's important for you to hear these brand names. In ERP cloud: Adventist Health, AXA, Banco Santander, CaixaBank, City of Las Vegas, ClubCorp, Emirates airlines, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, John Hancock, Johnson Controls, Intel, News Corp, Nissan Motor, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, the Bank of Nova Scotia, UCLA, Williams-Sonoma. 
In HCM: Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Association Générale, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Chicago Transit Authority, the City of Atlanta, Deutsche Post, EmblemHealth, Emirates air, Henry Ford Health System, Mars, Shell, Southwestern Energy Company, Treasury Wine Estate, Williams-Sonoma. 
Just a couple on the infrastructure platform side: Akamai, Allianz, Arconic, Baptist Healthcare System, City of Palm Beach, CEDS, Los Angeles County, Orange, SoftBank, Telia, University of Durham, U.S. Census Bureau, World Fuel Services, Zurich Insurance Group, a lot of logos. I could have gone on for a lot longer, but I just wanted to give you some context of the sorts of brands that are buying our cloud technologies.
With that, Larry's got some comments."

This coming January, Oracle will deliver the world's first autonomous database. We expect this innovative new technology to dramatically accelerate the growth of our PaaS and SaaS businesses and keep our database license business strong as well. People are buying database licenses to run on-premise and in the cloud. You can run them either place. They're buying options to run on-premise and in the cloud.
Okay, based on machine learning, the new autonomous version of the Oracle Database is totally automated, a self-driving system that does not require human beings to either manage or tune the database. Using artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error, the Oracle Autonomous Database delivers an unprecedented 99.995% system availability. That's less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year.
To achieve that level of reliability, the Oracle Autonomous Database automatically tunes and upgrades itself without human intervention. If a security vulnerability is detected, the database automatically and immediately patches itself while the system is running. AWS databases can't do any of this.
Even more compelling is the cost comparison between running the Oracle Autonomous Database versus running an Amazon database like Redshift. In a series of published benchmark tests, the Amazon Redshift database on average costs 5x more to run the same exact amount of work as the Oracle Autonomous Database. Let me repeat that. If you take out workload from Amazon running on Redshift and move it over to Oracle, your Amazon bill will drop by 80%. 
You're 5x -- it costs you 5x more to run Redshift than to run the Oracle Autonomous. And not -- this is not total cost of ownership. This is not labor. This is your Amazon bill, what you pay Amazon to do a -- to do this -- a piece of work you can run on the Oracle Cloud and pay 20 cents on the dollar by moving from Amazon to Oracle.
We're so confident of our cost advantages over Amazon that Oracle will provide our customers with written service level agreements that guarantee, that guarantee moving to the Oracle Cloud will cut Amazon's customer's database bills in half or substantially more than in half.
So Ken, all good."

To provision the Oracle Cloud Machines, it's the responsibility of Oracle to deliver the cloud machines and the cloud software, and then the customers -- then we have to actually install these cloud machines in the customer's data center and hook up to the customer's network. And every customer is a little bit different, so it takes us a certain amount of time to configure the system on Oracle's side. But the big thing is the customer has to make -- get the appropriate networking gear and connect up the Oracle Cloud Machine into their network. And that's what's proven to take longer than we had first anticipated. But -- so we have a bit of a backlog from that. But it's a matter of, again, easy for us to shift -- everyone receives the same cloud hardware. That's easy for us to do. Everyone receives the same cloud software, but connecting it in the customer data center can vary from data center to data center. And that's what's taking the extra time."

So let me just go through this, Mark. You get really all of the price advantages. You're buying variably. You take -- we do all of the work. We do all of the patching. The customer really doesn't touch this, so they get the benefits of cloud on one hand while not having to deal with some of what the regulatory issues might be on the other hand. The downside is what Larry went through. We have to actually physically go in and implement this, and there's some extra work that might be done as opposed to just hooking up directly into our cloud.

One, I was not trying to confuse what I thought this year's fiscal bookings in cloud would be with rolling 4 quarters' SaaS ARR bookings would be. So those are 2 separate numbers. And I'm glad the way you worded it because I must have said it right. The $2 billion is a forward-looking next rolling 4 quarters of SaaS bookings. And I think that's more than anybody's going to be even close to that sort of bookings number, but obviously, we'll see. So we think that's going to be very, very impressive. What is going to happen on the overall ecosystem? As you probably know, and I know I've said before, most of what's in our revenue base today did not come from our on-prem user base. Most came from competitors or came from companies that really are in their first set of applications, mid-market companies, fast growth companies, et cetera. So what I think does happen is -- just to make sure you understand, I think we said it before, but Oracle actually goes live on cloud financials right at the turn of the calendar year. So our E-Business Suite base, which is not the predominant piece of our Cloud SaaS base, will see this as a big, big move. So we are hopeful, when you talk about the entire ecosystem, that, actually, we'll start to see a higher degree of Oracle's user base moving. And I want to emphasize again, that is a good thing. We get materially more revenue when a customer moves from support of their existing on-prem applications to now SaaS. And that is roughly 3x or more the ARR. And the 3x, I want to emphasize again, is the equivalent of a like-for-like support compared to their new applications in the cloud. So what do I expect happens in the ecosystem? I think the ecosystem actually grows faster as a result of everything I described. Most of our base today did not come from the Oracle base, the Oracle base now with more and more references to move certainly our latest releases, which is now Release 13, more feature rich than we -- anything obviously we ever had before, Heather. And as that support base moves to cloud, we actually get more revenue, and as a result, the ecosystem grows faster."

And when you see us throwing up yet again another growth rate above market, it's just any of these sort of stories, anecdotes -- by the way, I've heard them for 7 years, right, that -- yes and predates me. So everyone's, ""Oh, everyone's moving off the Oracle Database,"" or, ""What do you think of this guy or that guy and the latest guy somebody told me, what do you think of -- what's that company that -- MongoDB, right?"" I said, the only thing I remember about MongoDB is 3 numbers: 100, 200, 100. That's their revenue, $100 million. $200 million were their expenses, and $100 million was their losses. And so I have that implanted in my brain. And the $100 million as a part of $40 billion seems really small to me. I don't know, maybe it's different to you, your math -- you're numerate as well. So just I look at our numbers, and I look at us growing faster than market. And it's now been going on a while. By the way, Brad, one important thing to note is I don't really care whether we denominate that in Platform-as-a-Service or, if you will, Database-as-a-Service licenses, Larry went into one example of a license deal, and/or database support. And I think when you look at that aggregated the ecosystem, I just -- with these stories, I'd just love somebody show up with something more than a story. Just show up with a number, and I -- all we do is keep showing up every single quarter with math that says, okay, could be true, but whether it's -- Larry's talking about Redshift, I brought up this other guy, just look at the list of competitors out there, and I just don't see growth rates that, certainly, nobody gaining share over us.

So all of that, that BYOL is a fundamental change and is significantly different from how SaaS works. And that's what I tried to explain. In SaaS, you are now doing a SaaS subscription. You are no longer using your license. You don't need to buy more licenses, and you shelve your support. With BYOL, you buy a new -- you buy additional licenses. You bring them to our cloud, and you continue to pay support. And that is going to be very significant going forward.

So as their unlimited agreements are starting to expire, that they could have historically -- if they thought, ""Oh, I'm going to rent all my licenses going forward. There's no point in owning them,"" they would have certified those licenses and stopped buying additional and renewing unlimited agreements. So what they've now seen is their pathway with BYOL gives them complete flexibility of when they are ready to move to the cloud but that there is a benefit in owning your licenses and buying more and renewing support. So customers move to the cloud when it makes sense for them. Autonomous database, which is coming out just in a little while here, that's going to be of an enormous driver for customers to actually move their important workloads to the cloud.

So there are a few things going on here. Remember, when you bring your own license to Oracle IaaS, you -- the service you purchase is more expensive than the basic IaaS because you get all of the autonomous -- all of the capability you wouldn't otherwise get, first of all. But you cannot divorce the margin of just IaaS without remembering that both licenses are being purchased and support is continuously paid. That's why you heard me say -- maybe you heard me say the so-called on-premise license because it's actually -- now that we've launched BYOL, it is actually a misnomer because the customer is -- it's currently categorized on our income statement as on-premise software and support for that matter. Those are called on-premise, but there's nothing on-premise about them. You can bring them to the cloud. So you have to understand how much money -- in that pool because with SaaS on the application side, remember, we don't sell you a new license. You no longer renew your support, and you start renting SaaS licenses and the service all bundled together. So in this case, to the extent that -- and by the way, I just want to be clear. Customers have the option, if they don't want to bring their own license, to buy, to rent licenses through PaaS. That's also available to them. But financially for both them and us, it actually works out best if they bring those licenses. And those with unlimited agreements can bring in unlimited amount of licenses to our cloud as well as continue to use whatever they've got still on-premise at their own site while continuing to pay support and buying additional licensees. So the math is more complete and very profitable for both us and the customer."

So to the point that Safra's bringing up, I mean, you have a choice to using whatever currency you'd like. You can buy as a license, which means the customers buys onetime as a traditional license transaction and can bring that to the cloud. And you can bring it to the cloud a couple of different ways. If you're in one of these highly regulated environments like I described, you can bring it to the cloud, utilizing the Cloud Machine, which is a very effective way of getting most of the benefits of the cloud without having to go through some of the hoops I described a few minutes ago, or you can bring that license all the way to the Oracle Public Cloud. Some customers, frankly, use it as a continuum because back to Larry's earlier point about the Autonomous Database, it isn't just about the flexibility of how you pay for it. The benefits now -- most of our customers now have the opportunity with the Autonomous Database to simply get out of patching. That may sound like a really trivial issue when you say that on a conference call, an analyst. It is huge to all our customers. I sit in rooms with CEOs talking about, ""How the heck do I get out of this d*** patching?"" Some of our customers have 12-month lag time between the release of a patch and when they can get it implemented. The release of a patch from us and when they get it implemented, this Autonomous Database actually eliminates all of that. It eliminates all of the labor they may have on-premise, actually DBAs and so forth that are actually running these databases, and we try and give the customer, we think, now exactly what they want. They can take advantage of this either on-premise. They can now take advantage of the Oracle Cloud in their data center with a Cloud Machine, or they can bring it to the Oracle Public Cloud. And if you want to buy it as a license, you want to buy it as a cloud service, it's totally up to you. So that's been our strategy, Phil. And frankly, to Safra's point about the economic model, we're fine either way the customer wants to do it. And so that's our strategy. And I think my opinion, for what it's worth, is whether that shows up on a license and then brought to our cloud, that's great for us. Whether deployed on the Cloud Machine and granted Larry's point about the latency between order, booking and eventual deployment, it is what it is for a short period of time.

Well, as I've said several times, I really look through starting with, like, just our pipeline. So our pipeline is bigger than it's -- or actually, growth in pipeline, Kirk, is just, as it sits this second towards the end of the year, is just superb. I don't want to go farther than that. I'm just really pleased with the progress in the number of opportunities we're getting to participate in. And that gets to competitive dynamics. If a customer wants SaaS ERP, there really isn't a competitive dynamic. So it's really us. So we really lead in that category. And the reason we lead is because there's nobody else, full stop. Now to the degree in HCM that HCM is combined with an ERP, which is becoming more and more the fashion of what we're seeing, then we're obviously significantly advantaged. We have a competitor in SaaS HCM. We don't have a competitor in SaaS ERP. Now the other thing I'd say that's an issue is for us, over the last couple years, is getting out of our traditional base. We're getting better and better at now because, historically, if you went back 6, 7 years ago, we typically call on the Oracle base of customers. And the other traditional older on-premise ERP company, SAP, once you bought SAP, once you bought Oracle, those people didn't move calling on the other customers. That's all changing now. So now it's customers getting more aware of the difference between a traditional on-premise ERP and a new, modern SaaS ERP. We get a chance now to compete for their -- these competitor customers that, frankly, we haven't had a chance to compete for, if you will, in the older generation of applications. So I don't know if that helps in the dynamics. By the way, those dynamics change because all of us usually on this call think about the United States of America. The farther you get from the United States of America, the better the dynamics become for us. Because of our global distribution, because of our global footprint, because of our global presence, because of our global references, because of our ability to deploy in multiple SaaS data centers around the world, we're even more advantaged the farther away you get from the United States. So why am I optimistic? I'm optimistic because we have great products. We got a competitive product lead in the most important application segment in the world, which is ERP. We're about to go live with our applications internally in Financials, which now we've already gone live with HCM. We've gone live with other applications. Now we'll have our flagship product automating Oracle. We're just in a great position. I know that sounds like hype, and I hope -- I actually believe this. So this is what's going on in the marketplace and one of the reasons why, in our company, if you were inside our company and our apps group, you'd feel the sort of confidence and swagger that you see around our apps group today."

I'll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. Customer adoption of our cloud products and services continues to be very strong, and what we have called our on-premise business remains robust. Bottom line, our transition to the cloud is going well. Despite the currency benefit being less than my guidance, total revenue was more than the high end of my guidance range, and earnings per share was at the high end, even at a higher tax rate than expected.
Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 47% from last year. Fusion cloud revenue was up 56% for the quarter. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter was $398 million, up 20% from last year. But just as a reminder, part of the Cloud Paas and IaaS business is our legacy hosting services, which don't share the same high growth characteristics as PaaS and next-gen IaaS services. This portion of PaaS, IaaS saw growth of 46% in CD and 49% in USD, while the traditional hosting services, which we are defocusing, were down nearly 10%. As traditional hosting services become a smaller part of total PaaS and IaaS, the underlying growth of PaaS and next-gen IaaS will be more visible. 
I want to also take a moment to review the announcements we made in October of bring your own licenses, what we call BYOL, and autonomous database. Unlike the applications business, where customers move to SaaS subscriptions, stock buying upfront licenses and shelve their application support, BYOL customers can leverage their years of investment in Oracle Database and technology software and bring those licenses to the Oracle Cloud infrastructure instead of canceling their licenses and support and moving to rent new licenses. With BYOL, we are seeing a strong increase in our technology installed base as customers renew their unlimited license agreements, invest in more licenses and options and renew support.
Because BYOL is now available and customers better understand their transition options to move to the Oracle Cloud, technology new software license revenue is dramatically improving from the declines we were seeing previously. We expect this trend to continue as we roll out autonomous database as customers license the options and technology they need. We expect to continue to take share in database.
Now total cloud and software revenues were $7.8 billion, up 7% in constant currency and up 9% in U.S. dollars. In fact, we've consistently overachieved our software and cloud revenue forecast the last 7 quarters. I focus on these numbers, which we refer to as the ecosystem revenues because that is where all of our software assets come together, and you can the start to see the powerful dynamics of the business, especially with our BYOL model.
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 39% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.3 billion, up 1% from last year, reflecting stable software license and continued high attach of support -- of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of customers.
GAAP application total revenues, which is new licenses and support and SaaS, were $2.7 billion, up 13%. And GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenues, which includes new license and support and PaaS and IaaS, were $5.1 billion, up 4%.
As for cloud margins, our SaaS business continues to scale and grow, and the gross margin has expanded to 66%, up from 59% last Q2. We expect to see further improvement in FY 2018, and we remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins.
The gross margin of Paas and IaaS was 40%, down from 44% last quarter as our geographic build-out goes forward in response to demand but ahead of the bulk of new revenue recognition. When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in Paas and IaaS gross margin.
Hardware revenues were $940 million, down 9%, and service revenues were $856 million, essentially unchanged in constant currency. Total non-GAAP revenues for the company were $9.6 billion, up 4% from last year and 6% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 8% from last year, 10% in U.S. dollars.
The operating margin was 44%, which was up from 42% last year. The operating margin has now increased year-over-year for 5 consecutive quarters, and while I can't promise this will happen every quarter, I do expect that operating margins will continue to expand.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was slightly higher than expected at 25.2%. As a result, EPS was $0.01 less at $0.70 a share in U.S. dollars, up 14% in USD, 12% in CD. The GAAP tax rate was 22.1% and GAAP EPS was $0.52.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.6 billion, up 2%, and free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.5 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $599 million. I expect the Cloud CapEx spending will be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS, IaaS build-out that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, should we see higher-than-expected ARR growth, we'd expect to see higher CapEx investments as well.
Now we have more than $71 billion in cash and marketable securities, but net of debt, our cash position is $10.9 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, up 6% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased nearly 41 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 74.5 million shares for a total of $3.5 billion. We also paid out dividends of nearly $3 billion. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by $12 billion and again, declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.
Now to the guidance for Q3. My guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. However, there have been some current -- there has been some current -- there has been some currency movement, and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue or $0.03 positive on EPS. 
So for Q3 in constant currency, cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, are expected to grow 21% to 25%. Total revenue is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.68 and $0.70. That puts the USD earnings per share at $0.71 to $0.73. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere around 24%. Of course, with the current and very real possibility of tax reform, the Q3 tax rate could easily end up being very different, especially to the extent that there is repatriation.
With that, I will turn over to Mark for his comments."

Just a few numbers: USD revenue was up 6%; software and cloud revenue was up 9%; operating income was up 10%; net income was up 16%; EPS grew 14%. That's 3 quarters in a row where EPS growth has been over double digits.
To Safra's point about our apps ecosystem, our application revenue was up 13%. That is a GAAP CD number. We're growing roughly 3x as fast as the market. 
[Audio Gap]
Now I've seen market numbers of 2, 3, 3.5, so depending on how you look at those numbers, we're more than 3x as fast as the market, maybe 4 with nearly 90% of that revenue being recurring on a trailing 12-month basis.
SaaS bookings was a strong quarter for us. We grew 42% in USD. That 42% accelerated, meaning the growth rate was higher than prior year. SaaS revenue was up 47 and over a $4.5 billion annualized run rate. ERP was up 66% organically. Overall ERP is now a $1.4 billion annual run rate. Fusion HCM, up 77%, more than double the growth rate of Workday. CX, double-digit growth with CX now at $1.1 billion annualized run rate. Data as a Service, up 47%. Our verticals were up 19%. That's on a compare of last year's growth of 125%. 
Our Technologies ecosystem, that's on-premise license, on-premise support and our PaaS and infrastructure revenue all together, was up 4% with solid cloud growth and new software license, which was essentially flat in the quarter.
In terms of our platform and infrastructure revenue, that was up 20%. Now there are a couple of things to call out here. As was mentioned first, inside our Paas and infrastructure is the legacy hosting business, which is declining. Second, we have Oracle Cloud Machine revenue, which is not yet reported, which we discussed last quarter. If we put it all together, the 49% growth Safra mentioned earlier, if all of that Oracle Cloud Machine had been provisioned, our revenue growth rate would have been above 55% in USD.
Business Analytics was up 104%, data integration up 88%, storage and compute Infrastructure as a Service both up triple digits. Cloud revenue grew 41% in USD, now over a $6 billion run rate, and 80% of that trailing 12-month software and cloud revenue is now recurring. Our cloud deferred revenue was up 33%.
Now just closing and looking forward, we're executing well on a big -- and our pipeline is the biggest we've ever had. And we expect to sell around $2 billion in SaaS ARR over the next 4 quarters, that being the second half of '18 and the first half of fiscal '19. Lastly, this was again another solid quarter from top line growth of 6% USD all the way down to the bottom of 14% EPS growth.
Let me give you a few customer names, wins we had in the quarter, and I'll just try to run through these quickly. But I think it's important for you to hear these brand names. In ERP cloud: Adventist Health, AXA, Banco Santander, CaixaBank, City of Las Vegas, ClubCorp, Emirates airlines, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, John Hancock, Johnson Controls, Intel, News Corp, Nissan Motor, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, the Bank of Nova Scotia, UCLA, Williams-Sonoma. 
In HCM: Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Association Générale, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Chicago Transit Authority, the City of Atlanta, Deutsche Post, EmblemHealth, Emirates air, Henry Ford Health System, Mars, Shell, Southwestern Energy Company, Treasury Wine Estate, Williams-Sonoma. 
Just a couple on the infrastructure platform side: Akamai, Allianz, Arconic, Baptist Healthcare System, City of Palm Beach, CEDS, Los Angeles County, Orange, SoftBank, Telia, University of Durham, U.S. Census Bureau, World Fuel Services, Zurich Insurance Group, a lot of logos. I could have gone on for a lot longer, but I just wanted to give you some context of the sorts of brands that are buying our cloud technologies.

This coming January, Oracle will deliver the world's first autonomous database. We expect this innovative new technology to dramatically accelerate the growth of our PaaS and SaaS businesses and keep our database license business strong as well. People are buying database licenses to run on-premise and in the cloud. You can run them either place. They're buying options to run on-premise and in the cloud.
Okay, based on machine learning, the new autonomous version of the Oracle Database is totally automated, a self-driving system that does not require human beings to either manage or tune the database. Using artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error, the Oracle Autonomous Database delivers an unprecedented 99.995% system availability. That's less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year.
To achieve that level of reliability, the Oracle Autonomous Database automatically tunes and upgrades itself without human intervention. If a security vulnerability is detected, the database automatically and immediately patches itself while the system is running. AWS databases can't do any of this.
Even more compelling is the cost comparison between running the Oracle Autonomous Database versus running an Amazon database like Redshift. In a series of published benchmark tests, the Amazon Redshift database on average costs 5x more to run the same exact amount of work as the Oracle Autonomous Database. Let me repeat that. If you take out workload from Amazon running on Redshift and move it over to Oracle, your Amazon bill will drop by 80%. 
You're 5x -- it costs you 5x more to run Redshift than to run the Oracle Autonomous. And not -- this is not total cost of ownership. This is not labor. This is your Amazon bill, what you pay Amazon to do a -- to do this -- a piece of work you can run on the Oracle Cloud and pay 20 cents on the dollar by moving from Amazon to Oracle.
We're so confident of our cost advantages over Amazon that Oracle will provide our customers with written service level agreements that guarantee, that guarantee moving to the Oracle Cloud will cut Amazon's customer's database bills in half or substantially more than in half.
So Ken, all good."

One, I was not trying to confuse what I thought this year's fiscal bookings in cloud would be with rolling 4 quarters' SaaS ARR bookings would be. So those are 2 separate numbers. And I'm glad the way you worded it because I must have said it right. The $2 billion is a forward-looking next rolling 4 quarters of SaaS bookings. And I think that's more than anybody's going to be even close to that sort of bookings number, but obviously, we'll see. So we think that's going to be very, very impressive. What is going to happen on the overall ecosystem? As you probably know, and I know I've said before, most of what's in our revenue base today did not come from our on-prem user base. Most came from competitors or came from companies that really are in their first set of applications, mid-market companies, fast growth companies, et cetera. So what I think does happen is -- just to make sure you understand, I think we said it before, but Oracle actually goes live on cloud financials right at the turn of the calendar year. So our E-Business Suite base, which is not the predominant piece of our Cloud SaaS base, will see this as a big, big move. So we are hopeful, when you talk about the entire ecosystem, that, actually, we'll start to see a higher degree of Oracle's user base moving. And I want to emphasize again, that is a good thing. We get materially more revenue when a customer moves from support of their existing on-prem applications to now SaaS. And that is roughly 3x or more the ARR. And the 3x, I want to emphasize again, is the equivalent of a like-for-like support compared to their new applications in the cloud. So what do I expect happens in the ecosystem? I think the ecosystem actually grows faster as a result of everything I described. Most of our base today did not come from the Oracle base, the Oracle base now with more and more references to move certainly our latest releases, which is now Release 13, more feature rich than we -- anything obviously we ever had before, Heather. And as that support base moves to cloud, we actually get more revenue, and as a result, the ecosystem grows faster."

And when you see us throwing up yet again another growth rate above market, it's just any of these sort of stories, anecdotes -- by the way, I've heard them for 7 years, right, that -- yes and predates me. So everyone's, ""Oh, everyone's moving off the Oracle Database,"" or, ""What do you think of this guy or that guy and the latest guy somebody told me, what do you think of -- what's that company that -- MongoDB, right?"" I said, the only thing I remember about MongoDB is 3 numbers: 100, 200, 100. That's their revenue, $100 million. $200 million were their expenses, and $100 million was their losses. And so I have that implanted in my brain. And the $100 million as a part of $40 billion seems really small to me. I don't know, maybe it's different to you, your math -- you're numerate as well. So just I look at our numbers, and I look at us growing faster than market. And it's now been going on a while. By the way, Brad, one important thing to note is I don't really care whether we denominate that in Platform-as-a-Service or, if you will, Database-as-a-Service licenses, Larry went into one example of a license deal, and/or database support. And I think when you look at that aggregated the ecosystem, I just -- with these stories, I'd just love somebody show up with something more than a story. Just show up with a number, and I -- all we do is keep showing up every single quarter with math that says, okay, could be true, but whether it's -- Larry's talking about Redshift, I brought up this other guy, just look at the list of competitors out there, and I just don't see growth rates that, certainly, nobody gaining share over us.

So all of that, that BYOL is a fundamental change and is significantly different from how SaaS works. And that's what I tried to explain. In SaaS, you are now doing a SaaS subscription. You are no longer using your license. You don't need to buy more licenses, and you shelve your support. With BYOL, you buy a new -- you buy additional licenses. You bring them to our cloud, and you continue to pay support. And that is going to be very significant going forward.

So as their unlimited agreements are starting to expire, that they could have historically -- if they thought, ""Oh, I'm going to rent all my licenses going forward. There's no point in owning them,"" they would have certified those licenses and stopped buying additional and renewing unlimited agreements. So what they've now seen is their pathway with BYOL gives them complete flexibility of when they are ready to move to the cloud but that there is a benefit in owning your licenses and buying more and renewing support. So customers move to the cloud when it makes sense for them. Autonomous database, which is coming out just in a little while here, that's going to be of an enormous driver for customers to actually move their important workloads to the cloud.

So a lot of customers, their first experience moving -- the first big move of Oracle customers' databases to the cloud really will begin in January. There's been no big migration any place of Oracle databases into anyone's cloud, including ours. There's been some, but it's a relatively very, very small business. This all begins to happen starting in January, where the capabilities in the cloud are so much better, the economics in the cloud are so much better than what's available on-premise that we think our customers are going to move very, very rapidly to the cloud.

So there are a few things going on here. Remember, when you bring your own license to Oracle IaaS, you -- the service you purchase is more expensive than the basic IaaS because you get all of the autonomous -- all of the capability you wouldn't otherwise get, first of all. But you cannot divorce the margin of just IaaS without remembering that both licenses are being purchased and support is continuously paid. That's why you heard me say -- maybe you heard me say the so-called on-premise license because it's actually -- now that we've launched BYOL, it is actually a misnomer because the customer is -- it's currently categorized on our income statement as on-premise software and support for that matter. Those are called on-premise, but there's nothing on-premise about them. You can bring them to the cloud. So you have to understand how much money -- in that pool because with SaaS on the application side, remember, we don't sell you a new license. You no longer renew your support, and you start renting SaaS licenses and the service all bundled together. So in this case, to the extent that -- and by the way, I just want to be clear. Customers have the option, if they don't want to bring their own license, to buy, to rent licenses through PaaS. That's also available to them. But financially for both them and us, it actually works out best if they bring those licenses. And those with unlimited agreements can bring in unlimited amount of licenses to our cloud as well as continue to use whatever they've got still on-premise at their own site while continuing to pay support and buying additional licensees. So the math is more complete and very profitable for both us and the customer."

I sit in rooms with CEOs talking about, ""How the heck do I get out of this d*** patching?"" Some of our customers have 12-month lag time between the release of a patch and when they can get it implemented. The release of a patch from us and when they get it implemented, this Autonomous Database actually eliminates all of that. It eliminates all of the labor they may have on-premise, actually DBAs and so forth that are actually running these databases, and we try and give the customer, we think, now exactly what they want. They can take advantage of this either on-premise. They can now take advantage of the Oracle Cloud in their data center with a Cloud Machine, or they can bring it to the Oracle Public Cloud. And if you want to buy it as a license, you want to buy it as a cloud service, it's totally up to you. So that's been our strategy, Phil. And frankly, to Safra's point about the economic model, we're fine either way the customer wants to do it. And so that's our strategy. And I think my opinion, for what it's worth, is whether that shows up on a license and then brought to our cloud, that's great for us. Whether deployed on the Cloud Machine and granted Larry's point about the latency between order, booking and eventual deployment, it is what it is for a short period of time. But that's just yet another thing that differentiates us from what anybody else can do in the market today. I hope that helps."

We haven't made any decisions about how we would use it. I believe that it is mandatory repatriation, so a tax will be due on all cash outside the United States for all of those companies. And I believe we'd need to book it or at least book an estimate for it in the quarter that the change -- that the tax law changes. That will make our tax rate look sort of strange, but of course, I'll disclose the amounts and all that. I'm not sure that the final rate has been set and whether it'll actually even stay in the bill. So we hope it does. We hope they do move to a territorial system. It will make us more competitive, and we look forward to that."

Well, as I've said several times, I really look through starting with, like, just our pipeline. So our pipeline is bigger than it's -- or actually, growth in pipeline, Kirk, is just, as it sits this second towards the end of the year, is just superb.",513,"Yes. Well, as I've said several times, I really look through starting with, like, just our pipeline. So our pipeline is bigger than it's -- or actually, growth in pipeline, Kirk, is just, as it sits this second towards the end of the year, is just superb. I don't want to go farther than that. I'm just really pleased with the progress in the number of opportunities we're getting to participate in. And that gets to competitive dynamics. If a customer wants SaaS ERP, there really isn't a competitive dynamic. So it's really us. So we really lead in that category. And the reason we lead is because there's nobody else, full stop. Now to the degree in HCM that HCM is combined with an ERP, which is becoming more and more the fashion of what we're seeing, then we're obviously significantly advantaged. We have a competitor in SaaS HCM. We don't have a competitor in SaaS ERP. Now the other thing I'd say that's an issue is for us, over the last couple years, is getting out of our traditional base. We're getting better and better at now because, historically, if you went back 6, 7 years ago, we typically call on the Oracle base of customers. And the other traditional older on-premise ERP company, SAP, once you bought SAP, once you bought Oracle, those people didn't move calling on the other customers. That's all changing now. So now it's customers getting more aware of the difference between a traditional on-premise ERP and a new, modern SaaS ERP. We get a chance now to compete for their -- these competitor customers that, frankly, we haven't had a chance to compete for, if you will, in the older generation of applications. So I don't know if that helps in the dynamics. By the way, those dynamics change because all of us usually on this call think about the United States of America. The farther you get from the United States of America, the better the dynamics become for us. Because of our global distribution, because of our global footprint, because of our global presence, because of our global references, because of our ability to deploy in multiple SaaS data centers around the world, we're even more advantaged the farther away you get from the United States. So why am I optimistic? I'm optimistic because we have great products. We got a competitive product lead in the most important application segment in the world, which is ERP. We're about to go live with our applications internally in Financials, which now we've already gone live with HCM. We've gone live with other applications. Now we'll have our flagship product automating Oracle. We're just in a great position. I know that sounds like hype, and I hope -- I actually believe this. So this is what's going on in the marketplace and one of the reasons why, in our company, if you were inside our company and our apps group, you'd feel the sort of confidence and swagger that you see around our apps group today."

When you look at the guidance for cloud growth rate and try to correlate against what Mark said with respect to SaaS ARR bookings growth, which looks to be about 40%, 50%, if you back that out of your cloud guidance for Q3, it looks like the IaaS, PaaS business, maybe it's a temporary thing as down to slightly flattish. So I just want to clarify that's the way we should be modeling the 2 different line items and how that -- we should be interpreting your cloud guidance."
