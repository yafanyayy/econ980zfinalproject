Today, I'm pleased to share with you an overview of our 2016 results and our outlook for 2017. I will also share with you our progress in advancing cleaner energy, improving the power grid and offering customers innovative products and options. Next, Robert will provide details on our 2016 results and 2017 guidance as well as review our regulatory schedule and comment on potential federal tax reform. 
We have [indiscernible] $1.88 non-GAAP earnings per share to [indiscernible] with the midpoint of our 2016 earnings guidance. This represents a 5% increase over comparable 2015 results on a non-GAAP temperature normalized basis. Although 2016 had its share of interesting temperature swings, it was on average normal for the year, so there's no need to temperature normalize our 2016 results. 
Also, please note on Slide 2, the 2016 non-GAAP results exclude the impact of the Franklin County charge of $0.23 per share recorded in the third quarter. 
We also issued earnings guidance for 2017, with the midpoint of $1.99 per share, a 6% increase over 2016's non-GAAP results, driven by earnings on our growing utility investments. Our earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings per share of $1.88. This long-term growth objective is supported by continued robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and is on a temperature normalized basis. 
We continue to make solid progress in providing cost-effective clean energy for our customers while building a smarter, more robust grid. We have a dynamic planning process that gives us the flexibility to adjust our capital plans as opportunities arise. So last evening, we issued an updated capital expenditure plan for 2017 through 2020 totaling $5.6 billion. The change from our November 2016 forecast are shown on Slide 3 and are primarily due to the acceleration, the timing of utility wind generation and IPL smart meter investments to enable customers to realize their benefits sooner. 
We began the transition of our generation fleet almost 1 decade ago, with the addition of utility owned wind and the planned retirements of our smaller, less efficient positive generating stations. And since 2010, we have retired or converted 1/3 of our coal-fired generation, moving us through our 2030 carbon emissions reduction target of 40%. Our generation fleet continues to transition to one that is cleaner and more efficient and major steps are underway to expand our natural gas generation. 
In Wisconsin, we are in the early stages of construction of the Riverside expansion and in Iowa, we are in the home stretch of the Marshalltown construction. The Marshalltown generated facilities is now almost complete, testing is going well and is expected to go in service by early April. Forecast of capital expenditures for the facility are approximately $670 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission, and it will own the authorized 11% ROE. We anticipate Marshalltown will be included in IPL's retail electric interim rates, which will be implemented 10 days after our rate filing in the second quarter. Marshalltown will be our most efficient facility to date, and is expected to have 60% less carbon emissions and 90% less water withdrawals when compared to the 2005 levels for the generating units it will replace. 
In Wisconsin, we broke ground for the Riverside expansion last September and expect that it will supply energy to our customers by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 703 megawatts and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. 
[indiscernible] letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of Riverside and we expect PSCW approvals of that agreement in the third quarter. These costs have been WPL's wholesale customers for decades and we are delighted that they will be our partners in Riverside. 
Our capital expenditure plan also includes an additional 900 megawatts of wind energy, of which 500 megawatts was approved by the Iowa utilities board last year. The terms that approval include a cost cap of $1,830 per KW, including AFUDC and transmission, a return equity of 11% for the life of the asset and a depreciable life of 40 years. We have selected GE as the wind turbine supplier for this expansion and acquired [indiscernible] up turbans from GE during the fourth quarter of 2016 to ensure all 900 megawatts of new wind is eligible for the full level of production tax credits. 
Power generation is the newest addition to our energy mix, and we continue to gain valuable expense on how fast to integrate it as well as storage into our electric system. We are currently receiving power from our 3 solar facilities, including Wisconsin's largest solar farm located at Campus, our learning laboratory at [indiscernible] Headquarters and the Indian Creek nature center in SEDAR Rapids, Iowa. Solar investments such as these as well as our planned solar collaboration with the city of Dubuque will help us meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributive forms of energy. 
The electric and gas distribution system continues to be an area of growing investments as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of the power delivery. [indiscernible] voltages and selective reliability improvements, such as expansion of our underground electric distribution network, are just some of our targeted investments. Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, which is giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas system while at the same time, continuing our pipeline safety program. This year, we plan to begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important component for a smarter and more resilient power grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages, 2-way energy flow and allow for remote connect and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter installation in 2019. 
We are making good progress in offering our customers innovative solutions and options. [indiscernible] approval for new residential customer offerings, including [indiscernible] pricing plans, a demand rate pilot, [indiscernible] auction and lower rates for renewable energy plans. We are also offering both Iowa and Wisconsin customers rebates for installation of charging stations. When we file the IPL retail electric base rate review, we plan to propose a number of product offerings for our Iowa customers as well. 
As I wrap up my remarks, I would like to briefly comment on federal initiatives and the impacts they may have on our industry and specifically, on Alliant Energy. As I mentioned earlier, the transition of our generation fleet started almost a decade ago. Our plan isn't based on an economic modernization of our generation fleet [indiscernible] more energy-efficient and lower emissions and water usage. Our plans were never predicated on a Clean Power Plan, but rather, they are based on providing our customers safe, reliable and cost competitive energy while improving the environment of the communities that we have a privilege to serve. The current debate on federal corporate tax reform is very important to our company and our customers, and we are very involved with this discussion. In general, lower tax rates should be beneficial to all. However, we must look at any tax reform in totality and not react to specific items. Robert will address how the current proposals would impact customers and share owners of Alliant Energy. 
On the various legislative and regulatory proposals, we will continue to engage with key local, state and federal stakeholders as well as customer industry groups, such as EEI, and navigate for our customers and share owners interest. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for the coming year. Our dedicated employees delivered a solid 2016, and will deliver 2017's financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout is 63.3% based on our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99 per share. We expect to complete projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner. We'll continue working with our regulators [indiscernible], environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner, continued focus on serving our customers and being partners in our communities, while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

We released year-end 2016 earnings last evening, with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.88 per share, which is $0.13 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings for year-end 2015. A summary of the year-over-y",1587,"Good morning, everyone. 
We released year-end 2016 earnings last evening, with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.88 per share, which is $0.13 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings for year-end 2015. A summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers may be found on Slides 4, 5 and 6. 
The major contributors of the year-over-year of the earnings growth were higher electric and gas margins and increased AFUDC related to the Marshalltown generating station. 
I'm Pleased to report that temperature normalized sales increased approximately 1% as forecasted. The commercial and industrial segments continue to be the largest sales growth classes year-over-year at both the utilities. For 2016, our earnings were not impacted by temperatures, but milder temperatures in 2015 resulted in a negative $0.04 per share variance. 
Before I move on to discuss 2017 guidance, I would like to point out that at the end of 2016, Alliant Energy's investment in ATC moved from WPL to one of our nonregulated facilities in accordance with the PSCW order. There was no impact to the Alliant Energy's consolidated financial statements as a result of the change, and we will continue including ATC's earnings with the utilities in future earnings release tables. 
Now let's briefly review our 2017 guidance. Last evening, we issued our consolidated 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 earnings per share. 
A walk from the 2016 non-GAAP EPS to the midpoint of the 2017 estimated guidance range is shown on Slide 7. The key drivers for the 6% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments, which are reflected in WPL's recently improved electric and gas retail rates as well as the infrastructure investments for IPL, which will be included in interim rates, which will go in effect 10 days after we filed a retail electric rate case in the second quarter of 2017. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes. 
During the past 7 years, we've been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rates flat. The recent rate base additions, which include grid modernization, the Marshalltown generating station and investments to advance cleaner energy, are driving the need for an electric base rate increase. We expect interim rates will include an annualized electric rate base of approximately $4 billion, with a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio approximately 49%. Franklin County will be included in interim rate base since we received FERC approval for the transfer to IPL earlier this week. We are in the process of finalizing revenue requirements and supporting schedules, thus, we are not disclosing the interim revenue requirement dollar amount at this time. Customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017 since the approximate 5% to 10% interim rate increase will be offset with tax benefit [indiscernible] billing credits and refunds related to lower transmission ROEs. 
On Slide 8, we have provided the proposed regulatory schedule for the IPL electric rate proceeding as well as definitions of the key components that will be included in final rates, which we expect to impact 2018 earnings. 
2017 will be the final year that IPL expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers to help reduce their costs. The 2017 credits are estimated to be close to the $76 million of credits in 2016. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact, but are not anticipated to impact full year 2017 results. 
The WPL retail rate case reflected electric rate base growth for our full year for the Edgewater 5 [indiscernible] and baghouse, which was placed in service in 2016, as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. 
As shown on Slide 9, the 2017 approved retail electric and gas rate base was [indiscernible] $3 billion, with an authorized ROE of 10% and a common equity ratio of 52%. 
Slide 10 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. On this slide, we estimate a 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 18%, which is 5% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. Also, to assist you in modeling, please note that IPL's interim rates will not be in effect until second quarter. In addition, WPL's new rates are in effect for the full year of 2017, but we have eliminated the summer versus winter pricing differential for Wisconsin retail electric customers. Both are expected to result in changes to our quarterly earnings profile compared to prior years. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows, given the earnings generated by the business, and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the additional wins included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation and is expected to be taken on federal income tax returns of the next few years. Our 2017 financing plan remains consistent with our announcement last November. Our plan assumes we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity later this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and $300 million at WPL. We may adjust plans as being prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. 
As we look beyond 2017, our equity needs will be driven by renewable investments and the Riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 will be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decision. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 11. For IPL, we expect to file the next Iowa electric rate case and receive a decision on our emissions plan and budget in the second quarter. During the third quarter, we are planning to file the advances remaking principles for additional wind in the state of Iowa. For WPL, we plan to file a fuel only case for 2018 by the third quarter, which is customer in years where a retail electric rate case is not filed. Also, in the third quarter, we anticipate filing for a certificate of authority for additional winds for Wisconsin customers. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to share some information on potential tax reform. There is still much uncertainty regarding the content and timing of potential tax reform. It is too early to provide details on the likely outcome, instead, we are providing one set of assumptions from the various proposals for tax reform and the near term directional impacts of such assumptions to give some indication of how our customers and share owners could be impacted. 
On Slide 12, we have provided these assumptions and some of the issues that could differentiate Alliant Energy from our peers in the industry. These differences include our existing net operating loss positions at our 2 utilities, our low nonregulated impairment debt, flow through accounting in Iowa jurisdiction and PTC credits generated by our wind farms. 
First, we have deferred tax assets on our regulated books related to federal net operating losses that we currently expect to utilize to offset taxable income through 2021. These deferred tax assets are part of the rate base calculations for both IPL and WPL, and are expected to decline over the next 5 years under current tax provisions and as we utilize such NOLs. If 100% expensing of capital expenditures is included in tax reform, we expect the utilization of our NOLs would slow down and extend beyond 2021, resulting in modest increases in IPL's and WPL's rate base in the near term. 
Second, Alliant Energy has a strong balance sheet with no long-term debt at the parent and approximately $550 million of long-term debt at its nonregulated subsidiary. If tax reform includes a loss of interest deductibility, this relatively low debt levels should not result in a significant impact on our results. 
Third, we are monitoring if IPL's flow-through [indiscernible] will continue to be available to state commissions following tax reform. If the requirements of the tax code provide no flexibility on how state commissions decide, the recovery of certain property-related timing differences, this could result in a slight rate increase for IPL customers over the near term. WPL's income taxes are normalized. Therefore, WPL customers should not be impacted by this issue. 
Finally, we are advocating for the retention of production tax credits under the current face out rules as well as other credits earned under the current tax code so that we may continue providing such benefits to our customers. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and we look forward to meeting with many of you throughout this year. 
At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Today, I'm pleased to share with you an overview of our 2016 results and our outlook for 2017. I will also share with you our progress in advancing cleaner energy, improving the power grid and offering customers innovative products and options. Next, Robert will provide details on our 2016 results and 2017 guidance as well as review our regulatory schedule and comment on potential federal tax reform. 
We had another good year achieving $1.88 non-GAAP earnings per share consistent with the midpoint of our 2016 earnings guidance. This represents a 5% increase over comparable 2015 results on a non-GAAP temperature normalized basis. Although 2016 had its share of interesting temperature swings, it was on average normal for the year, so there is no need to temperature normalize our 2016 results. Also, please note on Slide 2, the 2016 non-GAAP results exclude the impact of the Franklin County charge of $0.23 per share recorded in the third quarter. 
We also issued earnings guidance for 2017, with the midpoint of $1.99 per share, a 6% increase over 2016's non-GAAP results, driven by earnings on our growing utility investments. Our earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings per share of $1.88. This long-term growth objective is supported by continued robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and is on a temperature normalized basis. 
We continue to make solid progress in providing cost-effective clean energy for our customers while building a smarter, more robust grid. We have a dynamic planning process that gives us the flexibility to adjust our capital plans as opportunities arise. So last evening, we issued an updated capital expenditure plan for 2017 through 2020 totaling $5.6 billion. The change from our November 2016 forecast are shown on Slide 3 and are primarily due to the acceleration, the timing of utility wind generation and IPL smart meter investments to enable customers to realize their benefits sooner. 
We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago, with the addition of utility owned wind and the planned retirements of our smaller, less efficient generating stations. And since 2010, we have retired or converted 1/3 of our coal-fired generation, moving us through our 2030 carbon emissions reduction target of 40%. Our generation fleet continues to transition to one that is cleaner and more efficient, and major steps are underway to expand our natural gas generation. 
In Wisconsin, we are in the early stages of construction of the Riverside expansion. And in Iowa, we are in the homestretch of the Marshalltown construction. The Marshalltown generating facility is now almost complete, testing is going well and is expected to go in service by early April. Forecast of capital expenditures for the facility are approximately $670 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission, and it will earn the authorized 11% ROE. We anticipate Marshalltown will be included in IPL's retail electric interim rates, which will be implemented 10 days after our rate filing in the second quarter. Marshalltown will be our most efficient facility to date, and is expected to have 60% less carbon emissions and 90% less water withdrawals when compared to the 2005 levels for the generating units it will replace. 
In Wisconsin, we broke ground for the Riverside expansion last September and expect that it will supply energy to our customers by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 703 megawatts and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. REC (Co-ops) signed their letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of Riverside, and we expect PSCW approvals of that agreement in the third quarter. This Co-ops have been WPL's wholesale customers for decades and we are delighted that they will be our partners in Riverside. 
Our capital expenditure plan also includes an additional 900 megawatts of wind energy, of which 500 megawatts was approved by the Iowa utilities board last year. The terms of that approval include a cost cap of $1,830 per KW, including AFUDC and transmission, a return on equity of 11% for the life of the asset and a depreciable life of 40 years. We have selected GE as the wind turbine supplier for this expansion and acquired enough turbines from GE during the fourth quarter of 2016 to ensure all 900 megawatts of new wind is eligible for the full level of reduction tax credits. 
Power generation is the newest addition to our energy mix, and we continue to gain valuable experience on how best to integrate it as well as storage into our electric system. We are currently receiving power from our 3 solar facilities, including Wisconsin's largest solar farm located at our Rock River campus, a learning laboratory at our Madison headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investments such as these as well as our planned solar collaboration with the City of Dubuque will help us to meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. 
The electric and gas distribution system continues to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of the power delivery. Standardized voltages and selected reliability improvements, such as expansion of our underground electric distribution network, are just some of our targeted investments. Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, which is giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas system, while at the same time continuing our pipeline safety program. 
This year, we plan to begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important component for a smarter and more resilient power grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages, 2-way energy flow and allow for remote connect and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter installation in 2019. 
We are making good progress in offering our customers innovative solutions and options. WP&L recently received approval for new residential customer offerings including simpler time of use pricing plans, a demand rate pilot, a fixed bill option and lower rates for renewable energy plans. We are also offering both Iowa and Wisconsin customers rebates for installation of charging stations. When we file the IPL retail electric base rate review, we plan to propose a number of product offerings for our Iowa customers as well. 
As I wrap up my remarks, I would like to briefly comment on federal initiatives and the impacts they may have on our industry and specifically on Alliant Energy. As I mentioned earlier, the transition of our generation fleet started almost a decade ago. Our plan isn't based on economic modernization of our generation fleet to one that is more energy-efficient and lower emissions and water usage. Our plans were never predicated on a Clean Power Plan, but rather they are based on providing our customers safe, reliable and cost competitive energy while improving the environment of the communities that we have the privilege to serve. 
The current debate on federal corporate tax reform is very important to our company and our customers, and we are very involved with this discussion. In general, lower tax rates should be beneficial to all, however, we must look at any tax reform in its totality and not react to specific items. Robert will address how the current proposals would impact customers and shareowners of Alliant Energy. On the various legislative and regulatory proposals, we will continue to engage with key local, state and federal stakeholders as well as customer industry groups, such as EEI, and navigate for our customers and shareowners interest. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for the coming year. Our dedicated employees delivered a solid 2016, and will deliver 2017's financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout is 63.3% based on our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99 per share. We expect to complete projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner. We will continue working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. Continued focus on serving our customers and being partners in our communities, while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I will now turn the call over to Robert."

We released year-end 2016 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.88 per share, which is $0.13 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings for year-end 2015. A summary of the year-over-year",1583,"Good morning, everyone. We released year-end 2016 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.88 per share, which is $0.13 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings for year-end 2015. A summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers may be found on Slides 4, 5 and 6. The major contributors of the year-over-year earnings growth were higher electric and gas margins and increased AFUDC related to the Marshalltown generating station. 
I'm pleased to report that temperature normalized sales increased approximately 1% as forecasted. The commercial and industrial segments continue to be the largest sales growth classes year-over-year at both the utilities. For 2016, our earnings were not impacted by temperatures, but milder temperatures in 2015 resulted in a negative $0.04 per share variance. 
Before I move on to discuss 2017 guidance, I would like to point out that at the end of 2016, Alliant Energy's investment in ATC moved from WPL to one of our nonregulated subsidiaries in accordance with the PSCW order. There was no impact to the Alliant Energy's consolidated financial statements as a result of the change, and we will continue including ATC's earnings with the utilities in future earnings release tables. 
Now let's briefly review our 2017 guidance. Last evening, we issued our consolidated 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 earnings per share. A walk from the 2016 non-GAAP EPS to the midpoint of the 2017 estimated guidance range is shown on Slide 7. The key drivers for the 6% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments which are reflected in WPL's recently improved electric and gas retail rates, as well as the infrastructure investments for IPL which will be included in interim rates, which will go in effect 10 days after we filed a retail electric rate case in the second quarter of 2017. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes. 
During the past 7 years, we've been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rates flat. The recent rate base additions, which include grid modernization, the Marshalltown generating station and investments to advance cleaner energy, are driving the need for an electric base rate increase. We expect interim rates will include an annualized electric rate base of approximately $4 billion, with a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. 
Franklin County will be included in interim rate base since we received FERC approval for the transfer to IPL earlier this week. We're in the process of finalizing revenue requirements and supporting schedules, thus, we are not disclosing the interim revenue requirement dollar amount at this time. Customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017, since the approximate 5% to 10% interim rate increase will be offset with tax benefit rider billing credits and refunds related to lower transmission ROEs. 
On Slide 8, we have provided the proposed regulatory schedule for the IPL electric rate proceeding as well as definitions of the key components that will be included in final rates, which we expect to impact 2018 earnings. 2017 will be the final year that IPL expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers to help reduce their costs. The 2017 credits are estimated to be close to the $76 million of credits in 2016. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact the full year 2017 results. 
The WPL retail rate case reflected electric rate base growth for our full year for the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse, which was placed in service in 2016, as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. 
As shown on Slide 9, the 2017 approved retail electric and gas rate base was $3 billion, with an authorized ROE of 10% and a common equity ratio of 52%. 
Slide 10 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. On this slide, we estimate our 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 18%, which is 5% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. Also, to assist you in modeling, please note that IPL's interim rates will not be in effect until second quarter. In addition, WPL's new rates are in effect for the full year of 2017, but we have eliminated the summer versus winter pricing differential for Wisconsin Retail Electric customers. Both are expected to result in changes to our quarterly earnings profile compared to prior years. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows given the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the additional wins included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. 
Our 2017 financing plan remains consistent with our announcement last November. Our plan assumes we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity later this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and $300 million at WPL. We may adjust plans as being prudent, if market conditions warrants and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. 
As we look beyond 2017, our equity needs will be driven by renewable investments and the Riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decision. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 11. For IPL, we expect to file the next Iowa electric rate case and receive a decision on our emissions plan and budget in the second quarter. During the third quarter, we are planning to file the advanced ratemaking principles for additional wind in the state of Iowa. For WPL, we plan to file a fuel-only case for 2018 by the third quarter, which is customary in years where a retail electric rate case is not filed. Also, in the third quarter, we anticipate filing for a Certificate of Authority for additional wind for Wisconsin customers. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to share some information on potential tax reform. There is still much uncertainty regarding the content and timing of potential tax reform. It is too early to provide details on the likely outcome. Instead, we are providing one set of assumptions from the various proposals for tax reform and the near-term directional impacts of such assumptions to give some indication of how our customers and shareowners could be impacted. 
On Slide 12, we have provided these assumptions in some of the issues that could differentiate Alliant Energy from our peers in the industry. These differences include our existing net operating loss positions at our 2 utilities, our low nonregulated impairment debt, flow through accounting in our Iowa jurisdiction and PTC credits generated by our wind farm.
First, we have deferred tax assets on our regulated books related to federal net operating losses that we currently expect to utilize to offset taxable income through 2021. These deferred tax assets are part of the rate base calculations for both IPL and WPL, and are expected to decline over the next 5 years under current tax provisions as we utilize such NOL. If 100% expensing of capital expenditures is included in tax reform, we expect the utilization of our NOLs would slow down and extend beyond 2021, resulting in modest increases in IPL's and WPL's rate base in the near term. 
Second, Alliant Energy has a strong balance sheet with no long-term debt at the parent and approximately $550 million of long-term debt at its nonregulated subsidiary. If tax reform includes a loss of interest deductibility, this relatively low debt levels should not result in a significant impact on our results. 
Third, we are monitoring if IPL's flow through tax methodology will continue to be available to state commissions following tax reform. If the requirements of the tax code provide no flexibility on how state commissions decide, the recovery of certain property-related timing differences, this could result in a slight rate increase for IPL customers over the near term. WPL's income taxes are normalized. Therefore, WPL customers should not be impacted by this issue. 
Finally, we are advocating for the retention of production tax credits under the current phaseout rules as well as other credits earned under the current tax code, so that we may continue providing such benefits to our customers.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and we look forward to meeting with many of you throughout this year. At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

We released 2017 earnings guidance and provided updated 2017 through 2020 capital expenditure guidance. This release, as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call, are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com. 
Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. 
In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release, which is available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Pat."

Today, I'm pleased to share with you an overview of our 2016 results and our outlook for 2017. I will also share with you our progress in advancing cleaner energy, improving the power grid and offering customers innovative products and options. Next, Robert will provide details on our 2016 results and 2017 guidance as well as review our regulatory schedule and comment on potential federal tax reform. 
We had another good year, achieving $1.88 non-GAAP earnings per share, consistent with the midpoint of our 2016 earnings guidance. This represents a 5% increase over comparable 2015 results on a non-GAAP temperature normalized basis. Although 2016 had its share of interesting temperature swings, it was on average normal for the year, so there is no need to temperature normalize our 2016 results. Also, please note on Slide 2, the 2016 non-GAAP results exclude the impact of the Franklin County charge of $0.23 per share recorded in the third quarter. 
We also issued earnings guidance for 2017, with the midpoint of $1.99 per share, a 6% increase over 2016's non-GAAP results, driven by earnings on our growing utility investments. Our earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings per share of $1.88. This long-term growth objective is supported by continued robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and is on a temperature normalized basis. 
We continue to make solid progress in providing cost-effective clean energy for our customers while building a smarter, more robust grid. We have a dynamic planning process that gives us the flexibility to adjust our capital plans as opportunities arise. So last evening, we issued an updated capital expenditure plan for 2017 through 2020 totaling $5.6 billion. The change from our November 2016 forecast are shown on Slide 3 and are primarily due to the acceleration, the timing of utility wind generation and IPL smart meter investments to enable customers to realize their benefits sooner. 
We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago, with the addition of utility-owned wind and the planned retirements of our smaller, less efficient fossil generating stations. And since 2010, we have retired or converted 1/3 of our coal-fired generation, moving us toward our 2030 carbon emission reduction target of 40%. Our generation fleet continues to transition to one that is cleaner and more efficient, and major steps are underway to expand our natural gas generation. 
In Wisconsin, we are in the early stages of construction of the Riverside expansion. And in Iowa, we are in the home stretch of the Marshalltown construction. 
The Marshalltown generating facility is now almost complete, testing is going well, and it is expected to go in service by early April. Forecast of capital expenditures for the facility are approximately $670 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission, and it will earn the authorized 11% ROE. We anticipate Marshalltown will be included in IPL's retail electric interim rates, which will be implemented 10 days after our rate filing in the second quarter. Marshalltown will be our most efficient facility to date, and is expected to have 60% less carbon emissions and 90% less water withdrawals when compared to the 2005 levels for the generating units it will replace. 
In Wisconsin, we broke ground for the Riverside expansion last September and expect that it will supply energy to our customers by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 703 megawatts and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. REC co-ops signed their letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts at Riverside, and we expect PSCW approvals of that agreement in the third quarter. These co-ops have been WPL wholesale customers for decades and we are delighted that they will be our partners at Riverside. 
Our capital expenditure plan also includes an additional 900 megawatts of wind energy, of which 500 megawatts was approved by the Iowa utilities board last year. The terms of that approval include a cost cap of $1,830 per KW, including AFUDC and transmission, a return on equity of 11% for the life of the asset and a depreciable life of 40 years. We have selected GE as the wind turbine supplier for this expansion and acquired enough turbines from GE during the fourth quarter of 2016 to ensure all 900 megawatts of new wind is eligible for the full level of reduction tax credits. 
Power generation is the newest addition to our energy mix, and we continue to gain valuable experience on how best to integrate it as well as storage into our electric system. We are currently receiving power from our 3 solar facilities, including Wisconsin's largest solar farm located at our Rock River campus, a learning laboratory at our Madison headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investments such as these as well as our planned solar collaboration with the City of Dubuque will help us to meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. 
The electric and gas distribution system continues to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. Standardized voltages and selected reliability improvements, such as expansion of our underground electric distribution network, are just some of our targeted investments. Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, which is giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas system, while at the same time continuing our pipeline safety program. 
This year, we plan to begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important component for a smarter and more resilient power grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages, 2-way energy flow and allow for remote connect and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter installation in 2019. 
We are making good progress in offering our customers innovative solutions and options. WP&L recently received approval for new residential customer offerings, including simpler time of use pricing plans, a demand rate pilot, a fixed bill option and lower rates for renewable energy plans. We are also offering both Iowa and Wisconsin customers rebates for installation of charging stations. When we file the IPL retail electric base rate review, we plan to propose a number of product offerings for our Iowa customers as well. 
As I wrap up my remarks, I would like to briefly comment on federal initiatives and the impacts they may have on our industry and specifically on Alliant Energy. As I mentioned earlier, the transition of our generation fleet started almost a decade ago. Our plan isn't based on economic modernization of our generation fleet to one that is more energy-efficient and lower emissions and water usage. Our plans were never predicated on a Clean Power Plan, but rather they are based on providing our customers safe, reliable and cost-competitive energy while improving the environment of the communities that we have the privilege to serve. 
The current debate on federal corporate tax reform is very important to our company and our customers, and we are very involved with this discussion. In general, lower tax rates should be beneficial to all; however, we must look at any tax reform in its totality and not react to specific items. Robert will address how the current proposals would impact customers and shareowners of Alliant Energy. On the various legislative and regulatory proposals, we will continue to engage with key local, state and federal stakeholders as well as customer industry groups such as EEI, and navigate for our customers' and shareowners' interests. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for the coming year. Our dedicated employees delivered a solid 2016, and will deliver 2017's financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout is 63.3% based on our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99 per share. We expect to complete projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner. We will continue working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. Continued focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities, while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline, and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I will now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,419906608,1142504,"Alliant Energy Corporation, 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2017",2017-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Good morning, everyone. We released year-end 2016 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.88 per share, which is $0.13 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings for year-end 2015. A summary of the year-over-year",1580,"Good morning, everyone. We released year-end 2016 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.88 per share, which is $0.13 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings for year-end 2015. A summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers may be found on Slides 4, 5 and 6. The major contributors of the year-over-year earnings growth were higher electric and gas margins and increased AFUDC related to the Marshalltown generating station. 
I'm pleased to report that temperature normalized sales increased approximately 1%, as forecasted. The commercial and industrial segments continued to be the largest sales growth classes year-over-year at both the utilities. For 2016, our earnings were not impacted by temperatures, but milder temperatures in 2015 resulted in a negative $0.04 per share variance. 
Before I move on to discuss 2017 guidance, I would like to point out that at the end of 2016, Alliant Energy's investment in ATC moved from WPL to one of our nonregulated subsidiaries in accordance with the PSCW order. There was no impact to Alliant Energy's consolidated financial statements as a result of this change, and we will continue including ATC's earnings with the utilities in future earnings release tables. 
Now let's briefly review our 2017 guidance. Last evening, we issued our consolidated 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 earnings per share. A walk from the 2016 non-GAAP EPS to the midpoint of the 2017 estimated guidance range is shown on Slide 7. The key drivers for the 6% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments which are reflected in WPL's recently improved electric and gas retail rates, as well as the infrastructure investments for IPL which will be included in interim rates, which will go in effect 10 days after we filed a retail electric rate case in the second quarter of 2017. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes. 
During the past 7 years, we've been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rates flat. The recent rate base additions, which include grid modernization, the Marshalltown generating station and investments to advance cleaner energy, are driving the need for an electric base rate increase. We expect interim rates will include an annualized electric rate base of approximately $4 billion, with a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. 
Franklin County will be included in interim rate base since we received FERC approval for the transfer to IPL earlier this week. We're in the process of finalizing revenue requirements and supporting schedules; thus, we are not disclosing the interim revenue requirement dollar amount at this time. Customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017, since the approximate 5% to 10% interim rate increase will be offset with tax benefit rider billing credits and refunds related to lower transmission ROEs. 
On Slide 8, we have provided the proposed regulatory schedule for the IPL electric rate proceeding as well as definitions of the key components that will be included in final rates, which we expect to impact 2018 earnings. 2017 will be the final year that IPL expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers to help reduce their costs. The 2017 credits are estimated to be close to the $76 million of credits in 2016. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year 2017 results. 
The WPL retail rate case reflected electric rate base growth for our full year for the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse, which was placed in service in 2016, as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. 
As shown on Slide 9, the 2017 approved retail electric and gas rate base was $3 billion, with an authorized ROE of 10% and a common equity ratio of 52%. 
Slide 10 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. On this slide, we estimate our 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 18%, which is 5% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. Also, to assist you in modeling, please note that IPL's interim rates will not be in effect until second quarter. In addition, WPL's new rates are in effect for the full year of 2017, but we have eliminated the summer versus winter pricing differential for Wisconsin Retail Electric customers. Both are expected to result in changes to our quarterly earnings profile compared to prior years. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows given the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the additional wins included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. 
Our 2017 financing plan remains consistent with our announcement last November. Our plan assumes we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity later this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and $300 million at WPL. We may adjust plans as being prudent if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. 
As we look beyond 2017, our equity needs will be driven by renewable investments and the Riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decision. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 11. For IPL, we expect to file the next Iowa electric rate case and receive a decision on our emissions plan and budget in the second quarter. During the third quarter, we are planning to file the advanced ratemaking principles for additional wind in the state of Iowa. For WPL, we plan to file a fuel-only case for 2018 by the third quarter, which is customary in years where a retail electric rate case is not filed. Also, in the third quarter, we anticipate filing for a Certificate of Authority for additional wind for Wisconsin customers. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to share some information on potential tax reform. There is still much uncertainty regarding the content and timing of potential tax reform. There it is too early to provide details on the likely outcome. Instead, we are providing one set of assumptions from the various proposals for tax reform and the near-term directional impacts of such assumptions to give some indication of how our customers and shareowners could be impacted. 
On Slide 12, we have provided these assumptions and some of the issues that could differentiate Alliant Energy from our peers in the industry. These differences include our existing net operating loss positions at our 2 utilities, our low nonregulated impairment debt, flow-through accounting in our Iowa jurisdiction and PTC credits generated by our wind farm.
First, we have deferred tax assets on our regulated books related to federal net operating losses that we currently expect to utilize to offset taxable income through 2021. These deferred tax assets are part of the rate base calculations for both IPL and WPL, and are expected to decline over the next 5 years under current tax provisions as we utilize such NOLs. If 100% expensing of capital expenditures is included in tax reform, we expect the utilization of our NOLs would slow down and extend beyond 2021, resulting in modest increases in IPL's and WPL's rate base in the near term. 
Second, Alliant Energy has a strong balance sheet, with no long-term debt at the parent and approximately $550 million of long-term debt at its nonregulated subsidiary. If tax reform includes a loss of interest deductibility, this relatively low debt level should not result in a significant impact on our results. 
Third, we are monitoring if IPL's flow-through tax methodology will continue to be available to state commissions following tax reform. If the requirements of the tax code provide no flexibility on how state commissions decide the recovery of certain property-related timing differences, this could result in a slight rate increase for IPL customers over the near term. WPL's income taxes are normalized. Therefore, WPL customers should not be impacted by this issue. 
Finally, we are advocating for the retention of production tax credits under the current phaseout rules as well as other credits earned under the current tax code, so that we may continue providing such benefits to our customers.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and we look forward to meeting with many of you throughout this year. At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Today, I'm pleased to share with you an overview of our 2016 results and our outlook for 2017. I will also share with you our progress in advancing cleaner energy, improving the power grid and offering customers innovative products and options. Next, Robert will provide details on our 2016 results and 2017 guidance as well as review our regulatory schedule and comment on potential federal tax reform. 
We had another good year, achieving $1.88 non-GAAP earnings per share, consistent with the midpoint of our 2016 earnings guidance. This represents a 5% increase over comparable 2015 results on a non-GAAP temperature normalized basis. Although 2016 had its share of interesting temperature swings, it was on average normal for the year, so there is no need to temperature normalize our 2016 results. Also, please note on Slide 2, the 2016 non-GAAP results exclude the impact of the Franklin County charge of $0.23 per share recorded in the third quarter. 
We also issued earnings guidance for 2017, with the midpoint of $1.99 per share, a 6% increase over 2016's non-GAAP results, driven by earnings on our growing utility investments. Our earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings per share of $1.88. This long-term growth objective is supported by continued robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth, constructive regulatory outcomes and is on a temperature normalized basis. 
We continue to make solid progress in providing cost-effective clean energy for our customers while building a smarter, more robust grid. We have a dynamic planning process that gives us the flexibility to adjust our capital plans as opportunities arise. So last evening, we issued an updated capital expenditure plan for 2017 through 2020 totaling $5.6 billion. The change from our November 2016 forecast are shown on Slide 3 and are primarily due to the acceleration, the timing of utility wind generation and IPL smart meter investments to enable customers to realize their benefits sooner. 
We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago, with the addition of utility-owned wind and the planned retirements of our smaller, less efficient fossil generating stations. And since 2010, we have retired or converted 1/3 of our coal-fired generation, moving us toward our 2030 carbon emission reduction target of 40%. Our generation fleet continues to transition to one that is cleaner and more efficient, and major steps are underway to expand our natural gas generation. 
In Wisconsin, we are in the early stages of construction of the Riverside expansion. And in Iowa, we are in the home stretch of the Marshalltown construction. 
The Marshalltown generating facility is now almost complete, testing is going well, and it is expected to go in service by early April. Forecast of capital expenditures for the facility are approximately $670 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission, and it will earn the authorized 11% ROE. We anticipate Marshalltown will be included in IPL's retail electric interim rates, which will be implemented 10 days after our rate filing in the second quarter. Marshalltown will be our most efficient facility to date, and is expected to have 60% less carbon emissions and 90% less water withdrawals when compared to the 2005 levels for the generating units it will replace. 
In Wisconsin, we broke ground for the Riverside expansion last September and expect that it will supply energy to our customers by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 703 megawatts and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. REC co-ops signed their letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts at Riverside, and we expect PSCW approvals of that agreement in the third quarter. These co-ops have been WPL wholesale customers for decades and we are delighted that they will be our partners at Riverside. 
Our capital expenditure plan also includes an additional 900 megawatts of wind energy, of which 500 megawatts was approved by the Iowa utilities board last year. The terms of that approval include a cost cap of $1,830 per KW, including AFUDC and transmission, a return on equity of 11% for the life of the asset and a depreciable life of 40 years. We have selected GE as the wind turbine supplier for this expansion and acquired enough turbines from GE during the fourth quarter of 2016 to ensure all 900 megawatts of new wind is eligible for the full level of reduction tax credits. 
Power generation is the newest addition to our energy mix, and we continue to gain valuable experience on how best to integrate it as well as storage into our electric system. We are currently receiving power from our 3 solar facilities, including Wisconsin's largest solar farm located at our Rock River campus, a learning laboratory at our Madison headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investments such as these as well as our planned solar collaboration with the City of Dubuque will help us to meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. 
The electric and gas distribution system continues to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. Standardized voltages and selected reliability improvements, such as expansion of our underground electric distribution network, are just some of our targeted investments. Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, which is giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas system, while at the same time continuing our pipeline safety program. 
This year, we plan to begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important component for a smarter and more resilient power grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages, 2-way energy flow and allow for remote connect and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter installation in 2019. 
We are making good progress in offering our customers innovative solutions and options. WP&L recently received approval for new residential customer offerings, including simpler time of use pricing plans, a demand rate pilot, a fixed bill option and lower rates for renewable energy plans. We are also offering both Iowa and Wisconsin customers rebates for installation of charging stations. When we file the IPL retail electric base rate review, we plan to propose a number of product offerings for our Iowa customers as well. 
As I wrap up my remarks, I would like to briefly comment on federal initiatives and the impacts they may have on our industry and specifically on Alliant Energy. As I mentioned earlier, the transition of our generation fleet started almost a decade ago. Our plan isn't based on economic modernization of our generation fleet to one that is more energy-efficient and lower emissions and water usage. Our plans were never predicated on a Clean Power Plan, but rather they are based on providing our customers safe, reliable and cost-competitive energy while improving the environment of the communities that we have the privilege to serve. 
The current debate on federal corporate tax reform is very important to our company and our customers, and we are very involved with this discussion. In general, lower tax rates should be beneficial to all; however, we must look at any tax reform in its totality and not react to specific items. Robert will address how the current proposals would impact customers and shareowners of Alliant Energy. On the various legislative and regulatory proposals, we will continue to engage with key local, state and federal stakeholders as well as customer industry groups such as EEI, and navigate for our customers' and shareowners' interests. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for the coming year. Our dedicated employees delivered a solid 2016, and will deliver 2017's financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout is 63.3% based on our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99 per share. We expect to complete projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner. We will continue working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. Continued focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities, while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline, and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I will now turn the call over to Robert."

We released year-end 2016 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.88 per share, which is $0.13 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings for year-end 2015. A summary of the year-over-year",1579,"Good morning, everyone. We released year-end 2016 earnings last evening with our non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.88 per share, which is $0.13 per share higher than the non-GAAP earnings for year-end 2015. A summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers may be found on Slides 4, 5 and 6. The major contributors of the year-over-year earnings growth were higher electric and gas margins and increased AFUDC related to the Marshalltown generating station. 
I'm pleased to report that temperature-normalized sales increased approximately 1%, as forecasted. The commercial and industrial segments continued to be the largest sales growth classes year-over-year at both the utilities. For 2016, our earnings were not impacted by temperatures, but milder temperatures in 2015 resulted in a negative $0.04 per share variance. 
Before I move on to discuss 2017 guidance, I would like to point out that at the end of 2016, Alliant Energy's investment in ATC moved from WPL to one of our nonregulated subsidiaries in accordance with the PSCW order. There was no impact to Alliant Energy's consolidated financial statements as a result of this change, and we will continue including ATC's earnings with the utilities in future earnings release tables. 
Now let's briefly review our 2017 guidance. Last evening, we issued our consolidated 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 earnings per share. A walk from the 2016 non-GAAP EPS to the midpoint of the 2017 estimated guidance range is shown on Slide 7. The key drivers for the 6% growth in earnings relate to infrastructure investments which are reflected in WPL's recently improved electric and gas retail rates, as well as the infrastructure investments for IPL which will be included in interim rates, which will go in effect 10 days after we filed a retail electric rate case in the second quarter of 2017. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes. 
During the past 7 years, we've been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rates flat. The recent rate base additions, which include grid modernization, the Marshalltown generating station and investments to advance cleaner energy, are driving the need for an electric base rate increase. We expect interim rates will include an annualized electric rate base of approximately $4 billion, with a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. 
Franklin County will be included in interim rate base since we received FERC approval for the transfer to IPL earlier this week. We're in the process of finalizing revenue requirements and supporting schedules; thus, we are not disclosing the interim revenue requirement dollar amount at this time. Customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017, since the approximate 5% to 10% interim rate increase will be offset with tax benefit rider billing credits and refunds related to lower transmission ROEs. 
On Slide 8, we have provided the proposed regulatory schedule for the IPL electric rate proceeding as well as definitions of the key components that will be included in final rates, which we expect to impact 2018 earnings. 2017 will be the final year that IPL expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers to help reduce their costs. The 2017 credits are estimated to be close to the $76 million of credits in 2016. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year 2017 results. 
The WPL retail rate case reflected electric rate base growth for our full year for the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse, which was placed in service in 2016, as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. 
As shown on Slide 9, the 2017 approved retail electric and gas rate base was $3 billion, with an authorized ROE of 10% and a common equity ratio of 52%. 
Slide 10 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. On this slide, we estimate our 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 18%, which is 5% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. Also, to assist you in modeling, please note that IPL's interim rates will not be in effect until second quarter. In addition, WPL's new rates are in effect for the full year of 2017, but we have eliminated the summer versus winter pricing differential for Wisconsin Retail Electric customers. Both are expected to result in changes to our quarterly earnings profile compared to prior years. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows given the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the additional wins included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. 
Our 2017 financing plan remains consistent with our announcement last November. Our plan assumes we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity later this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and $300 million at WPL. We may adjust plans as being prudent if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. 
As we look beyond 2017, our equity needs will be driven by renewable investments and the Riverside expansion project. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decision. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017, which we have summarized on Slide 11. For IPL, we expect to file the next Iowa electric rate case and receive a decision on our emissions plan and budget in the second quarter. During the third quarter, we are planning to file the advanced ratemaking principles for additional wind in the state of Iowa. For WPL, we plan to file a fuel-only case for 2018 by the third quarter, which is customary in years where a retail electric rate case is not filed. Also, in the third quarter, we anticipate filing for a Certificate of Authority for additional wind for Wisconsin customers. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to share some information on potential tax reform. There is still much uncertainty regarding the content and timing of potential tax reform. There it is too early to provide details on the likely outcome. Instead, we are providing one set of assumptions from the various proposals for tax reform and the near-term directional impacts of such assumptions to give some indication of how our customers and shareowners could be impacted. 
On Slide 12, we have provided these assumptions and some of the issues that could differentiate Alliant Energy from our peers in the industry. These differences include our existing net operating loss positions at our 2 utilities, our low nonregulated impairment debt, flow-through accounting in our Iowa jurisdiction and PTC credits generated by our wind farm.
First, we have deferred tax assets on our regulated books related to federal net operating losses that we currently expect to utilize to offset taxable income through 2021. These deferred tax assets are part of the rate base calculations for both IPL and WPL, and are expected to decline over the next 5 years under current tax provisions as we utilize such NOLs. If 100% expensing of capital expenditures is included in tax reform, we expect the utilization of our NOLs would slow down and extend beyond 2021, resulting in modest increases in IPL's and WPL's rate base in the near term. 
Second, Alliant Energy has a strong balance sheet, with no long-term debt at the parent and approximately $550 million of long-term debt at its nonregulated subsidiary. If tax reform includes a loss of interest deductibility, this relatively low debt level should not result in a significant impact on our results. 
Third, we are monitoring if IPL's flow-through tax methodology will continue to be available to state commissions following tax reform. If the requirements of the tax code provide no flexibility on how state commissions decide the recovery of certain property-related timing differences, this could result in a slight rate increase for IPL customers over the near term. WPL's income taxes are normalized. Therefore, WPL customers should not be impacted by this issue. 
Finally, we are advocating for the retention of production tax credits under the current phaseout rules as well as other credits earned under the current tax code, so that we may continue providing such benefits to our customers.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and we look forward to meeting with many of you throughout this year. At this time, I will turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Like other utilities in the region, we enjoyed a mild winter, but it did lower our first quarter results by $0.04 per share.

Therefore, mild temperatures led to a negative first quarter variance from last year of $0.02 per share. Despite the mild temperatures, we achieved solid earnings this quarter of $0.43 per share, which was the same as the first quarter of 2016. With the exception of the mild weather, these results were in line with our expectations. Robert will provide more details regarding the quarter's results a bit later. And with these financial results, we reaffirm our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. Earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% annually through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings of $1.88. This long-term growth objective continues to be supported by the utilities' robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and constructive regulatory outcomes. 
We achieved several milestones and advanced growth strategy in early April. First, Marshalltown Generating Station began commercial operation on April 1. Second, the Franklin County Wind Farm was transferred to IPL also on April 1. And third, IPL private electric rate reviewed on April 3 and interim rates went into effect on April 13. 
Marshalltown was completed on time and below budget, with the full load testing heat rate of 6,610 BTU per kilowatt hour, that is under contractual guarantee, and makes it one of the most efficient units in the world. Marshalltown's ability is to quickly ramp up or ramp down energy production, complements Iowa's best wind resources and is a great addition to our energy mix. Marshalltown is expected to have 60% less carbon emissions, and 90% less water withdrawals when compared to the [indiscernible] levels of the generating units of this replacement. Now that Marshalltown is in service and customers are realizing its benefits, it's cost recovery was included in interim rates that went into effect on April 13, earning the authorized 11% ROE. Marshalltown's final costs include AFUDC and transmission [indiscernible] approximately $750 million, well below the approved cost cap of $920 million. Last week, the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded IPL [indiscernible] award for its work on Marshalltown. This is the first InVision platinum award for any company in Iowa. The award recognized IPL's focus on sustainable performance and infrastructure resilience. The award was issued after a peer review process that assess Marshalltown on [indiscernible] sustainability factors addressing a wide range of important criteria. We're very proud that our sustainability efforts were recognized by this distinguished group. 
I do want to take a moment and recognize the Alliant Energy team and all the contractors that brought this project to a successful completion. It was truly a team effort, and I'm not only proud of the excellent construction and performance, but most importantly, safety performance on this project was world-class. Thank you. 
It is constant we are making good progress on the foundation and underground piping for the Riverside expansion, which we are now calling the West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will supply energy to our customers by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 730 megawatts and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. The 3 electric cooperatives filed a letter of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside, and we expect PSCW approval of the agreement by the third quarter. These costs [indiscernible] wholesale customers for decades. We are delighted that they'll be our partners in West Riverside. 
Wind energy has been an important and now increasing part of our energy portfolio. Wind energy brings many benefits to our customers and communities, including the annual dues payments to farm families and property tax payments that support the rural communities that we have the privilege to serve. Also, our owned wind farms have remarkable performance in the first quarter, with a total average capacity factor reaching over 40%, and IPL customers are now benefiting from the energy produced by our Franklin County Wind Farm, which is now part of Whispering Willow. We are pleased that the state of Iowa encourages generation investments. In late last year, the Iowa Utilities Board approved our plan to [indiscernible] up to 500 megawatts of wind in Iowa. The terms of that approval include a cost cap of $1,830 per kilowatt, including AFUDC and transmission costs, a return on equity of 11% for the life of the asset and depreciable life of 40 years. 
As we discussed early this year, we were able to secure enough equipment to not only assure the approved 500-megawatt qualify for the 100% PTCs, but also qualify additional wind investments for 100% PTCs. Our current capital expenditure plan includes a 500 megawatts already approved in Iowa and an additional up to 200 megawatts, each for IPL and WPL, for a total wind expansion of 900 megawatts replacement service by 2020. However, we are now exploring options to increase our total wind expansion to 1,100 megawatts, with an additional 200 megawatts for IPL. We have enough equipment secured that the former 1,100 megawatts would qualify for the 100% PTCs. Therefore, we plan to make regulatory filings later this year, seeking approval for up to 400 megawatts of additional wind generation at IPL and up to 200 megawatts at WPL. As I mentioned, our capital expenditure plan and still includes investments of 900 megawatts of wind. We have not yet updated our capital plans to include the additional 200 megawatts at IPL since we are still working to secure additional sites. As is our regular practice, we plan to provide updated capital expenditure estimates in November, prior to the EEI conference. 
Solar generation is the newest addition to our energy mix. We're excited about our upcoming collaboration with the City of Dubuque and [indiscernible] the facility for West Riverside, which are both on the planning stages. These projects will be an addition to the pre-existing solar facilities located at our Rock River Campus, our new laboratory at [indiscernible] Headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. More investments such as these will help us meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. 
The electric and gas distribution systems continue to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. [indiscernible] voltages and the expansion of our underground electricity distribution network are just some of our targeted investments. Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, which is giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas systems, while at the same time, continuing our pipeline safety program. And this year, we'll begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important foundational component for [indiscernible] more resilient grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages [indiscernible], energy flow and will also [indiscernible] connects and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter installation in 2019. 
We are making good progress in offering our customers innovative solutions and options. WPL [indiscernible] approval for new residential customer offering, including [indiscernible] plan, demand rate pilots, fixed bill option and lower renewable energy rates. IPL has proposed a revised [indiscernible] option for residential and small businesses, an economic development rate and a couple of pilots for a small customer demand rate and a limited income rate. And both our Iowa and Wisconsin customers are taking advantage of our rebates for installation of these charging stations. 
We continue the execution of our strategy by providing cleaner energies for our customers, by building a smarter, more robust grid. We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago, with the addition of utility on wind and combined cycle gas to replace older, smaller and less efficient fossil generation we are retiring. By the end of this year, we will have retired or converted almost 40% our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity. Additionally, we will have retired almost 75% of our oil fired combustion turbines in these generation capacity by the end of this year. We're on a path toward a carbon emission reduction target of 40% by 2030. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017. Our dedicated employees delivered a solid first quarter, but we'll deliver on our full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout target is 63.3% based on the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99 per share. We expect to complete projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner. We will continue working with our regulators, customer advocates, environmental groups, [indiscernible] utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. We continue to focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities, while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,428434581,1189478,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Good morning, everyone. We released first quarter 2017 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.43 per share, which is the same as the earnings for the first quarter 2017. Our summary of the year-over-year earnings drive",1234,"Good morning, everyone. We released first quarter 2017 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.43 per share, which is the same as the earnings for the first quarter 2017. 
Our summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers can be found on Slides 2 and 3. 
New WPL retail electric and gas base rates, which went in effect January 1, contributed to higher earnings in the first quarter of 2017. These increased earnings were offset by the negative impacts of mild temperatures, higher fuel expense and higher depreciation expense from rate base additions. Excluding the impacts of temperatures and the extra day in 2016 for repair, retail electric sales between the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 increased more than 1%. 
Now let's briefly review our 2017 guidance. Last evening, we shared our updated view of our earnings [indiscernible] comparing 2016 non-GAAP EPS to the midpoint of our 2017 EPS guidance range on Slide 4. The update quantifies the impacts of higher IPL and WPL revenues due to the retail base rate increases as separate drivers in the earnings [indiscernible]. As shown on this slide, the 6% growth in earnings is primarily driven by infrastructure investments reflected in WPL's recently approved retail electric and gas base rates and IPL's interim electric base rates that went into effect April 13. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and continued retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth account from commercial and industrial classes. 
During the past 7 years, we have been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base, while keeping base rates flat. The recent rate base additions, which include grid modernization investments, the Marshalltown Generating Station and investments to advance cleaner energy, drove the need for retail electric rate increase. [indiscernible] rates include retail electric rate base of approximately $3.8 billion, a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. Interim rates associated with this rate filing went into effect April 13, therefore, the resulting earnings increase will only impact the last 3 quarters of 2017. To assist you in modeling, we estimate that the $0.20 per share increase in earnings from IPL's interim electric rate increase will be spread across 2017, with approximately 25% recognized in the second quarter, 45% recognized in the third quarter and 30% in the fourth quarter. Iowa retail customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017, since the approximate 7% interim rate increase will be offset with a refund related to the lower transmission ROEs and tax [indiscernible] billing curve. This will be the final year that IPL expects to provide tax benefit [indiscernible] credits to electric and gas customers to help reduce their costs. The 2017 credits are estimated to be $74 million. As in prior years, the tax benefit for riders have a quarterly timing impact, but [indiscernible] impact full year 2017 results. 
Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. On this slide, we estimate a 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 17%, which is 4% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. The WPL retail electric and gas base rate increases, which went into effect January 1, reflect electric and gas rate base growth, including a full year of the Edgewater 5 [indiscernible] baghouse that was placed in service in 2016 as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. As part of the WPL rate design, the PSCW approved the elimination of seasonal pricing beginning in 2017. This will impact the calendarization of the rate increases in your forecasting models for this year. We estimate that the $0.18 per share increased earnings impact would be spread across the quarters, with approximately 35% recognized in each of the first and fourth quarters, approximately 25% in the second quarter and minimal increase in the third quarter. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the expansion of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 through the additional wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts on bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. 
There have been no changes to our 2017 financing plan. Our plan continues to assume we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We may adjust plans as being prudent if market conditions warrants and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. 
As we look beyond 2017, we expect equity needs to be driven by renewable investments in the West Riverside project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decision. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 6. For IPL, we expect to receive decision on our emissions plan and budget this quarter, and during the third or fourth quarter, we are planning to file the advance ratemaking principles for additional wind investments for our Iowa customers. For WPL, we plan to file a 2018 fuel only case during the third quarter, which is customary in years where a retail electric rate case is not filed. And also, in the third or fourth quarter, we anticipate filing a certificate of authority for additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. 
In our investor deck, we have provided our proposed procedural schedule for the IPL retail electric rate review. This is still a proposed schedule. All parties to the case are working to finalize this schedule, and we plan to have the updated schedule in the investor deck we will be posting on our website prior to the AGM meeting on May 22. 
In closing, I would like to briefly touch on the recent court decisions [indiscernible] rate case back to FERC. This action has not changed our current reserve amount related to the second [indiscernible] complaint. We continue to reserve both ATC earnings based on the 9.7% ROE recommended by the ALJ plus ATC's awarded 50 basis point [indiscernible]. We are monitoring any potential impact to this court decision on the second MISO ROE complaint and ATC's ongoing authorized ROE. We received the refunds for the first MISO ROE complaint earlier this year and started refunding the IPL portion back to Iowa electric customers this week, the WPL portion of the refund will return to Wisconsin electric customers in accordance with the future regulatory proceeding. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I'll turn it back to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

This winter was even warmer than last year, in which we realized $0.02 per share lower earnings when compared to normal temperatures. Therefore, mild temperatures led to a negative first quarter variance from last year of $0.02 per share.

With the exception of the mild weather, these results were in line with our expectations. Robert will provide more details regarding the quarter's results a bit later. And with these financial results, we reaffirm our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share.

We achieved several milestones and advanced growth strategy in early April. First, Marshalltown Generating Station began commercial operations on April 1. Second, the Franklin County Wind Farm was transferred to IPL also on April 1. And third, IPL filed an electric rate review on April 3, and interim rates went into effect on April 13. 
Marshalltown was completed on time and below budget, with a full load testing heat rate of 6,610 Btu per kilowatt hour, better than the contractual guarantee, and makes it one of the most efficient units in the world. Marshalltown's ability's to quickly ramp up or ramp down energy production complements Iowa's vast wind resources and is a great addition to our energy mix. Marshalltown is expected to have 60% less carbon emissions and 90% less water withdrawals when compared to the 2005 levels of the generating units it is replacing. 
Now that Marshalltown is in service and customers are realizing its benefits, its cost recovery was included in interim rates that went into effect on April 13, earning the authorized 11% ROE. Marshalltown's final costs, including AFUDC and transmission, came in at approximately $750 million, well below the approved cost cap of $920 million. 
Last week, the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded IPL Envision Platinum Award for its work on Marshalltown. This is the first Envision Platinum Award for any company in Iowa. The award recognized IPL's focus on sustainable performance and infrastructure resilience. The award was issued after a peer review process that assessed Marshalltown on 60 sustainability factors addressing a wide range of important criteria. We are very proud that our sustainability efforts were recognized by this distinguished group. 
I do want to take a moment and recognize the Alliant Energy team and all the contractors that brought this project to a successful completion. It was truly a team effort. And I'm not only proud of the excellent construction and performance, but most importantly, safety performance on this project was world-class. Thank you. 
In Wisconsin, we are making good progress on the foundation and underground piping for the Riverside expansion, which we are now calling the West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will supply energy to our customers by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 730 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission.

However, we are now exploring options to increase our total wind expansion to 1,100 megawatts, with an additional 200 megawatts for IPL. We have enough equipment secured that the full 1,100 megawatts would qualify for the 100% PTCs. Therefore, we plan to make regulatory filings later this year, seeking approval for up to 400 megawatts of additional wind generation at IPL and up to 200 megawatts at WPL. 
As I mentioned, our capital expenditure plan still includes investments of 900 megawatts of wind. We have not yet updated our capital plan to include the additional 200 megawatts at IPL since we are still working to secure additional sites.

We continue execution of our strategy by providing cleaner energies for our customers while building a smarter, more robust grid. We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago with the addition of utility and wind and combined-cycle gas to replace older, smaller and less efficient fossil generation we are retiring. By the end of this year, we will have retired or converted almost 40% our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity. Additionally, we will have retired almost 75% of our oil-fired combustion turbines and diesel-generation capacity by the end of this year. We're on a path toward our carbon emission reduction target of 40% by 2030. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017. Our dedicated employees delivered a solid first quarter, and we'll deliver on our full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout target is 63.3% based on the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99 per share. 
We expect to complete projects on time and at or below budget and at a very safe manner. We will continue working with our regulators, customer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. We continue to focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

We released first quarter 2017 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.43 per share, which is the same as the earnings for the first quarter 2016. Our summary of the year-over-year earnings drive",1246,"Good morning, everyone. We released first quarter 2017 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.43 per share, which is the same as the earnings for the first quarter 2016. 
Our summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers can be found on Slides 2 and 3 new WPL retail electric and gas base rates, which went in effect January 1, contributed to higher earnings in the first quarter of 2017. These increased earnings were offset by the negative impacts of mild temperatures, higher fuel expense and higher depreciation expense from rate base additions. Excluding the impacts of temperatures and the extra day in 2016 for leap year, retail electric sales between the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 increased more than 1%. 
Now let's briefly review our 2017 guidance. Last evening, we shared our updated view of our earnings walk comparing 2016 non-GAAP EPS to the midpoint of the 2017 EPS guidance range on Slide 4. The update quantifies the impacts of higher IPL and WPL revenues due to the retail base rate increases as separate drivers in the earnings walk. As shown on this slide, the 6% growth in earnings is primarily driven by infrastructure investments reflected in WPL's recently approved retail electric and gas base rates and IPL's interim electric base rates that went into effect April 13. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and continued retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes. 
During the past 7 years, we have been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rate flat. The recent rate base additions, which include grid modernization investments, the Marshalltown Generating Station and investments to advance cleaner energy, drove the need for a retail electric rate increase. 
Interim rates include retail electric rate base of approximately $3.8 billion, a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. Interim rates associated with this rate filing went into effect April 13. Therefore, the resulting earnings increase will only impact the last 3 quarters of 2017. To assist you in modeling, we estimate that the $0.20 per share increase in earnings from IPL's interim electric rate increase will be spread across 2017, with approximately 25% recognized in the second quarter, 45% recognized in the third quarter and 30% in the fourth quarter. 
Iowa retail customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017 since the approximate 7% interim rate increase will be offset with a refund related to the lower transmission ROEs and tax benefit rider billing credit. This will be the final year that IPL expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers to help reduce their costs. The 2017 credits are estimated to be $74 million. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year 2017 results. 
Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. On this slide, we estimate a 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 17%, which is 4% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. The WPL retail electric and gas base rate increases, which went into effect January 1, reflect electric and gas rate base growth, including a full year of the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse that was placed in service in 2016 as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. 
As part of the WPL rate design, the PSCW approved the elimination of seasonal pricing beginning in 2017. This will impact the calendar-ization of the rate increases in your forecasting models for this year. We estimate that the $0.18 per share increased earnings impact would be spread across the quarters, with approximately 35% recognized in each of the first and fourth quarters, approximately 25% in the second quarter and minimal increase in the third quarter. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 through the additional wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. 
There have been no changes to our 2017 financing plan. Our plan continues to assume we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We may adjust plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. 
As we look beyond 2017, we expect equity needs to be driven by renewable investments in the West Riverside project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decisions. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 6. For IPL, we expect to receive decision on our emissions plan and budget this quarter. And during the third or fourth quarter, we are planning to file the advance ratemaking principles for additional wind investments for our Iowa customers. 
For WPL, we plan to file a 2018 fuel-only case during the third quarter, which is customary in years where our retail electric rate case is not filed. And also, in the third or fourth quarter, we anticipate filing a Certificate of Authority for additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. 
In our investor deck, we have provided our proposed procedural schedule for the IPL retail electric rate review. This is still a proposed schedule. All parties to the case are working to finalize the schedule, and we plan to have the updated schedule in the investor deck we will be posting on our website prior to the AGA meetings on May 22. 
In closing, I would like to briefly touch on the recent court decisions to remand the New England ROE case back to FERC. This action has not changed our current reserve amount related to the second MISO complaint. We continue to reserve those ATC earnings based on the 9.7% ROE recommended by the ALJ plus ATC's awarded 50 basis point adder. We are monitoring any potential impacts to this court decision on the second MISO ROE complaint and ATC's ongoing authorized ROE. 
We received the refunds for the first MISO ROE complaint earlier this year and started refunding the IPL portion back to Iowa electric customers this week. The WPL portion of the refund will return to Wisconsin electric customers in accordance with a future regulatory proceeding. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I'll turn it back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Today, I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter 2017 results, and I will also share several major milestones that occurred in April. Next, Robert will provide the details on our results as well as review our regulatory schedule. 
Like other utilities in the region, we enjoyed a mild winter, but it did lower our first quarter results by $0.04 per share. This winter was even warmer than last year, in which we realized $0.02 per share lower earnings when compared to normal temperatures. Therefore, mild temperatures led to a negative first quarter variance from last year of $0.02 per share. 
Despite the mild temperatures, we achieved solid earnings this quarter of $0.43 per share, which was the same as the first quarter of 2016. With the exception of the mild weather, these results were in line with our expectations. Robert will provide more details regarding the quarter's results a bit later. And with these financial results, we reaffirm our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. Earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% annually through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings of $1.88. This long-term growth objective continues to be supported by the utilities' robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and constructive regulatory outcomes. 
We achieved several milestones and advanced our strategy in early April. First, Marshalltown Generating Station began commercial operations on April 1. Second, the Franklin County Wind Farm was transferred to IPL also on April 1. And third, IPL filed an electric rate review on April 3, and interim rates went into effect on April 13. 
Marshalltown was completed on time and below budget, with a full load testing heat rate of 6,610 Btu per kilowatt hour, better than the contractual guarantee, and makes it one of the most efficient units in the world. Marshalltown's ability's to quickly ramp up or ramp down energy production complements Iowa's vast wind resources and is a great addition to our energy mix. Marshalltown is expected to have 60% less carbon emissions and 90% less water withdrawals when compared to the 2005 levels of the generating units it is replacing. 
Now that Marshalltown is in service and customers are realizing its benefits, its cost recovery was included in interim rates that went into effect on April 13, earning the authorized 11% ROE. Marshalltown's final costs, including AFUDC and transmission, came in at approximately $750 million, well below the approved cost cap of $920 million. 
Last week, the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded IPL Envision Platinum Award for its work on Marshalltown. This is the first Envision Platinum Award for any company in Iowa. The award recognized IPL's focus on sustainable performance and infrastructure resilience. The award was issued after a peer review process that assessed Marshalltown on 60 sustainability factors addressing a wide range of important criteria. We are very proud that our sustainability efforts were recognized by this distinguished group. 
I do want to take a moment and recognize the Alliant Energy team and all the contractors that brought this project to a successful completion. It was truly a team effort. And I'm not only proud of the excellent construction and performance, but most importantly, safety performance on this project was world-class. Thank you. 
In Wisconsin, we are making good progress on the foundation and underground piping for the Riverside expansion, which we are now calling the West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will supply energy to our customers by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 730 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. 
The 3 electric cooperatives signed a letter of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside, and we expect PSCW approval of the agreement by the third quarter, these co-ops have been WPL wholesale customers for decades. And we are delighted that they'll be our partners in West Riverside. 
Wind energy has been an important and now increasing part of our energy portfolio. Wind energy brings many benefits to our customers and communities, including the annual lease payments to farm families and property tax payments that support the rural communities that we have the privilege to serve. Also, our owned wind farms have remarkable performance in the first quarter, with a total average capacity factor reaching over 40%. And IPL customers are now benefiting from the energy produced by our Franklin County Wind Farm, which is now part of Whispering Willow. 
We are pleased that the state of Iowa encourages generation investments. In late last year, the Iowa Utilities Board approved our plan to add up to 500 megawatts of wind in Iowa. Terms of that approval include a cost cap of $1,830 per kilowatt, including AFUDC and transmission costs, a return on equity of 11% for the life of the asset and depreciable life of 40 years. 
As we discussed with you earlier this year, we were able to secure enough equipment to not only assure the approved 500 megawatts qualified for the 100% PTCs, but also qualified additional wind investments for 100% PTCs. Our current capital expenditure plan includes the 500 megawatts already approved in Iowa and an additional up to 200 megawatts each for IPL and WPL, for a total wind expansion of 900 megawatts replacement service by 2020. However, we are now exploring options to increase our total wind expansion to 1,100 megawatts, with an additional 200 megawatts for IPL. We have enough equipment secured that the full 1,100 megawatts would qualify for the 100% PTCs. Therefore, we plan to make regulatory filings later this year, seeking approval for up to 400 megawatts of additional wind generation at IPL and up to 200 megawatts at WPL. 
As I mentioned, our capital expenditure plans still includes investments of 900 megawatts of wind. We have not yet updated our capital plan to include the additional 200 megawatts at IPL since we are still working to secure additional sites. As is our regular practice, we plan to provide updated capital expenditure estimates in November prior to the EEI Conference. 
Solar generation is the newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our upcoming collaboration with the City of Dubuque and the solar facility for West Riverside, which are both in the planning stages. These projects will be an addition to the 3 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River Campus, our learning laboratory at our Madison headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investments such as these will help us meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. 
The electric and gas distribution systems continue to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. Standardizing voltages and expansion of our underground electricity distribution network are just some of our targeted investments. 
Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, which is giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas systems while, at the same time, continuing our pipeline safety program. And this year, we will begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important foundational component for a smarter and more resilient grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages, two-way energy flow and allow for remote reads, connects and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter  installation in 2019. 
We are making good progress in offering our customers innovative solutions and options. WPL received approval for new residential customer offerings, including simpler time-of-use pricing plans, demand rate pilots, a fixed bill option and lower renewable energy rates. IPL has proposed a revised time-of-day option for residential and small businesses, an economic development rate and a couple of pilots for small customer demand rate and a limited income rate. And both our Iowa and Wisconsin customers are taking advantage of our rebates for installation of EV charging stations. 
We continue execution of our strategy by providing cleaner energies for our customers while building a smarter, more robust grid. We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago with the addition of utility and wind and combined-cycle gas to replace older, smaller and less efficient fossil generation we are retiring. By the end of this year, we will have retired or converted almost 40% our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity. Additionally, we will have retired almost 75% of our oil-fired combustion turbines and diesel-generation capacity by the end of this year. We're on a path toward our carbon emission reduction target of 40% by 2030. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017. Our dedicated employees delivered a solid first quarter, and we'll deliver on our full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target.

As we look beyond 2017, we expect equity needs to be driven by renewable investments in the West Riverside project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decisions. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 6. For IPL, we expect to receive decision on our emissions plan and budget this quarter. And during the third or fourth quarter, we are planning to file the advance ratemaking principles for additional wind investments for our Iowa customers. 
For WPL, we plan to file a 2018 fuel-only case during the third quarter, which is customary in years where our retail electric rate case is not filed. And also, in the third or fourth quarter, we anticipate filing a Certificate of Authority for additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. 
In our investor deck, we have provided our proposed procedural schedule for the IPL retail electric rate review. This is still a proposed schedule. All parties to the case are working to finalize the schedule, and we plan to have the updated schedule in the investor deck we will be posting on our website prior to the AGA meetings on May 22. 
In closing, I would like to briefly touch on the recent court decisions to remand the New England ROE case back to FERC. This action has not changed our current reserve amount related to the second MISO ROE complaint. We continue to reserve those ATC earnings based on the 9.7% ROE recommended by the ALJ plus ATC's awarded 50 basis point adder. We are monitoring any potential impacts to this court decision on the second MISO ROE complaint and ATC's ongoing authorized ROE. 
We received the refunds for the first MISO ROE complaint earlier this year and started refunding the IPL portion back to Iowa electric customers this week. The WPL portion of the refund will return to Wisconsin electric customers in accordance with a future regulatory proceeding. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I'll turn it back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Today, I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter 2017 results, and I will also share several major milestones that occurred in April. Next, Robert will provide the details on our results as well as review our regulatory schedule. 
Like other utilities in the region, we enjoyed a mild winter, but it did lower our first quarter results by $0.04 per share. This winter was even warmer than last year, in which we realized $0.02 per share lower earnings when compared to normal temperatures. Therefore, mild temperatures led to a negative first quarter variance from last year of $0.02 per share. 
Despite the mild temperatures, we achieved solid earnings this quarter of $0.43 per share, which was the same as the first quarter of 2016. With the exception of the mild weather, these results were in line with our expectations. Robert will provide more details regarding the quarter's results a bit later. And with these financial results, we reaffirm our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. Earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% annually through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings of $1.88. This long-term growth objective continues to be supported by the utilities' robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and constructive regulatory outcomes. 
We achieved several milestones and advanced our strategy in early April. First, Marshalltown Generating Station began commercial operations on April 1. Second, the Franklin County Wind Farm was transferred to IPL also on April 1. And third, IPL filed an electric rate review on April 3, and interim rates went into effect on April 13. 
Marshalltown was completed on time and below budget, with a full load testing heat rate of 6,610 Btu per kilowatt hour, better than the contractual guarantee, and makes it one of the most efficient units in the world. Marshalltown's ability's to quickly ramp up or ramp down energy production complements Iowa's vast wind resources and is a great addition to our energy mix. Marshalltown is expected to have 60% less carbon emissions and 90% less water withdrawals when compared to the 2005 levels of the generating units it is replacing. 
Now that Marshalltown is in service and customers are realizing its benefits, its cost recovery was included in interim rates that went into effect on April 13, earning the authorized 11% ROE. Marshalltown's final costs, including AFUDC and transmission, came in at approximately $750 million, well below the approved cost cap of $920 million. 
Last week, the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded IPL Envision Platinum Award for its work on Marshalltown. This is the first Envision Platinum Award for any company in Iowa. The award recognized IPL's focus on sustainable performance and infrastructure resilience. The award was issued after a peer review process that assessed Marshalltown on 60 sustainability factors addressing a wide range of important criteria. We are very proud that our sustainability efforts were recognized by this distinguished group. 
I do want to take a moment and recognize the Alliant Energy team and all the contractors that brought this project to a successful completion. It was truly a team effort. And I'm not only proud of the excellent construction and performance, but most importantly, safety performance on this project was world-class. Thank you. 
In Wisconsin, we are making good progress on the foundation and underground piping for the Riverside expansion, which we are now calling the West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will supply energy to our customers by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 730 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. 
The 3 electric cooperatives signed a letter of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside, and we expect PSCW approval of the agreement by the third quarter, these co-ops have been WPL wholesale customers for decades. And we are delighted that they'll be our partners in West Riverside. 
Wind energy has been an important and now increasing part of our energy portfolio. Wind energy brings many benefits to our customers and communities, including the annual lease payments to farm families and property tax payments that support the rural communities that we have the privilege to serve. Also, our owned wind farms have remarkable performance in the first quarter, with a total average capacity factor reaching over 40%. And IPL customers are now benefiting from the energy produced by our Franklin County Wind Farm, which is now part of Whispering Willow. 
We are pleased that the state of Iowa encourages generation investments. In late last year, the Iowa Utilities Board approved our plan to add up to 500 megawatts of wind in Iowa. Terms of that approval include a cost cap of $1,830 per kilowatt, including AFUDC and transmission costs, a return on equity of 11% for the life of the asset and depreciable life of 40 years. 
As we discussed with you earlier this year, we were able to secure enough equipment to not only assure the approved 500 megawatts qualified for the 100% PTCs, but also qualified additional wind investments for 100% PTCs. Our current capital expenditure plan includes the 500 megawatts already approved in Iowa and an additional up to 200 megawatts each for IPL and WPL, for a total wind expansion of 900 megawatts replacement service by 2020. However, we are now exploring options to increase our total wind expansion to 1,100 megawatts, with an additional 200 megawatts for IPL. We have enough equipment secured that the full 1,100 megawatts would qualify for the 100% PTCs. Therefore, we plan to make regulatory filings later this year, seeking approval for up to 400 megawatts of additional wind generation at IPL and up to 200 megawatts at WPL. 
As I mentioned, our capital expenditure plans still includes investments of 900 megawatts of wind. We have not yet updated our capital plan to include the additional 200 megawatts at IPL since we are still working to secure additional sites. As is our regular practice, we plan to provide updated capital expenditure estimates in November prior to the EEI Conference. 
Solar generation is the newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our upcoming collaboration with the City of Dubuque and the solar facility for West Riverside, which are both in the planning stages. These projects will be an addition to the 3 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River Campus, our learning laboratory at our Madison headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investments such as these will help us meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. 
The electric and gas distribution systems continue to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. Standardizing voltages and expansion of our underground electricity distribution network are just some of our targeted investments. 
Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, which is giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas systems while, at the same time, continuing our pipeline safety program. And this year, we will begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important foundational component for a smarter and more resilient grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages, two-way energy flow and allow for remote reads, connects and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter  installation in 2019. 
We are making good progress in offering our customers innovative solutions and options. WPL received approval for new residential customer offerings, including simpler time-of-use pricing plans, demand rate pilots, a fixed bill option and lower renewable energy rates. IPL has proposed a revised time-of-day option for residential and small businesses, an economic development rate and a couple of pilots for small customer demand rate and a limited income rate. And both our Iowa and Wisconsin customers are taking advantage of our rebates for installation of EV charging stations. 
We continue execution of our strategy by providing cleaner energies for our customers while building a smarter, more robust grid. We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago with the addition of utility and wind and combined-cycle gas to replace older, smaller and less efficient fossil generation we are retiring. By the end of this year, we will have retired or converted almost 40% our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity. Additionally, we will have retired almost 75% of our oil-fired combustion turbines and diesel-generation capacity by the end of this year. We're on a path toward our carbon emission reduction target of 40% by 2030. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017. Our dedicated employees delivered a solid first quarter, and we'll deliver on our full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout target is 63.3% based on the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99 per share. 
We expect to complete projects on time and at or below budget and at a very safe manner. We will continue working with our regulators, customer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. We continue to focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

We released first quarter 2017 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.43 per share, which is the same as the earnings for the first quarter 2016. Our summary of the year-over-year earnings drive",1249,"Good morning, everyone. We released first quarter 2017 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.43 per share, which is the same as the earnings for the first quarter 2016. 
Our summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers can be found on Slides 2 and 3. New WPL retail electric and gas base rates, which went in effect January 1, contributed to higher earnings in the first quarter of 2017. These increased earnings were offset by the negative impacts of mild temperatures, higher fuel expense and higher depreciation expense from rate base additions. Excluding the impacts of temperatures and the extra day in 2016 for leap year, retail electric sales between the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 increased more than 1%. 
Now let's briefly review our 2017 guidance. Last evening, we shared our updated view of our earnings walk comparing 2016 non-GAAP EPS to the midpoint of the 2017 EPS guidance range on Slide 4. The update quantifies the impacts of higher IPL and WPL revenues due to the retail base rate increases as separate drivers in the earnings walk. As shown on this slide, the 6% growth in earnings is primarily driven by infrastructure investments reflected in WPL's recently approved retail electric and gas base rates and IPL's interim electric base rates that went into effect April 13. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and continued retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes. 
During the past 7 years, we have been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rate flat. The recent rate base additions, which include grid modernization investments, the Marshalltown Generating Station and investments to advance cleaner energy, drove the need for a retail electric rate increase. 
Interim rates include retail electric rate base of approximately $3.8 billion, a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. Interim rates associated with this rate filing went into effect April 13. Therefore, the resulting earnings increase will only impact the last 3 quarters of 2017. To assist you in modeling, we estimate that the $0.20 per share increase in earnings from IPL's interim electric rate increase will be spread across 2017, with approximately 25% recognized in the second quarter, 45% recognized in the third quarter and 30% in the fourth quarter. 
Iowa retail customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017 since the approximate 7% interim rate increase will be offset with a refund related to the lower transmission ROEs and tax benefit rider billing credit. This will be the final year that IPL expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers to help reduce their costs. The 2017 credits are estimated to be $74 million. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year 2017 results. 
Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. On this slide, we estimate a 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 17%, which is 4% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. The WPL retail electric and gas base rate increases, which went into effect January 1, reflect electric and gas rate base growth, including a full year of the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse that was placed in service in 2016 as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. 
As part of the WPL rate design, the PSCW approved the elimination of seasonal pricing beginning in 2017. This will impact the calendar-ization of the rate increases in your forecasting models for this year. We estimate that the $0.18 per share increased earnings impact would be spread across the quarters, with approximately 35% recognized in each of the first and fourth quarters, approximately 25% in the second quarter and minimal increase in the third quarter. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 [ through ] the additional wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. 
There have been no changes to our 2017 financing plan. Our plan continues to assume we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We may adjust plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. 
As we look beyond 2017, we expect equity needs to be driven by renewable investments in the West Riverside project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decisions. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 6. For IPL, we expect to receive decision on our emissions plan and budget this quarter. And during the third or fourth quarter, we are planning to file the advance ratemaking principles for additional wind investments for our Iowa customers. 
For WPL, we plan to file a 2018 fuel-only case during the third quarter, which is customary in years where our retail electric rate case is not filed. And also, in the third or fourth quarter, we anticipate filing a Certificate of Authority for additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. 
In our investor deck, we have provided our proposed procedural schedule for the IPL retail electric rate review. This is still a proposed schedule. All parties to the case are working to finalize the schedule, and we plan to have the updated schedule in the investor deck we will be posting on our website prior to the AGA meetings on May 22. 
In closing, I would like to briefly touch on the recent court decisions to remand the New England ROE case back to FERC. This action has not changed our current reserve amount related to the second MISO ROE complaint. We continue to reserve those ATC earnings based on the 9.7% ROE recommended by the ALJ plus ATC's awarded 50 basis point adder.

Today, I'm pleased to share with you our first quarter 2017 results, and I will also share several major milestones that occurred in April. Next, Robert will provide the details on our results as well as review our regulatory schedule. 
Like other utilities in the region, we enjoyed a mild winter, but it did lower our first quarter results by $0.04 per share. This winter was even warmer than last year, in which we realized $0.02 per share lower earnings when compared to normal temperatures. Therefore, mild temperatures led to a negative first quarter variance from last year of $0.02 per share. 
Despite the mild temperatures, we achieved solid earnings this quarter of $0.43 per share, which was the same as the first quarter of 2016. With the exception of the mild weather, these results were in line with our expectations. Robert will provide more details regarding the quarter's results a bit later. And with these financial results, we reaffirm our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. Earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% annually through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings per share of $1.88. This long-term growth objective continues to be supported by the utilities' robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and constructive regulatory outcomes. 
We achieved several milestones and advanced our strategy in early April. First, Marshalltown Generating Station began commercial operations on April 1. Second, the Franklin County Wind Farm was transferred to IPL also on April 1. And third, IPL filed an electric rate review on April 3, and interim rates went into effect on April 13. 
Marshalltown was completed on time and below budget, with a full load testing heat rate of 6,610 Btu per kilowatt hour, better than the contractual guarantee, and makes it one of the most efficient units in the world. Marshalltown's ability's to quickly ramp up or ramp down energy production complements Iowa's vast wind resources and is a great addition to our energy mix. Marshalltown is expected to have 60% less carbon emissions and 90% less water withdrawals when compared to the 2005 levels of the generating units it is replacing. 
Now that Marshalltown is in service and customers are realizing its benefits, its cost recovery was included in interim rates that went into effect on April 13, earning the authorized 11% ROE. Marshalltown's final costs, including AFUDC and transmission, came in at approximately $750 million, well below the approved cost cap of $920 million. 
Last week, the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure awarded IPL Envision Platinum Award for its work on Marshalltown. This is the first Envision Platinum Award for any company in Iowa. The award recognized IPL's focus on sustainable performance and infrastructure resilience. The award was issued after a peer review process that assessed Marshalltown on 60 sustainability factors addressing a wide range of important criteria. We are very proud that our sustainability efforts were recognized by this distinguished group. 
I do want to take a moment and recognize the Alliant Energy team and all the contractors that brought this project to a successful completion. It was truly a team effort. And I'm not only proud of the excellent construction and performance, but most importantly, safety performance on this project was world-class. Thank you. 
In Wisconsin, we are making good progress on the foundation and underground piping for the Riverside expansion, which we are now calling the West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will supply energy to our customers by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 730 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. 
The 3 electric cooperatives signed a letter of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside, and we expect PSCW approval of the agreement by the third quarter, these co-ops have been WPL wholesale customers for decades. And we are delighted that they'll be our partners in West Riverside. 
Wind energy has been an important and now increasing part of our energy portfolio. Wind energy brings many benefits to our customers and communities, including the annual lease payments to farm families and property tax payments that support the rural communities that we have the privilege to serve. Also, our owned wind farms have remarkable performance in the first quarter, with a total average capacity factor reaching over 40%. And IPL customers are now benefiting from the energy produced by our Franklin County Wind Farm, which is now part of Whispering Willow. 
We are pleased that the state of Iowa encourages generation investments. In late last year, the Iowa Utilities Board approved our plan to add up to 500 megawatts of wind in Iowa. Terms of that approval include a cost cap of $1,830 per kilowatt, including AFUDC and transmission costs, a return on equity of 11% for the life of the asset and depreciable life of 40 years. 
As we discussed with you earlier this year, we were able to secure enough equipment to not only assure the approved 500 megawatts qualified for the 100% PTCs, but also qualified additional wind investments for 100% PTCs. Our current capital expenditure plan includes the 500 megawatts already approved in Iowa and an additional up to 200 megawatts each for IPL and WPL, for a total wind expansion of 900 megawatts replacement service by 2020. However, we are now exploring options to increase our total wind expansion to 1,100 megawatts, with an additional 200 megawatts for IPL. We have enough equipment secured that the full 1,100 megawatts would qualify for the 100% PTCs. Therefore, we plan to make regulatory filings later this year, seeking approval for up to 400 megawatts of additional wind generation at IPL and up to 200 megawatts at WPL. 
As I mentioned, our capital expenditure plans still includes investments of 900 megawatts of wind. We have not yet updated our capital plan to include the additional 200 megawatts at IPL since we are still working to secure additional sites. As is our regular practice, we plan to provide updated capital expenditure estimates in November prior to the EEI Conference. 
Solar generation is the newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our upcoming collaboration with the City of Dubuque and the solar facility for West Riverside, which are both in the planning stages. These projects will be an addition to the 3 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River Campus, our learning laboratory at our Madison headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investments such as these will help us meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. 
The electric and gas distribution systems continue to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. Standardizing voltages and expansion of our underground electricity distribution network are just some of our targeted investments. 
Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, which is giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas systems while, at the same time, continuing our pipeline safety program. And this year, we will begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important foundational component for a smarter and more resilient grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages, two-way energy flow and allow for remote reads, connects and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter  installation in 2019. 
We are making good progress in offering our customers innovative solutions and options. WPL received approval for new residential customer offerings, including simpler time-of-use pricing plans, demand rate pilots, a fixed bill option and lower renewable energy rates. IPL has proposed a revised time-of-day option for residential and small businesses, an economic development rate and a couple of pilots for small customer demand rate and a limited income rate. And both our Iowa and Wisconsin customers are taking advantage of our rebates for installation of EV charging stations. 
We continue execution of our strategy by providing cleaner energies for our customers while building a smarter, more robust grid. We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago with the addition of utility and wind and combined-cycle gas to replace older, smaller and less efficient fossil generation we are retiring. By the end of this year, we will have retired or converted almost 40% our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity. Additionally, we will have retired almost 75% of our oil-fired combustion turbines and diesel-generation capacity by the end of this year. We're on a path toward our carbon emission reduction target of 40% by 2030. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017. Our dedicated employees delivered a solid first quarter, and we'll deliver on our full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and a 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout target is 63.3% based on the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99 per share. 
We expect to complete projects on time and at or below budget and at a very safe manner. We will continue working with our regulators, customer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. We continue to focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,428434581,1228017,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Good morning, everyone. We released first quarter 2017 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.43 per share, which is the same as the earnings for the first quarter 2016. Our summary of the year-over-year earnings drive",1249,"Good morning, everyone. We released first quarter 2017 earnings last evening, with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.43 per share, which is the same as the earnings for the first quarter 2016. 
Our summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers can be found on Slides 2 and 3. New WPL retail electric and gas base rates, which went in effect January 1, contributed to higher earnings in the first quarter of 2017. These increased earnings were offset by the negative impacts of mild temperatures, higher fuel expense and higher depreciation expense from rate base additions. Excluding the impacts of temperatures and the extra day in 2016 for leap year, retail electric sales between the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 increased more than 1%. 
Now let's briefly review our 2017 guidance. Last evening, we shared our updated view of our earnings walk comparing 2016 non-GAAP EPS to the midpoint of the 2017 EPS guidance range on Slide 4. The update quantifies the impacts of higher IPL and WPL revenues due to the retail base rate increases as separate drivers in the earnings walk. As shown on this slide, the 6% growth in earnings is primarily driven by infrastructure investments reflected in WPL's recently approved retail electric and gas base rates and IPL's interim electric base rates that went into effect April 13. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and continued retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes. 
During the past 7 years, we have been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rate flat. The recent rate base additions, which include grid modernization investments, the Marshalltown Generating Station and investments to advance cleaner energy, drove the need for a retail electric rate increase. 
Interim rates include retail electric rate base of approximately $3.8 billion, a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. Interim rates associated with this rate filing went into effect April 13. Therefore, the resulting earnings increase will only impact the last 3 quarters of 2017. To assist you in modeling, we estimate that the $0.20 per share increase in earnings from IPL's interim electric rate increase will be spread across 2017, with approximately 25% recognized in the second quarter, 45% recognized in the third quarter and 30% in the fourth quarter. 
Iowa retail customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017 since the approximate 7% interim rate increase will be offset with a refund related to the lower transmission ROEs and tax benefit rider billing credit. This will be the final year that IPL expects to provide tax benefit rider billing credits to electric and gas customers to help reduce their costs. The 2017 credits are estimated to be $74 million. As in prior years, the tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact full year 2017 results. 
Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC. On this slide, we estimate a 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 17%, which is 4% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. The WPL retail electric and gas base rate increases, which went into effect January 1, reflect electric and gas rate base growth, including a full year of the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse that was placed in service in 2016 as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. 
As part of the WPL rate design, the PSCW approved the elimination of seasonal pricing beginning in 2017. This will impact the calendar-ization of the rate increases in your forecasting models for this year. We estimate that the $0.18 per share increased earnings impact would be spread across the quarters, with approximately 35% recognized in each of the first and fourth quarters, approximately 25% in the second quarter and minimal increase in the third quarter. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast reflects strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and impacts of the extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 [ through ] the additional wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. 
There have been no changes to our 2017 financing plan. Our plan continues to assume we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We may adjust plans as deemed prudent if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. 
As we look beyond 2017, we expect equity needs to be driven by renewable investments in the West Riverside project. Our forecast assumes that capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our intent is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decisions. 
We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 6. For IPL, we expect to receive decision on our emissions plan and budget this quarter. And during the third or fourth quarter, we are planning to file the advance ratemaking principles for additional wind investments for our Iowa customers. 
For WPL, we plan to file a 2018 fuel-only case during the third quarter, which is customary in years where our retail electric rate case is not filed. And also, in the third or fourth quarter, we anticipate filing a Certificate of Authority for additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. 
In our investor deck, we have provided our proposed procedural schedule for the IPL retail electric rate review. This is still a proposed schedule. All parties to the case are working to finalize the schedule, and we plan to have the updated schedule in the investor deck we will be posting on our website prior to the AGA meetings on May 22. 
In closing, I would like to briefly touch on the recent court decisions to remand the New England ROE case back to FERC. This action has not changed our current reserve amount related to the second MISO ROE complaint. We continue to reserve those ATC earnings based on the 9.7% ROE recommended by the ALJ plus ATC's awarded 50 basis point adder. We are monitoring any potential impacts to this court decision on the second MISO ROE complaint and ATC's ongoing authorized ROE. 
We received the refunds for the first MISO ROE complaint earlier this year and started refunding the IPL portion back to Iowa electric customers this week. The WPL portion of the refund will return to Wisconsin electric customers in accordance with a future regulatory proceeding. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I'll turn it back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Today, I am pleased to share with you our second quarter 2017 results and I will update you on some recent progress we've made on delivering on our commitments and advancing our strategy. Next, Robert will provide details on our second quarter 2017 results as well as review our regulatory schedule. 
Although we experienced a stormy and wet spring, the temperatures were on average normal in the second quarter 2017. In comparison, last spring was slightly warmer, which led to a negative quarter-over-quarter variance of $0.01 per share. With the normal temperatures, we achieved solid earnings this quarter of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. These results were in line with our expectations and reflect revenue increases at both utilities. Robert will provide more details regarding this quarter's results a bit later. 
Although year-to-date earnings were negatively impacted by the warm winter experienced during the first quarter, our year-to-date earnings are still within our earnings guidance range. So we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. Our earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% annually through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings per share of $1.88. This long-term earnings growth continues to be supported by the utility's robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and constructive regulatory outcomes. 
Let me spend a few minutes updating you on our wind investment activities. At the time the capital plan was issued in November, we were confident that we secured enough equipment from GE to assure that 100% PTCs could be realized on a total of 900 megawatts of additional wind, including the 500-megawatt that was already approved by the IUB in Iowa. Now that we have more transparency into the total project cost and size availability, we believe that we can install up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind that can qualify for 100% PTCs. But just yesterday, we filed a new advanced rate making principal application, or RPU, with the Iowa Utilities Board to request approval for another up to 500 megawatts of utility owned wind. This cost-effective addition to our resource plan will help keep energy costs stable for customers over the long term. In the RPU, we requested the same return on equity of 11% that was approved in the last proceeding. We also requested a cost cap of $1,780 per kW, including AFUDC and transmission, which is slightly below the cap approved in the last proceeding. Details of the filings may be found on Slide 2. We still plan on filing with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission for additional 200 megawatts of wind for WPL later this year. We are in the early stages of that process and I will discuss that in a few minutes. 
Please keep in mind that our current published capital expenditure plan includes the 500 megawatts already approved in Iowa and an additional 200 each for IPL and WPL, for total wind expansion of 900 megawatts during the 2017-2020 period. Since the time we issued our capital guidance, wind install costs are trending lower and are now coming in below our original forecast. Also, as we evaluate construction schedules and in-service dates, we expect to shift cost between years and the plan. As a result, we don't expect our 2017 or 2020 capital plan to increase by the full project amount for the additional 300 megawatts of wind. We will update our capital energy plan as part of our third quarter earnings release in November, but I want to be clear that this additional wind investment aligns with our earnings growth objective of 5% to 7%. 
We continue to make good progress on our wind expansion efforts, including the acquisition of additional high-performing sites for future utility wind development. I am pleased to announce that we recently executed a contract of [indiscernible] to acquire their 170-megawatt English farm site in the Southeast Iowa that is expected to close by year-end. With this acquisition, our undeveloped utility wind sites total over 1,000 megawatts, including our previously announced purchase of the 300 megawatts of [indiscernible] site and the remaining land available at our existing Whispering Willow and [indiscernible] sites that can accommodate up to an additional 600 megawatts of new wind. Construction will commence soon on the already approved 500 megawatts of Iowa wind. I am pleased to announce that the Infrastructure Energy Alternative LLC, commonly known as IEA, has been selected as the balance of plan contractor for that portion of our wind expansion. We are forecasting that approximately half of this project will go in service in 2019 and the other half in 2020. 
In our efforts to continue pursuing affordable energy options for our customers, we issued a request for proposals for up to 200 megawatts of wind service [indiscernible] customers. There's a lot of interest in the RFP and our team is currently reviewing the various proposals that we received. This is the first step in our process to analyze the different alternatives before seeking PSCW approval to add additional wind resources to our WPL energy portfolio. 
Wind energy will continue to be a significant resource which normally enhances our ability to manage cost for customers, but also fulfills their increasing desire for renewable energy. Our utility wind portfolio of 568 megawatts will grow substantially with the plans to increase it by up to 1,200 megawatts. In addition, we supplemented our owned resources with approximately 600 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. We now forecast that with our utility owned wind and purchase power agreements at almost 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity will be from renewables by 2024. We're very fortunate that we serve customers in a region where wind energy is economic and abundant and we must thank our supportive communities and farm families and they are great partners in fueling our future. 
In addition to our utility owned wind, we recently announced a nonregulated wind investment in the great Western wind project. After receiving FERC approval in July, I am pleased to report that last week, we closed on this acquisition on a 50% cash equity ownership interest in this Oklahoma wind project. We expect this investment to be modestly accretive to earnings in the first year and now finance the acquisition through a term loan. We are being very thoughtful and opportunistically in pursuing nonregulated growth opportunities, with loan risk profiles such as the Great Western project, which already includes a long-term PPA. We expect that our nonregulated business will contribute no more than 10% of our consolidated earnings in the next 5 years. 
Moving on to our guest generation investments. We're making good progress with Wisconsin's West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will supply enough energy to our customers by early 2020. [indiscernible] be approximately 703 megawatts and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. The 3 elective cooperatives signed letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside, and we have already received FERC approval and expect PSCW approval of our agreement with the co-ops by the end of the quarter. These co-ops have been WPL's wholesale customers for decades. We are delighted that they will be our partners in West Riverside. 
Solar generation is our newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our collaboration on 2 solar projects with the City of Dubuque. The [indiscernible] project is approximately 85% complete, and the Port of Dubuque project is approximately 55% complete. These projects are expected to start generating renewable energy for customers in September. Planning work continues for solar integration with our newest gas generating stations: West Riverside Energy Center in Southern Wisconsin; and Marshalltown Generating Station in central Iowa. These projects are in addition to the 3 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River campus, our [indiscernible] laboratory at our Madison headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investment such as these, as well as the beyond solar tariff recently filed in Iowa, will help us to meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. 
The electric and gas distribution systems continue to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. Standardizing voltages and selective reliability improvements, such as expansion of our underground electric distribution network, are just some of our targeted investments. On the gas side, we continue to make investments in our pipeline safety program. Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, just giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas systems. This year, we will begin installation of smart meters for Iowa, electric and gas customers. This is an important foundational component for a smarter and more resilient power grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages to energy flow and offer remote  [indiscernible], connects and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter installation in 2019. 
We continue to execute on our strategy by providing cleaner energy for our customers by building a smarter, more robust grid. We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago, with the addition of utility owned wind and combined-cycle gas to replace the older, smaller and less efficient fossil generation we are retiring. By the end of this year, we will have retired or converted almost 40% of our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity. Additionally, we will not retire almost 75% of our oil and diesel fired generation capacity by the end of this year. 
We are on a solid path toward our carbon emission target of 40% by 2030. We've also established a new target to reduce water withdrawals by 75% by 2030 from 2005 levels. 
[indiscernible] to review the progress we have made towards achieving our carbon reduction target as well as our sustainability targets by raising the 2017 corporate Sustainability Report, which will be issued in the middle of this month. 
Before I wrap up, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees for their strong recovery efforts. Iowa and Wisconsin have experienced significant strong activity during last couple of months. I'm extremely proud of the quick response times and restoration efforts exhibited by our employees all by keeping safety top of mind. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017. Our dedicated employees delivered solid second quarter 2017 results, and will deliver our full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout ratio is 63.3% based on the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99. We expect to complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner. We will continue working with the regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. Continued focus on serving our customers and being the partners with our communities are reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest on Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,531484972,1267742,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2017",2017-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Good morning, everyone. We released second quarter 2017 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. Our summary of the year-over-year earnings dr",1265,"Good morning, everyone. 
We released second quarter 2017 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. Our summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers can be found on Slides 3 and 4. 
Contributing to the higher earnings in the second quarter were new WPL retail electric and gas base rates, which went into effect on January 1 and IPL interim retail electric base rates, which went into effect on April 13. These increases in earnings were offset by the negative impacts of higher depreciation expense from rate base additions, including the Marshalltown gas facility at IPL as well as higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at WPL. 
Let me turn on Alliant's retail electric sales between the second quarters of 2017 and '16 were essentially flat. Excluding the impact of temperatures and the extra day in 2016 for leap year, retail electric sales during the first half of 2017 increased approximately 1% compared to last year. 
Now let's briefly review our full year 2017 earnings guidance. As Pat noted, we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and continued retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes. The projected 6% growth in earnings for 2017 will be primarily driven by infrastructure investments reflected in IPL's and WPL's recent base rate review. 
Starting with our Iowa jurisdiction. During the past 7 years we have been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rates flat for our customers. The recent rate base additions, which include electric distribution investments, the Marshalltown Generating Station and investments to advanced cleaner energy, drove the need for a retail electric rate increase. Interim rates implemented in the second quarter include: retail electric rate base of approximately $3.8 billion; a blended ROE of approximately 10%; and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. Given the interim rate started in the second quarter, the resulting earnings increase will only impact the last 3 quarters of 2017. 
Iowa retail customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017 since the approximate 7% interim rate increase will be offset with refunds related to lower transmission ROEs and billing credits from the tax benefit rider. The 2017 electric tax benefit rider credits are estimated to be $68 billion -- or $68 million. As in prior years, these tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact the full year 2017 results. 
Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impact of a tax benefit rider. On this slide, we estimate a 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 17%, which is 4% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. 
Turning to our Wisconsin jurisdiction. The WPL electric and gas base rate increases went into effect January 1. These reflect electric and gas rate base growth, including a full year of the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse that was placed in service in 2016 as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. As part of the new WPL rate design, the PSCW approved the elimination of seasonal pricing beginning in 2017. This will impact the calendarization of the rate increase in your forecasting models for this year. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast continues to anticipate strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions reflected after 2021 due to the additional wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. 
There have been no material changes to our 2017 financing plan. Our plan continues to assume we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We completed the issuance of $125 million of new common equity under an ATM program during the second quarter. We also entered into a $95 million term loan last week to finance the Great Western wind project acquisition. We may adjust the remaining financing plan for 2017 as being prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. As we look beyond 2017, we expect equity needs to be driven by renewable investments in the West Riverside project. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our plan is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decision. 
Finally, for our regulatory schedule. We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 6. For WPL, we anticipate a decision in the fourth quarter on the recently filed fuel only case for 2018. Also, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate filing for a certificate of authority for additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. For IPL, we received the decision on our emissions plan and budget for the second quarter and yesterday, we filed the advanced rate making principals for the second 500-megawatt wind investment for our Iowa customers. We have requested rate-making principals consistent with the application for the first 500 megawatts approved by the IUB last year. The only notable difference is a lower-cost cap, reflecting a trend in declining capital cost for wind project. 
In closing, I would like to briefly discuss the IPL retail electric base rate review. Intervenor direct testimony was filed earlier this week. This completes the initial testimony by all interested parties as the IUB staff does not file testimony. Some of the key issues addressed in the interim testimony were: return on equity; rate design; and the recovery of certain capital and deferred cost. Financial information filed confidentially by the intervenors will be made available within the next couple of business days have been made public. The office of the consumer advocate has proposed a $90 million increase in the revenue requirement versus the $176 million increase requested by IPL. Approximately half of the difference between the increases [indiscernible] by the OTA and the IPL related different return on equity amounts. To assist you in assessing the impact of the different viewpoints on the ROEs, please note that each 15 basis point change in ROE impacts, the revenue requirement by approximately $4 million or a $0.01 per share earnings impact. 
We appreciate the point of view presented by each of the intervenors and acknowledge the divergent viewpoints are a normal part of rate reviews. We look forward to discussions with the intervenors in the coming weeks as we work through the rate review process. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Today, I am pleased to share with you our second quarter 2017 results, and I will update you on some recent progress we've made on delivering on our commitments",1922,"Thanks, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Today, I am pleased to share with you our second quarter 2017 results, and I will update you on some recent progress we've made on delivering on our commitments and advancing our strategy. Next, Robert will provide details on our second quarter 2017 results as well as review our regulatory schedule. 
Although we experienced a stormy and wet spring, the temperatures were, on average, normal in the second quarter 2017. In comparison, last spring was slightly warmer, which led to a negative quarter-over-quarter variance of $0.01 per share. With the normal temperatures, we achieved solid earnings this quarter of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. These results were in line with our expectations and reflect revenue increases at both utilities. Robert will provide more details regarding this quarter's results a bit later. 
Although year-to-date earnings were negatively impacted by the warm winter experienced during the first quarter, our year-to-date earnings are still within our earnings guidance range. So we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. Our earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% annually through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings per share of $1.88. This long-term earnings growth continues to be supported by the utility's robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and constructive regulatory outcomes. 
Let me spend a few minutes updating you on our wind investment activities. At the time the capital plan was issued in November, we were confident that we secured enough equipment from GE to assure that 100% PTCs could be realized on a total of 900 megawatts of additional wind, including the 500-megawatt that was already approved by the IUB in Iowa. Now that we have more transparency into the total project cost and size availability, we believe that we can install up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind that can qualify for 100% PTCs. 
But just yesterday, we filed a new advanced rate making principal application, or RPU, with the Iowa Utilities Board to request approval for another up to 500 megawatts of utility-owned wind. This cost-effective addition to our resource plan will help keep energy costs stable for customers over the long term. 
In the RPU, we requested the same return on equity of 11% that was approved in the last proceeding. We also requested a cost cap of $1,780 per kW, including AFUDC and transmission, which is slightly below the cap approved in the last proceeding. Details of the filings may be found on Slide 2. 
We still plan on filing with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission for additional 200 megawatts of wind for WPL later this year. We are in the early stages of that process, and I will discuss that in a few minutes. 
Please keep in mind that our current published capital expenditure plan includes the 500 megawatts already approved in Iowa and an additional 200 each for IPL and WPL, for total wind expansion of 900 megawatts during the 2017-2020 period. Since the time we issued our capital guidance, wind install costs are trending lower and are now coming in below our original forecast. Also, as we evaluate construction schedules and in-service dates, we expect to shift cost between years in the plan. As a result, we don't expect our 2017 or 2020 capital plan to increase by the full project amount for the additional 300 megawatts of wind. We will update our capital energy plan as part of our third quarter earnings release in November, but I want to be clear that this additional wind investment aligns with our earnings growth objective of 5% to 7%. 
We continue to make good progress on our wind expansion efforts, including the acquisition of additional high-performing sites for future utility wind development. I am pleased to announce that we recently executed a contract with [indiscernible] to acquire their 170-megawatt English farm site in the Southeast Iowa that is expected to close by year-end. With this acquisition, our undeveloped utility wind sites totaled over 1,000 megawatts, including our previously announced purchase of the 300 megawatts of Upland Prairie site and the remaining land available at our existing Whispering Willow and Bent Tree sites that can accommodate up to an additional 600 megawatts of new wind. Construction will commence soon on the already approved 500 megawatts of Iowa wind. I am pleased to announce that the Infrastructure Energy Alternative LLC, commonly known as IEA, has been selected as the balance of plant contractor for that portion of our wind expansion. We are forecasting that approximately half of this project will go in service in 2019 and the other half in 2020. 
In our efforts to continue pursuing affordable energy options for our customers, we issued a request for proposals for up to 200 megawatts of wind for Wisconsin customers. There's a lot of interest in the RFP, and our team is currently reviewing the various proposals that we received. This is the first step in our process to analyze the different alternatives before seeking PSCW approval to add additional wind resources to our WPL energy portfolio. 
Wind energy will continue to be a significant resource, which normally enhances our ability to manage cost for customers, but also fulfills their increasing desire for renewable energy. Our utility wind portfolio of 568 megawatts will grow substantially with the plans to increase it by up to 1,200 megawatts. In addition, we supplemented our owned resources with approximately 600 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. We now forecast that with our utility-owned wind and purchase power agreements at almost 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity will be from renewables by 2024. We are very fortunate that we serve customers in a region where wind energy is economic and abundant, and I must thank our supportive rural communities and farm families, and they are great partners in fueling our future. 
In addition to our utility-owned wind, we recently announced a nonregulated wind investment in the Great Western wind project. After receiving FERC approval in July, I am pleased to report that last week, we closed on this acquisition on a 50% cash equity ownership interest in this Oklahoma wind project. We expect this investment to be modestly accretive to earnings in the first year and now finance the acquisition through a term loan. We are being very thoughtful and opportunistic in pursuing nonregulated growth opportunities, with low risk profiles such as the Great Western project, which already includes a long-term PPA. We expect that our nonregulated business will contribute no more than 10% of our consolidated earnings in the next 5 years. 
Moving on to our gas generation investments. We're making good progress with Wisconsin's West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will supply enough energy to our customers by early 2020. Its outflow will be approximately 703 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. The 3 elective cooperatives signed letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside, and we have already received FERC approval and expect PSCW approval of our agreement with the co-ops by the end of the quarter. These co-ops have been WPL's wholesale customers for decades. We are delighted that they will be our partners in West Riverside. 
Solar generation is our newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our collaboration on 2 solar projects with the City of Dubuque. The West Dubuque project is approximately 85% complete, and the Port of Dubuque project is approximately 55% complete. These projects are expected to start generating renewable energy for customers in September. 
Planning work continues for solar integration with our newest gas generating stations: West Riverside Energy Center in Southern Wisconsin and Marshalltown Generating Station in Central Iowa. These projects are in addition to the 3 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River campus, our learning laboratory at our Madison headquarters, and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investment such as these, as well as the Beyond Solar tariff recently filed in Iowa, will help us meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. 
The electric and gas distribution systems continue to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. Standardizing voltages and selective reliability improvements, such as expansion of our underground electric distribution network, are just some of our targeted investments. 
On the gas side, we continue to make investments in our pipeline safety program. Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, just giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas systems. This year, we will begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important foundational component for a smarter and more resilient power grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages, 2-way energy flow and offer remotely connects and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter installation in 2019. 
We continue to execute on our strategy by providing cleaner energy for our customers by building a smarter, more robust grid. We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago, with the addition of utility-owned wind and combined-cycle gas to replace the older, smaller and less efficient fossil generation we are retiring. By the end of this year, we will have retired or converted almost 40% of our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity. Additionally, we will now retire almost 75% of our oil and diesel fired generation capacity by the end of this year. 
We are on a solid path toward a carbon emission target of 40% by 2030. We've also established a new target to reduce water withdrawals by 75% by 2030 from 2005 levels. I encourage you to review the progress we have made towards achieving our carbon reduction target as well as our other sustainability targets by reading the 2017 Corporate Sustainability Report, which will be issued in the middle of this month. 
Before I wrap up, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees for their strong recovery efforts. Iowa and Wisconsin have experienced significant strong activity during the last couple of months. I'm extremely proud of the quick response times and restoration efforts exhibited by our employees, all by keeping safety top of mind. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017. Our dedicated employees delivered solid second quarter 2017 results and will deliver our full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout ratio is 63.3% based on the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99. We expect to complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner. We will continue working with the regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. Continued focus on serving our customers and being the partners with our communities are reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest on Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

We released second quarter 2017 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. A summary of the year-over-year earnings drive",1264,"Good morning, everyone.  We released second quarter 2017 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. A summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers can be found on Slides 3 and 4. 
Contributing to the higher earnings in the second quarter were new WPL retail electric and gas base rates, which went into effect on January 1, and IPL interim retail electric base rates, which went into effect on April 13. These increases in earnings were offset by the negative impacts of higher depreciation expense from rate base additions, including the Marshalltown gas facility at IPL as well as higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at WPL. 
Let me turn on Alliant's retail electric sales between the second quarters of 2017 and '16 were essentially flat. Excluding the impact of temperatures and the extra day in 2016 for leap year, retail electric sales during the first half of 2017 increased approximately 1% compared to last year. 
Now let's briefly review our full year 2017 earnings guidance. As Pat noted, we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and continued retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes. The projected 6% growth in earnings for 2017 will be primarily driven by infrastructure investments reflected in IPL's and WPL's recent base rate review. 
Starting with our Iowa jurisdiction. During the past 7 years, we have been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rates flat for our customers. The recent rate base addition, which include electric distribution investment, the Marshalltown Generating Station and investments to advanced cleaner energy, drove the need for a retail electric rate increase. Interim rates implemented in the second quarter include retail electric rate base of approximately $3.8 billion, a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. Given the interim rate started in the second quarter, the resulting earnings increase will only impact the last 3 quarters of 2017. 
Iowa retail customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017 since the approximate 7% interim rate increase will be offset with refunds related to lower transmission ROEs and billing credits from the tax benefit rider. The 2017 electric tax benefit rider credits are estimated to be $68 billion -- or $68 million. As in prior years, these tax benefit riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact the full year 2017 results. 
Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impact of a tax benefit rider. On this slide, we estimate a 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 17%, which is 4% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. 
Shifting to our Wisconsin jurisdiction. The WPL electric and gas base rate increases went into effect January 1. These reflect electric and gas rate base growth, including a full year of the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse that was placed in service in 2016 as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. As part of the new WPL rate design, the PSCW approved the elimination of seasonal pricing beginning in 2017. This will impact the calendarization of the rate increase in your forecasting models for this year. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast continues to anticipate strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions reflected after 2021 due to the additional wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. 
There have been no material changes to our 2017 financing plan. Our plan continues to assume we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We completed the issuance of $125 million of new common equity under an ATM program during the second quarter. We also entered into a $95 million term loan last week to finance the Great Western wind project acquisition. We may adjust the remaining financing plan for 2017 as being prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. 
As we look beyond 2017, we expect equity needs to be driven by renewable investments in the West Riverside project. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our plan is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decision. 
Finally, for our regulatory schedule. We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 6. For WPL, we anticipate a decision in the fourth quarter on the recently filed fuel-only case for 2018. Also, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate filing for a certificate of authority for additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. For IPL, we received the decision on our emissions plan and budget for the second quarter. And yesterday, we filed the advanced rate making principals for the second 500-megawatt wind investment for our Iowa customers. We are requesting rate-making principals consistent with the application for the first 500 megawatts approved by the IUB last year. The only notable difference is a lower-cost cap, reflecting a trend in declining capital cost for wind project. 
In closing, I would like to briefly discuss the IPL retail electric base rate review. Intervenor direct testimony was filed earlier this week. This completes the initial testimony by all interested parties as the IUB staff does not file testimony. Some of the key issues addressed in the interim testimony were: return on equity, rate design and the recovery of certain capital and deferred costs. Financial information filed confidentially by the intervenors will be made available within the next couple of business days have been made public. 
The Office of Consumer Advocate has proposed a $90 million increase in the revenue requirement versus the $176 million increase requested by IPL. Approximately half of the difference between the increases proposed by the OTA and the IPL relate to different return on equity amounts. To assist you in assessing the impact of the different viewpoints on the ROEs, please note that each 15 basis point change in ROE impacts the revenue requirement by approximately $4 million or a $0.01 per share earnings impact. 
We appreciate the point of view presented by each of the intervenors and acknowledge the divergent viewpoints are a normal part of rate reviews. We look forward to discussions with the intervenors in the coming weeks as we work through the rate review process. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Today, I am pleased to share with you our second quarter 2017 results, and I will update you on some recent progress we've made on delivering on our commitments",1922,"Thanks, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Today, I am pleased to share with you our second quarter 2017 results, and I will update you on some recent progress we've made on delivering on our commitments and advancing our strategy. Next, Robert will provide details on our second quarter 2017 results as well as review our regulatory schedule. 
Although we experienced a stormy and wet spring, the temperatures were, on average, normal in the second quarter 2017. In comparison, last spring was slightly warmer, which led to a negative quarter-over-quarter variance of $0.01 per share. With the normal temperatures, we achieved solid earnings this quarter of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. These results were in line with our expectations and reflect revenue increases at both utilities. Robert will provide more details regarding this quarter's results a bit later. 
Although year-to-date earnings were negatively impacted by the warm winter experienced during the first quarter, our year-to-date earnings are still within our earnings guidance range. So we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. Our earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% annually through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings per share of $1.88. This long-term earnings growth continues to be supported by the utility's robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and constructive regulatory outcomes. 
Let me spend a few minutes updating you on our wind investment activities. At the time the capital plan was issued in November, we were confident that we secured enough equipment from GE to assure that 100% PTCs could be realized on a total of 900 megawatts of additional wind, including the 500-megawatt that was already approved by the IUB in Iowa. Now that we have more transparency into the total project cost and site availability, we believe that we can install up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind that can qualify for 100% PTCs. 
But just yesterday, we filed a new advanced rate making principal application, or RPU, with the Iowa Utilities Board to request approval for another up to 500 megawatts of utility-owned wind. This cost-effective addition to our resource plan will help keep energy costs stable for customers over the long term. 
In the RPU, we requested the same return on equity of 11% that was approved in the last proceeding. We also requested a cost cap of $1,780 per kW, including AFUDC and transmission, which is slightly below the cap approved in the last proceeding. Details of the filings may be found on Slide 2. 
We still plan on filing with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission for additional 200 megawatts of wind for WPL later this year. We are in the early stages of that process, and I will discuss that in a few minutes. 
Please keep in mind that our current published capital expenditure plan includes the 500 megawatts already approved in Iowa and an additional 200 each for IPL and WPL, for total wind expansion of 900 megawatts during the 2017-2020 period. Since the time we issued our capital guidance, wind install costs are trending lower and are now coming in below our original forecast. Also, as we evaluate construction schedules and in-service dates, we expect to shift cost between years in the plan. As a result, we don't expect our 2017 or 2020 capital plan to increase by the full project amount for the additional 300 megawatts of wind. We will update our capital expenditure plan as part of our third quarter earnings release in November, but I want to be clear that this additional wind investment aligns with our earnings growth objective of 5% to 7%. 
We continue to make good progress on our wind expansion efforts, including the acquisition of additional high-performing sites for future utility wind development. I am pleased to announce that we recently executed a contract with Tradewind to acquire their 170-megawatt English farm site in Southeast Iowa that is expected to close by year-end. With this acquisition, our undeveloped utility wind sites totaled over 1,000 megawatts, including our previously announced purchase of the 300 megawatts of Upland Prairie site and the remaining land available at our existing Whispering Willow and Bent Tree sites that can accommodate up to an additional 600 megawatts of new wind. Construction will commence soon on the already approved 500 megawatts of Iowa wind. I am pleased to announce that the Infrastructure Energy Alternative LLC, commonly known as IEA, has been selected as the balance of plant contractor for that portion of our wind expansion. We are forecasting that approximately half of this project will go in service in 2019 and the other half in 2020. 
In our efforts to continue pursuing affordable energy options for our customers, we issued a request for proposals for up to 200 megawatts of wind for Wisconsin customers. There's a lot of interest in the RFP, and our team is currently reviewing the various proposals that we received. This is the first step in our process to analyze the different alternatives before seeking PSCW approval to add additional wind resources to our WPL energy portfolio. 
Wind energy will continue to be a significant resource, which not only enhances our ability to manage cost for customers, but also fulfills their increasing desire for renewable energy. Our utility wind portfolio of 568 megawatts will grow substantially with the plans to increase it by up to 1,200 megawatts. In addition, we supplemented our owned resources with approximately 600 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. We now forecast that with our utility-owned wind and purchase power agreements at almost 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity will be from renewables by 2024. We are very fortunate that we serve customers in a region where wind energy is economic and abundant, and I must thank our supportive rural communities and farm families, and they are great partners in fueling our future. 
In addition to our utility-owned wind, we recently announced a nonregulated wind investment in the Great Western wind project. After receiving FERC approval in July, I am pleased to report that last week, we closed on this acquisition of a 50% cash equity ownership interest in this Oklahoma wind project. We expect this investment to be modestly accretive to earnings in the first year and have financed the acquisition through a term loan. We are being very thoughtful and opportunistic in pursuing nonregulated growth opportunities, with low risk profiles such as the Great Western project, which already includes a long-term PPA. We expect that our nonregulated business will contribute no more than 10% of our consolidated earnings in the next 5 years. 
Moving on to our gas generation investments. We're making good progress with Wisconsin's West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will supply enough energy to our customers by early 2020. Its outflow will be approximately 703 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. The 3 elective cooperatives signed letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside, and we have already received FERC approval and expect PSCW approval of our agreement with the co-ops by the end of the quarter. These co-ops have been WPL's wholesale customers for decades. We are delighted that they will be our partners in West Riverside. 
Solar generation is our newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our collaboration on 2 solar projects with the City of Dubuque. The West Dubuque project is approximately 85% complete, and the Port of Dubuque project is approximately 55% complete. These projects are expected to start generating renewable energy for customers in September. 
Planning work continues for solar integration with our newest gas generating stations: West Riverside Energy Center in Southern Wisconsin and Marshalltown Generating Station in Central Iowa. These projects are in addition to the 3 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River campus, our learning laboratory at our Madison headquarters, and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investment such as these, as well as the Beyond Solar tariff recently filed in Iowa, will help us meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. 
The electric and gas distribution systems continue to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. Standardizing voltages and selective reliability improvements, such as expansion of our underground electric distribution network, are just some of our targeted investments. 
On the gas side, we continue to make investments in our pipeline safety program. Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, just giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas systems. This year, we will begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important foundational component for a smarter and more resilient power grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages, 2-way energy flow and offer remotely connects and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter installation in 2019. 
We continue to execute on our strategy by providing cleaner energy for our customers by building a smarter, more robust grid. We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago, with the addition of utility-owned wind and combined-cycle gas to replace the older, smaller and less efficient fossil generation we are retiring. By the end of this year, we will have retired or converted almost 40% of our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity. Additionally, we will now retire almost 75% of our oil and diesel fired generation capacity by the end of this year. 
We are on a solid path toward our carbon emission target of 40% by 2030. We've also established a new target to reduce water withdrawals by 75% by 2030 from 2005 levels. I encourage you to review the progress we have made towards achieving our carbon reduction target as well as our other sustainability targets by reading the 2017 Corporate Sustainability Report, which will be issued in the middle of this month. 
Before I wrap up, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees for their strong recovery efforts. Iowa and Wisconsin have experienced significant strong activity during the last couple of months. I'm extremely proud of the quick response times and restoration efforts exhibited by our employees, all by keeping safety top of mind. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017. Our dedicated employees delivered solid second quarter 2017 results and will deliver our full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout ratio is 63.3% based on the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99. We expect to complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner. We will continue working with the regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. Continued focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities are reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest on Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

We released second quarter 2017 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. A summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers can be found on Slides 3 and 4. 
Contributing to the higher earnings in the second quarter were new WPL retail electric and gas base rates, which went into effect on January 1, and IPL interim retail electric base rates, which went into effect on April 13. These increases in earnings were offset by the negative impacts of higher depreciation expense from rate base additions, including the Marshalltown gas facility at IPL as well as higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at WPL. 
Temperature normalized retail electric sales between the second quarters of 2017 and '16 were essentially flat. Excluding the impact of temperatures and the extra day in 2016 for leap year, retail electric sales during the first half of 2017 increased approximately 1% compared to last year. 
Now let's briefly review our full year 2017 earnings guidance. As Pat noted, we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and continued retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes. The projected 6% growth in earnings for 2017 will be primarily driven by infrastructure investments reflected in IPL's and WPL's recent base rate review. 
Starting with our Iowa jurisdiction. During the past 7 years, we have been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rates flat for our customers. The recent rate base addition, which include electric distribution investment, the Marshalltown Generating Station and investments to advanced cleaner energy, drove the need for a retail electric rate increase. Interim rates implemented in the second quarter include retail electric rate base of approximately $3.8 billion, a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. Given the interim rate started in the second quarter, the resulting earnings increase will only impact the last 3 quarters of 2017. 
Iowa retail customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017 since the approximate 7% interim rate increase will be offset with refunds related to lower transmission ROEs and billing credits from the Tax Benefit Rider. The 2017 electric Tax Benefit Rider credits are estimated to be $68 billion -- or $68 million. As in prior years, these Tax Benefit Riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact the full year 2017 results. 
Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impact of a Tax Benefit Rider. On this slide, we estimate a 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 17%, which is 4% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. 
Shifting to our Wisconsin jurisdiction. The WPL electric and gas base rate increases went into effect January 1. These reflect electric and gas rate base growth, including a full year of the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse that was placed in service in 2016 as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. As part of the new WPL rate design, the PSCW approved the elimination of seasonal pricing beginning in 2017. This will impact the calendarization of the rate increase in your forecasting models for this year. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast continues to anticipate strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the additional wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. 
There have been no material changes to our 2017 financing plan. Our plan continues to assume we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We completed the issuance of $125 million of new common equity under an ATM program during the second quarter. We also entered into a $95 million term loan last week to finance the Great Western wind project acquisition. We may adjust the remaining financing plan for 2017 as deemed prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. 
As we look beyond 2017, we expect equity needs to be driven by renewable investments in the West Riverside project. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our plan is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decision. 
Finally, for our regulatory schedule. We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 6. For WPL, we anticipate a decision in the fourth quarter on the recently filed fuel-only case for 2018. Also, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate filing for a certificate of authority for additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. For IPL, we received a decision on our emissions plan and budget in the second quarter. And yesterday, we filed the advanced rate making principals for the second 500-megawatt wind investment for our Iowa customers. We are requesting rate-making principals consistent with the application for the first 500 megawatts approved by the IUB last year. The only notable difference is a lower-cost cap, reflecting a trend in declining capital cost for wind projects. 
In closing, I would like to briefly discuss the IPL retail electric base rate review. Intervenor direct testimony was filed earlier this week. This completes the initial testimony by all interested parties as the IUB staff does not file testimony. Some of the key issues addressed in the intervenor testimony were: return on equity, rate design and the recovery of certain capital and deferred costs. Financial information filed confidentially by the intervenors will be made available within the next couple of business days have been made public. 
The Office of Consumer Advocate has proposed a $90 million increase in the revenue requirement versus the $176 million increase requested by IPL. Approximately half of the difference between the increases proposed by the OTA and the IPL relate to different return on equity amounts. To assist you in assessing the impact of the different viewpoints on the ROEs, please note that each 15 basis point change in ROE impacts the revenue requirement by approximately $4 million or a $0.01 per share earnings impact. 
We appreciate the point of view presented by each of the intervenors and acknowledge the divergent viewpoints are a normal part of rate reviews. We look forward to discussions with the intervenors in the coming weeks as we work through the rate review process. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Today, I am pleased to share with you our second quarter 2017 results, and I will update you on some recent progress we've made on delivering on our commitments",1922,"Thanks, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Today, I am pleased to share with you our second quarter 2017 results, and I will update you on some recent progress we've made on delivering on our commitments and advancing our strategy. Next, Robert will provide details on our second quarter 2017 results as well as review our regulatory schedule. 
Although we experienced a stormy and wet spring, the temperatures were, on average, normal in the second quarter 2017. In comparison, last spring was slightly warmer, which led to a negative quarter-over-quarter variance of $0.01 per share. With the normal temperatures, we achieved solid earnings this quarter of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. These results were in line with our expectations and reflect revenue increases at both utilities. Robert will provide more details regarding this quarter's results a bit later. 
Although year-to-date earnings were negatively impacted by the warm winter experienced during the first quarter, our year-to-date earnings are still within our earnings guidance range. So we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. Our earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% annually through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings per share of $1.88. This long-term earnings growth continues to be supported by the utility's robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and constructive regulatory outcomes. 
Let me spend a few minutes updating you on our wind investment activities. At the time the capital plan was issued in November, we were confident that we secured enough equipment from GE to assure that 100% PTCs could be realized on a total of 900 megawatts of additional wind, including the 500-megawatt that was already approved by the IUB in Iowa. Now that we have more transparency into the total project cost and site availability, we believe that we can install up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind that can qualify for 100% PTCs. 
But just yesterday, we filed a new advanced rate making principal application, or RPU, with the Iowa Utilities Board to request approval for another up to 500 megawatts of utility-owned wind. This cost-effective addition to our resource plan will help keep energy costs stable for customers over the long term. 
In the RPU, we requested the same return on equity of 11% that was approved in the last proceeding. We also requested a cost cap of $1,780 per kW, including AFUDC and transmission, which is slightly below the cap approved in the last proceeding. Details of the filings may be found on Slide 2. 
We still plan on filing with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission for additional 200 megawatts of wind for WPL later this year. We are in the early stages of that process, and I will discuss that in a few minutes. 
Please keep in mind that our current published capital expenditure plan includes the 500 megawatts already approved in Iowa and an additional 200 each for IPL and WPL, for total wind expansion of 900 megawatts during the 2017-2020 period. Since the time we issued our capital guidance, wind install costs are trending lower and are now coming in below our original forecast. Also, as we evaluate construction schedules and in-service dates, we expect to shift cost between years in the plan. As a result, we don't expect our 2017 or 2020 capital plan to increase by the full project amount for the additional 300 megawatts of wind. We will update our capital expenditure plan as part of our third quarter earnings release in November, but I want to be clear that this additional wind investment aligns with our earnings growth objective of 5% to 7%. 
We continue to make good progress on our wind expansion efforts, including the acquisition of additional high-performing sites for future utility wind development. I am pleased to announce that we recently executed a contract with Tradewind to acquire their 170-megawatt English farm site in Southeast Iowa that is expected to close by year-end. With this acquisition, our undeveloped utility wind sites totaled over 1,000 megawatts, including our previously announced purchase of the 300 megawatts of Upland Prairie site and the remaining land available at our existing Whispering Willow and Bent Tree sites that can accommodate up to an additional 600 megawatts of new wind. Construction will commence soon on the already approved 500 megawatts of Iowa wind. I am pleased to announce that the Infrastructure Energy Alternative LLC, commonly known as IEA, has been selected as the balance of plant contractor for that portion of our wind expansion. We are forecasting that approximately half of this project will go in service in 2019 and the other half in 2020. 
In our efforts to continue pursuing affordable energy options for our customers, we issued a request for proposals for up to 200 megawatts of wind for Wisconsin customers. There's a lot of interest in the RFP, and our team is currently reviewing the various proposals that we received. This is the first step in our process to analyze the different alternatives before seeking PSCW approval to add additional wind resources to our WPL energy portfolio. 
Wind energy will continue to be a significant resource, which not only enhances our ability to manage cost for customers, but also fulfills their increasing desire for renewable energy. Our utility wind portfolio of 568 megawatts will grow substantially with the plans to increase it by up to 1,200 megawatts. In addition, we supplemented our owned resources with approximately 600 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. We now forecast that with our utility-owned wind and purchase power agreements at almost 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity will be from renewables by 2024. We are very fortunate that we serve customers in a region where wind energy is economic and abundant, and I must thank our supportive rural communities and farm families, and they are great partners in fueling our future. 
In addition to our utility-owned wind, we recently announced a nonregulated wind investment in the Great Western wind project. After receiving FERC approval in July, I am pleased to report that last week, we closed on this acquisition of a 50% cash equity ownership interest in this Oklahoma wind project. We expect this investment to be modestly accretive to earnings in the first year and have financed the acquisition through a term loan. We are being very thoughtful and opportunistic in pursuing nonregulated growth opportunities, with low risk profiles such as the Great Western project, which already includes a long-term PPA. We expect that our nonregulated business will contribute no more than 10% of our consolidated earnings in the next 5 years. 
Moving on to our gas generation investments. We're making good progress with Wisconsin's West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will supply enough energy to our customers by early 2020. Its outflow will be approximately 703 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. The 3 elective cooperatives signed letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside, and we have already received FERC approval and expect PSCW approval of our agreement with the co-ops by the end of the quarter. These co-ops have been WPL's wholesale customers for decades. We are delighted that they will be our partners in West Riverside. 
Solar generation is our newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our collaboration on 2 solar projects with the City of Dubuque. The West Dubuque project is approximately 85% complete, and the Port of Dubuque project is approximately 55% complete. These projects are expected to start generating renewable energy for customers in September. 
Planning work continues for solar integration with our newest gas generating stations: West Riverside Energy Center in Southern Wisconsin and Marshalltown Generating Station in Central Iowa. These projects are in addition to the 3 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River campus, our learning laboratory at our Madison headquarters, and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investment such as these as well as the Beyond Solar tariff recently filed in Iowa, will help us meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. 
The electric and gas distribution systems continue to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. Standardizing voltages and selective reliability improvements, such as expansion of our underground electric distribution network, are just some of our targeted investments. 
On the gas side, we continue to make investments in our pipeline safety program. Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, just giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas systems. This year, we will begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important foundational component for a smarter and more resilient power grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages, 2-way energy flow and offer remotely connects and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter installation in 2019. 
We continue to execute on our strategy by providing cleaner energy for our customers by building a smarter, more robust grid. We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago, with the addition of utility-owned wind and combined-cycle gas to replace the older, smaller and less efficient fossil generation we are retiring. By the end of this year, we will have retired or converted almost 40% of our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity. Additionally, we will now retire almost 75% of our oil and diesel fired generation capacity by the end of this year. 
We are on a solid path toward our carbon emission target of 40% by 2030. We've also established a new target to reduce water withdrawals by 75% by 2030 from 2005 levels. I encourage you to review the progress we have made towards achieving our carbon reduction target as well as our other sustainability targets by reading the 2017 Corporate Sustainability Report, which will be issued in the middle of this month. 
Before I wrap up, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees for their strong recovery efforts. Iowa and Wisconsin have experienced significant strong activity during the last couple of months. I'm extremely proud of the quick response times and restoration efforts exhibited by our employees, all by keeping safety top of mind. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017. Our dedicated employees delivered solid second quarter 2017 results and will deliver our full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout ratio is 63.3% based on the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99. We expect to complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner. We will continue working with the regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. Continued focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities are reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest on Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

We released second quarter 2017 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. A summary of the year-over-year earnings driver",1261,"Good morning, everyone. We released second quarter 2017 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. A summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers can be found on Slides 3 and 4. 
Contributing to the higher earnings in the second quarter were new WPL retail electric and gas base rates, which went into effect on January 1, and IPL interim retail electric base rates, which went into effect on April 13. These increases in earnings were offset by the negative impacts of higher depreciation expense from rate base additions, including the Marshalltown gas facility at IPL as well as higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at WPL. 
Temperature normalized retail electric sales between the second quarters of 2017 and '16 were essentially flat. Excluding the impact of temperatures and the extra day in 2016 for leap year, retail electric sales during the first half of 2017 increased approximately 1% compared to last year. 
Now let's briefly review our full year 2017 earnings guidance. As Pat noted, we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and continued retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes. The projected 6% growth in earnings for 2017 will be primarily driven by infrastructure investments reflected in IPL's and WPL's recent base rate review. 
Starting with our Iowa jurisdiction. During the past 7 years, we have been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rates flat for our customers. The recent rate base addition, which include electric distribution investment, the Marshalltown Generating Station and investments to advanced cleaner energy, drove the need for a retail electric rate increase. Interim rates implemented in the second quarter include retail electric rate base of approximately $3.8 billion, a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. Given the interim rate started in the second quarter, the resulting earnings increase will only impact the last 3 quarters of 2017. 
Iowa retail customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017 since the approximate 7% interim rate increase will be offset with refunds related to lower transmission ROEs and billing credits from the Tax Benefit Rider. The 2017 electric Tax Benefit Rider credits are estimated to be $68 billion -- or $68 million. As in prior years, these Tax Benefit Riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact the full year 2017 results. 
Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impact of a Tax Benefit Rider. On this slide, we estimate a 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 17%, which is 4% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. 
Shifting to our Wisconsin jurisdiction. The WPL electric and gas base rate increases went into effect January 1. These reflect electric and gas rate base growth, including a full year of the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse that was placed in service in 2016 as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. As part of the new WPL rate design, the PSCW approved the elimination of seasonal pricing beginning in 2017. This will impact the calendarization of the rate increase in your forecasting models for this year. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast continues to anticipate strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the additional wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. 
There have been no material changes to our 2017 financing plan. Our plan continues to assume we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We completed the issuance of $125 million of new common equity under an ATM program during the second quarter. We also entered into a $95 million term loan last week to finance the Great Western wind project acquisition. We may adjust the remaining financing plan for 2017 as deemed prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. 
As we look beyond 2017, we expect equity needs to be driven by renewable investments in the West Riverside project. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our plan is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decision. 
Finally, for our regulatory schedule. We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 6. For WPL, we anticipate a decision in the fourth quarter on the recently filed fuel-only case for 2018. Also, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate filing for a certificate of authority for additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. For IPL, we received a decision on our emissions plan and budget in the second quarter. And yesterday, we filed the advanced rate making principals for the second 500-megawatt wind investment for our Iowa customers. We are requesting rate-making principals consistent with the application for the first 500 megawatts approved by the IUB last year. The only notable difference is a lower-cost cap, reflecting a trend in declining capital cost for wind projects. 
In closing, I would like to briefly discuss the IPL retail electric base rate review. Intervenor direct testimony was filed earlier this week. This completes the initial testimony by all interested parties as the IUB staff does not file testimony. Some of the key issues addressed in the intervenor testimony were: return on equity, rate design and the recovery of certain capital and deferred costs. Financial information filed confidentially by the intervenors will be made available within the next couple of business days have been made public. 
The Office of Consumer Advocate has proposed a $90 million increase in the revenue requirement versus the $176 million increase requested by IPL. Approximately half of the difference between the increases proposed by the OTA and the IPL relate to different return on equity amounts. To assist you in assessing the impact of the different viewpoints on the ROEs, please note that each 15 basis point change in ROE impacts the revenue requirement by approximately $4 million or a $0.01 per share earnings impact. 
We appreciate the point of view presented by each of the intervenors and acknowledge the divergent viewpoints are a normal part of rate reviews. We look forward to discussions with the intervenors in the coming weeks as we work through the rate review process. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Today, I am pleased to share with you our second quarter 2017 results, and I will update you on some recent progress we've made on delivering on our commitments",1922,"Thanks, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Today, I am pleased to share with you our second quarter 2017 results, and I will update you on some recent progress we've made on delivering on our commitments and advancing our strategy. Next, Robert will provide details on our second quarter 2017 results as well as review our regulatory schedule. 
Although we experienced a stormy and wet spring, the temperatures were, on average, normal in the second quarter 2017. In comparison, last spring was slightly warmer, which led to a negative quarter-over-quarter variance of $0.01 per share. With the normal temperatures, we achieved solid earnings this quarter of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. These results were in line with our expectations and reflect revenue increases at both utilities. Robert will provide more details regarding this quarter's results a bit later. 
Although year-to-date earnings were negatively impacted by the warm winter experienced during the first quarter, our year-to-date earnings are still within our earnings guidance range. So we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. Our earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7% annually through 2020 based on non-GAAP 2016 earnings per share of $1.88. This long-term earnings growth continues to be supported by the utility's robust capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and constructive regulatory outcomes. 
Let me spend a few minutes updating you on our wind investment activities. At the time the capital plan was issued in November, we were confident that we secured enough equipment from GE to assure that 100% PTCs could be realized on a total of 900 megawatts of additional wind, including the 500-megawatt that was already approved by the IUB in Iowa. Now that we have more transparency into the total project cost and site availability, we believe that we can install up to 1,200 megawatts of new wind that can qualify for 100% PTCs. 
But just yesterday, we filed a new advanced rate making principal application, or RPU, with the Iowa Utilities Board to request approval for another up to 500 megawatts of utility-owned wind. This cost-effective addition to our resource plan will help keep energy costs stable for customers over the long term. 
In the RPU, we requested the same return on equity of 11% that was approved in the last proceeding. We also requested a cost cap of $1,780 per kW, including AFUDC and transmission, which is slightly below the cap approved in the last proceeding. Details of the filings may be found on Slide 2. 
We still plan on filing with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission for additional 200 megawatts of wind for WPL later this year. We are in the early stages of that process, and I will discuss that in a few minutes. 
Please keep in mind that our current published capital expenditure plan includes the 500 megawatts already approved in Iowa and an additional 200 each for IPL and WPL, for total wind expansion of 900 megawatts during the 2017-2020 period. Since the time we issued our capital guidance, wind install costs are trending lower and are now coming in below our original forecast. Also, as we evaluate construction schedules and in-service dates, we expect to shift cost between years in the plan. As a result, we don't expect our 2017 or 2020 capital plan to increase by the full project amount for the additional 300 megawatts of wind. We will update our capital expenditure plan as part of our third quarter earnings release in November, but I want to be clear that this additional wind investment aligns with our earnings growth objective of 5% to 7%. 
We continue to make good progress on our wind expansion efforts, including the acquisition of additional high-performing sites for future utility wind development. I am pleased to announce that we recently executed a contract with Tradewind to acquire their 170-megawatt English farm site in Southeast Iowa that is expected to close by year-end. With this acquisition, our undeveloped utility wind sites totaled over 1,000 megawatts, including our previously announced purchase of the 300 megawatts of Upland Prairie site and the remaining land available at our existing Whispering Willow and Bent Tree sites that can accommodate up to an additional 600 megawatts of new wind. Construction will commence soon on the already approved 500 megawatts of Iowa wind. I am pleased to announce that the Infrastructure Energy Alternative LLC, commonly known as IEA, has been selected as the balance of plant contractor for that portion of our wind expansion. We are forecasting that approximately half of this project will go in service in 2019 and the other half in 2020. 
In our efforts to continue pursuing affordable energy options for our customers, we issued a request for proposals for up to 200 megawatts of wind for Wisconsin customers. There's a lot of interest in the RFP, and our team is currently reviewing the various proposals that we received. This is the first step in our process to analyze the different alternatives before seeking PSCW approval to add additional wind resources to our WPL energy portfolio. 
Wind energy will continue to be a significant resource, which not only enhances our ability to manage cost for customers, but also fulfills their increasing desire for renewable energy. Our utility wind portfolio of 568 megawatts will grow substantially with the plans to increase it by up to 1,200 megawatts. In addition, we supplemented our owned resources with approximately 600 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. We now forecast that with our utility-owned wind and purchase power agreements at almost 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity will be from renewables by 2024. We are very fortunate that we serve customers in a region where wind energy is economic and abundant, and I must thank our supportive rural communities and farm families, and they are great partners in fueling our future. 
In addition to our utility-owned wind, we recently announced a nonregulated wind investment in the Great Western wind project. After receiving FERC approval in July, I am pleased to report that last week, we closed on this acquisition of a 50% cash equity ownership interest in this Oklahoma wind project. We expect this investment to be modestly accretive to earnings in the first year and have financed the acquisition through a term loan. We are being very thoughtful and opportunistic in pursuing nonregulated growth opportunities, with low risk profiles such as the Great Western project, which already includes a long-term PPA. We expect that our nonregulated business will contribute no more than 10% of our consolidated earnings in the next 5 years. 
Moving on to our gas generation investments. We're making good progress with Wisconsin's West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will supply enough energy to our customers by early 2020. Its outflow will be approximately 703 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, excluding AFUDC and transmission. The 3 elective cooperatives signed letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside, and we have already received FERC approval and expect PSCW approval of our agreement with the co-ops by the end of the quarter. These co-ops have been WPL's wholesale customers for decades. We are delighted that they will be our partners in West Riverside. 
Solar generation is our newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our collaboration on 2 solar projects with the City of Dubuque. The West Dubuque project is approximately 85% complete, and the Port of Dubuque project is approximately 55% complete. These projects are expected to start generating renewable energy for customers in September. 
Planning work continues for solar integration with our newest gas generating stations: West Riverside Energy Center in Southern Wisconsin and Marshalltown Generating Station in Central Iowa. These projects are in addition to the 3 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River campus, our learning laboratory at our Madison headquarters, and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investment such as these as well as the Beyond Solar tariff recently filed in Iowa, will help us meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. 
The electric and gas distribution systems continue to be an area of growing investment as customers expect improved reliability, resiliency and security of their power delivery. Standardizing voltages and selective reliability improvements, such as expansion of our underground electric distribution network, are just some of our targeted investments. 
On the gas side, we continue to make investments in our pipeline safety program. Also, many communities and industrial customers have requested additional natural gas supply, just giving us the opportunity to upgrade and expand our gas systems. This year, we will begin installation of smart meters for Iowa electric and gas customers. This is an important foundational component for a smarter and more resilient power grid. Access to real-time information and data will allow us to manage outages, 2-way energy flow and offer remotely connects and disconnects. We expect to complete the Iowa smart meter installation in 2019. 
We continue to execute on our strategy by providing cleaner energy for our customers by building a smarter, more robust grid. We began the transition of our generation fleet almost a decade ago, with the addition of utility-owned wind and combined-cycle gas to replace the older, smaller and less efficient fossil generation we are retiring. By the end of this year, we will have retired or converted almost 40% of our 2010 coal-fired generation capacity. Additionally, we will now retire almost 75% of our oil and diesel fired generation capacity by the end of this year. 
We are on a solid path toward our carbon emission target of 40% by 2030. We've also established a new target to reduce water withdrawals by 75% by 2030 from 2005 levels. I encourage you to review the progress we have made towards achieving our carbon reduction target as well as our other sustainability targets by reading the 2017 Corporate Sustainability Report, which will be issued in the middle of this month. 
Before I wrap up, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees for their strong recovery efforts. Iowa and Wisconsin have experienced significant strong activity during the last couple of months. I'm extremely proud of the quick response times and restoration efforts exhibited by our employees, all by keeping safety top of mind. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017. Our dedicated employees delivered solid second quarter 2017 results and will deliver our full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide for 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. Our targeted 2017 dividend payout ratio is 63.3% based on the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $1.99. We expect to complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget in a very safe manner. We will continue working with the regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner. Continued focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities are reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster. And we will continue to manage the company to strike a balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. 
Thank you for your interest on Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

We released second quarter 2017 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. A summary of the year-over-year earnings driver",1267,"Good morning, everyone. We released second quarter 2017 earnings last evening with our earnings from continuing operations of $0.41 per share, which is $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2016. A summary of the year-over-year earnings drivers can be found on Slides 3 and 4. 
Contributing to the higher earnings in the second quarter were new WPL retail electric and gas base rates, which went into effect on January 1, and IPL interim retail electric base rates, which went into effect on April 13. These increases in earnings were offset by the negative impacts of higher depreciation expense from rate base additions, including the Marshalltown gas facility at IPL as well as higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at WPL. 
Temperature normalized retail electric sales between the second quarters of 2017 and '16 were essentially flat. Excluding the impact of temperatures and the extra day in 2016 for leap year, retail electric sales during the first half of 2017 increased approximately 1% compared to last year. 
Now let's briefly review our full year 2017 earnings guidance. As Pat noted, we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $1.92 to $2.06 per share. The 2017 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and continued retail sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to 2016. Please note that when comparing 2016 to 2017, we expect most of the sales growth to come from commercial and industrial classes. The projected 6% growth in earnings for 2017 will be primarily driven by infrastructure investments reflected in IPL's and WPL's recent base rate review. 
Starting with our Iowa jurisdiction. During the past 7 years, we have been able to earn on our increasing IPL rate base while keeping base rates flat for our customers. The recent rate base addition, which include electric distribution investment, the Marshalltown Generating Station and investments to advanced cleaner energy, drove the need for a retail electric rate increase. Interim rates implemented in the second quarter include retail electric rate base of approximately $3.8 billion, a blended ROE of approximately 10% and a common equity ratio of approximately 49%. Given the interim rate started in the second quarter, the resulting earnings increase will only impact the last 3 quarters of 2017. 
Iowa retail customers will see a minimal impact to their total bills in 2017 since the approximate 7% interim rate increase will be offset with refunds related to lower transmission ROEs and billing credits from the Tax Benefit Rider. The 2017 electric Tax Benefit Rider credits are estimated to be $68 billion -- or $68 million. As in prior years, these Tax Benefit Riders have a quarterly timing impact but are not anticipated to impact the full year 2017 results. 
Slide 5 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impact of a Tax Benefit Rider. On this slide, we estimate a 2017 consolidated effective tax rate of 17%, which is 4% higher than our 2016 consolidated effective tax rate. 
Shifting to our Wisconsin jurisdiction. The WPL electric and gas base rate increases went into effect January 1. These reflect electric and gas rate base growth, including a full year of the Edgewater 5 scrubber and baghouse that was placed in service in 2016 as well as performance improvements at Columbia. The increase in revenue requirements for these and other rate base additions was partially offset by energy efficiency cost recovery and transmission amortization. As part of the new WPL rate design, the PSCW approved the elimination of seasonal pricing beginning in 2017. This will impact the calendarization of the rate increase in your forecasting models for this year. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast continues to anticipate strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and extension of bonus depreciation deductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the additional wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. 
There have been no material changes to our 2017 financing plan. Our plan continues to assume we will issue up to $150 million of new common equity this year as well as long-term debt of up to $250 million at IPL and up to $300 million at WPL. We completed the issuance of $125 million of new common equity under an ATM program during the second quarter. We also entered into a $95 million term loan last week to finance the Great Western wind project acquisition. We may adjust the remaining financing plan for 2017 as deemed prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. 
As we look beyond 2017, we expect equity needs to be driven by renewable investments in the West Riverside project. Our forecast assumes that the capital expenditures beyond 2017 would be financed by operating cash flows and external financing. Our plan is to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL for the most recent retail rate case decision. 
Finally, for our regulatory schedule. We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 6. For WPL, we anticipate a decision in the fourth quarter on the recently filed fuel-only case for 2018. Also, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate filing for a certificate of authority for additional wind for our Wisconsin customers. For IPL, we received a decision on our emissions plan and budget in the second quarter. And yesterday, we filed the advanced rate making principals for the second 500-megawatt wind investment for our Iowa customers. We are requesting rate-making principals consistent with the application for the first 500 megawatts approved by the IUB last year. The only notable difference is a lower-cost cap, reflecting a trend in declining capital cost for wind projects. 
In closing, I would like to briefly discuss the IPL retail electric base rate review. Intervenor direct testimony was filed earlier this week. This completes the initial testimony by all interested parties as the IUB staff does not file testimony. Some of the key issues addressed in the intervenor testimony were: return on equity, rate design and the recovery of certain capital and deferred costs. Financial information filed confidentially by the intervenors will be made available within the next couple of business days now that our second quarter results have been made public. 
The Office of Consumer Advocate has proposed a $90 million increase in the revenue requirement versus the $176 million increase requested by IPL. Approximately half of the difference between the increases proposed by the OTA and the IPL relate to different return on equity amounts. To assist you in assessing the impact of the different viewpoints on the ROEs, please note that each 15 basis point change in ROE impacts the revenue requirement by approximately $4 million or a $0.01 per share earnings impact. 
We appreciate the point of view presented by each of the intervenors and acknowledge the divergent viewpoints are a normal part of rate reviews. We look forward to discussions with the intervenors in the coming weeks as we work through the rate review process. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

So the combination of the two, we think the overall capital plan of the -- that we already issued last November, those dollars will be coming down in total, and the timing might be shifting between the years, again, depending on the construction cycles. So we come out with the new guidance in November. Don't expect it to be a full cost for additional 300 megawatts of wind. All the megawatts are going to be coming down in price. So it'll be slightly different, but don't expect it to increase by the full 300 megawatts of -- if you do the math that way."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, we issued a press release, which included third quarter and year-to-date financial results, updated our 2017 earnings guidance range and announced our 2018 earnings guidance and common stock dividend target. It also provided our annual capital expenditure plan through 2021 and our current estimated totaled CapEx for 2022 through 2026. Before the quarter, I'm pleased to report that excessively mild temperatures are results according to plan. Like many others in the region, we experienced a very cool summer, which followed a very warm winter. This negatively impacted our year-to-date earnings by $0.06 per share. As in the past, this is the quarter that we update this year's earnings guidance to include the temperature impacts for the first 9 months. For the new guidance is now has a midpoint of $1.93 per share, which is $0.06 per share lower for the midpoint of earnings guidance provided for 2017 last November. Robert will provide details for the quarter later in the call. Let me now focus on 2018, which you will be pleased with. We announced a 6% increase in our targeted 2018 common dividend to $1.34 per share. We also announced a 6% increase of earnings guidance, with the midpoint of $2.11 per share. As shown on Slide 2, the 6% increase is based on temperature-normalized earnings for 2017 of $1.99 per share and not the revised 2017 guidance that includes this year's negative temperature impact. I also want to reaffirm that our long term earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7%, and our dividend payout ratio remains at 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings. We also issued our 2017 to 2021 capital expenditure plan totaling $6.9 billion as shown on Slide 3. In addition, we provided a walk from the previous plan to our current plan on Slide 4. As you can see, the CapEx increase is driven mostly by the additional 300 megawatts of wind that we've been discussing with you. This increase was partially offset by lower maintenance expenditures in generation. Our updated capital expenditure plan includes 1,200 megawatts of wind energy. Under current tax law, we expect all of the wind projects to qualify for the 100% federal production tax credits. Also, our CapEx plan included additional lead beyond 2020, which we anticipate would be a combination of grid enhancements, solar and natural gas generation. And as energy technology evolve, we continue to evaluate our investment plans to best serve the needs of our customers. Approximately 1/2 of our $11.9 billion 10-year capital plan is for enhancing our electric and gas distribution systems, including smart meter deployment in Iowa. Our customers and communities expect us to not only maintain a safe and highly reliable system, but now expect us to adapt to a system that is more interactive and dynamic. We continue to make exciting progress on the development of our wind expansion. Our existing utility wind portfolio includes owned wind farms of 568 megawatts, plus approximately 600 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. Our plants to raise these 1,200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for our customers. We forecast that almost 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity will be from renewable sources by 2024. Let me now share with you some of the key activities underway to expand our energy resources. In August, we filed a new advanced rate-making principal application, or RPU, with Iowa Utilities Board to request approval for up to 500 megawatts of utility-owned wind. In the RPU, we requested the same return equity of 11% that was approved in the last proceeding. We also requested a cap of $1,780 per kilowatt including AFUDC and transmission, which is lower than the cost cap approved in the last proceeding. We expect approval in the first quarter of 2018. In construction, we'll soon begin to our wind farm. We are also making good progress on acquiring additional wind farms, which is all part of our 1,000 megawatts wind expansion in Iowa. Our forecast assumes that 300 megawatts will be in service in 2019 and the remaining 700 megawatts of wind will be placed in service in 2020. Recently, we signed an agreement with energy to purchase a stake in the forward wind energy center along with WPS and MGNE. We will file a joint application with PSCW for the purchase of this Wisconsin wind farm before year-end. This approved, customers are expect to realize a savings from the transfer of this wind farm for existing power agreement to utility-owned. We anticipate closing the spring of 2018 subject to regulatory approvals. WPL's share of the facility will be 55 megawatts, with the purchase price of approximately $74 million. This purchase is included in the capital expenditure plan we released last evening, which cost for a total 200 megawatts of additional wind investment for WP&L. We are also completing our evaluations from the request for proposal for additional wind energy options to benefit our Wisconsin customers. We anticipate filing request for additional wind investments with the Public services commission before the year-end. We are very fortunate that we serve customers in the region where wind energy is economic and abundant and our support of rural communities and farm families that are great partners in fueling our future. We cannot do this without them. Moving on to our gas generation investments. We are in the early stages of making good progress with this Wisconsin West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will be in service by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 730 megawatts and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million including being AFUDC and transmission. That 3 electric cooperatives that signed letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside have received PSCW approval. We expect FERC approval of the whole supply within the coming months. These coops have been WPL's wholesale customers for decades, and we are delighted that they'll be our partners in West Riverside. Solar generation is the newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our collaboration on 2 solar projects with the City of Dubuque, which is are now producing energy for our customers. These projects are in addition to our 300 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River campus, our running laboratory at headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investments can such as these will help meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. We're also planning to install solar at West Riverside Energy Center in Southern Wisconsin and [indiscernible] generating station in Central Iowa. Before I wrap up, I would like to briefly address the tax reform that we released in Congress yesterday. It's too early for us to know the potential impact of tax reform in our company and customers. Especially given changes are expected in the coming weeks. We will remain involved in the process and will continue to advocate for our customers for the economic in the communities we are privileged to serve. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees for the storm recovery assistance not only at home, but also in Florida. I'm extremely proud of their quick response and great customer care during challenging restoration efforts, while keeping safety top of mind. With the stages a week away, I'd like to take a moment to pay tribute to the approximately 400 proud veterans that work with Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today. I also want to extend my thanks to appreciation to the military families for everything they do while their loved ones away from home. Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017 and 2018. Our dedicated employees delivered solid third quarter results and will deliver on full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide the 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We expect to complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget and in a very safe manner. We will continue working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, utilities and customers in a collaborative manner.

We released third quarter 2017 earnings last night with our GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share. The difference is a $0.02 per share nonrecurring charge of from write-downs of regulatory as",1230,"Good morning, everyone. We released third quarter 2017 earnings last night with our GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share. The difference is a $0.02 per share nonrecurring charge of from write-downs of regulatory assets due to the recent proposed settlement reached with the major intervening parties and IPOs retail electric rate review. Our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share were $0.05 lower than non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to impacts on the electric sales of cooler summer temperatures in our service territory compared to last year. IPL interim retail electric base rates and new WPL retail electric and gas base rates continue to contribute to higher earnings in the third quarter of 2017. However, as expected, these increased earnings were offset by the impacts of higher depreciation expense from rate base additions, including the Marshalltown facility, AFUDC earned on Marshalltown in 2016 and higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at WPL. The summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers can be found on Slide 5, 6 and 7. Turning to our updated 2017 earnings guidance. Our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings generated through the first 3 quarters of this year have been consistent with our original earnings guidance, allowing us to narrow the range. The updated 2017 earnings guidance range is $1.89 to $1.97 per share. The change to the midpoint of our updated earnings guidance is due to the $0.06 of losses from the impact on electric and gas sales of the much milder temperatures in our service territory during the first 3 quarters of 2017. Excluding the impact for these much milder temperatures, we continue to see modest sales growth in our service territories, driven by increased sales through our commercial and industrial segments. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, temperature-normalized sales, excluding the impact of leap year, increased approximately 1/2 of 1%. Now let's review our 2018 earnings guidance. Last night, we issued our consolidated 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 to $2.18 per share. A lot from the midpoint of the 2017 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS range to the midpoint of the 2018 earnings guidance range is shown on Slide 8. The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are infrastructure investments in our core utility business, reflecting WPL's 2018 approved electric and gas retail rates; and IPL's final electric retail rates as proposed in the settlement currently under review by the Iowa Utilities Board. IPL's interim rates will remain in effect until the IUB approve final rates by issuing a written decision expected some time in the first quarter of 2018. Also, IPL plans to file a retail gas rate review next year to recover investments in this gas distribution system since its last gas rate review filed in 2012. We are forecasting IPL's interim gas base rates will go into effect in the second quarter of 2018. The 2018 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and retail electric sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to temperature-normalized 2017 sale. Similar to this year's increase in sales, we expect most of the electric sales growth for next year to come from commercial and industrial classes. Slide 9 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impact of the tax benefit riders for 2017 and 2018. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 15% for 2017 and 24% for 2018. This 9% year-over-year increase is primarily related to changes in tax credits, associated with IPL's tax benefit riders. Please note that the tax benefit riders have no impact on annual earnings. Also, to assist you in modeling, we would like to provide you with information concerning the assume MISO ROEs embedded in forecasted APC invested earnings. The 2017 earnings forecast assumes an ROE of 10.82% through the end of this year. For 2018, earnings forecast assumes in ROE of 10.2%. We currently expect FERC will resolve the second MISO ROE complaint sometime in the first half of 2018. Finally, we have forecasted a flat O&M trend in 2017 through 2018 as we continue to focus on cost controls for the benefit of our customers. The forecasted flat O&M trend excludes the fluctuations we expect from energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations if included in WPL's most recent electric and gas rate order. Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast continues to anticipate strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and expansion of bonus depreciation reduction through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 through the tax credits from wind investments included in our plan. These forecasts is based on current federal net operating losses and carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken at the federal income tax returns over the next few years. There have been no material changes in our 2017 plan. In August, we entered into a new 5-year $1 billion master credit facility and in October, we completed the issuance of $300 million of long-term debt at WPL. Our 2017 plan continues to assume we will issue up to $250 million of long-term debt at IPL later this year. Our 2018 financing plan assumes we will issue long-term debt of up to $700 million at IPL, which includes refinancing $350 million of long-term debt maturing in 2018. We also plan to issue up to $1 billion of debt at Alliant Energy finance, which includes refinancing $595 million of term loans maturing next year. Finally, our plan assumes we will issue up to $200 million of new common equity in 2018 through a combination of an ATM program and our share direct program. The financing plan will allow us to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL, included in the most recent retail rate decision. We may adjust these financing plans as deemed prudent, as market conditions warrant, and as our external financing needs continue to be reaffirmed. Finally, for our regulatory schedule. We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 10. The IPL, we with the decision concerning the retail electric base rate review filed at April of this year. We anticipate an oral decision from the IUB before the end of this year and a written decision early in 2018. Also, we expect a decision from the Iowa Utilities Board concerning the advanced rate-making principals for the second 500-megawatt of wind investment for our Iowa customers at the end of the first quarter of next year. For WPL, we plan to submit a retail electric and gas rate review filing for test years 2019 and 2020 next year. The rate filing recovery of the West Riverside gas facility currently under construction. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you the financed conference next week. For your convenience, we have already posted on our website the investor presentation, which details a separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures through 2021 as well as updated rate base and a construction work in progress estimates. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, we issued a press release which included third quarter and year-to-date financial results, updated our 2017 earnings guidance range and announced our 2018 earnings guidance and comm",1470,"Thanks, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, we issued a press release which included third quarter and year-to-date financial results, updated our 2017 earnings guidance range and announced our 2018 earnings guidance and common stock dividend target. It also provided our annual capital expenditure plan through 2021 and our current estimated total CapEx for 2022 through 2026. Before the quarter, I am pleased to report that excessive mild temperatures, our results were according to plan. Like many others in the region, we experienced a very cool summer, which followed a very warm winter. This negatively impacted our year-to-date earnings by $0.06 per share. As in the past, this is the quarter that we update this year's earnings guidance to include the temperature impacts for the first 9 months. So the new guidance is now -- has a midpoint of $1.93 per share, which is $0.06 per share lower for the midpoint of earnings guidance provided for 2017 last November. Robert will provide details for the quarter later in the call. Let me now focus on 2018, which you will be pleased with. We announced a 6% increase in our targeted 2018 common dividend to $1.34 per share. We also announced a 6% increase of earnings guidance with a midpoint of $2.11 per share. As shown on Slide 2, the 6% increase is based on temperature-normalized earnings for 2017 of $1.99 per share and not the revised 2017 guidance that includes this year's negative temperature impact. I also want to reaffirm that our long-term earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7%, and our dividend payout ratio remains at 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings. We also issued our 2017 to 2021 capital expenditure plan totaling $6.9 billion, as shown on Slide 3. In addition, we provided a walk from the previous plan to our current plan on Slide 4. As you can see, the CapEx increase is driven mostly by the additional 300 megawatts of wind that we've been discussing with you. This increase was partially offset by lower maintenance expenditures in generation. Our updated capital expenditure plan includes 1,200 megawatts of wind energy. Under current tax law, we expect all of the wind projects to qualify for the 100% federal production tax credits. Also, our CapEx plan includes additional lead beyond 2020, which we anticipate would be a combination of grid enhancements, solar and natural gas generation. And as energy technologies evolve, we will continue to evaluate our investment plans to best serve the needs of our customers. Approximately 1/2 of our $11.9 billion, 10-year capital plan is for enhancing our electric and gas distribution systems, including smart meter deployment in Iowa. Our customers and communities expect us to not only maintain a safe and highly reliable system, but now expect us to adapt to a system that is more interactive and dynamic. We continue to make exciting progress on the development of our wind expansion. Our existing utility wind portfolio includes owned wind farms of 568 megawatts, plus approximately 600 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. Our plans to reach 1,200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for our customers. We forecast that almost 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity would be from renewable sources by 2024. Let me now share with you some of the key activities underway to expand our energy resources. In August, we filed a new advanced rate-making principal application, or RPU, with Iowa Utilities Board to request approval for up to 500 megawatts of additional utility-owned wind. In the RPU, we requested the same return equity of 11% that was approved in the last proceeding. We also requested a cost cap of $1,780 per kilowatt including AFUDC and transmission, which is lower than the cost cap approved in the last proceeding. We expect approval in the first quarter of 2018. In construction, we'll soon begin at our Upland Prairie Wind Farm. We are also making good progress on acquiring additional wind farms, which is all part of our 1,000-megawatt wind expansion in Iowa. Our forecast assumes that 300 megawatts will be in service in 2019, and the remaining 700 megawatts of wind will be placed in service in 2020. Recently, we signed an agreement with We Energies purchase a stake in the forward wind energy center, along with WPS and MG&E. We will file a joint application with PSCW for the purchase of this Wisconsin wind farm before year-end. If approved, customers are expected to realize a savings from the transfer of this wind farm for an existing purchase power agreement to utility-owned. We anticipate closing in the spring of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals. WPL's share of the facility will be 55 megawatts, with a purchase price of approximately $74 million. This purchase is included in the capital expenditure plan we released last evening, which cost for a total of 200 megawatts of additional wind investment for WP&L. We are also completing our evaluations from the request for proposal for additional wind energy options to benefit our Wisconsin customers. We anticipate filing a request for additional wind investments with the Public Service Commission before the year-end. We are very fortunate that we serve customers in a region where wind energy is economic and abundant, and I must thank our support of rural communities and farm families that are great partners in fueling our future. We cannot do this without them. Moving on to our gas-generation investments. We are in the early stages of making good progress with Wisconsin's West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will be in service by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 730 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, including AFUDC and transmission. That 3 electric cooperatives that signed letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside have received PSCW approval. We expect FERC approval of the wholesale supply agreement within the coming months. These co-ops have been WPL's wholesale customers for decades, and we are delighted that they'll be our partners in West Riverside. Solar generation is the newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our collaboration on 2 solar projects with the city of Dubuque, which is are now producing energy for our customers. These projects are in addition to our 300 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River campus, our running laboratory at our Lansing headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investments, such as these, will help meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. We are also planning to install solar at West Riverside Energy Center in Southern Wisconsin and Marshalltown Generating Station in Central Iowa. Before I wrap up, I would like to briefly address the tax reform they've released in Congress yesterday. It's too early for us to know the potential impacts of tax reform on our company and customers, especially given that changes are expected in the coming weeks. We will remain involved in the process and will continue to advocate for our customers for the economic growth in the communities we are privileged to serve. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees for the storm recovery assistance not only at home, but also in Florida. I'm extremely proud of their quick response and great customer care during challenging restoration efforts, while we're keeping safety top of mind. With Veterans Day just a week away, I would like to take a moment and pay tribute to the approximately 400 proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today. I also want to extend my thanks to appreciation to all the military families for everything they do while their loved ones are away from home. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017 and 2018. Our dedicated employees delivered solid third quarter results and will deliver on full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide the 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We expect to complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget and in a very safe manner. We will continue working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner; continue focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities, while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster; and we will continue to manage the company to strike the balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

We released third quarter 2017 earnings last night with our GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share. The difference is a $0.02 per share nonrecurring charge from write-downs of regulatory asset",1235,"Good morning, everyone. We released third quarter 2017 earnings last night with our GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share. The difference is a $0.02 per share nonrecurring charge from write-downs of regulatory assets due to the recent proposed settlement reached with the major intervening parties and IPL's retail electric rate review. Our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share were $0.05 lower than non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the impacts on electric sales of cooler summer temperatures in our service territory compared to last year. IPL interim retail electric base rates and new WPL retail electric and gas base rates continue to contribute to higher earnings in the third quarter of 2017. However, as expected, these increased earnings were offset by the impacts of higher depreciation expense from rate base additions, including the Marshalltown facility, AFUDC earned on Marshalltown in 2016 and higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at WPL. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers can be found on Slides 5, 6 and 7. 
Turning to our updated 2017 earnings guidance. Our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings generated through the first 3 quarters of this year have been consistent with our original earnings guidance, allowing us to narrow the range. The updated 2017 earnings guidance range is $1.89 to $1.97 per share. The change to the midpoint of our updated earnings guidance is due to the $0.06 of losses from the impact on electric and gas sales of the much milder temperatures in our service territory during the first 3 quarters of 2017. Excluding the impacts of these much milder temperatures, we continue to see modest sales growth in our service territories, driven by increased sales through our commercial and industrial segments. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, temperature-normalized sales, excluding the impact of leap year, increased approximately 0.5%. Now let's review our 2018 earnings guidance. Last night, we issued our consolidated 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 to $2.18 per share. A walk from the midpoint of the 2017 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS range to the midpoint of the 2018 earnings guidance range is shown on Slide 8. The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are infrastructure investments in our core utility business, reflecting WPL's 2018 approved electric and gas retail rates; and IPL's final electric retail rates as proposed in the settlement currently under review by the Iowa Utilities Board. IPL's interim rates will remain in effect until the IUB approve final rates by issuing a written decision expected sometime in the first quarter of 2018. Also, IPL plans to file a retail gas rate review next year to recover investments in this gas distribution system since its last gas rate review filed in 2012. We are forecasting IPL's interim gas base rates will go into effect in the second quarter of 2018. The 2018 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and retail electric sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to temperature-normalized 2017 sale. Similar to this year's increase in sales, we expect most of the electric sales growth for next year to come from commercial and industrial classes. Slide 9 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impact of the tax benefit riders for 2017 and 2018. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 15% for 2017 and 24% for 2018. This 9% year-over-year increase is primarily related to changes in tax credits, associated with IPL's tax benefit riders. Please note that the tax benefit riders have no impact on annual earnings. Also, to assist you in modeling, we would like to provide you with information concerning the assumed MISO ROE's embedded and forecasted ATC investment earnings. The 2017 earnings forecast assumes an ROE of 10.82% through the end of this year. For 2018, earnings forecast assumes an ROE of 10.2%. We currently expect FERC will resolve the second MISO ROE complaint sometime in the first half of 2018. Finally, we have forecasted a flat O&M trend in 2017 through 2018 as we continue to focus on cost controls for the benefit of our customers. The forecasted flat O&M trend excludes the fluctuations we expect from energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations, which were included in WPL's most recent electric and gas rate order. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast continues to anticipate strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and extension of bonus depreciation reductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the tax credits from wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. There have been no material changes to our 2017 financing plan. In August, we entered into a new 5-year $1 billion master credit facility. And in October, we completed the issuance of $300 million of long-term debt at WPL. Our 2017 plan continues to assume we will issue up to $250 million of long-term debt at IPL later this year. Our 2018 financing plan assumes we will issue long-term debt of up to $700 million at IPL, which includes refinancing $350 million of long-term debt maturing in 2018. We also plan to issue up to $1 billion of debt at Alliant Energy finance, which includes refinancing $595 million of term loans maturing next year. Finally, our plan assumes we will issue up to $200 million of new common equity in 2018 through a combination of an ATM program and our share on the direct program. The financing plan will allow us to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL included in the most recent retail rate decision. We may adjust these financing plans as deemed prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. Finally, for our regulatory schedule. We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 10. For IPL, we await a decision concerning the retail electric base rate review filed on April of this year. We anticipate an oral decision from the IUB before the end of this year and a written decision early in 2018. Also, we expect a decision from the Iowa Utilities Board concerning the advanced rate-making principals for the second 500-megawatt of wind investment for our Iowa customers at the end of the first quarter of next year. For WPL, we plan to submit a retail electric and gas rate review filing for test years 2019 and 2020 next year, the rate filing will seek recovery of the West Riverside gas facility currently under construction. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company, and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI finance conference next week. For your convenience, we have already posted on our website the EEI investor presentation, which details the separate IPL- and WPL-updated capital expenditures through 2021 as well as updated rate base and a construction work-in-progress estimates. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, we issued a press release which included third quarter and year-to-date financial results, updated our 2017 earnings guidance range and announced our 2018 earnings guidance and common stock dividend target. It also provided our annual capital expenditure plan through 2021 and our current estimated total CapEx for 2022 through 2026. Before the quarter, I am pleased to report that excessive mild temperatures, our results were according to plan. Like many others in the region, we experienced a very cool summer, which followed a very warm winter. This negatively impacted our year-to-date earnings by $0.06 per share. As in the past, this is the quarter that we update this year's earnings guidance to include the temperature impacts for the first 9 months. So the new guidance is now -- has a midpoint of $1.93 per share, which is $0.06 per share lower for the midpoint of earnings guidance provided for 2017 last November. Robert will provide details for the quarter later in the call. Let me now focus on 2018, which you will be pleased with. We announced a 6% increase in our targeted 2018 common dividend to $1.34 per share. We also announced a 6% increase of earnings guidance with a midpoint of $2.11 per share. As shown on Slide 2, the 6% increase is based on temperature-normalized earnings for 2017 of $1.99 per share and not the revised 2017 guidance that includes this year's negative temperature impact. I also want to reaffirm that our long-term earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7%, and our dividend payout ratio remains at 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings. We also issued our 2017 to 2021 capital expenditure plan totaling $6.9 billion, as shown on Slide 3. In addition, we provided a walk from the previous plan to our current plan on Slide 4. As you can see, the CapEx increase is driven mostly by the additional 300 megawatts of wind that we've been discussing with you. This increase was partially offset by lower maintenance expenditures in generation. Our updated capital expenditure plan includes 1,200 megawatts of wind energy. Under current tax law, we expect all of the wind projects to qualify for the 100% federal production tax credits. Also, our CapEx plan includes additional lead beyond 2020, which we anticipate would be a combination of grid enhancements, solar and natural gas generation. And as energy technologies evolve, we will continue to evaluate our investment plans to best serve the needs of our customers. Approximately 1/2 of our $11.9 billion, 10-year capital plan is for enhancing our electric and gas distribution systems, including smart meter deployment in Iowa. Our customers and communities expect us to not only maintain a safe and highly reliable system, but now expect us to adapt to a system that is more interactive and dynamic. We continue to make exciting progress on the development of our wind expansion. Our existing utility wind portfolio includes owned wind farms of 568 megawatts, plus approximately 600 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. Our plans to reach 1,200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for our customers. We forecast that almost 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity would be from renewable sources by 2024. Let me now share with you some of the key activities underway to expand our energy resources. In August, we filed a new advanced rate-making principal application, or RPU, with Iowa Utilities Board to request approval for up to 500 megawatts of additional utility-owned wind. In the RPU, we requested the same return equity of 11% that was approved in the last proceeding. We also requested a cost cap of $1,780 per kilowatt including AFUDC and transmission, which is lower than the cost cap approved in the last proceeding. We expect approval in the first quarter of 2018. In construction, we'll soon begin at our Upland Prairie Wind Farm. We are also making good progress on acquiring additional wind farms, which is all part of our 1,000-megawatt wind expansion in Iowa. Our forecast assumes that 300 megawatts will be in service in 2019, and the remaining 700 megawatts of wind will be placed in service in 2020. Recently, we signed an agreement with We Energies purchase a stake in the forward wind energy center, along with WPS and MG&E. We will file a joint application with PSCW for the purchase of this Wisconsin wind farm before year-end. If approved, customers are expected to realize a savings from the transfer of this wind farm for an existing purchase power agreement to utility-owned. We anticipate closing in the spring of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals. WPL's share of the facility will be 55 megawatts, with a purchase price of approximately $74 million. This purchase is included in the capital expenditure plan we released last evening, which calls for a total of 200 megawatts of additional wind investment for WP&L. We are also completing our evaluations from the request for proposal for additional wind energy options to benefit our Wisconsin customers. We anticipate filing a request for additional wind investments with the Public Service Commission before the year-end. We are very fortunate that we serve customers in a region where wind energy is economic and abundant, and I must thank our support of rural communities and farm families that are great partners in fueling our future. We cannot do this without them. Moving on to our gas-generation investments. We are in the early stages of making good progress with Wisconsin's West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will be in service by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 730 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, including AFUDC and transmission. That 3 electric cooperatives that signed letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside have received PSCW approval. We expect FERC approval of the wholesale supply agreement within the coming months. These co-ops have been WPL's wholesale customers for decades, and we are delighted that they'll be our partners in West Riverside. Solar generation is the newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our collaboration on 2 solar projects with the city of Dubuque, which is are now producing energy for our customers. These projects are in addition to our 300 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River campus, our running laboratory at our Lansing headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investments, such as these, will help meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. We are also planning to install solar at West Riverside Energy Center in Southern Wisconsin and Marshalltown Generating Station in Central Iowa. Before I wrap up, I would like to briefly address the tax reform bill released in Congress yesterday. It's too early for us to know the potential impacts of tax reform on our company and customers, especially given that changes are expected in the coming weeks. We will remain involved in the process and will continue to advocate for our customers for the economic growth in the communities we are privileged to serve. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees for the storm recovery assistance not only at home, but also in Florida. I'm extremely proud of their quick response and great customer care during challenging restoration efforts, while we're keeping safety top of mind. With Veterans Day just a week away, I would like to take a moment and pay tribute to the approximately 400 proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today. I also want to extend my thanks to appreciation to all the military families for everything they do while their loved ones are away from home. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017 and 2018. Our dedicated employees delivered solid third quarter results and will deliver on full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide the 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We expect to complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget and in a very safe manner. We will continue working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner; continue focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities, while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster; and we will continue to manage the company to strike the balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

We released third quarter 2017 earnings last night with our GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share. The difference is a $0.02 per share nonrecurring charge from write-downs of regulatory asset",1235,"Good morning, everyone. We released third quarter 2017 earnings last night with our GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share. The difference is a $0.02 per share nonrecurring charge from write-downs of regulatory assets due to the recent proposed settlement reached with the major intervening parties and IPL's retail electric rate review. Our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share were $0.05 lower than non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the impacts on electric sales of cooler summer temperatures in our service territory compared to last year. IPL interim retail electric base rates and new WPL retail electric and gas base rates continue to contribute to higher earnings in the third quarter of 2017. However, as expected, these increased earnings were offset by the impacts of higher depreciation expense from rate base additions, including the Marshalltown facility, AFUDC earned on Marshalltown in 2016 and higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at WPL. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers can be found on Slides 5, 6 and 7. 
Turning to our updated 2017 earnings guidance. Our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings generated through the first 3 quarters of this year have been consistent with our original earnings guidance, allowing us to narrow the range. The updated 2017 earnings guidance range is $1.89 to $1.97 per share. The change to the midpoint of our updated earnings guidance is due to the $0.06 of losses from the impact on electric and gas sales of the much milder temperatures in our service territory during the first 3 quarters of 2017. Excluding the impacts of these much milder temperatures, we continue to see modest sales growth in our service territories, driven by increased sales through our commercial and industrial segments. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, temperature-normalized sales, excluding the impact of leap year, increased approximately 0.5%. Now let's review our 2018 earnings guidance. Last night, we issued our consolidated 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 to $2.18 per share. A walk from the midpoint of the 2017 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS range to the midpoint of the 2018 earnings guidance range is shown on Slide 8. The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are infrastructure investments in our core utility business, reflecting WPL's 2018 approved electric and gas retail rates; and IPL's final electric retail rates as proposed in the settlement currently under review by the Iowa Utilities Board. IPL's interim rates will remain in effect until the IUB approve final rates by issuing a written decision expected sometime in the first quarter of 2018. Also, IPL plans to file a retail gas rate review next year to recover investments in this gas distribution system since its last gas rate review filed in 2012. We are forecasting IPL's interim gas base rates will go into effect in the second quarter of 2018. The 2018 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and retail electric sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to temperature-normalized 2017 sale. Similar to this year's increase in sales, we expect most of the electric sales growth for next year to come from commercial and industrial classes. Slide 9 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impact of the tax benefit riders for 2017 and 2018. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 15% for 2017 and 24% for 2018. This 9% year-over-year increase is primarily related to changes in tax credits, associated with IPL's tax benefit riders. Please note that the tax benefit riders have no impact on annual earnings. Also, to assist you in modeling, we would like to provide you with information concerning the assumed MISO ROE's embedded and forecasted ATC investment earnings. The 2017 earnings forecast assumes an ROE of 10.82% through the end of this year. For 2018, earnings forecast assumes an ROE of 10.2%. We currently expect FERC will resolve the second MISO ROE complaint sometime in the first half of 2018. Finally, we have forecasted a flat O&M trend in 2017 through 2018 as we continue to focus on cost controls for the benefit of our customers. The forecasted flat O&M trend excludes the fluctuations we expect from energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations, which were included in WPL's most recent electric and gas rate order. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast continues to anticipate strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and extension of bonus depreciation reductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the tax credits from wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. There have been no material changes to our 2017 financing plan. In August, we entered into a new 5-year $1 billion master credit facility. And in October, we completed the issuance of $300 million of long-term debt at WPL. Our 2017 plan continues to assume we will issue up to $250 million of long-term debt at IPL later this year. Our 2018 financing plan assumes we will issue long-term debt of up to $700 million at IPL, which includes refinancing $350 million of long-term debt maturing in 2018. We also plan to issue up to $1 billion of debt at Alliant Energy finance, which includes refinancing $595 million of term loans maturing next year. Finally, our plan assumes we will issue up to $200 million of new common equity in 2018 through a combination of an ATM program and our share on the direct program. The financing plan will allow us to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL included in the most recent retail rate decision. We may adjust these financing plans as deemed prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. Finally, for our regulatory schedule. We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 10. For IPL, we await a decision concerning the retail electric base rate review filed in April of this year. We anticipate an oral decision from the IUB before the end of this year and a written decision early in 2018. Also, we expect a decision from the Iowa Utilities Board concerning the advanced rate-making principals for the second 500-megawatt of wind investment for our Iowa customers at the end of the first quarter of next year. For WPL, we plan to submit a retail electric and gas rate review filing for test years 2019 and 2020 next year, the rate filing will seek recovery of the West Riverside gas facility currently under construction. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company, and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI finance conference next week. For your convenience, we have already posted on our website the EEI investor presentation, which details the separate IPL- and WPL-updated capital expenditures through 2021 as well as updated rate base and a construction work-in-progress estimates. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

And, so yes, that would require us to go in for a rate review with a test year 2019 rate review at this point in time. And so assuming we cannot get to some type of settlement agreement before then, that's what our current plan assumes. And then if you turn over to the WPL increase, you'll see about a $500 million increase from '19 to 2020. And a lot of that is based on the West Riverside plant that we're currently expecting to put into service late in 2019 and early 2020, as well as some modest levels of winds on the WPL side, too. And we expect to go in for a rate review or file for a rate review sometime most likely in the second quarter of 2018 for that 2019 and 2020 test period."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, we issued a press release which included third quarter and year-to-date financial results, updated our 2017 earnings guidance range and announced our 2018 earnings guidance and common stock dividend target. It also provided our annual capital expenditure plan through 2021 and our current estimated total CapEx for 2022 through 2026. Before the quarter, I am pleased to report that excessive mild temperatures, our results were according to plan. Like many others in the region, we experienced a very cool summer, which followed a very warm winter. This negatively impacted our year-to-date earnings by $0.06 per share. As in the past, this is the quarter that we update this year's earnings guidance to include the temperature impacts for the first 9 months. So the new guidance is now -- has a midpoint of $1.93 per share, which is $0.06 per share lower for the midpoint of earnings guidance provided for 2017 last November. Robert will provide details for the quarter later in the call. Let me now focus on 2018, which you will be pleased with. We announced a 6% increase in our targeted 2018 common dividend to $1.34 per share. We also announced a 6% increase of earnings guidance with a midpoint of $2.11 per share. As shown on Slide 2, the 6% increase is based on temperature-normalized earnings for 2017 of $1.99 per share and not the revised 2017 guidance that includes this year's negative temperature impact. I also want to reaffirm that our long-term earnings growth objective remains at 5% to 7%, and our dividend payout ratio remains at 60% to 70% of consolidated earnings. We also issued our 2017 to 2021 capital expenditure plan totaling $6.9 billion, as shown on Slide 3. In addition, we provided a walk from the previous plan to our current plan on Slide 4. As you can see, the CapEx increase is driven mostly by the additional 300 megawatts of wind that we've been discussing with you. This increase was partially offset by lower maintenance expenditures in generation. Our updated capital expenditure plan includes 1,200 megawatts of wind energy. Under current tax law, we expect all of the wind projects to qualify for the 100% federal production tax credits. Also, our CapEx plan includes additional lead beyond 2020, which we anticipate would be a combination of grid enhancements, solar and natural gas generation. And as energy technologies evolve, we will continue to evaluate our investment plans to best serve the needs of our customers. Approximately 1/2 of our $11.9 billion, 10-year capital plan is for enhancing our electric and gas distribution systems, including smart meter deployment in Iowa. Our customers and communities expect us to not only maintain a safe and highly reliable system, but now expect us to adapt to a system that is more interactive and dynamic. We continue to make exciting progress on the development of our wind expansion. Our existing utility wind portfolio includes owned wind farms of 568 megawatts, plus approximately 600 megawatts of renewable purchase power agreements. Our plans to reach 1,200 megawatts of new wind generation will more than double renewable energy for our customers. We forecast that almost 30% of Alliant Energy's rated electric capacity would be from renewable sources by 2024. Let me now share with you some of the key activities underway to expand our energy resources. In August, we filed a new advanced rate-making principal application, or RPU, with Iowa Utilities Board to request approval for up to 500 megawatts of additional utility-owned wind. In the RPU, we requested the same return equity of 11% that was approved in the last proceeding. We also requested a cost cap of $1,780 per kilowatt including AFUDC and transmission, which is lower than the cost cap approved in the last proceeding. We expect approval in the first quarter of 2018. In construction, we'll soon begin at our Upland Prairie Wind Farm. We are also making good progress on acquiring additional wind farms, which is all part of our 1,000-megawatt wind expansion in Iowa. Our forecast assumes that 300 megawatts will be in service in 2019, and the remaining 700 megawatts of wind will be placed in service in 2020. Recently, we signed an agreement with We Energies purchase a stake in the forward wind energy center, along with WPS and MG&E. We will file a joint application with PSCW for the purchase of this Wisconsin wind farm before year-end. If approved, customers are expected to realize a savings from the transfer of this wind farm for an existing purchase power agreement to utility-owned. We anticipate closing in the spring of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals. WPL's share of the facility will be 55 megawatts, with a purchase price of approximately $74 million. This purchase is included in the capital expenditure plan we released last evening, which calls for a total of 200 megawatts of additional wind investment for WP&L. We are also completing our evaluations from the request for proposal for additional wind energy options to benefit our Wisconsin customers. We anticipate filing a request for additional wind investments with the Public Service Commission before the year-end. We are very fortunate that we serve customers in a region where wind energy is economic and abundant, and I must thank our support of rural communities and farm families that are great partners in fueling our future. We cannot do this without them. Moving on to our gas-generation investments. We are in the early stages of making good progress with Wisconsin's West Riverside Energy Center. We expect that West Riverside will be in service by early 2020. Its output will be approximately 730 megawatts, and our share of the total anticipated project cost is approximately $640 million, including AFUDC and transmission. That 3 electric cooperatives that signed letters of intent to acquire approximately 65 megawatts of West Riverside have received PSCW approval. We expect FERC approval of the wholesale supply agreement within the coming months. These co-ops have been WPL's wholesale customers for decades, and we are delighted that they'll be our partners in West Riverside. Solar generation is the newest addition to our energy mix. We are excited about our collaboration on 2 solar projects with the city of Dubuque, which is are now producing energy for our customers. These projects are in addition to our 300 existing solar facilities located at our Rock River campus, our running laboratory at our Lansing headquarters and the Indian Creek Nature Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Solar investments, such as these, will help meet our customers' growing interest in cleaner and distributed forms of energy. We are also planning to install solar at West Riverside Energy Center in Southern Wisconsin and Marshalltown Generating Station in Central Iowa. Before I wrap up, I would like to briefly address the tax reform bill released in Congress yesterday. It's too early for us to know the potential impacts of tax reform on our company and customers, especially given that changes are expected in the coming weeks. We will remain involved in the process and will continue to advocate for our customers for the economic growth in the communities we are privileged to serve. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated employees for the storm recovery assistance not only at home, but also in Florida. I'm extremely proud of their quick response and great customer care during challenging restoration efforts, while we're keeping safety top of mind. With Veterans Day just a week away, I would like to take a moment and pay tribute to the approximately 400 proud veterans that work here at Alliant Energy and to those veterans that are on the call with us today. I also want to extend my thanks to appreciation to all the military families for everything they do while their loved ones are away from home. 
Let me summarize my key focus areas for 2017 and 2018. Our dedicated employees delivered solid third quarter results and will deliver on full year financial and operating objectives. Our plan continues to provide the 5% to 7% earnings growth and 60% to 70% common dividend payout target. We expect to complete our large construction projects on time and at or below budget and in a very safe manner. We will continue working with our regulators, consumer advocates, environmental groups, neighboring utilities and customers in a collaborative manner; continue focus on serving our customers and being good partners in our communities, while reshaping the organization to be leaner and faster; and we will continue to manage the company to strike the balance between capital investment, operational and financial discipline and cost impact to customers. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy, and I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

We released third quarter 2017 earnings last night with our GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share. The difference is a $0.02 per share nonrecurring charge from write-downs of regulatory asset",1235,"Good morning, everyone. We released third quarter 2017 earnings last night with our GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share and our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share. The difference is a $0.02 per share nonrecurring charge from write-downs of regulatory assets due to the recent proposed settlement reached with the major intervening parties and IPL's retail electric rate review. Our non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 per share were $0.05 lower than non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the impacts on electric sales of cooler summer temperatures in our service territory compared to last year. IPL interim retail electric base rates and new WPL retail electric and gas base rates continue to contribute to higher earnings in the third quarter of 2017. However, as expected, these increased earnings were offset by the impacts of higher depreciation expense from rate base additions, including the Marshalltown facility, AFUDC earned on Marshalltown in 2016 and higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at WPL. A summary of the quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers can be found on Slides 5, 6 and 7. 
Turning to our updated 2017 earnings guidance. Our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings generated through the first 3 quarters of this year have been consistent with our original earnings guidance, allowing us to narrow the range. The updated 2017 earnings guidance range is $1.89 to $1.97 per share. The change to the midpoint of our updated earnings guidance is due to the $0.06 of losses from the impact on electric and gas sales of the much milder temperatures in our service territory during the first 3 quarters of 2017. Excluding the impacts of these much milder temperatures, we continue to see modest sales growth in our service territories, driven by increased sales through our commercial and industrial segments. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, temperature-normalized sales, excluding the impact of leap year, increased approximately 0.5%. Now let's review our 2018 earnings guidance. Last night, we issued our consolidated 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.04 to $2.18 per share. A walk from the midpoint of the 2017 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS range to the midpoint of the 2018 earnings guidance range is shown on Slide 8. The key drivers of the 6% growth in EPS are infrastructure investments in our core utility business, reflecting WPL's 2018 approved electric and gas retail rates; and IPL's final electric retail rates as proposed in the settlement currently under review by the Iowa Utilities Board. IPL's interim rates will remain in effect until the IUB approve final rates by issuing a written decision expected sometime in the first quarter of 2018. Also, IPL plans to file a retail gas rate review next year to recover investments in this gas distribution system since its last gas rate review filed in 2012. We are forecasting IPL's interim gas base rates will go into effect in the second quarter of 2018. The 2018 guidance range assumes normal temperatures and retail electric sales growth of approximately 1% when compared to temperature-normalized 2017 sale. Similar to this year's increase in sales, we expect most of the electric sales growth for next year to come from commercial and industrial classes. Slide 9 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for IPL, WPL and AEC, including the impact of the tax benefit riders for 2017 and 2018. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 15% for 2017 and 24% for 2018. This 9% year-over-year increase is primarily related to changes in tax credits, associated with IPL's tax benefit riders. Please note that the tax benefit riders have no impact on annual earnings. Also, to assist you in modeling, we would like to provide you with information concerning the assumed MISO ROE's embedded and forecasted ATC investment earnings. The 2017 earnings forecast assumes an ROE of 10.82% through the end of this year. For 2018, earnings forecast assumes an ROE of 10.2%. We currently expect FERC will resolve the second MISO ROE complaint sometime in the first half of 2018. Finally, we have forecasted a flat O&M trend in 2017 through 2018 as we continue to focus on cost controls for the benefit of our customers. The forecasted flat O&M trend excludes the fluctuations we expect from energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations, which were included in WPL's most recent electric and gas rate order. 
Turning to our financing plans. Our current forecast continues to anticipate strong cash flows from the earnings generated by the business and extension of bonus depreciation reductions through 2019. Alliant Energy currently does not expect to make any significant federal income tax payments through 2021, with additional tax payment reductions expected after 2021 due to the tax credits from wind investments included in our plan. This forecast is based on current federal net operating losses and credit carryforward positions as well as future amounts of bonus depreciation expected to be taken on federal income tax returns over the next few years. There have been no material changes to our 2017 financing plan. In August, we entered into a new 5-year $1 billion master credit facility. And in October, we completed the issuance of $300 million of long-term debt at WPL. Our 2017 plan continues to assume we will issue up to $250 million of long-term debt at IPL later this year. Our 2018 financing plan assumes we will issue long-term debt of up to $700 million at IPL, which includes refinancing $350 million of long-term debt maturing in 2018. We also plan to issue up to $1 billion of debt at Alliant Energy finance, which includes refinancing $595 million of term loans maturing next year. Finally, our plan assumes we will issue up to $200 million of new common equity in 2018 through a combination of an ATM program and our share on the direct program. The financing plan will allow us to maintain the capital structures at IPL and WPL included in the most recent retail rate decision. We may adjust these financing plans as deemed prudent, if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs continue to be reassessed. Finally, for our regulatory schedule. We have several current and planned regulatory dockets of note for 2017 and 2018, which we have summarized on Slide 10. For IPL, we await a decision concerning the retail electric base rate review filed in April of this year. We anticipate an oral decision from the IUB before the end of this year and a written decision early in 2018. Also, we expect a decision from the Iowa Utilities Board concerning the advanced rate-making principals for the second 500-megawatt of wind investment for our Iowa customers at the end of the first quarter of next year. For WPL, we plan to submit a retail electric and gas rate review filing for test years 2019 and 2020 next year, the rate filing will seek recovery of the West Riverside gas facility currently under construction. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company, and look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI finance conference next week. For your convenience, we have already posted on our website the EEI investor presentation, which details the separate IPL- and WPL-updated capital expenditures through 2021 as well as updated rate base and a construction work-in-progress estimates. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."
