Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President Stores and Prevention; John Cargill, Executive Vice President Finance and",540,"Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President Stores and Prevention; John Cargill, Executive Vice President Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. 
We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2016 performance followed by our outlook for 2017. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we are very pleased with our better-than-expected sales and earnings results for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, especially given our strong multiyear comparison in a highly competitive and promotional holiday season. Our results continue to benefit from our ability to offer customers great values on a wide assortment of gifts and fashions for the family and the home. 
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter grew 17% to $0.77 on net earnings that rose 14% to $301 million. Sales for the quarter increased 8% to $3.5 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of last year's 4% gain.
For the 2016 fiscal year, earnings per share grew 13% to $2.83, while net earnings rose 10% to $1.1 billion. Sales grew 8% to $12.9 billion, with comparable sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in 2015.
dd's DISCOUNTS customers also responded positively to its merchandise assortments, which led to solid growth in sales and operating profit at dd's for both the quarter and fiscal 2016. For the fourth quarter, shoes and Men's were the best-performing merchandise categories at Ross, while the Midwest and Southeast were the strongest regions. 
Our fourth quarter operating margin of 13.6% was up 90 basis points from last year. This improvement was mainly driven by our above-plan sales along with a favorable comparison of packaway-related costs versus last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, operating margin increased 40 basis points to a new record of 14%. As we ended 2016, total consolidated inventories were up 7% over the prior year, with packaway levels at 49% of total inventories compared to 47% last year. Average in-store inventories were up slightly at year-end.
As noted in today's press release, our board authorized a new program to repurchase $1.75 billion of our common stock over the next 2 fiscal years. This represents a 25% increase over the prior 2-year $1.4 billion authorization that was completed at the end of the fourth quarter. The board also approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per share, up 19% on top of a 15% increase in the prior year.
The continued growth of our shareholder payouts reflect our ongoing confidence in the company's ability to generate significant amount of cash after funding our growth and the other capital needs of our business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record also reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing share stockholder value and returns. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2016 results and details on our fiscal 2017 full year and first quarter guidance."

Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, fourth quarter operating margin increased 90 basis points to 13.6%. Cost of goods sold improved by 110 basis points in the quarter driven primarily by 65 basis points of lower distribution expenses, mainly from the timing of packaway-related costs that negatively impacted last year's fourth quarter. Merchandise margin improved by 15 basis points, while buying and occupancy costs were lower by 40 and 5 basis points, respectively. These improvements were partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in freight costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased approximately 20 basis points due mainly to higher wages.
Turning to our stock buyback program. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for a total purchase price of $170 million, which completed our previous 2-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program. For the year, we repurchased a total of 11.6 million shares for an aggregate price of $700 million.
Let's turn now to our guidance for 2017. Earnings per share for fiscal 2017 are forecast to be $3.02 to $3.15, up 7% to 11% from $2.83 in fiscal 2016. Incorporated in this guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.08 from the 53rd week in 2017 and $0.03 in a lower tax rate related to our adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard. 
The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2017 include the following: total sales for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018 are forecast to grow 6% to 7%. Comparable store sales, on a 52-week basis, ending January 27, 2018, are expected to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain in 2016. We plan to add about 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, this numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. If same-store sales are in line with our guidance of up 1% to 2%, then we would project operating margin for 2017 to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.1%. This EBIT margin range assumes merchandise margin for 2017 will be relatively flat on top of strong growth over the past several years. Also incorporated in this operating margin guidance is an estimated benefit of about 15 basis points from the 53rd week. 
Net interest expense is estimated to be $13 million. Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 37% to 38%. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $386 million. Capital expenditures in 2017 are projected to be approximately $400 million. And depreciation and amortization expense, inclusive of stock-based amortization, is forecast to be about $400 million, up from $377 million in 2016.
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending April 29, 2017, we are projecting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2%. Earnings per share for the period are forecast to be $0.76 to $0.79. Included in this guidance is an estimated $0.02 benefit from a lower tax rate related to the aforementioned adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard.
Other assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 23 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the quarter. First quarter operating margin is projected to be 14.7% to 14.9% compared to last year's 15.4%. The forecasted decline in EBIT is mainly due to higher wage and freight costs.
In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $3.5 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 36% to 37%, resulting from the previously mentioned accounting change. And finally, weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around 390 million.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Again, we are very pleased that our better-than-expected financial performance for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. As previously mentioned, this is notable, considering our own robust sales and earnings growth over the past several years and the ongoing competitive retail climate. As we look ahead to 2017, there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty in the political, macroeconomic and retail climate. In addition, we face tough prior year sales and earnings comparison. As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to remain somewhat cautious in planning our business for the coming year.
Nevertheless, we are confident that the off-price sector will remain a strong performing segment of retail, especially given consumers' continued focus on value. This, combined with our proven ability to deliver exceptional value our customers have come to expect, makes us optimistic about our prospects for future growth.
As a result, over the longer term, we continue to believe we can achieve average annual earnings per share gain in the low double-digit percentage range. 
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance",540,"Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. 
We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2016 performance, followed by our outlook for 2017. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we are very pleased with our better-than-expected sales and earnings results for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, especially given our strong multiyear comparison and the highly competitive and promotional holiday season. Our results continue to benefit from our ability to offer customers great value on a wide assortment of gifts and fashions for the family and the home.
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter grew 17% to $0.77 on net earnings that rose 14% to $301 million. Sales for the quarter increased 8% to $3.5 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of last year's 4% gain.
For the 2016 fiscal year, earnings per share grew 13% to $2.83, while net earnings rose 10% to $1.1 billion. Sales grew 8% to $12.9 billion, with comparable sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in 2015.
dd's DISCOUNTS customers also responded positively to its merchandise assortment, which led to solid growth in sales and operating profit at dd's for both the quarter and fiscal 2016. 
For the fourth quarter, Shoes and Men's were the best-performing merchandise categories at Ross, while the Midwest and Southeast were the strongest regions. Our fourth quarter operating margin of 13.6% was up 90 basis points from last year. This improvement was mainly driven by our above-plan sales, along with a favorable comparison of packaway-related costs versus last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, operating margin increased 40 basis points to a new record of 14%. As we ended 2016, total consolidated inventories were up 7% over the prior year, with packaway levels at 49% of total inventories compared to 47% last year. Average in-store inventories were up slightly at year-end.
As noted in today's press release, our board authorized a new program to repurchase $1.75 billion of our common stock over the next 2 fiscal years. This represents a 25% increase over the prior 2-year $1.4 billion authorization that was completed at the end of the fourth quarter. The board also approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per share, up 19% on top of a 15% increase in the prior year.
The continued growth of our shareholder payouts reflects our ongoing confidence in the company's ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding our growth and the other capital needs of our business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record also reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2016 results and details on our fiscal 2017 full year and first quarter guidance."

Let's start with our fourth quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket.

Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, fourth quarter operating margin increased 90 basis points to 13.6%. Cost of goods sold improved by 110 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by 65 basis points of lower distribution expenses, mainly from the timing of packaway-related costs that negatively impacted last year's fourth quarter. Merchandise margin improved by 15 basis points, while buying and occupancy costs were lower by 40 and 5 basis points, respectively. These improvements were partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in freight costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased approximately 20 basis points due mainly to higher wages.
Turning to our stock buyback program. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for a total purchase price of $170 million, which completed our previous 2-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program. For the year, we repurchased a total of 11.6 million shares for an aggregate price of $700 million.
Let's turn now to our guidance for 2017. Earnings per share for fiscal 2017 are forecast to be $3.02 to $3.15, up 7% to 11% from $2.83 in fiscal 2016. Incorporated in this guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.08 from the 53rd week in 2017 and $0.03 in lower tax rate related to our adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard. 
The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2017 include the following. Total sales for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018 are forecast to grow 6% to 7%. Comparable store sales, on a 52-week basis ending January 27, 2018, are expected to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain in 2016. We plan to add about 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, this numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. If same-store sales are in line with our guidance of up 1% to 2%, then we would project operating margin for 2017 to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.1%. This EBIT margin range assumes merchandise margin for 2017 will be relatively flat on top of strong growth over the past several years. Also incorporated in this operating margin guidance is an estimated benefit of about 15 basis points from the 53rd week. 
Net interest expense is estimated to be $13 million. Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 37% to 38%. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 386 million. Capital expenditures in 2017 are projected to be approximately $400 million. And depreciation and amortization expense, inclusive of stock-based amortization, is forecast to be about $400 million, up from $377 million in 2016.
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending April 29, 2017, we are projecting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2%. Earnings per share for the period are forecast to be $0.76 to $0.79. Included in this guidance is an estimated $0.02 benefit from a lower tax rate related to the aforementioned adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard.
Other assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 23 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the quarter. First quarter operating margin is projected to be 14.7% to 14.9% compared to last year's 15.4%. The forecasted decline in EBIT is mainly due to higher wage and freight costs. In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $3.5 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 36% to 37%, resulting from the previously mentioned accounting change. And finally, weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around 390 million.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Again, we are very pleased with our better-than-expected financial performance for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. As previously mentioned, this is notable considering our own robust sales and earnings growth over the past several years and the ongoing competitive retail climate. As we look ahead to 2017, there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty in the political, macroeconomic and retail climates. In addition, we face tough prior year sales and earnings comparisons. As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to remain somewhat cautious in planning our business for the coming year.
Nevertheless, we are confident that the off-price sector will remain a strong-performing segment of retail, especially given consumers' continued focus on value. This, combined with our proven ability to deliver exceptional value our customers have come to expect, makes us optimistic about our prospects for future growth. As a result, over the longer term, we continue to believe we can achieve average annual earnings per share gain in the low double-digit percentage range.

For us, if sales perform in line with the 1% to 2% comp, we would lose some leverage on fixed costs. In addition, we expect wages to be a greater headwind in the first half of the year than the back half as we raised wages in the middle of 2016. And then further, we expect freight costs to be a headwind in 2017, as we've seen higher carrier rates. In terms of the full year guidance, stripping out the 53rd week and the impact of the accounting change, we're guiding up 3% to 7% on a 1% to 2% comp. That's very consistent how we've guided the previous years. That, with the 53rd week included, shows EBIT margin relatively flat, and then without the 53rd week, it's down slightly."

We've got the department stores who seem to be focused on lowering markdown levels in their stores and are certainly buying inventories lighter. We did hear from a big competitor, Target, today talking about getting much more aggressive on pricing, I think, including categories where you guys would overlap. So how do you think about your competitive positioning here? And how are you thinking about relative pricing spread strategy in the near term given some diverging strategies in the marketplace right now?"

In the longer term, as we think about supply, we speculate about everything that could happen with a lot of changes that are going on out there. We're always studying the retail landscape and how that might change, and we're looking at that constantly. We don't see near-term supply issues in the next 2 to 3 years.

We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2016 performance, followed by our outlook for 2017. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we are very pleased with our better-than-expected sales and earnings results for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, especially given our strong multiyear comparison and the highly competitive and promotional holiday season. Our results continue to benefit from our ability to offer customers great values on a wide assortment of gifts and fashions for the family and the home.
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter grew 17% to $0.77 on net earnings that rose 14% to $301 million. Sales for the quarter increased 8% to $3.5 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of last year's 4% gain.
For the 2016 fiscal year, earnings per share grew 13% to $2.83, while net earnings rose 10% to $1.1 billion. Sales grew 8% to $12.9 billion, with comparable sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in 2015.
dd's DISCOUNTS customers also responded positively to its merchandise assortment, which led to solid growth in sales and operating profit at dd's for both the quarter and fiscal 2016. 
For the fourth quarter, Shoes and Men's were the best-performing merchandise categories at Ross, while the Midwest and Southeast were the strongest regions. Our fourth quarter operating margin of 13.6% was up 90 basis points from last year. This improvement was mainly driven by our above-plan sales, along with a favorable comparison of packaway-related costs versus last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, operating margin increased 40 basis points to a new record of 14%. As we ended 2016, total consolidated inventories were up 7% over the prior year, with packaway levels at 49% of total inventories compared to 47% last year. Average in-store inventories were up slightly at year-end.
As noted in today's press release, our board authorized a new program to repurchase $1.75 billion of our common stock over the next 2 fiscal years. This represents a 25% increase over the prior 2-year $1.4 billion authorization that was completed at the end of the fourth quarter. The board also approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per share, up 19% on top of a 15% increase in the prior year.
The continued growth of our shareholder payouts reflects our ongoing confidence in the company's ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding our growth and the other capital needs of our business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record also reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2016 results and details on our fiscal 2017 full year and first quarter guidance."

Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, fourth quarter operating margin increased 90 basis points to 13.6%. Cost of goods sold improved by 110 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by 65 basis points of lower distribution expenses, mainly from the timing of packaway-related costs that negatively impacted last year's fourth quarter. Merchandise margin improved by 15 basis points, while buying and occupancy costs were lower by 40 and 5 basis points, respectively. These improvements were partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in freight costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased approximately 20 basis points due mainly to higher wages.
Turning to our stock buyback program. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for a total purchase price of $170 million, which completed our previous 2-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program. For the year, we repurchased a total of 11.6 million shares for an aggregate price of $700 million.
Let's turn now to our guidance for 2017. Earnings per share for fiscal 2017 are forecast to be $3.02 to $3.15, up 7% to 11% from $2.83 in fiscal 2016. Incorporated in this guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.08 from the 53rd week in 2017 and $0.03 in lower tax rate related to our adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard. 
The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2017 include the following. Total sales for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018 are forecast to grow 6% to 7%. Comparable store sales, on a 52-week basis ending January 27, 2018, are expected to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain in 2016. We plan to add about 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. If same-store sales are in line with our guidance of up 1% to 2%, then we would project operating margin for 2017 to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.1%. This EBIT margin range assumes merchandise margin for 2017 will be relatively flat on top of strong growth over the past several years. Also incorporated in this operating margin guidance is an estimated benefit of about 15 basis points from the 53rd week. 
Net interest expense is estimated to be $13 million. Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 37% to 38%. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 386 million. Capital expenditures in 2017 are projected to be approximately $400 million. And depreciation and amortization expense, inclusive of stock-based amortization, is forecast to be about $400 million, up from $377 million in 2016.
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending April 29, 2017, we are projecting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2%. Earnings per share for the period are forecast to be $0.76 to $0.79. Included in this guidance is an estimated $0.02 benefit from a lower tax rate related to the aforementioned adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard.
Other assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 23 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the quarter. First quarter operating margin is projected to be 14.7% to 14.9% compared to last year's 15.4%. The forecasted decline in EBIT is mainly due to higher wage and freight costs. In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $3.5 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 36% to 37%, resulting from the previously mentioned accounting change. And finally, weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around 390 million.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Again, we are very pleased with our better-than-expected financial performance for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. As previously mentioned, this is notable considering our own robust sales and earnings growth over the past several years and the ongoing competitive retail climate. As we look ahead to 2017, there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty in the political, macroeconomic and retail climates. In addition, we face tough prior year sales and earnings comparisons. As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to remain somewhat cautious in planning our business for the coming year.
Nevertheless, we are confident that the off-price sector will remain a strong-performing segment of retail, especially given consumers' continued focus on value. This, combined with our proven ability to deliver exceptional values our customers have come to expect, makes us optimistic about our prospects for future growth. As a result, over the longer term, we continue to believe we can achieve average annual earnings per share gain in the low double-digit percentage range. 
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. 
We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2016 performance, followed by our outlook for 2017. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we are very pleased with our better-than-expected sales and earnings results for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, especially given our strong multiyear comparison and the highly competitive and promotional holiday season. Our results continue to benefit from our ability to offer customers great values on a wide assortment of gifts and fashions for the family and the home.
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter grew 17% to $0.77 on net earnings that rose 14% to $301 million. Sales for the quarter increased 8% to $3.5 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of last year's 4% gain.
For the 2016 fiscal year, earnings per share grew 13% to $2.83, while net earnings rose 10% to $1.1 billion. Sales grew 8% to $12.9 billion, with comparable sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in 2015.
dd's DISCOUNTS customers also responded positively to its merchandise assortment, which led to solid growth in sales and operating profit at dd's for both the quarter and fiscal 2016. 
For the fourth quarter, Shoes and Men's were the best-performing merchandise categories at Ross, while the Midwest and Southeast were the strongest regions. Our fourth quarter operating margin of 13.6% was up 90 basis points from last year. This improvement was mainly driven by our above-plan sales, along with a favorable comparison of packaway-related costs versus last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, operating margin increased 40 basis points to a new record of 14%. As we ended 2016, total consolidated inventories were up 7% over the prior year, with packaway levels at 49% of total inventories compared to 47% last year. Average in-store inventories were up slightly at year-end.
As noted in today's press release, our board authorized a new program to repurchase $1.75 billion of our common stock over the next 2 fiscal years. This represents a 25% increase over the prior 2-year $1.4 billion authorization that was completed at the end of the fourth quarter. The board also approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per share, up 19% on top of a 15% increase in the prior year.
The continued growth of our shareholder payouts reflects our ongoing confidence in the company's ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding our growth and the other capital needs of our business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. This consistent record also reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our 2016 results and details on our fiscal 2017 full year and first quarter guidance."

Let's start with our fourth quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket.

Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by a combination of higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, fourth quarter operating margin increased 90 basis points to 13.6%. Cost of goods sold improved by 110 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by 65 basis points of lower distribution expenses, mainly from the timing of packaway-related costs that negatively impacted last year's fourth quarter. Merchandise margin improved by 15 basis points, while buying and occupancy costs were lower by 40 and 5 basis points, respectively. These improvements were partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in freight costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased approximately 20 basis points due mainly to higher wages.
Turning to our stock buyback program. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for a total purchase price of $170 million, which completed our previous 2-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program. For the year, we repurchased a total of 11.6 million shares for an aggregate price of $700 million.
Let's turn now to our guidance for 2017. Earnings per share for fiscal 2017 are forecast to be $3.02 to $3.15, up 7% to 11% from $2.83 in fiscal 2016. Incorporated in this guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.08 from the 53rd week in 2017 and $0.03 in lower tax rate related to our adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard. 
The operating statement assumptions for fiscal 2017 include the following. Total sales for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018 are forecast to grow 6% to 7%. Comparable store sales, on a 52-week basis ending January 27, 2018, are expected to increase 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain in 2016. We plan to add about 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. If same-store sales are in line with our guidance of up 1% to 2%, then we would project operating margin for 2017 to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.1%. This EBIT margin range assumes merchandise margin for 2017 will be relatively flat on top of strong growth over the past several years. Also incorporated in this operating margin guidance is an estimated benefit of about 15 basis points from the 53rd week. 
Net interest expense is estimated to be $13 million. Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 37% to 38%. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 386 million. Capital expenditures in 2017 are projected to be approximately $400 million. And depreciation and amortization expense, inclusive of stock-based amortization, is forecast to be about $400 million, up from $377 million in 2016.
Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. For the 13 weeks ending April 29, 2017, we are projecting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2%. Earnings per share for the period are forecast to be $0.76 to $0.79. Included in this guidance is an estimated $0.02 benefit from a lower tax rate related to the aforementioned adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard.
Other assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 23 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the quarter. First quarter operating margin is projected to be 14.7% to 14.9% compared to last year's 15.4%. The forecasted decline in EBIT is mainly due to higher wage and freight costs. In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $3.5 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 36% to 37%, resulting from the previously mentioned accounting change. And finally, weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be around 390 million.
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Again, we are very pleased with our better-than-expected financial performance for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. As previously mentioned, this is notable considering our own robust sales and earnings growth over the past several years and the ongoing competitive retail climate. As we look ahead to 2017, there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty in the political, macroeconomic and retail climates. In addition, we face tough prior year sales and earnings comparisons. As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to remain somewhat cautious in planning our business for the coming year.
Nevertheless, we are confident that the off-price sector will remain a strong-performing segment of retail, especially given consumers' continued focus on value. This, combined with our proven ability to deliver exceptional values our customers have come to expect, makes us optimistic about our prospects for future growth. As a result, over the longer term, we continue to believe we can achieve average annual earnings per share gain in the low double-digit percentage range.

We've got the department stores who seem to be focused on lowering markdown levels in their stores and are certainly buying inventories lighter. We did hear from a big competitor, Target, today talking about getting much more aggressive on pricing, I think, including categories where you guys would overlap. So how do you think about your competitive positioning here? And how are you thinking about relative pricing spread strategy in the near term given some diverging strategies in the marketplace right now?"

So that is part of their ongoing job, the way they do it in the fourth quarter. We've been in this promotional -- highly promotional environment for an extended period of time, so Target is kind of an addition into the picture. But that is what we do every day for a living. And so going in with a conservative sales plan gives us the ability to chase back. And when we're chasing back, we're chasing back at values that we know are competitive to the outside world."

If we see that those brands do what they're planning and start reducing the inventories that they bring into the country, how do you think about -- obviously, in the near term, you'll always say there's good supply in the channel.

Let me -- so first, on the short term, in terms of as people tighten up on their supply, whether it's the vendors or in department stores, supply comes from struggle with full-line retailers forecasting their sales. So in the shorter term, that's where a lot of goods come from store closures, Penney's closed stores, [indiscernible] closed stores. So in the short term, that's where the supply comes from. In the longer term, as we think about supply, we speculate about everything that could happen with a lot of changes that are going on out there. We're always studying the retail landscape and how that might change, and we're looking at that constantly. We don't see near-term supply issues in the next 2 to 3 years. So that's kind of how we're looking at supply at this moment in time. And over time, we may need to be more creative in terms of supply, but that's how we look at it today."

We will begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As mentioned in our press release, we achieved respectable growth in both sales and earnings during the first quarter despite the uncertainty and volatility in the external environment. Earnings per share for the period were $0.82, up from $0.73 in the prior year. Net earnings were $321 million, up from $291 million last year. First quarter sales increased 7% to $3.3 billion with comparable store sales up 3%. 
Sales gains at Ross were broad-based across most merchandise categories and geographic regions. First quarter operating margin of 15.2% exceeded our expectations due to above planned sales and merchandise margins. 
As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 6% versus the prior year with average in-store inventory down slightly. 
Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46%, similar to last year. 
Despite challenging multi-year comparison, dd's DISCOUNTS also saw continued solid growth in same-store sales and operating profits in the first quarter. 
Our store expansion program remains on track with the addition of 23 new Ross and five dd's DISCOUNTS stores in the first quarter. We are planning a total of 90 new locations in 2017, comprised of approximately 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS.  As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores during the year. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Our 3% comparable store sales gain was driven by higher traffic as well as an increase in the size of the average basket. While first quarter operating margin of 15.2% decreased relative to last year's 15.4%, it exceeded our expectations. 
Cost of goods sold was flat for the quarter. Merchandise margins improved by 15 basis points while distribution and occupancy costs declined by 15 and 5 basis points, respectively.  These improvements were offset by a 35 basis point increase in freight expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 20 basis points mainly due to higher wages. 
Earnings per share for the quarter also benefited by $0.01 due to favorable expense timing that is expected to reverse in subsequent quarters. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million shares for a total of $215 million. We remain on track to buy back as planned a total of $875 million in stock for the year under the new 2-year, $1.75 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in February of this year. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the second quarter ending July 29, 2017, we are forecasting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76 compared to $0.71 last year. 
Our guidance for the second quarter is based on the following assumptions. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 28 new stores during the period, including 21 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. 
Second quarter operating margin is projected to be 13.9% to 14.1%, down slightly from last year's 14.4%, reflecting our forecast for higher freight costs and wage costs. 
In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 37% to 38% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 387 million. 
Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018 to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.17 compared to $2.83 last year. As a reminder, our forecasted EPS for 2017 includes an approximate benefit of $0.08 per share from the 53rd week. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Looking ahead, we have plenty of liquidity and are open-to-buy to take advantage of the terrific opportunities in the marketplace and offer shoppers the best bargains possible. That said, we also face our own increasingly difficult prior year comparisons, along with political macroeconomic and retail climate that are likely to remain uncertain. So while we hope to do better, we are maintaining a somewhat cautious outlook for the balance of the year. 
Over the longer term, we are confident the off-price sector will remain a strong performing segment of retail as consumers continue to seek value. 
In addition, we believe our operating strategies and ongoing investments in people, processes and systems should enable us to drive respectable growth in both sales and earnings in 2017 and beyond.

We will begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As mentioned in our press release, we achieved respectable growth in both sales and earnings during the first quarter, despite the uncertainty and volatility in the external environment. Earnings per share for the period were $0.82, up from $0.73 in the prior year. Net earnings were $321 million, up from $291 million last year. First quarter sales increased 7% to $3.3 billion with comparable store sales up 3%. 
Sales gains at Ross were broad-based across most merchandise categories and geographic region. First quarter operating margin of 15.2% exceeded our expectations due to above planned sales and merchandise margins. As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 6% versus the prior year with average in-store inventory down slightly. packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46%, similar to last year. Despite challenging multi-year comparison, dd's DISCOUNTS also saw continued solid growth in same-store sales and operating profits in the first quarter. 
Our store expansion program remains on track with the addition of 23 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS stores in the first quarter. We are planning a total of 90 new locations in 2017, comprised of approximately 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS.  As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores during the year. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Our 3% comparable store sales gain was driven by higher traffic as well as an increase in the size of the average basket. While first quarter operating margin of 15.2% decreased relative to last year's 15.4%, it exceeded our expectations. 
Cost of goods sold was flat for the quarter. Merchandise margins improved by 15 basis points while distribution and occupancy costs declined by 15 and 5 basis points, respectively.  These improvements were offset by a 35 basis point increase in freight expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 20 basis points mainly due to higher wages. Earnings per share for the quarter also benefited by $0.01 due to favorable expense timing that is expected to reverse in subsequent quarters.  
During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million shares for a total of $215 million. We remain on track to buy back as planned a total of $875 million in stock for the year under the new 2-year $1.75 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in February of this year. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the second quarter ending July 29, 2017, we are forecasting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76 compared to $0.71 last year. 
Our guidance for the second quarter is based on the following assumptions. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 28 new stores during the period, including 21 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Second quarter operating margin is projected to be 13.9% to 14.1%, down slightly from last year's 14.4%, reflecting our forecast for higher freight costs and wage costs. 
In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 37% to 38% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 387 million. 
Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018, to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.17 compared to $2.83 last year. As a reminder, our forecasted EPS for 2017 includes an approximate benefit of $0.08 per share from the 53rd week. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

So while we hope to do better, we are maintaining a somewhat cautious outlook for the balance of the year. 
Over the longer term, we are confident the off-price sector will remain a strong performing segment of retail as consumers continue to seek value. In addition, we believe our operating strategies and ongoing investments in people, processes and systems should enable us to drive respectable growth in both sales and earnings in 2017 and beyond.

So this is a question we've actually been working on for some time. And we've been using the extra space that we've created, if you like, in stores to really look at 3 things. One is make the stores easier to shop just by organizing the store in an easier to shop way. Secondly, expanding into faster growing or new categories. And then thirdly, when it comes to new stores, be more flexible in terms of the store size, the new store openings. So I would say, we're actually pursuing a mix of all 3 in terms of, as you say, optimizing how we're using the space."

We will begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.  As mentioned in our press release, we achieved respectable growth in both sales and earnings during the first quarter, despite the uncertainty and volatility in the external environment. Earnings per share for the period were $0.82, up from $0.73 in the prior year. Net earnings were $321 million, up from $291 million last year. First quarter sales increased 7% to $3.3 billion with comparable store sales up 3%. 
Sales gains at Ross were broad-based across most merchandise categories and geographic region. First quarter operating margin of 15.2% exceeded our expectations due to above planned sales and merchandise margins. As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 6% versus the prior year with average in-store inventory down slightly. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46%, similar to last year. Despite challenging multi-year comparison, dd's DISCOUNTS also saw continued solid growth in same-store sales and operating profits in the first quarter.  Our store expansion program remains on track with the addition of 23 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS stores in the first quarter. We are planning a total of 90 new locations in 2017, comprised of approximately 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS.  As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores during the year. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Our 3% comparable store sales gain was driven by higher traffic as well as an increase in the size of the average basket. While first quarter operating margin of 15.2% decreased relative to last year's 15.4%, it exceeded our expectations. 
Cost of goods sold was flat for the quarter. Merchandise margins improved by 15 basis points while distribution and occupancy costs declined by 15 and 5 basis points, respectively.  These improvements were offset by a 35 basis point increase in freight expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 20 basis points mainly due to higher wages. Earnings per share for the quarter also benefited by $0.01 due to favorable expense timing that is expected to reverse in subsequent quarters.   During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million shares for a total of $215 million. We remain on track to buy back as planned a total of $875 million in stock for the year under the new 2-year $1.75 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in February of this year. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the second quarter ending July 29, 2017, we are forecasting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76 compared to $0.71 last year.  Our guidance for the second quarter is based on the following assumptions. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 28 new stores during the period, including 21 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Second quarter operating margin is projected to be 13.9% to 14.1%, down slightly from last year's 14.4%, reflecting our forecast for higher freight costs and wage costs. 
In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 37% to 38% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 387 million.  Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018, to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.17 compared to $2.83 last year. As a reminder, our forecasted EPS for 2017 includes an approximate benefit of $0.08 per share from the 53rd week. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

So while we hope to do better, we are maintaining a somewhat cautious outlook for the balance of the year.  Over the longer term, we are confident the off-price sector will remain a strong performing segment of retail as consumers continue to seek value. In addition, we believe our operating strategies and ongoing investments in people, processes and systems should enable us to drive respectable growth in both sales and earnings in 2017 and beyond.

We will begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.  As mentioned in our press release, we achieved respectable growth in both sales and earnings during the first quarter, despite the uncertainty and volatility in the external environment. Earnings per share for the period were $0.82, up from $0.73 in the prior year. Net earnings were $321 million, up from $291 million last year. First quarter sales increased 7% to $3.3 billion with comparable store sales up 3%. 
Sales gains at Ross were broad-based across most merchandise categories and geographic region. First quarter operating margin of 15.2% exceeded our expectations due to above planned sales and merchandise margins. As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 6% versus the prior year with average in-store inventory down slightly. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46%, similar to last year. Despite challenging multi-year comparison, dd's DISCOUNTS also saw continued solid growth in same-store sales and operating profits in the first quarter.  Our store expansion program remains on track with the addition of 23 new Ross and 5 dd's DISCOUNTS stores in the first quarter. We are planning a total of 90 new locations in 2017, comprised of approximately 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS.  As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores during the year. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance."

Our 3% comparable store sales gain was driven by higher traffic as well as an increase in the size of the average basket. While first quarter operating margin of 15.2% decreased relative to last year's 15.4%, it exceeded our expectations. 
Cost of goods sold was flat for the quarter. Merchandise margins improved by 15 basis points while distribution and occupancy costs declined by 15 and 5 basis points, respectively.  These improvements were offset by a 35 basis point increase in freight expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period increased by 20 basis points mainly due to higher wages. Earnings per share for the quarter also benefited by $0.01 due to favorable expense timing that is expected to reverse in subsequent quarters.   During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million shares for a total of $215 million. We remain on track to buy back as planned a total of $875 million in stock for the year under the new 2-year $1.75 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in February of this year. 
Let's turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the second quarter ending July 29, 2017, we are forecasting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76 compared to $0.71 last year.  Our guidance for the second quarter is based on the following assumptions. Total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 28 new stores during the period, including 21 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Second quarter operating margin is projected to be 13.9% to 14.1%, down slightly from last year's 14.4%, reflecting our forecast for higher freight costs and wage costs. 
In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 37% to 38% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 387 million.  Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018, to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.17 compared to $2.83 last year. As a reminder, our forecasted EPS for 2017 includes an approximate benefit of $0.08 per share from the 53rd week. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

So while we hope to do better, we are maintaining a somewhat cautious outlook for the balance of the year.  Over the longer term, we are confident the off-price sector will remain a strong performing segment of retail as consumers continue to seek value. In addition, we believe our operating strategies and ongoing investments in people, processes and systems should enable us to drive respectable growth in both sales and earnings in 2017 and beyond.

We will begin our call today with a review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with the better-than-expected growth we delivered in both sales and earnings in the second quarter, especially given our challenging multi-year comparisons in today's volatile retail climate. 
Earnings per share for the period were $0.82, up 15% on top of a 30% increase last year. Net earnings for the second quarter grew to $317 million compared to $282 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 8% to $3,432,000,000 with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in the prior year. 
Operating margin of 14.9% for the quarter outperformed our projections mainly due to a combination of higher merchandise margins and leverage on our above planned sales. 
For the first 6 months of fiscal 2017, earnings per share were $1.64, up 14% on top of a 9% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $638 million, up from $573 million in last year's gross path. 
Sales year-to-date rose 7% to $6.738 billion with comparable store sales up 4% versus a 3% gain in the same period last year. 
Sales trends during the quarter were broad-based across all major geographic regions in merchandise category. 
The Midwest and Southeast were the strongest regions while shoes was the best performing merchandise category at Ross. dd's DISCOUNTS also posted strong better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profits for the quarter. 
As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 3% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories up slightly. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 47% at this time last year. 
Turning to expansion programs. We opened 21 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the second quarter. For the 2017 fiscal year, we continue to plan for a total of about 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS location. As usual these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate a handful of stores. 
Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance."

Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. 
As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin outperformed our projections, increasing 50 basis points to 14.9% compared to 14.4% last year. Cost of goods sold for the second quarter improved 25 basis points, driven by a better than expected 35 basis point increase in merchandise margin, 20 basis points in lower occupancy costs and distribution expenses that were lower by 10 basis points. These gains were partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in freight costs, along with 15 basis points of higher buying costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period were lower by 25 basis points. This improvement includes a nonrecurring benefit of approximately 20 basis points from legal-related costs. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $215 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $430 million. 
As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $875 million in stock for the year under the 2-year $1.75 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February of this year. 
Let's turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 28, 2017, same-store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a robust 7% gain last year with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.67 versus $0.62 in last year's third quarter. 
For the fourth quarter ending February 3, 2018, we are also planning same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a solid 4% gain last year with earnings per share projected to be $0.88 to $0.92 compared to $0.77 last year. This includes an approximate benefit of $0.08 due to the 53rd week. 
Now I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for the third quarter EPS guidance. Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%. We're planning to add 30 new Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. 
Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 12.4% to 12.6% versus 12.6% in the prior year. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $2.5 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 37% to 38%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 384 million. 
As noted in today's press release, based on our results for the first 6 months as well as our second half forecast, we now are projecting earnings per share for the full year on a 53-week basis to increase 12% to 14% to $3.16 to $3.23 on top of a 13% gain in fiscal 2016. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Looking ahead to the second half, we realize that we face our most challenging prior year comparisons in a volatile retail backdrop. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a somewhat cautious outlook for the balance of this year, which is reflected in our guidance. 
Nevertheless, over the longer term, we are very confident in our ability to offer customers outstanding value throughout our stores. This will always be our top priority as it has proven to be the most crucial driver in consistently delivering solid results in both sales and earnings.

Second question would be may be from a store growth runway and returns you're seeing on the new stores, at what point would you guys consider a new concept like Home, which seem to something people are moving into? And then thirdly, on freight contracts, Mike, just curious, what's the length of the contracts and how's your best viewpoint going into next year?"

Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations.
We will begin our call today with a review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with the better-than-expected growth we delivered in both sales and earnings in the second quarter, especially given our challenging multiyear comparisons and today's volatile retail climate. Earnings per share for the period were $0.82, up 15% on top of a 13% increase last year. Net earnings for the second quarter grew to $317 million compared to $282 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 8% to $3,432,000,000 with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in the prior year. Operating margin of 14.9% for the quarter outperformed our projections mainly due to a combination of higher merchandise margins and leverage on our above-planned sales.
For the first 6 months of fiscal 2017, earnings per share were $1.64, up 14% on top of a 9% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $638 million, up from $573 million in last year's growth path. Sales year-to-date rose 7% to $6.738 billion with comparable store sales up 4% versus a 3% gain in the same period last year. 
Sales trends during the quarter were broad-based across all major geographic regions and merchandise category. The midwest and southeast were the strongest regions while shoes was the best performing merchandise category at Ross. dd's DISCOUNTS also posted strong better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profits for the quarter.
As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 3% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories up slightly. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 47% at this time last year.
Turning to expansion programs. We opened 21 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the second quarter. For the 2017 fiscal year, we continue to plan for a total of about 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate a handful of stores.
Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance."

Let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin outperformed our projections, increasing 50 basis points to 14.9% compared to 14.4% last year.
Cost of goods sold for the second quarter improved 25 basis points driven by a better-than-expected 35 basis point increase in merchandise margin, 20 basis points in lower occupancy costs and distribution expenses that were lower by 10 basis points. These gains were partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in freight costs, along with 15 basis points of higher buying costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period were lower by 25 basis points. This improvement includes a nonrecurring benefit of approximately 20 basis points from legal-related costs.
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $215 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $430 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $875 million in stock for the year under the 2-year $1.75 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February of this year.
Let's turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 28, 2017, same-store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a robust 7% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.67 versus $0.62 in last year's third quarter.
For the fourth quarter ending February 3, 2018, we are also planning same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a solid 4% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.88 to $0.92 compared to $0.77 last year. This includes an approximate benefit of $0.08 due to the 53rd week.
Now, I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for the third quarter EPS target. Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%. We're planning to add 30 new Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 12.4% to 12.6% versus 12.6% in the prior year. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $2.5 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 37% to 38%. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 384 million. As noted in today's press release, based on our results for the first 6 months as well as our second half forecast, we now are projecting earnings per share for the full year on a 53-week basis to increase 12% to 14% to $3.16 to $3.23 on top of a 13% gain in fiscal 2016.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Once again, we are pleased with the better-than-expected sales and earnings gains we delivered for both the second quarter and the first half of the year. These results were driven by our ongoing ability to offer compelling bargains to today's value-oriented consumer.
Looking ahead to the second half, we realize that we face our most challenging prior year comparisons and a volatile retail backdrop. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a somewhat cautious outlook for the balance of this year, which is reflected in our guidance.
Nevertheless, over the longer-term, we are very confident in our ability to offer customers outstanding value throughout our stores. This will always be our top priority as it has proven to be the most crucial driver in consistently delivering solid results in both sales and earnings.

We will begin our call today with a review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with the better-than-expected growth we delivered in both sales and earnings in the second quarter, especially given our challenging multiyear comparison and today's volatile retail climate. Earnings per share for the period were $0.82, up 15% on top of a 13% increase last year. Net earnings for the second quarter grew to $317 million compared to $282 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 8% to $3,432,000,000 with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in the prior year. Operating margin of 14.9% for the quarter outperformed our projections mainly due to a combination of higher merchandise margin and leverage on our above-plan sales.
For the first 6 months of fiscal 2017, earnings per share were $1.64, up 14% on top of a 9% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $638 million, up from $573 million in last year's first half. Sales year-to-date rose 7% to $6,738,000,000 with comparable store sales up 4% versus a 3% gain in the same period last year. 
Sales trends during the quarter were broad-based across all major geographic regions and merchandise category. The Midwest and Southeast were the strongest regions while shoes was the best performing merchandise category at Ross. dd's DISCOUNTS also posted strong better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profits for the quarter.
As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 3% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories up slightly. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 47% at this time last year.
Turning to expansion programs. We opened 21 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the second quarter. For the 2017 fiscal year, we continue to plan for a total of about 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate a handful of stores.
Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance."

As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin outperformed our project",481,"Thank you, Barbara.
Let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin outperformed our projections, increasing 50 basis points to 14.9% compared to 14.4% last year.
Cost of goods sold for the second quarter improved 25 basis points driven by a better-than-expected 35 basis point increase in merchandise margin, 20 basis points in lower occupancy costs and distribution expenses that were lower by 10 basis points. These gains were partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in freight costs, along with 15 basis points of higher buying costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period were lower by 25 basis points. This improvement includes a nonrecurring benefit of approximately 20 basis points from legal-related costs.
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $215 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $430 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $875 million in stock for the year under the 2-year $1.75 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February of this year.
Let's turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 28, 2017, same-store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a robust 7% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.67 versus $0.62 in last year's third quarter.
For the fourth quarter ending February 3, 2018, we are also planning same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a solid 4% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.88 to $0.92 compared to $0.77 last year. This includes an approximate benefit of $0.08 due to the 53rd week.
Now, I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for the third quarter EPS target. Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%. We're planning to add 30 new Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 12.4% to 12.6% versus 12.6% in the prior year. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $2.5 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 37% to 38%. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 384 million. As noted in today's press release, based on our results for the first 6 months as well as our second half forecast, we now are projecting earnings per share for the full year on a 53-week basis to increase 12% to 14% to $3.16 to $3.23 on top of a 13% gain in fiscal 2016.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Once again, we are pleased with the better-than-expected sales and earnings gains we delivered for both the second quarter and the first half of the year. These results were driven by our ongoing ability to offer compelling bargains to today's value-oriented consumer.
Looking ahead to the second half, we realize that we face our most challenging prior year comparison and a volatile retail backdrop. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a somewhat cautious outlook for the balance of this year, which is reflected in our guidance.
Nevertheless, over the longer-term, we are very confident in our ability to offer customers outstanding value throughout our stores. This will always be our top priority as it has proven to be the most crucial driver in consistently delivering solid results in both sales and earnings.

We will begin our call today with a review of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with the better-than-expected growth we delivered in both sales and earnings in the second quarter, especially given our challenging multiyear comparison and today's volatile retail climate. Earnings per share for the period were $0.82, up 15% on top of a 13% increase last year. Net earnings for the second quarter grew to $317 million compared to $282 million for the same period last year. Sales rose 8% to $3,432,000,000 with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a 4% gain in the prior year. Operating margin of 14.9% for the quarter outperformed our projections mainly due to a combination of higher merchandise margin and leverage on our above-plan sales.
For the first 6 months of fiscal 2017, earnings per share were $1.64, up 14% on top of a 9% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $638 million, up from $573 million in last year's first half. Sales year-to-date rose 7% to $6,738,000,000 with comparable store sales up 4% versus a 3% gain in the same period last year. 
Sales trends during the quarter were broad-based across all major geographic regions and merchandise category. The Midwest and Southeast were the strongest regions while shoes was the best performing merchandise category at Ross. dd's DISCOUNTS also posted strong better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profits for the quarter.
As we ended the second quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 3% compared to the prior year, with average in-store inventories up slightly. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 47% at this time last year.
Turning to expansion programs. We opened 21 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the second quarter. For the 2017 fiscal year, we continue to plan for a total of about 70 new Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate a handful of stores.
Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our second quarter results and details on our second half guidance."

Let's start with our second quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As mentioned earlier, second quarter operating margin outperformed our projections, increasing 50 basis points to 14.9% compared to 14.4% last year.
Cost of goods sold for the second quarter improved 25 basis points driven by a better-than-expected 35 basis point increase in merchandise margin, 20 basis points in lower occupancy costs and distribution expenses that were lower by 10 basis points. These gains were partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in freight costs, along with 15 basis points of higher buying costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period were lower by 25 basis points. This improvement includes a nonrecurring benefit of approximately 20 basis points from legal-related costs.
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $215 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 6.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $430 million. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $875 million in stock for the year under the 2-year $1.75 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February of this year.
Let's turn now to our second half guidance. For the third quarter ending October 28, 2017, same-store sales are forecast to increase 1% to 2% on top of a robust 7% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.67 versus $0.62 in last year's third quarter.
For the fourth quarter ending February 3, 2018, we are also planning same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a solid 4% gain last year, with earnings per share projected to be $0.88 to $0.92 compared to $0.77 last year. This includes an approximate benefit of $0.08 due to the 53rd week.
Now, I'll provide some additional operating statement assumptions for the third quarter EPS target. Total sales are projected to grow 4% to 5%. We're planning to add 30 new Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 12.4% to 12.6% versus 12.6% in the prior year. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $2.5 million. Our tax rate is planned at approximately 37% to 38%. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 384 million. As noted in today's press release, based on our results for the first 6 months as well as our second half forecast, we now are projecting earnings per share for the full year on a 53-week basis to increase 12% to 14% to $3.16 to $3.23 on top of a 13% gain in fiscal 2016.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Once again, we are pleased with the better-than-expected sales and earnings gains we delivered for both the second quarter and the first half of the year. These results were driven by our ongoing ability to offer compelling bargains to today's value-oriented consumer.
Looking ahead to the second half, we realize that we face our most challenging prior year comparison and a volatile retail backdrop. So while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a somewhat cautious outlook for the balance of this year, which is reflected in our guidance.
Nevertheless, over the longer term, we are very confident in our ability to offer customers outstanding value throughout our stores. This will always be our top priority as it has proven to be the most crucial driver in consistently delivering solid results in both sales and earnings.
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have."

We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, our third quarter sales and earnings outperformed our expectations despite being up against our toughest prior year comparison and 2 major hurricanes during the quarter. 
We are pleased with these results, which reflect our continued market share gains in a challenging retail environment. Earnings per share for the period were $0.72, up 16% from last year. These results include an approximate $0.01 benefit from favorable expense timing that's expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Net earnings grew to $274 million compared to $204 million in the prior year. Sales for the third quarter rose 8% to $3.3 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a robust 7% gains last year. 
Operating margin of 13.3% was better than expected mainly due to a combination of higher merchandise margins and leverage on above-plan sales. 
For the first 9 months of fiscal 2017, earnings per share were $2.36, up 15% on top of an 11% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $912 million, up from $817 million last year. Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $10.1 billion, with comparable store sales up 4% versus a 4% gain in the same period last year. 
By region, transfer fairly broad-based, with the Midwest performing the strongest during the period. We estimate that the hurricanes in Texas and Florida had a minimal impact for the quarter as sales rebounded significantly following the storms. 
By merchandise category, children's was the best-performing area, benefiting from solid execution of our merchandising strategies. 
Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS continue to post better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profit for the third quarter. As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 4%, with average in-store inventories flat compared to the prior year. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 45% last year. 
Turning to our expansion programs, we opened 30 new Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in third quarter, completing our 2017 store opening program. We expect to end the year with 1,408 Ross and 213 dd's DISCOUNTS stores and net increase of 88 locations for fiscal 2017. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the remainder of the year."

Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. 
As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin outperformed our projections and increased 65 basis points to 13.3%. Cost of goods sold for the quarter improved 30 basis points, driven by a 25 basis point increase in merchandise margin and occupancy and buying cost that were lower by 20 basis points each. These gains were partially offset by 30 basis point increase in freight cost, along with 5 basis points in higher distribution expenses due mainly to the timing of packaway-related costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period were lower by 35 basis points as a result of leverage on our 4% comparable store sales gain, and as we anniversary nonrecurring cost in last year's third quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $219 million. 
Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 10.5 million shares for an aggregate price of $649 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $875 million in stock for the year under the 2-year, $1.75 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February of this year. 
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. As mentioned in our press release, we are raising our sales expectations for the fourth quarter. We now forecast comparable store sales to increase 2% to 3% on top of strong [indiscernible] over the last several years. We are projecting earnings per share to remain unchanged at $0.88 to $0.92 as the benefit from higher comparable store sales is expected to be offset by the aforementioned expense timing shift from the third to the fourth quarter. 
As a reminder, our EPS guidance for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year includes an estimated benefit of $0.08 from the extra week. 
The operating statement assumptions for our fourth quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are projected to grow 11% to 12%, which includes a benefit from this year's 53rd week; operating margin is projected to be in the range of 14.0% to 14.2% versus 13.6% in the prior year; net interest expense is estimated to be about $1.5 million; our tax rate is planned at approximately 37% to 38%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 380 million. 
Based on our year-to-date results and projected fourth quarter guidance, we are now planning earnings per share for the full year on a 53-week basis to be in the range of $3.24 to $3.28. 
On a 52-week basis, this updated forecast for fiscal 2017 represents solid projected earnings per share growth of 12% to 13% on top of a 13% gain in 2016. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

While we're optimistic about our prospects for the fourth quarter, our guidance reflects an uncertain external environment and the likelihood of yet another very promotional holiday season. 
As Michael just mentioned, we also faced our own challenging multi-year comparisons. Nonetheless, we believe that off-price will remain a strong performing segment in retail, driven by consumers ongoing focus on value. 
Most importantly, we have a consistent track record of being able to deliver the compelling bargains that our customers' desire. All of this makes us confident in our ability to achieve solid growth in sales and earnings over the long term.

We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, our third quarter sales and earnings outperformed our expectations despite being up against our toughest prior year comparison and 2 major hurricanes during the quarter. We are pleased with these results, which reflect our continued market share gains in a challenging retail environment. 
Earnings per share for the period were $0.72, up 16% from last year. These results include an approximate $0.01 benefit from favorable expense timing that's expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Net earnings grew to $274 million compared to $204 million in the prior year. Sales for the third quarter rose 8% to $3.3 billion with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a robust 7% gains last year. 
Operating margin of 13.3% was better than expected, mainly due to a combination of higher merchandise margins and leverage on above-plan sales.
For the first 9 months of fiscal 2017, earnings per share were $2.36, up 15% on top of an 11% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $912 million, up from $817 million last year. Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $10.1 billion with comparable store sales up 4% versus a 4% gain in the same period last year. 
By region, trends were fairly broad-based with the Midwest performing the strongest during the period. We estimate that the hurricanes in Texas and Florida had a minimal impact for the quarter as sales rebounded significantly following the storms. 
By merchandise category, children's was the best-performing area, benefiting from solid execution of our merchandising strategies. 
Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS continued to post better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profit for the third quarter. As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 4%, with average in-store inventories flat compared to the prior year. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 45% last year. 
Turning to our expansion programs, we opened 30 new Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNT locations in third quarter, completing our 2017 store opening program. We expect to end the year with 1,408 Ross and 213 dd's DISCOUNTS stores, a net increase of 88 locations for fiscal 2017. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the remainder of the year."

Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin outperformed our projection",485,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin outperformed our projections and increased 65 basis points to 13.3%. 
Cost of goods sold for the quarter improved 30 basis points, driven by a 25 basis point increase in merchandise margin and occupancy and buying cost that were lower by 20 basis points each. These gains were partially offset by 30 basis point increase in freight cost, along with 5 basis points in higher distribution expenses due mainly to the timing of packaway-related costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period were lower by 35 basis points as a result of leverage on our 4% comparable store sales gain and as we anniversary-ed nonrecurring cost in last year's third quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $219 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 10.5 million shares for an aggregate price of $649 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $875 million in stock for the year under the 2-year, $1.75 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February of this year. 
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. As mentioned in our press release, we are raising our sales expectations for the fourth quarter. We now forecast comparable store sales to increase 2% to 3% on top of strong [Audio Gap] over the last several years. We are projecting earnings per share to remain unchanged at $0.88 to $0.92, as the benefit from higher comparable store sales is expected to be offset by the aforementioned expense timing shift from the third to the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our EPS guidance for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year includes an estimated benefit of $0.08 from the extra week. 
The operating statement assumptions for our fourth quarter guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 11% to 12%, which includes a benefit from this year's 53rd week; operating margin is projected to be in the range of 14.0% to 14.2% versus 13.6% in the prior year; net interest expense is estimated to be about $1.5 million; our tax rate is planned at approximately 37% to 38%; and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 380 million. 
Based on our year-to-date results and projected fourth quarter guidance, we are now planning earnings per share for the full year on a 53-week basis to be in the range of $3.24 to $3.28. On a 52-week basis, this updated forecast for fiscal 2017 represents solid projected earnings per share growth of 12% to 13% on top of a 13% gain in 2016. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Again, we are pleased with the better-than-expected results we achieved in the third quarter despite facing our toughest prior year comparisons and 2 major hurricanes. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by our above-plan sales and earnings year-to-date. In addition, our merchants have done an excellent job of acquiring exciting assortment of sharply priced name-brand fashions and guests to appeal to today's holiday shoppers. While we're optimistic about our prospects for the fourth quarter, our guidance reflects an uncertain external environment and the likelihood of yet another very promotional holiday season. As Michael just mentioned, we also faced our own challenging multiyear comparisons. Nonetheless, we believe that off-price will remain a strong performing segment in retail, driven by consumers' ongoing focus on value. 
Most importantly, we have a consistent track record of being able to deliver the compelling bargains that our customers desire. All of this makes us confident in our ability to achieve solid growth in sales and earnings over the long term. 
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."

I would say that they aren't really any strong, strong fashion trends out there. I mean, there's some smaller trends, but something that would be -- would change the course of what you were doing going from a skinny jeans to a wide-legged pants. There's no major fashion trend. So I think that's part of the issue as you go through, particularly in Ladies Apparel is that there aren't any real drivers out there. The trends that are out there, however, we have in our assortment. And because we've been able to execute at such a high level and have liquidity, we've been able to chase availability and get in-season goods. And so we feel pretty good about our assortment as we enter into the fourth quarter, but I actually think a big part of the fashion quotient in the Ladies business is the lack of fashion to be honest."

We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, our third quarter sales and earnings outperformed our expectations despite being up against our toughest prior year comparison and 2 major hurricanes during the quarter. We are pleased with these results, which reflect our continued market share gains in a challenging retail environment. 
Earnings per share for the period were $0.72, up 16% from last year. These results include an approximate $0.01 benefit from favorable expense timing that's expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Net earnings grew to $274 million compared to $204 million in the prior year. Sales for the third quarter rose 8% to $3.3 billion with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a robust 7% gains last year. 
Operating margin of 13.3% was better than expected, mainly due to a combination of higher merchandise margins and leverage on above-plan sales.
For the first 9 months of fiscal 2017, earnings per share were $2.36, up 15% on top of an 11% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $912 million, up from $817 million last year. Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $10.1 billion with comparable store sales up 4% versus a 4% gain in the same period last year. 
By region, trends were fairly broad-based with the Midwest performing the strongest during the period. We estimate that the hurricanes in Texas and Florida had a minimal impact for the quarter as sales rebounded significantly following the storms. 
By merchandise category, children's was the best-performing area, benefiting from solid execution of our merchandising strategies. 
Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS continued to post better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profit for the third quarter. As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 4%, with average in-store inventories flat compared to the prior year. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 45% last year. 
Turning to our expansion programs, we opened 30 new Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNT locations in third quarter, completing our 2017 store opening program. We expect to end the year with 1,408 Ross and 213 dd's DISCOUNTS stores, a net increase of 88 locations for fiscal 2017. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the remainder of the year."

Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin outperformed our projection",485,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin outperformed our projections and increased 65 basis points to 13.3%. 
Cost of goods sold for the quarter improved 30 basis points, driven by a 25 basis point increase in merchandise margin and occupancy and buying costs that were lower by 20 basis points each. These gains were partially offset by 30 basis point increase in freight cost, along with 5 basis points in higher distribution expenses due mainly to the timing of packaway-related costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period were lower by 35 basis points as a result of leverage on our 4% comparable store sales gain and as we anniversaried nonrecurring cost in last year's third quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $219 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 10.5 million shares for an aggregate price of $649 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $875 million in stock for the year under the 2-year, $1.75 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February of this year. 
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. As mentioned in our press release, we are raising our sales expectations for the fourth quarter. We now forecast comparable store sales to increase 2% to 3% on top of strong [Audio Gap] over the last several years. We are projecting earnings per share to remain unchanged at $0.88 to $0.92, as the benefit from higher comparable store sales is expected to be offset by the aforementioned expense timing shift from the third to the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our EPS guidance for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year includes an estimated benefit of $0.08 from the extra week. 
The operating statement assumptions for our fourth quarter guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 11% to 12%, which includes a benefit from this year's 53rd week; operating margin is projected to be in the range of 14.0% to 14.2% versus 13.6% in the prior year; net interest expense is estimated to be about $1.5 million; our tax rate is planned at approximately 37% to 38%; and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 380 million. 
Based on our year-to-date results and projected fourth quarter guidance, we are now planning earnings per share for the full year on a 53-week basis to be in the range of $3.24 to $3.28. On a 52-week basis, this updated forecast for fiscal 2017 represents solid projected earnings per share growth of 12% to 13% on top of a 13% gain in 2016. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Again, we are pleased with the better-than-expected results we achieved in the third quarter despite facing our toughest prior year comparisons and 2 major hurricanes. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by our above-plan sales and earnings year-to-date. In addition, our merchants have done an excellent job of acquiring exciting assortment of sharply priced name-brand fashions and guests to appeal to today's holiday shoppers. While we're optimistic about our prospects for the fourth quarter, our guidance reflects an uncertain external environment and the likelihood of yet another very promotional holiday season. As Michael just mentioned, we also faced our own challenging multiyear comparisons. Nonetheless, we believe that off-price will remain a strong performing segment in retail, driven by consumers' ongoing focus on value. 
Most importantly, we have a consistent track record of being able to deliver the compelling bargains that our customers desire. All of this makes us confident in our ability to achieve solid growth in sales and earnings over the long term. 
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."

I would say that there weren't really any strong, strong fashion trends out there. I mean, there's some smaller trends, but something that would be -- would change the course of what you were doing going from a skinny jeans to a wide-legged pant. There's no major fashion trend. So I think that's part of the issue as you go through, particularly in Ladies Apparel is that there aren't any real drivers out there. The trends that are out there, however, we have in our assortment. And because we've been able to execute at such a high level and have liquidity, we've been able to chase availability and get in-season goods. And so we feel pretty good about our assortments as we enter into the fourth quarter, but I actually think a big part of the fashion quotient in the Ladies business is the lack of fashion to be honest."

We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter and year-to-date performance, followed by our outlook for the remainder of the year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. 
As noted in today's press release, our third quarter sales and earnings outperformed our expectations despite being up against our toughest prior year comparison and 2 major hurricanes during the quarter. We are pleased with these results, which reflect our continued market share gains in a challenging retail environment. 
Earnings per share for the period were $0.72, up 16% from last year. These results include an approximate $0.01 benefit from favorable expense timing that's expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. 
Net earnings grew to $274 million compared to $204 million in the prior year. Sales for the third quarter rose 8% to $3.3 billion with comparable store sales up 4% on top of a robust 7% gains last year. 
Operating margin of 13.3% was better than expected, mainly due to a combination of higher merchandise margins and leverage on above-plan sales.
For the first 9 months of fiscal 2017, earnings per share were $2.36, up 15% on top of an 11% increase in the prior year. Net earnings were $912 million, up from $817 million last year. Sales year-to-date rose 8% to $10.1 billion with comparable store sales up 4% versus a 4% gain in the same period last year. 
By region, trends were fairly broad-based with the Midwest performing the strongest during the period. We estimate that the hurricanes in Texas and Florida had a minimal impact for the quarter as sales rebounded significantly following the storms. 
By merchandise category, children's was the best-performing area, benefiting from solid execution of our merchandising strategies. 
Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS continued to post better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profit for the third quarter. As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 4%, with average in-store inventories flat compared to the prior year. Packaway as a percent of total inventories was 46% compared to 45% last year. 
Turning to our expansion programs, we opened 30 new Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNT locations in third quarter, completing our 2017 store opening program. We expect to end the year with 1,408 Ross and 213 dd's DISCOUNTS stores, a net increase of 88 locations for fiscal 2017. 
Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the remainder of the year."

Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin outperformed our projection",485,"Thank you, Barbara. Let's start with our third quarter results. Our 4% comparable store sales gain was driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. As Barbara mentioned, third quarter operating margin outperformed our projections and increased 65 basis points to 13.3%. 
Cost of goods sold for the quarter improved 30 basis points, driven by a 25 basis point increase in merchandise margin and occupancy and buying costs that were lower by 20 basis points each. These gains were partially offset by 30 basis point increase in freight cost, along with 5 basis points in higher distribution expenses due mainly to the timing of packaway-related costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the period were lower by 35 basis points as a result of leverage on our 4% comparable store sales gain and as we anniversaried nonrecurring cost in last year's third quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $219 million. Year-to-date, we have bought back a total of 10.5 million shares for an aggregate price of $649 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $875 million in stock for the year under the 2-year, $1.75 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February of this year. 
Let's turn now to our fourth quarter outlook. As mentioned in our press release, we are raising our sales expectations for the fourth quarter. We now forecast comparable store sales to increase 2% to 3% on top of strong [Audio Gap] over the last several years. We are projecting earnings per share to remain unchanged at $0.88 to $0.92, as the benefit from higher comparable store sales is expected to be offset by the aforementioned expense timing shift from the third to the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our EPS guidance for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year includes an estimated benefit of $0.08 from the extra week. 
The operating statement assumptions for our fourth quarter guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 11% to 12%, which includes a benefit from this year's 53rd week; operating margin is projected to be in the range of 14.0% to 14.2% versus 13.6% in the prior year; net interest expense is estimated to be about $1.5 million; our tax rate is planned at approximately 37% to 38%; and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 380 million. 
Based on our year-to-date results and projected fourth quarter guidance, we are now planning earnings per share for the full year on a 53-week basis to be in the range of $3.24 to $3.28. On a 52-week basis, this updated forecast for fiscal 2017 represents solid projected earnings per share growth of 12% to 13% on top of a 13% gain in 2016. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments."

Again, we are pleased with the better-than-expected results we achieved in the third quarter despite facing our toughest prior year comparisons and 2 major hurricanes. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by our above-plan sales and earnings year-to-date. In addition, our merchants have done an excellent job of acquiring exciting assortment of sharply priced name-brand fashions and guests to appeal to today's holiday shoppers. While we're optimistic about our prospects for the fourth quarter, our guidance reflects an uncertain external environment and the likelihood of yet another very promotional holiday season. As Michael just mentioned, we also faced our own challenging multiyear comparisons. Nonetheless, we believe that off-price will remain a strong performing segment in retail, driven by consumers' ongoing focus on value. 
Most importantly, we have a consistent track record of being able to deliver the compelling bargains that our customers desire. All of this makes us confident in our ability to achieve solid growth in sales and earnings over the long term. 
At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have."

I would say that there weren't really any strong, strong fashion trends out there. I mean, there's some smaller trends, but something that would be -- would change the course of what you were doing going from a skinny jeans to a wide-legged pant. There's no major fashion trend. So I think that's part of the issue as you go through, particularly in Ladies Apparel is that there aren't any real drivers out there. The trends that are out there, however, we have in our assortment. And because we've been able to execute at such a high level and have liquidity, we've been able to chase availability and get in-season goods. And so we feel pretty good about our assortments as we enter into the fourth quarter, but I actually think a big part of the fashion quotient in the Ladies business is the lack of fashion to be honest."

Again, I used California as an example. We've been in there for 30 years.

This year, it's strictly a function of how we're executing the business in open-to-buy. We go into the year with a 1 to 2 comp. We plan inventories at that level. If we can exceed that comp, you're able to chase the business and you turn faster. So this year is really a function of how we manage the business, and I think that's going to be the opportunity going forward as well in terms of when we look into next year and beyond."
