I'd like to open by congratulating Phebe on welcoming her first grandchild into the world just yesterday. Mother, son and grandmother are all doing well. Phebe is with the newest addition to our family right now, but she left us well prepared to report our results on this call. 
I'd also like to welcome Kim Kuryea, our Vice President and Controller, to the call and thank her for joining me today. 
Congratulations, Phebe. Welcome, Kim. Now let's get started. 
Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.62 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.23 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $807 million.
The results for the quarter beat analyst consensus by $0.08, mostly on a lower-than-anticipated tax provision. 
Revenue and operating earnings are up significantly against the year ago quarter by 5.4% and 7.8%, respectively.
Earnings from continuing operations are also up $43 million on the strength of a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin, offset in part by a lower effective tax rate in the year ago quarter. Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.22 or 9.2%.
So in summary, against the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue is up 5.4%, operating earnings are up 7.8%, earnings from continuing operations are up 5.6% and fully diluted earnings per share are up 9.2%.
Sequentially, the story is just as wholesome. Revenue is up $502 million or 6.5% and operating earnings are up $48 million or 4.5%. 
Earnings from continuing operations are also up by $40 million. And similarly, earnings per fully diluted share are up $0.14. 
So all in all, a very solid quarter with good performance all around. The Marine group's improved performance, both quarter-over-quarter and sequentially, is notable. In short, we were very pleased with the quarter. 
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.87 on revenue of $31.35 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $3.06 billion. We had full year margins of 13.7%, a record for GD.
Revenue for the year is down $116 million, somewhat [ph] less than half of a percent. Operating earnings, on the other hand, are up $131 million or 3.1% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations are up $97 million or 3.3%.
This, together with share repurchase activity and a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate, led quite naturally to an 8.7% improvement in diluted earnings per share. This was a very good year, a year of continuing improvement, a year of accomplishment.
Free cash flow from operations is $678 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.81 billion, which is 59% of earnings from continuing operations. 
As we had advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to be as robust as is typical for us. It was, in fact, less than 100% of net earnings. This happened for 2 reasons: first, we were working off a very large advanced payments received in late 2014 on a major combat systems program; and second, we expected an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream, consistent with building numerous test aircraft and preproduction parts in connection with the G500 and G600 programs. All of this were normalized and unwind quite positively beginning this year. 
In 2017, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 100% of net income,  give or take a little. We should keep this kind of cash performance up throughout the planning horizon. 
Let me briefly give you some color on the quarter in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Revenue was up both quarter-over-quarter and sequentially. Against the year ago quarter, sales are up $82 million or 3.8% and operating earnings are up $26 million or 6.3% as a result of a 50 basis point improvement in margins. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was up $207 million or 10.3% and operating earnings are essentially flat as a result of the anticipated compression in operating margin.
For the year, revenue is $8.36 billion and operating earnings are $1.72 billion with an operating margin of 20.5%. This is a year-over-year reduction of 5.5% in sales, almost $500 million, but operating earnings are up $12 million for the year on a 120 basis point improvement in margins. 
All in all, a very good year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and decent order intake particularly good in the last half of the year.  This result was consistent with our guidance to you that we would hold earnings even with 2015. As I mentioned, earnings were actually up $12 million over 2015.
Order activity in the quarter was good and pipeline activity was actually robust. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8:1 dollar based and 0.9:1 in units of green delivery at Gulfstream. 
All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good. The second half of 2016 was actually strong from a pace of activity standpoint, and interest in the G500 and 600 is increasing nicely as we get closer to entering into service with these aircraft. 
The Combat Systems revenue was $1.68 billion and is up $160 million or 10.5%. And operating earnings are up $25 million or 10.7% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
Sequentially, the story is even better. Sales are up $354 million or 26.6% and operating earnings are up $40 million or 18.3%. For the full year, sales are down $38 million or 0.7%. However, operating earnings are up $32 million or 3.6% on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin.
By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat lower revenue and stronger operating margins. 
Overall, Combat Systems is a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance. As you'll learn later in my remarks, this is a business group poised for quite significant growth in the 2017 to 2020 time frame as we began delivering on our backlog. 
Marine group revenue of $2.04 billion in the quarter is up $59 million or 3% compared to the year ago quarter and essentially flat on a sequential basis. 
Operating earnings are up $14 million or 8.1% against the year ago quarter and up $20 million or 12% sequentially. 
Revenue for the year is up $189 million or 2.4%. Recall that this year's $189 million increase in annual revenue follows a $701 million increase in 2015 and a $600 million increase in 2014. That's more than 20% growth for the group over that 3-year period.
On the other hand, operating earnings for the year are down $3 million on a 30 basis point reduction in operating margins. 
So the story here is a good quarter on both the quarter-over-quarter and sequential basis. On an annual basis, we experienced better-than-anticipated revenue but not as good as expected operating margin, which left us relatively flat year-over-year. 
In the Information Systems and Technology group, revenue in the quarter is $2.28 billion, up $123 million or 5.7% against the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $244 million in the quarter are 6.1% better than the fourth quarter a year ago.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings are down $12 million or 4.7% on a 20 basis point reduction in margins and a 2.4% reduction in sales.
For the year, revenue was up $222 million or 2.5% and earnings are up $89 million or 9.9% on the strength of a 70 basis point improvement in margins, very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year, we forecast flat operating earnings for the group, so this was a very strong year for IS&T. 
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2016 was to expect revenue of $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion and operating margin rate of 13.3% and a tax rate of 29.5% and return on sales of 9.1%.
We wound up the year light on revenue with $31.35 billion, but we exceeded our earnings expectation with operating margins of 13.7%, an effective tax rate of 27.6% and a return on sales of 9.8%. 
Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $9.20. We wound up at $9.87, $0.67 better. About $0.23 of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.25  from a lower-than-planned tax rate and the balance, about $0.19, from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly, a very solid year by any measure. 
So before we go to guidance, I want Kim to make a few remarks and then talk about the fundamentals of our accounting rule adoption for 2017 and the restatement of 2016 under these new revenue recognition rules. 
All of the guidance I'll offer you for 2017 and for 2018 through 2020 as well will flow from the restatement of 2016, which is found in exhibits K-1 through K-3 of the press release. Kim?"
274561,416256838,1118455,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2017",2017-01-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jason, and good morning.

In particular, this",1549,"Thanks, Jason, and good morning. I'll start up by touching on just a few miscellaneous items related to 2016's financial performance. 
The first thing I'll note is the foreign exchange rate volatility that we've seen throughout 2016. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on the growth experienced in our Combat Systems group given their increasing international activity. As Jason pointed out, the group's full year revenue was down 0.7% compared to 2015. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2015, the group's sales would have actually increased by 1.5% in 2016.
As a reminder, this has nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. What we're talking about is merely the translation of our various international businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes and the negative effect on that translation that comes with a strengthening U.S. dollar.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
For the full year, interest expense was $91 million versus $83 million in 2015. The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt, yielding more interest expense, and about a $450 million reduction in our cash balance associated with capital deployment activities, which resulted in slightly lower interest income. 
For 2017, we expect net interest expense of around $110 million. The increase is due to the full year effect of the increased debt and lower cash positions. 
We ended 2016 with a cash balance of $2.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.6 billion. That compares with cash of almost $2.8 billion and net debt of about $600 million at the end of 2015. Those changes are attributable to our capital deployment activities, which I'll walk through in just a minute. 
Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the year, very consistent with our 2015 effective rate of 27.7%. Our 2016 outcome was lower than anticipated principally due to the higher-than-expected benefits from increased international activity and employee stock option exercises during the year.
As we look forward to 2017, we expect an effective tax rate of about 28%, reflecting the fact that our international activity continues to increase and the tax benefit associated with stock options being a permanent part of the tax landscape. 
Let's move on to our pension plans. 
We contributed about $200 million to our plans in 2016, as forecast. For 2017, we expect that amount to be about the same to be contributed mostly during the third quarter.
A quick note on discontinued operations. In the fourth quarter, we had a net $10 million loss in discontinued operations to record an accrual for an environmental matter related to a business we divested back in the early '80s. 
And finally, to summarize our activities on the capital deployment front for the year. We spent approximately $2 billion to repurchase 14.2 million shares in 2016 at an average price of a little less than $143 per share. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we disbursed $2.9 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2016 or 1.6x our free cash flow from operations for the year. 
Okay, that wraps up the discussion of 2016's financial performance and some expectations for interest expense, tax and pension contributions. Now I'd like to move on to an explanation of our 2017 accounting change.
On January 1 of this year, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC Topic 606, which addresses revenue from contracts with customers. This new standard outlines a 5-step model to determine how and when to recognize revenue on a contract-by-contract basis. 
For the vast majority of our contracts, we will continue to recognize revenue over time similar to what we've done in the past under the percentage of completion method. But for contracts that don't qualify for over time revenue recognition, we'll recognize revenue at a single point in time.
As we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q and in today's press release exhibits, we expect this new standard to have 2 notable impacts on our contract portfolio. 
The first change relates to how we will account for adjustments in our estimates associated with our long-term contracts. Starting in 2017, we'll utilize what's called the cumulative catch-up method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This is similar to what others in our industry have done for many years. 
In 2016 and prior, we used what's called the reallocation method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This meant that any changes in profit we anticipated on our long-term contracts were recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term rather than immediately when identified under the cumulative catch-up method.
As a result of this change, we may see larger and more variable impacts from period to period from adjustments in contract estimates, particularly on our contracts of greater value and with a longer performance period such as in our Marine Systems group.
The second notable change that the new standard will have on our financial statements is in our Aerospace group, specifically at Gulfstream. 
Starting in 2017, we'll have one revenue recognition point for Gulfstream aircraft: when the customer accepts the outfitted aircraft at entry into service. This is different than the revenue recognition model we utilized in 2016 and before. 
Our past practice had 2 revenue recognition points at 2 distinct contractual milestones: green aircraft delivery and final outfitted delivery. 
It's important to note that these 2 changes and any other changes brought about by the standard impact only the timing of when we recognize revenue and earnings and do not alter our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts.
Now to prepare for an effective discussion of our 2017 guidance, which is based on the new method of revenue recognition, we need a consistent foundation as a point of comparison. Therefore, we restated our 2016 results as if we had been on the new revenue recognition standard for all of 2016. You can see the restated results for 2016 in exhibits K-1 through K-3 of our press release. 
Throughout 2017, as we speak with you and report in our Form 10-Qs, we'll compare our 2017 financial information to the restated 2016 results so all of our comparisons will be on the same basis.
I don't intend to walk you through all of the changes that you can see by examining the exhibits to our press release. But as you can see on Exhibit K-1 for 2016, as restated, both our consolidated revenue and operating earnings decline against the as-reported numbers. Similarly, the margin rate and diluted earnings per share follow suit. The biggest driver of this change is in Aerospace. Please refer to Exhibit K-3 in our press release.
Since under the new standard revenue at Gulfstream is now driven by outfitted deliveries, our restated 2016 revenue is lower as we had fewer outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. Operating earnings are similarly impacted.
Likewise, operating margins go down due to mix shift between outfitted deliveries and the green deliveries. 
On the other hand, as we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q, the impact on 2015 would have been just the opposite, because in that year, there were more outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. There is no other change in cost, pricing, R&D, SG&A spend or services revenue or margins. This is strictly related to the timing of the aircraft deliveries.
So the question is, how will all this impact Aerospace in 2017? Well, Jason will give you detailed guidance shortly. But in general, some of the 2016 green deliveries in excess of the completed deliveries should deliver in the first quarter, thereby giving the first quarter a boost versus the restated fourth quarter. That will be offset later in the year as we experience planned green deliveries that do not enter into service during the year. 
This natural phenomenon will be exacerbated by a number of green G500s that will not have revenue recognized at green delivery because of the new rule. So on balance, for the year, a modest accounting headwind for 2017. 
In short, the impact of these changes depends on the number and the mix of green versus outfitted deliveries in any period. 
Okay, let me wrap up by reminding you of something that I mentioned early in this discussion. This is about an accounting change that, in some circumstances, alters when we recognize revenue and earnings but does not impact our operations, our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts.
When you sit back and think about the restatement of 2016 and prior and everything -- everything that's occurred and been reported up to that point may have shifted around between the quarterly and annual reporting period. But if you look to the end of 2016 and recognize that the operating activities and cash flows of the company are unchanged up to that point, this is all about timing. We just have to look at the past through new lens so that we can have a meaningful comparison to our future results. 
Jason, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you to address the 2017 guidance."

So let me provide some guidance for 2017 and some commentary on 2018 through 2020 initially by business group and then a company-wide roll-up. 
This year, we did a more detailed and extensive planning exercise around the 3-year period subsequent to 2017. So I want to take this opportunity to share with you our expectations for that period as well.
In Aerospace, we expect 2017 revenue to be $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016 as restated but coincidentally similar to 2016 as reported. 
Operating earnings will be approximately $1.6 billion with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. The margin rate is somewhat lower than prior experience under the legacy accounting rules as a result of mix shift and increased R&D spending as well as an anticipated increase in pre-owned aircraft sales. 
In Aerospace for the 5-year period 2016 through 2020, that is 2016 as restated, we expect a sales CAGR of 5.3%. That CAGR rolls up modest sales increases in 2018 and 2019 with significant growth in 2020.
For the same period, the operating earnings CAGR is expected to be 5.9%. 
These percentages are -- percentages, of course, imply a degree of precision that isn't possible in out-year forecasting. However, we believe they're directionally accurate. 
In Combat Systems, we expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% in 2017 with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. This implies a margin rate of around 15.6%.
For the period 2016 to 2020, the expected sales CAGR is about 8.7% and earnings CAGR about 9.6%. Combat Systems is in a period where several of our international programs are migrating from development, prototyping and low-rate initial production into full-scale production. This supports the growth rates I just discussed. 
The Marine group is expected to have revenue of $7.9 billion, a reduction of 2.6% against 2016 as restated. Operating earnings in 2017 are anticipated to be $680 million to $685 million with an operating margin rate around 8.6%.
The 2016 to 2020 sales CAGR is expected to be 5% with the strongest year-over-year growth in 2018. The expected earnings CAGR for the Marine group for 2016 to 2020 is about 9%. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect a modest improvement in revenue in 2017 and operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a 2016 to 2020 CAGR for sales and earnings of 4.5% and 5.3%, respectively.
So company-wide, all of this rolls up to $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion of revenue, up over 2016 restated numbers by more than 2.5%; operating earnings of $4.15 billion to $4.2 billion, up over 2016 by about 11.5%; and operating margin around 13.3%, about 110 basis points above 2016 restated.
Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 28% tax provision, as Kim mentioned, and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55 per fully diluted shares, up about 10% over 2016 under the new accounting rule.
With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it's a bit more balanced than most years. Divide our guidance by 4, then take $0.10 off the first quarter, $0.05 off the second quarter, add $0.05 to the third quarter and add $0.10 to the fourth quarter, and that should give you the rough progression. 
So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effect of capital deployment.
With respect to capital deployment, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2017 for dividends and share repurchases, which will give a boost to the EPS guidance I've just given you. The amount of that boost will depend on the timing and share price.
For the period 2016 to 2020, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 5.6% and an operating earnings CAGR of 7.1%. This is simply a rollup of the projections I've given you for the business groups, so we're quite bullish about 2018 through 2020 in all segments.
Now let me end my remarks there and we'll start taking your questions."

So as it relates to order activity, as I mentioned, we really saw a very encouraging increase in velocity in the second half of the year, and that really is representative across the entire model portfolio, including the new products. I think what we're seeing here is as we expected, as both the G500 and G600 get closer to entering into service, we're starting to see that order interest continue to pick up. So we feel very good about where those airplanes are as they get closer to the respective EIS states. Overall, as I said, it's not just order activity, which, again, we felt very good about in both the third and fourth quarters, but it's the velocity and what we think is the pipeline. What comes in sometimes is not the same as what goes out and we've talked about extended or protracted contract negotiations and the timing it takes to get aircraft contracts signed and completed. And as good as we saw the second half from an order perspective, we saw just as encouraging velocity from the pipeline perspective going into Q1, which I think gives us a good bit of optimism as we start this year from an order perspective. With respect to your question about the out years, as I mentioned, you saw the -- you heard the remarks on 2017 and the CAGR for the out-year period. I think what we see is as we are transitioning with the real ramp of the 500 starting in '18 and the 600 starting in '19, we'll see modest growth in each of those years from their respective entries into service and then we'll see really more of the acceleration of the growth starting in 2020 when both of them are fully up and ramped into production."

Certainly, as we've been signaling through this couple of year period where we have seen lighter than our traditional cash flow conversion, it has been our expectation, our forecast, that we would be back to our traditional 100% conversion rate starting at '17. We have a high degree of confidence in that and we actually do see that as a sustaining trend. That's not a onetime thing, but we do expect to be able to keep up that level of conversion in that range throughout this planning horizon that I described. As it relates to free cash flow or -- excuse me, CapEx, typically, somewhere in the ballpark of 2% of revenues is where we tend to end up around CapEx. That, of course, depends on the timing and phasing of the various projects across the business, so it can [indiscernible] a little bit it will be back and forth. But certainly, what's coming on the horizon with Ohio, we'll bring with it some investment. We're still in the very early phases of discussing what the profile and timing of that looks like with the Navy. And so I don't think we're prepared to discuss any type of outsized CapEx investment at any 1-year beyond what I just described. But it's certainly -- we do not see that affecting that overall conversion rate through the planning horizon that I just described."

Again, do keep in mind that green aircraft will shift, including G500 green aircraft, will shift from '16 -- or from '17 into '18. So this is something that I think is more of an issue in this immediate transition as you try to think about '16 prior to restatement and '16 under the restatement and then how you take that restated '16 to then project 2017. I will point out one notion of the number you see in those exhibits around the difference, the delta between the green and outfitted airplane. We do have a number of, I don't have the exact number at the top of my head, but a number of aircraft that are associated with special mission programs. And those get inducted directly into the special mission process and don't go to a completion. So there's a natural delta there, and I'm sure Erin can give you some numbers after the call we need to get into that level of detail. As it relates to the G500 certification, we're still on track this year. Everything is going well with the flight test program. And we're still targeting certifications and entry into service, meaning an outfitted delivery prior to the end of the year."

As Kim described, there really is just one primary meaningful difference that we're talking about as it relates to the defense businesses. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to understate what the team has done here to go through this process because there's a lot of all small puts and takes. But the big-ticket item is this move from the perspective method of accounting for these changes in our long-term estimates to the cumulative catch-up method. So the issue there is there's no one thing you can point to that can say this is directionally indicative from a trend perspective because what's happening here, every quarter, every year, across the portfolio of these programs, we're performing updates to our estimates that complete and we're making adjustments across that portfolio to our profit booking rate margins on those programs. So as we do that in a given quarter, you're going to have some programs go up, some programs go down. As you've seen with a number of our peers were pretty much all been on this method even prior to this point, that can lead to somewhat more volatility under the cumulative catch-up method than we had experienced under the perspective method. I think you can reasonably expect somewhere in the order of magnitude if you compare them to us historically, two times or so, the level of quarterly profit adjustment type impacts on the results. And I'm saying that's what we see in the future. I can't, I wouldn't be foolish enough to try to predict that, but it's all good independent what happens in a given quarter. What you saw in 2016 [ph] was that there were a handful more profit rate adjustments that had little to any impact under the perspective method in those periods. But when you take them all in one lumpsum, they just drove a little bit more of an anomaly, a little bit more perturbation from quarter-to-quarter. So this is what we're going to frankly we have to get into a little more detail with you in the future, when and if these things would. And as we said, we fully expect that somewhat increase level of volatility on a quarterly basis to be part of our story in the future."

And so given the restatement here in the period and the fact that you're having to sort of [indiscernible] '16 [ph], as you now look at and evaluate '17, we frankly just thought it would be useful for you to get a little bit more of a picture, so you weren't left and isolation that sort of the 2 data points megatrend or not because that can be kind of a tough expectation, I think, for anybody assessing the results.

So the planes you referred to, as I mentioned, the 16 is a little bit of an overstatement because there were somewhere in the ballpark of a half dozen or more handful of these special mission airplanes that don't flow into completion. So they're done that it out. But again, I think the key to remember is what we're trying to do here in the moment, and this I believe in the last time will do this because the green deliveries will just stayed out of the discussion from this point forward. But when you're trying to think about in the moment, as we transition between the old rules and the new rules, some of the instincts might be, as you've articulated, while you get the recount, the value associated with these green airplanes that didn't deliver outfitted at the end of 2016. But you have to keep in mind, that was going to happen at the end of 2017 as well, so there's an output on the other end that sort of that natural flow of the business. If you think of this as the steady in production model, the 650 to 550 to 450 to 280 [ph], you expect sort of that similar cadence coming out the other end. So if you just leave it at that, it's essentially a net neutral or close to it anyway. Where I or actually Kim articulated there's a modest headwind. And when I say headwind, it's an accounting artifice headwind, it's not a business headwind. What's happening there is we would have had, if you imagine, a G500 entry into service before the end of the year, there's quite naturally a handful of green G500 is that are incremental to those in production aircraft. That are also going to tilt out of '17 and into '18. So on balance, we would see more of an outflow, if you will, a tilt out of the year in '17 on the back and because of that phenomenon around entering of service of the G500, even than we are seeing as a tilt in flow from the end of '16 into '17. So hence, our attempt to try to help you understand in the moment as we transition sort of what that impact of the shift of the new rules is on Gulfstream."

So when you look at it, the third quarter was actually higher because we had on balance favorable booking rate changes in the fourth quarter across that portfolio on balance, had some negative book rating changes. Again, under the perspective method, as you are well aware, and we talked about many times, that gets cast out over the future, so there's virtually no effect in the moment when you make those changes. You can see in the results it had a little bit more volatility for under the catch-up method. I don't think you can take that and translate or extend that into what does it mean for the margin rates of the business in 2017 and beyond. Those are pretty much disconnected, I think. Really, that's a function of, as you know, we've experienced some cost growth at the vast shipyard on the settlement of the A 12 program and some of the work we're doing on the [indiscernible] 1000 as well as the restarted 51 [ph] program there. So that's sort of well documented and discussed. And we're working our way through that and have every expectation that they'll get that shipyard back to where we wanted to be and as quickly as we can. So that's one influence. And the other is, of course, as we add more and more volume around the cost plus Colombia [ph] class development effort, that, of course, is going to be dilutive in terms of margins with respect to how it compares to fixed-price and full-rate production program. So that's really what you're seeing going forward."

As it relates to the defense budget, I don't know that there's anything more fundamental assume than what we are seeing, which is notionally upward directional budgets that sort of underpin and support the defense programs across the board. Really, what's it about more so is what's in the backlog. We've developed a historically high backlog across the company, and now we're all about executing that backlog. So a good share of what you see particularly in Combat Systems and Marine Systems is all about just executing on that backlog and continuing to perform the way we have. So that gives us a great deal of confidence about that trajectory that I described it. As it relates to Aerospace, so I alluded to before, if I have to guess and I don't want to commit, but I'm fairly statement, this will be the last time we talk about we deliveries because it's all about outfitted deliveries in the future. So to your point right now as we look at 2017, we're projecting somewhere in the range, from a large cabin perspective of, call it, 90 to 95 outfitted deliveries. And from a mid-cabin perspective, somewhere in the range of 25 to 30 deliveries. As you are well aware, we tend not to look out beyond 1 year because we set production rates and work thr those customer contract on an annual basis. So we'll continue to of the that on an annual basis, but that gives you a sense of what we're seeing as we head into 2017."

So you mentioned the backlog is down just slightly sequentially and something important to point out there, particularly as it relates to Combat Systems. Kim alluded to the foreign exchange impact in that group as it relates to our annual sales. You have to keep in mind there is equally, if not more so an impact on what, if you will, the balance sheet for sales, that is the backlog. And so we saw something in the order of magnitude of a $700 million reduction in Combat Systems backlog in 2016 as a result of that FX headwind. So that kind of gives you a sense of what's happening there. In terms of opportunities in the pipeline, you're right, it is quite robust, both on the domestic and international front. We've got a number of competitions. There's an 8 by 8 vehicle in the U.K., there's opportunities in Poland and the Czech Republic, follow-on work in Austria. Really, the list kind of goes on and on throughout both Europe and the Middle East for Combat Systems as it relates to international programs. Domestically, obviously, we are looking forward to the ramp-up with the recapitalization efforts and so on as it relates to Stryker ECP, Stryker [indiscernible] with a 30-millimeter [ph] gun, Abrams upgrades, well, there's Marine Corps labs. Really, it's just a very encouraging and robust list for this group, again, both domestically and across the board internationally. So really exciting to see. Your last part of your question, Aerospace slots [ph] I think the fundamentally, the thing to -- the other way to think about this is with a good order activity we saw in the quarter, we continue to be encouraged by our EIS sort of next available slots for the various aircraft. The 650 remains [indiscernible] consistent with where we were last time, 24 months [ph] or so. 550 remains in the 12-month range. 450, we actually only have one aircraft left to sell. So we should get that behind us this quarter, which, by the way, I think is a great testament to this transition in the way culture mishandled this. When you think about it from both sides of the spectrum, on the one and, there was speculation about could we get the 500 into service when we said we could and doing what we said it would. Certainly, the test program is demonstrating so far that it's meeting is not exceeding all of our expectations for what the airplane could do. And as we mentioned, I should say PB mentioned the quarter ago, we've now officially pulled that EIS and from the first quarter '18 to fourth quarter '17. So that's on one of the spectrum. But despite about one 450 left, possibly the more difficult aspect of this transition was managing the supply chain, the order activity, inventory and so on. So to close that out in a timely and secure fashion, we're not exposing the company and managed this transition. So far, so good. So that is really encouraging. So that's kind of what we see on the horizon from an EIS perspective for the various aircraft."

I'd like to open by congratulating Phebe on welcoming her first grandchild into the world just yesterday. Mother, son and grandmother are all doing well. Phebe is with the newest addition to our family right now, but she left us well prepared to report our results on this call. 
I'd also like to welcome Kim Kuryea, our Vice President and Controller, to the call and thank her for joining me today. 
Congratulations, Phebe. Welcome, Kim. Now let's get started. 
Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.62 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.23 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $807 million.
The results for the quarter beat analyst consensus by $0.08, mostly on a lower-than-anticipated tax provision. 
Revenue and operating earnings are up significantly against the year ago quarter by 5.4% and 7.8%, respectively.
Earnings from continuing operations are also up $43 million on the strength of a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin, offset in part by a lower effective tax rate in the year ago quarter. Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.22 or 9.2%.
So in summary, against the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue is up 5.4%, operating earnings are up 7.8%, earnings from continuing operations are up 5.6% and fully diluted earnings per share are up 9.2%.
Sequentially, the story is just as wholesome. Revenue is up $502 million or 6.5% and operating earnings are up $48 million or 4.5%. 
Earnings from continuing operations are also up by $40 million. And similarly, earnings per fully diluted share are up $0.14. 
So all in all, a very solid quarter with good performance all around. The Marine group's improved performance, both quarter-over-quarter and sequentially, is notable. In short, we were very pleased with the quarter. 
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.87 on revenue of $31.35 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $3.06 billion. We had full year margins of 13.7%, a record for GD.
Revenue for the year is down $116 million, somewhat less than half of a percent. Operating earnings, on the other hand, are up $131 million or 3.1% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations are up $97 million or 3.3%.
This, together with share repurchase activity and a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate, led quite naturally to an 8.7% improvement in diluted earnings per share. This was a very good year, a year of continuing improvement, a year of accomplishment.
Free cash flow from operations is $678 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.81 billion, which is 59% of earnings from continuing operations. 
As we had advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to be as robust as is typical for us. It was, in fact, less than 100% of net earnings. This happened for 2 reasons: first, we were working off a very large advanced payments received in late 2014 on a major combat systems program; and second, we expected an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream, consistent with building numerous test aircraft and preproduction parts in connection with the G500 and G600 programs. All of this were normalized and unwind quite positively beginning this year. 
In 2017, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 100% of net income,  give or take a little. We should keep this kind of cash performance up throughout the planning horizon. 
Let me briefly give you some color on the quarter in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Revenue was up both quarter-over-quarter and sequentially. Against the year ago quarter, sales are up $82 million or 3.8% and operating earnings are up $26 million or 6.3% as a result of a 50 basis point improvement in margins. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was up $207 million or 10.3% and operating earnings are essentially flat as a result of the anticipated compression in operating margin.
For the year, revenue is $8.36 billion and operating earnings are $1.72 billion with an operating margin of 20.5%. This is a year-over-year reduction of 5.5% in sales, almost $500 million, but operating earnings are up $12 million for the year on a 120 basis point improvement in margins. 
All in all, a very good year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and decent order intake particularly good in the last half of the year.  This result was consistent with our guidance to you that we would hold earnings even with 2015. As I mentioned, earnings were actually up $12 million over 2015.
Order activity in the quarter was good and pipeline activity was actually robust. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8:1 dollar based and 0.9:1 in units of green delivery at Gulfstream. 
All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good. The second half of 2016 was actually strong from a pace of activity standpoint, and interest in the G500 and 600 is increasing nicely as we get closer to entering into service with these aircraft. 
The Combat Systems revenue was $1.68 billion and is up $160 million or 10.5%. And operating earnings are up $25 million or 10.7% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
Sequentially, the story is even better. Sales are up $354 million or 26.6% and operating earnings are up $40 million or 18.3%. For the full year, sales are down $38 million or 0.7%. However, operating earnings are up $32 million or 3.6% on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin.
By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat lower revenue and stronger operating margins. 
Overall, Combat Systems is a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance. As you'll learn later in my remarks, this is a business group poised for quite significant growth in the 2017 to 2020 time frame as we began delivering on our backlog. 
Marine group revenue of $2.04 billion in the quarter is up $59 million or 3% compared to the year ago quarter and essentially flat on a sequential basis. 
Operating earnings are up $14 million or 8.1% against the year ago quarter and up $20 million or 12% sequentially. 
Revenue for the year is up $189 million or 2.4%. Recall that this year's $189 million increase in annual revenue follows a $701 million increase in 2015 and a $600 million increase in 2014. That's more than 20% growth for the group over that 3-year period.
On the other hand, operating earnings for the year are down $3 million on a 30 basis point reduction in operating margins. 
So the story here is a good quarter on both the quarter-over-quarter and sequential basis. On an annual basis, we experienced better-than-anticipated revenue but not as good as expected operating margin, which left us relatively flat year-over-year. 
In the Information Systems and Technology group, revenue in the quarter is $2.28 billion, up $123 million or 5.7% against the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $244 million in the quarter are 6.1% better than the fourth quarter a year ago.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings are down $12 million or 4.7% on a 20 basis point reduction in margins and a 2.4% reduction in sales.
For the year, revenue was up $222 million or 2.5% and earnings are up $89 million or 9.9% on the strength of a 70 basis point improvement in margins, very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year, we forecast flat operating earnings for the group, so this was a very strong year for IS&T. 
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2016 was to expect revenue of $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion and operating margin rate of 13.3% and a tax rate of 29.5% and return on sales of 9.1%.
We wound up the year light on revenue with $31.35 billion, but we exceeded our earnings expectation with operating margins of 13.7%, an effective tax rate of 27.6% and a return on sales of 9.8%. 
Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $9.20. We wound up at $9.87, $0.67 better. About $0.23 of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.25  from a lower-than-planned tax rate and the balance, about $0.19, from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly, a very solid year by any measure. 
So before we go to guidance, I want Kim to make a few remarks and then talk about the fundamentals of our accounting rule adoption for 2017 and the restatement of 2016 under these new revenue recognition rules. 
All of the guidance I'll offer you for 2017 and for 2018 through 2020 as well will flow from the restatement of 2016, which is found in exhibits K-1 through K-3 of the press release. Kim?"
274561,416256838,1118552,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2017",2017-01-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jason, and good morning. I'll start up by touching on just a few miscellaneous items related to 2016's financial performance. The first thing I'll note is the foreign exchange rate volatility that we've seen throughout 2016. In particular, this",1549,"Thanks, Jason, and good morning. I'll start up by touching on just a few miscellaneous items related to 2016's financial performance. 
The first thing I'll note is the foreign exchange rate volatility that we've seen throughout 2016. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on the growth experienced in our Combat Systems group given their increasing international activity. As Jason pointed out, the group's full year revenue was down 0.7% compared to 2015. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2015, the group's sales would have actually increased by 1.5% in 2016.
As a reminder, this has nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. What we're talking about is merely the translation of our various international businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes and the negative effect on that translation that comes with a strengthening U.S. dollar.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
For the full year, interest expense was $91 million versus $83 million in 2015. The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt, yielding more interest expense, and about a $450 million reduction in our cash balance associated with capital deployment activities, which resulted in slightly lower interest income. 
For 2017, we expect net interest expense of around $110 million. The increase is due to the full year effect of the increased debt and lower cash positions. 
We ended 2016 with a cash balance of $2.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.6 billion. That compares with cash of almost $2.8 billion and net debt of about $600 million at the end of 2015. Those changes are attributable to our capital deployment activities, which I'll walk through in just a minute. 
Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the year, very consistent with our 2015 effective rate of 27.7%. Our 2016 outcome was lower than anticipated principally due to the higher-than-expected benefits from increased international activity and employee stock option exercises during the year.
As we look forward to 2017, we expect an effective tax rate of about 28%, reflecting the fact that our international activity continues to increase and the tax benefit associated with stock options being a permanent part of the tax landscape. 
Let's move on to our pension plans. 
We contributed about $200 million to our plans in 2016, as forecast. For 2017, we expect that amount to be about the same to be contributed mostly during the third quarter.
A quick note on discontinued operations. In the fourth quarter, we had a net $10 million loss in discontinued operations to record an accrual for an environmental matter related to a business we divested back in the early '80s. 
And finally, to summarize our activities on the capital deployment front for the year. We spent approximately $2 billion to repurchase 14.2 million shares in 2016 at an average price of a little less than $143 per share. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we disbursed $2.9 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2016 or 1.6x our free cash flow from operations for the year. 
Okay, that wraps up the discussion of 2016's financial performance and some expectations for interest expense, tax and pension contributions. Now I'd like to move on to an explanation of our 2017 accounting change.
On January 1 of this year, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC Topic 606, which addresses revenue from contracts with customers. This new standard outlines a 5-step model to determine how and when to recognize revenue on a contract-by-contract basis. 
For the vast majority of our contracts, we will continue to recognize revenue over time similar to what we've done in the past under the percentage of completion method. But for contracts that don't qualify for over time revenue recognition, we'll recognize revenue at a single point in time.
As we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q and in today's press release exhibits, we expect this new standard to have 2 notable impacts on our contract portfolio. 
The first change relates to how we will account for adjustments in our estimates associated with our long-term contracts. Starting in 2017, we'll utilize what's called the cumulative catch-up method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This is similar to what others in our industry have done for many years. 
In 2016 and prior, we used what's called the reallocation method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This meant that any changes in profit we anticipated on our long-term contracts were recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term rather than immediately when identified under the cumulative catch-up method.
As a result of this change, we may see larger and more variable impacts from period to period from adjustments in contract estimates, particularly on our contracts of greater value and with a longer performance period such as in our Marine Systems group.
The second notable change that the new standard will have on our financial statements is in our Aerospace group, specifically at Gulfstream. 
Starting in 2017, we'll have one revenue recognition point for Gulfstream aircraft: when the customer accepts the outfitted aircraft at entry into service. This is different than the revenue recognition model we utilized in 2016 and before. 
Our past practice had 2 revenue recognition points at 2 distinct contractual milestones: green aircraft delivery and final outfitted delivery. 
It's important to note that these 2 changes and any other changes brought about by the standard impact only the timing of when we recognize revenue and earnings and do not alter our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts.
Now to prepare for an effective discussion of our 2017 guidance, which is based on the new method of revenue recognition, we need a consistent foundation as a point of comparison. Therefore, we restated our 2016 results as if we had been on the new revenue recognition standard for all of 2016. You can see the restated results for 2016 in exhibits K-1 through K-3 of our press release. 
Throughout 2017, as we speak with you and report in our Form 10-Qs, we'll compare our 2017 financial information to the restated 2016 results so all of our comparisons will be on the same basis.
I don't intend to walk you through all of the changes that you can see by examining the exhibits to our press release. But as you can see on Exhibit K-1 for 2016, as restated, both our consolidated revenue and operating earnings decline against the as-reported numbers. Similarly, the margin rate and diluted earnings per share follow suit. The biggest driver of this change is in Aerospace. Please refer to Exhibit K-3 in our press release.
Since under the new standard revenue at Gulfstream is now driven by outfitted deliveries, our restated 2016 revenue is lower as we had fewer outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. Operating earnings are similarly impacted.
Likewise, operating margins go down due to mix shift between outfitted deliveries and the green deliveries. 
On the other hand, as we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q, the impact on 2015 would have been just the opposite, because in that year, there were more outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. There is no other change in cost, pricing, R&D, SG&A spend or services revenue or margins. This is strictly related to the timing of the aircraft deliveries.
So the question is, how will all this impact Aerospace in 2017? Well, Jason will give you detailed guidance shortly. But in general, some of the 2016 green deliveries in excess of the completed deliveries should deliver in the first quarter, thereby giving the first quarter a boost versus the restated fourth quarter. That will be offset later in the year as we experience planned green deliveries that do not enter into service during the year. 
This natural phenomenon will be exacerbated by a number of green G500s that will not have revenue recognized at green delivery because of the new rule. So on balance, for the year, a modest accounting headwind for 2017. 
In short, the impact of these changes depends on the number and the mix of green versus outfitted deliveries in any period. 
Okay, let me wrap up by reminding you of something that I mentioned early in this discussion. This is about an accounting change that, in some circumstances, alters when we recognize revenue and earnings but does not impact our operations, our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts.
When you sit back and think about the restatement of 2016 and prior and everything -- everything that's occurred and been reported up to that point may have shifted around between the quarterly and annual reporting period. But if you look to the end of 2016 and recognize that the operating activities and cash flows of the company are unchanged up to that point, this is all about timing. We just have to look at the past through new lens so that we can have a meaningful comparison to our future results. 
Jason, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you to address the 2017 guidance."

So let me provide some guidance for 2017 and some commentary on 2018 through 2020 initially by business group and then a company-wide roll-up. 
This year, we did a more detailed and extensive planning exercise around the 3-year period subsequent to 2017. So I want to take this opportunity to share with you our expectations for that period as well.
In Aerospace, we expect 2017 revenue to be $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016 as restated but coincidentally similar to 2016 as reported. 
Operating earnings will be approximately $1.6 billion with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. The margin rate is somewhat lower than prior experience under the legacy accounting rules as a result of mix shift and increased R&D spending as well as an anticipated increase in pre-owned aircraft sales. 
In Aerospace for the 5-year period 2016 through 2020, that is 2016 as restated, we expect a sales CAGR of 5.3%. That CAGR rolls up modest sales increases in 2018 and 2019 with significant growth in 2020.
For the same period, the operating earnings CAGR is expected to be 5.9%. 
These percentages are -- percentages, of course, imply a degree of precision that isn't possible in out-year forecasting. However, we believe they're directionally accurate. 
In Combat Systems, we expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% in 2017 with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. This implies a margin rate of around 15.6%.
For the period 2016 to 2020, the expected sales CAGR is about 8.7% and earnings CAGR about 9.6%. Combat Systems is in a period where several of our international programs are migrating from development, prototyping and low-rate initial production into full-scale production. This supports the growth rates I just discussed. 
The Marine group is expected to have revenue of $7.9 billion, a reduction of 2.6% against 2016 as restated. Operating earnings in 2017 are anticipated to be $680 million to $685 million with an operating margin rate around 8.6%.
The 2016 to 2020 sales CAGR is expected to be 5% with the strongest year-over-year growth in 2018. The expected earnings CAGR for the Marine group for 2016 to 2020 is about 9%. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect a modest improvement in revenue in 2017 and operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a 2016 to 2020 CAGR for sales and earnings of 4.5% and 5.3%, respectively.
So company-wide, all of this rolls up to $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion of revenue, up over 2016 restated numbers by more than 2.5%; operating earnings of $4.15 billion to $4.2 billion, up over 2016 by about 11.5%; and operating margin around 13.3%, about 110 basis points above 2016 restated.
Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 28% tax provision, as Kim mentioned, and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55 per fully diluted shares, up about 10% over 2016 under the new accounting rule.
With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it's a bit more balanced than most years: divide our guidance by 4, and then take $0.10 off the first quarter, $0.05 off the second quarter, add $0.05 to the third quarter and add $0.10 to the fourth quarter. And that should give you the rough progression. 
So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effect of capital deployment.
With respect to capital deployment, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2017 for dividends and share repurchases, which will give a boost to the EPS guidance I've just given you. The amount of that boost will depend on the timing and share price.
For the period 2016 to 2020, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 5.6% and an operating earnings CAGR of 7.1%. This is simply a roll-up of the projections I've given you for the business groups. So we're quite bullish about 2018 through 2020 in all segments.
Now let me end my remarks there, and we'll start taking your questions."

So, well, as it relates to order activity, as I mentioned, we really saw a very encouraging increase in velocity in the second half of the year, and that really is representative across the entire model portfolio, including the new products. I think what we're seeing here is as we expected, as both the G500 and G600 get closer to entering into service, we're starting to see that order interest continue to pick up. So we feel very good about where those airplanes are as they get closer to the EIS -- their respective EIS dates. Overall, as I said, it's not just order activity, which, again, we felt very good about in both the third and fourth quarters, but it's the velocity into the what we think of as the pipeline. What comes in sometimes is not the same as what goes out, and we've talked about extended or protracted contract negotiations and the timing it takes to get aircraft contracts signed and completed. And as good as we saw the second half from an order perspective, we saw just as encouraging velocity from the pipeline perspective going into Q1, which, we should think, gives us a good bit of optimism as we start this year from an order perspective. With respect to your question about the out years, as I mentioned, you saw the -- you heard the remarks on 2017 and the CAGR for the out-year period. I think what we see is as we are transitioning with the real ramp of the 500 starting in '18 and the 600 starting in '19, we'll see modest growth in each of those years from their respective entries into service, and then we'll see really more of the acceleration of the growth starting in 2020 when both of them are fully up and ramped into the production."

Again, do keep in mind that green aircraft will shift, including G500 green aircraft, will shift from '16 -- or from '17 into '18. So this is something that I think is more of an issue in this immediate transition as you try to think about '16 prior to restatement and '16 under the restatement and then how you take that restated '16 to then project 2017. I will point out one notion of the number you see in those exhibits around the difference, the delta, between the green and outfitted airplanes. We do have a number of -- I don't have the exact number off the top of my head, but a number of aircraft that are associated with special mission programs. And those get inducted directly into the special mission process and don't go to a completion. So there's a natural delta there, and I'm sure Erin can give you some numbers after the call, so we need to get into that level of detail. As it relates to the G500 certification, we're still on track this year. Everything is going well with the flight test program. And we're still targeting certification and entry into service, meaning an outfitted delivery, prior to the end of the year."

Look, as Kim described, there really is just one primary meaningful difference that we're talking about as it relates to the defense businesses. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to understate what the team has done here to go through this process because there's a lot of smaller puts and takes. But the big-ticket item is this move from the prospective method of accounting for these changes in our long-term estimates to the cumulative catch-up method. So the issue there is there's no one thing you can point to that can say this is directionally indicative from a trend perspective because what's happening here, every quarter, every year across the portfolio of these programs, we are performing updates to our estimates at complete, and we're making adjustments across that portfolio to our profit booking rate margins on those programs. So as we do that in a given quarter, you're going to have some programs go up, some programs go down. As you've seen with a number of our peers who have pretty much all been on this method even prior to this point, that can lead to somewhat more volatility under the cumulative catch-up method than we have experienced under the prospective method. I think you can reasonably expect somewhere in the order of magnitude, if you compare them to us historically, 2x or so the level of quarterly profit adjustment-type impacts on the results. Am I saying that's what we'll see in the future? I can't -- I wouldn't be foolish enough to try and predict that, but it's all going to depend on what happens in a given quarter. What you saw in 2016 was that there were a handful more profit rate adjustments that had little to any impact under the prospective method in those periods. But when you take them all in one lump sum, they just drove a little bit more of that anomaly, a little bit more of that perturbation from quarter-to-quarter. So this is what we're going to frankly have to get into in a little more detail with you in the future when and if these things happen. And as we've said, we fully expect that somewhat increased level of volatility on a quarterly basis to be part of our story in the future."

So we wanted to show you a little bit more directional color on where we see the business is going.

So they're done, done and out. But again, I think the key to remember is, what we're trying to do here in the moment -- and this, I believe, is the last time we'll do this because green deliveries will just fade out of the discussion from this point forward. But when you're trying to think about in the moment as we transition between the old rules and the new rules, some of the instinct might be, as you've articulated, that, well, you get to recount the value associated with these green airplanes that didn't deliver outfitted at the end of 2016. But you have to keep in mind that was going to happen at the end of 2017 as well, so there's an output on the other end that's sort of that natural flow of the business. And if you think of this as a steady in-production models, the 650, the 550, the 450, the 280, you'd expect sort of that similar cadence coming out the other end where we -- so if you just leave it at that, it's essentially a net neutral or close to it anyway, where I or actually Kim articulated it as a modest headwind. And when I say headwind, it's an accounting artifice headwind, it's not a business headwind. What's happening there is we would have had, if you imagine, a G500 entering into service before the end of the year. There's quite naturally a handful of green G500s that are incremental to those in-production aircraft that are also going to tilt out of '17 and into '18. So on balance, we would see more of an outflow, if you will, or a tilt out of the year in '17 on the back end because of that phenomenon around the entry into service of the G500. Even then, we are seeing as a tilt in flow from the end of '16 into '17. So hence, our attempt to try to help you understand in the moment as we transition sort of what that impact of the shift of the rules is on Gulfstream."

So when you look at it, the third quarter was actually higher because we had, on balance, favorable booking rate changes in the fourth quarter across that portfolio; on balance, had some negative book rating changes. Again, under the prospective method, as you're well aware and we've talked about many times, that gets cast out over the future, so there's virtually no effect in the moment when you make those changes. You can see in the results it had a little bit more volatile in effect under the cum catch-up method. I don't think you can take that and translate or extend that into what does it mean for the margin rates of the business in 2017 and beyond. Those are pretty much disconnected, I think. Really, that's a function of -- as you know, we've experienced some cost growth at the Bath shipyard on the settlement of the A-12 program and some of the work we're doing on the DDG 1000 as well as the restart of the 51 program there. So that's sort of well documented and discussed. And we're working our way through that and we have every expectation that we'll get that shipyard back to where we want it to be and as quickly as we can. So that's one influence. And the other is, of course, as we add more and more volume around the cost-plus Columbia class development effort, that, of course, is going to be dilutive in terms of margins with respect to how it compares to fixed-price and full-rate production program. So that's really more what you're seeing going forward."

So like as it relates to the defense budget, I don't know that there's anything more fundamental assumes than what we are seeing, which is notionally upward directional budgets that sort of underpin and support the defense programs across the board. Really, what's it about more so is what's in the backlog. We've developed a historically high backlog across the company, and now we're all about executing that backlog. So a good share of what you see, particularly in Combat Systems and in Marine Systems, is all about just executing on that backlog and continuing to perform the way we have. So that gives us a great deal of confidence about that trajectory that I described. As it relates to Aerospace, so I alluded to before if I had to guess -- and I don't want to commit, Phebe, but I'm fairly certain this will probably be the last time we talk about green deliveries because it's all about outfitted deliveries in the future. So to your point, right now as we look at 2017, we're projecting somewhere in the range, from a large-cabin perspective, of, call it, 90 to 95 outfitted deliveries. And from a mid-cabin perspective, somewhere in the range of 25 to 30 deliveries. As you are well aware, we tend not to look out beyond one year because we set production rates and work through those customer contracts on an annual basis. So we'll continue to update that on an annual basis, but that gives you a sense of what we're seeing as we head into 2017."

So you mentioned the backlog is down just slightly sequentially, and something important to point out there particularly as it relates to Combat Systems. Kim alluded to the foreign exchange impact in that group as it relates to our annual sales. You have to keep in mind there's equally, if not more so, an impact on what, if you will, the balance sheet for sales, that is the backlog. And so we saw something in the order of magnitude of a $700 million reduction in Combat Systems backlog in 2016 as a result of that FX headwind. So that kind of gives you a sense of what's happening there. In terms of opportunities in the pipeline, you're right, it is quite robust, both on the domestic and international front. We've got a number of competitions. There's an 8 by 8 vehicle in the U.K., there's opportunities in Poland and the Czech Republic, follow-on work in Austria. Really the list kind of goes on and on throughout both Europe and the Middle East for Combat Systems as it relates to international programs. Domestically, obviously, we are looking forward to the ramp-up with recapitalization efforts and so on as it relates to Stryker ECP, Stryker [indiscernible] with a 30-millimeter  gun, Abrams upgrades. What else? There's the Marine Corps labs. Really, it's just a very encouraging and robust list for this group, again, both domestically and across the board internationally. So really exciting to see. Your last part of your question, Aerospace slots, I think fundamentally, the thing to -- the way to think about this is with the good order activity we saw in the quarter, we continue to be encouraged by our EIS sort of next available slots for the various aircraft. The 650 remains essentially consistent with where we were last time, 24 months or so. The 550 remains in the 12-month range. 450, we actually only have one aircraft left to sell, so we should get that behind us this quarter, which, by the way, I think, is a great testament to this transition in the way Gulfstream has handled this. When you think about it from both sides of the spectrum, on the one end, there was the speculation about could we get the 500 into service when we said we could and doing what we said it would. And certainly, the test program is demonstrating so far that it's meeting if not exceeding all of our expectations for what the airplane can do. And as we mentioned there -- I should say Phebe mentioned a quarter ago we've now officially pulled that EIS in from first quarter '18 to fourth quarter '17. So that's on one end of the spectrum. But this point about 1 450 left, possibly the more difficult aspect of this transition was managing the supply chain, the order activity, the inventories and so on to close that out in a timely and secure fashion without exposing the company and manage this transition. So far, so good. So that is really encouraging. So that's kind of what we see on the horizon from an EIS perspective for the various aircraft."

Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.62 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.23 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $807 million.
The results for the quarter beat analyst consensus by $0.08, mostly on a lower-than-anticipated tax provision. 
Revenue and operating earnings are up significantly against the year ago quarter by 5.4% and 7.8%, respectively.
Earnings from continuing operations are also up $43 million on the strength of a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin, offset in part by a lower effective tax rate in the year ago quarter. Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.22 or 9.2%.
So in summary, against the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue is up 5.4%, operating earnings are up 7.8%, earnings from continuing operations are up 5.6% and fully diluted earnings per share are up 9.2%.
Sequentially, the story is just as wholesome. Revenue is up $502 million or 6.5% and operating earnings are up $48 million or 4.5%. 
Earnings from continuing operations are also up by $40 million. And similarly, earnings per fully diluted share are up $0.14. 
So all in all, a very solid quarter with good performance all around. The Marine group's improved performance, both quarter-over-quarter and sequentially, is notable. In short, we were very pleased with the quarter. 
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.87 on revenue of $31.35 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $3.06 billion. We had full year margins of 13.7%, a record for GD.
Revenue for the year is down $116 million, somewhat less than half of a percent. Operating earnings, on the other hand, are up $131 million or 3.1% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations are up $97 million or 3.3%.
This, together with share repurchase activity and a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate, led quite naturally to an 8.7% improvement in diluted earnings per share. This was a very good year, a year of continuing improvement, a year of accomplishment.
Free cash flow from operations is $678 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.81 billion, which is 59% of earnings from continuing operations. 
As we had advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to be as robust as is typical for us. It was, in fact, less than 100% of net earnings. This happened for 2 reasons: first, we were working off a very large advanced payments received in late 2014 on a major combat systems program; and second, we expected an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream, consistent with building numerous test aircraft and preproduction parts in connection with the G500 and G600 programs. All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively beginning this year. 
In 2017, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 100% of net income,  give or take a little. We should keep this kind of cash performance up throughout the planning horizon. 
Let me briefly give you some color on the quarter in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Revenue was up both quarter-over-quarter and sequentially. Against the year ago quarter, sales are up $82 million or 3.8% and operating earnings are up $26 million or 6.3% as a result of a 50 basis point improvement in margins. 
On a sequential basis, revenue is up $207 million or 10.3% and operating earnings are essentially flat as a result of the anticipated compression in operating margin.
For the year, revenue is $8.36 billion and operating earnings are $1.72 billion with an operating margin of 20.5%. This is a year-over-year reduction of 5.5% in sales, almost $500 million, but operating earnings are up $12 million for the year on a 120 basis point improvement in margins. 
All in all, a very good year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and decent order intake, particularly good in the last half of the year.  This result was consistent with our guidance to you that we would hold earnings even with 2015. As I mentioned, earnings were actually up $12 million over 2015.
Order activity in the quarter was good and pipeline activity was actually robust. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8:1 dollar based and 0.9:1 in units of green delivery at Gulfstream. 
All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good. The second half of 2016 was actually strong from a pace of activity standpoint, and interest in the G500 and 600 is increasing nicely as we get closer to entering into service with these aircraft. 
The Combat Systems revenue was $1.68 billion and is up $160 million or 10.5%. And operating earnings are up $25 million or 10.7% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
Sequentially the story is even better. Sales are up $354 million or 26.6% and operating earnings are up $40 million or 18.3%. For the full year, sales are down $38 million or 0.7%. However, operating earnings are up $32 million or 3.6% on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin.
By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat lower revenue and stronger operating margins. 
Overall, Combat Systems is a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance. As you'll learn later in my remarks, this is a business group poised for quite significant growth in the 2017 to 2020 time frame as we begin delivering on our backlog. 
Marine group revenue of $2.04 billion in the quarter is up $59 million or 3% compared to the year ago quarter and essentially flat on a sequential basis. 
Operating earnings are up $14 million or 8.1% against the year ago quarter and up $20 million or 12% sequentially. 
Revenue for the year is up $189 million or 2.4%. Recall that this year's $189 million increase in annual revenue follows a $701 million increase in 2015 and a $600 million increase in 2014. That's more than 20% growth for the group over that 3-year period.
On the other hand, operating earnings for the year are down $3 million on a 30 basis point reduction in operating margins. 
So the story here is a good quarter on both a quarter-over-quarter and sequential basis. On an annual basis, we experienced better-than-anticipated revenue but not as good as expected operating margin, which left us relatively flat year-over-year. 
In the Information Systems and Technology group, revenue in the quarter is $2.28 billion, up $123 million or 5.7% against the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $244 million in the quarter are 6.1% better than the fourth quarter a year ago.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings are down $12 million or 4.7% on a 20 basis point reduction in margins and a 2.4% reduction in sales.
For the year, revenue is up $222 million or 2.5% and earnings are up $89 million or 9.9% on the strength of a 70 basis point improvement in margins; very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year, we forecast flat operating earnings for the group, so this was a very strong year for IS&T. 
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2016 was to expect revenue of $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion, an operating margin rate of 13.3% and a tax rate of 29.5% and return on sales of 9.1%.
We wound up the year light on revenue with $31.35 billion, but we exceeded our earnings expectation with operating margins of 13.7%, an effective tax rate of 27.6% and a return on sales of 9.8%. 
Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $9.20. We wound up at $9.87, $0.67 better. About $0.23 of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.25  from a lower-than-planned tax rate and the balance, about $0.19, from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly a very solid year by any measure. 
So before we go to guidance, I want Kim to make a few remarks and then talk about the fundamentals of our accounting rule adoption for 2017 and the restatement of 2016 under these new revenue recognition rules. 
All of the guidance I'll offer you for 2017 and for 2018 through 2020 as well will flow from the restatement of 2016, which is found in exhibits K-1 through K-3 of the press release. Kim?"

I'll start out by touching on just a few miscellaneous items related to 2016's financial performance.

I'll start out by touching on just a few miscellaneous items related to 2016's financial performance. 
The first thing I'll note is the foreign exchange rate volatility that we've seen throughout 2016. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on the growth experienced in our Combat Systems group given their increasing international activity. As Jason pointed out, the group's full year revenue was down 0.7% compared to 2015. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2015, the group's sales would have actually increased by 1.5% in 2016.
As a reminder, this has nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. What we're talking about is merely the translation of our various international businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes and the negative effect on that translation that comes with a strengthening U.S. dollar.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
For the full year, interest expense was $91 million versus $83 million in 2015. The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt, yielding more interest expense, and about a $450 million reduction in our cash balance associated with capital deployment activities, which resulted in slightly lower interest income. 
For 2017, we expect net interest expense of around $110 million. The increase is due to the full year effect of the increased debt and lower cash positions. 
We ended 2016 with a cash balance of $2.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.6 billion. That compares with cash of almost $2.8 billion and net debt of about $600 million at the end of 2015. Those changes are attributable to our capital deployment activities, which I'll walk through in just a minute. 
Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the year, very consistent with our 2015 effective rate of 27.7%. Our 2016 outcome was lower than anticipated principally due to the higher-than-expected benefits from increased international activity and employee stock option exercises during the year.
As we look forward to 2017, we expect an effective tax rate of about 28%, reflecting the fact that our international activity continues to increase and the tax benefit associated with stock options being a permanent part of the tax landscape. 
Let's move on to our pension plans. We contributed about $200 million to our plans in 2016, as forecast. For 2017, we expect that amount to be about the same, to be contributed mostly during the third quarter.
A quick note on discontinued operations. In the fourth quarter, we had a net $10 million loss in discontinued operations to record an accrual for an environmental matter related to a business we divested back in the early '80s. 
And finally, to summarize our activities on the capital deployment front for the year. We spent approximately $2 billion to repurchase 14.2 million shares in 2016 at an average price of a little less than $143 per share. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we disbursed $2.9 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2016 or 1.6x our free cash flow from operations for the year. 
Okay, that wraps up the discussion of 2016's financial performance and some expectations for interest expense, tax and pension contributions. Now I'd like to move on to an explanation of our 2017 accounting change.
On January 1 of this year, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC Topic 606, which addresses revenue from contracts with customers. This new standard outlines a 5-step model to determine how and when to recognize revenue on a contract-by-contract basis. 
For the vast majority of our contracts, we will continue to recognize revenue over time similar to what we've done in the past under the percentage of completion method. But for contracts that don't qualify for over time revenue recognition, we'll recognize revenue at a single point in time.
As we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q and in today's press release exhibits, we expect this new standard to have 2 notable impacts on our contract portfolio. 
The first change relates to how we will account for adjustments in our estimates associated with our long-term contracts. Starting in 2017, we'll utilize what's called the cumulative catch-up method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This is similar to what others in our industry have done for many years. 
In 2016 and prior, we used what's called the reallocation method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This meant that any changes in profit we anticipated on our long-term contracts were recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term rather than immediately when identified under the cumulative catch-up method.
As a result of this change, we may see larger and more variable impacts from period to period from adjustments in contract estimates, particularly on our contracts of greater value and with a longer performance period such as in our Marine Systems group.
The second notable change that the new standard will have on our financial statements is in our Aerospace group, specifically at Gulfstream. Starting in 2017, we'll have one revenue recognition point for Gulfstream aircraft: when the customer accepts the outfitted aircraft at entry into service. This is different than the revenue recognition model we utilized in 2016 and before. 
Our past practice had 2 revenue recognition points at 2 distinct contractual milestones: green aircraft delivery and final outfitted delivery. 
It's important to note that these 2 changes and any other changes brought about by the standard impact only the timing of when we recognize revenue and earnings and do not alter our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts.
Now to prepare for an effective discussion of our 2017 guidance, which is based on the new method of revenue recognition, we need a consistent foundation as a point of comparison. Therefore, we've restated our 2016 results as if we had been on the new revenue recognition standard for all of 2016. You can see the restated results for 2016 in exhibits K-1 through K-3 of our press release. 
Throughout 2017, as we speak with you and report in our Form 10-Qs, we'll compare our 2017 financial information to the restated 2016 results so all of our comparisons will be on the same basis.
I don't intend to walk you through all of the changes that you can see by examining the exhibits to our press release. But as you can see on Exhibit K-1 for 2016, as restated, both our consolidated revenue and operating earnings decline against the as-reported numbers. Similarly, the margin rate and diluted earnings per share follow suit. The biggest driver of this change is in Aerospace. Please refer to Exhibit K-3 in our press release.
Since under the new standard revenue at Gulfstream is now driven by outfitted deliveries, our restated 2016 revenue is lower, as we had fewer outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. Operating earnings are similarly impacted.
Likewise, operating margins go down due to mix shift between outfitted deliveries and the green deliveries. 
On the other hand, as we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q, the impact on 2015 would have been just the opposite, because in that year there were more outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. There is no other change in cost, pricing, R&D, SG&A spend or services revenue or margins. This is strictly related to the timing of the aircraft deliveries.
So the question is, how will all this impact Aerospace in 2017? Well, Jason will give you detailed guidance shortly, but in general, some of the 2016 green deliveries in excess of the completed deliveries should deliver in the first quarter, thereby giving the first quarter a boost versus the restated fourth quarter. That will be offset later in the year as we experience planned green deliveries that do not enter into service during the year. 
This natural phenomenon will be exacerbated by a number of green G500s that will not have revenue recognized at green delivery because of the new rule. So on balance, for the year, a modest accounting headwind for 2017. 
In short, the impact of these changes depends on the number and the mix of green versus outfitted deliveries in any period. 
Okay, let me wrap up by reminding you of something that I mentioned early in this discussion. This is about an accounting change that, in some circumstances, alters when we recognize revenue and earnings but does not impact our operations, our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts.
When you sit back and think about the restatement of 2016 and prior, everything that's occurred and been reported up to that point may have shifted around between the quarterly and annual reporting period. But if you look to the end of 2016 and recognize that the operating activities and cash flows of the company are unchanged up to that point, this is all about timing. We just have to look at the past through a new lens so that we can have a meaningful comparison to our future results. 
Jason, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you to address the 2017 guidance."

So let me provide some guidance for 2017 and some commentary on 2018 through 2020 initially by business group and then a company-wide roll-up. 
This year, we did a more detailed and extensive planning exercise around the 3-year period subsequent to 2017. So I want to take this opportunity to share with you our expectations for that period as well.
In Aerospace, we expect 2017 revenue to be $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016 as restated, but coincidentally similar to 2016 as reported. 
Operating earnings will be approximately $1.6 billion with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. The margin rate is somewhat lower than prior experience under the legacy accounting rules as a result of mix shift and increased R&D spending as well as an anticipated increase in pre-owned aircraft sales. 
In Aerospace, for the 5-year period 2016 through 2020, that is, 2016 as restated, we expect a sales CAGR of 5.3%. That CAGR rolls up modest sales increases in 2018 and 2019 with significant growth in 2020. For the same period, the operating earnings CAGR is expected to be 5.9%. 
These percentages are -- percentages, of course, imply a degree of precision that isn't possible in out-year forecasting. However, we believe they're directionally accurate. 
In Combat Systems, we expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% in 2017 with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. This implies a margin rate of around 15.6%.
For the period 2016 to 2020, the expected sales CAGR is about 8.7% and earnings CAGR about 9.6%. Combat Systems is in a period where several of our international programs are migrating from development, prototyping and low-rate initial production into full-scale production. This supports the growth rates I just discussed. 
The Marine group is expected to have revenue of $7.9 billion, a reduction of 2.6% against 2016 as restated. Operating earnings in 2017 are anticipated to be $680 million to $685 million with an operating margin rate around 8.6%.
The 2016 to 2020 sales CAGR is expected to be 5% with the strongest year-over-year growth in 2018. The expected earnings CAGR for the Marine group for 2016 to 2020 is about 9%. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect a modest improvement in revenue in 2017 and operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a 2016 to 2020 CAGR for sales and earnings of 4.5% and 5.3%, respectively.
So company-wide, all of this rolls up to $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion of revenue, up over 2016 restated numbers by more than 2.5%; operating earnings of $4.15 billion to $4.2 billion, up over 2016 by about 11.5%; and operating margin around 13.3%, about 110 basis points above 2016 restated.
Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 28% tax provision, as Kim mentioned, and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55 per fully diluted shares, up about 10% over 2016 under the new accounting rule.
With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it's a bit more balanced than most years: divide our guidance by 4, then take $0.10 off the first quarter, $0.05 off the second quarter, add $0.05 to the third quarter and add $0.10 to the fourth quarter, and that should give you the rough progression. 
So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effect of capital deployment.
With respect to capital deployment, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2017 for dividends and share repurchases, which will give a boost to the EPS guidance I've just given you. The amount of that boost will depend on the timing and share price.
For the period 2016 to 2020, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 5.6% and an operating earnings CAGR of 7.1%. This is simply a roll-up of the projections I've given you for the business groups. So we're quite bullish about 2018 through 2020 in all segments.
Now let me end my remarks there, and we'll start taking your questions."

So, look, as it relates to order activity, as I mentioned, we really saw a very encouraging increase in velocity in the second half of the year, and that really is representative across the entire model portfolio, including the new products. I think what we're seeing here is, as we expected, as both the G500 and G600 get closer to entering into service, we're starting to see that order interest continue to pick up. So we feel very good about where those airplanes are as they get closer to the EIS -- their respective EIS dates. 
Overall, as I said, it's not just order activity, which, again, we felt very good about in both the third and fourth quarters, but it's the velocity into what we think of as the pipeline. What comes in sometimes is not the same as what goes out, and we've talked about extended or protracted contract negotiations and the timing it takes to get aircraft contracts signed and completed. And as good as we saw the second half from an order perspective, we saw just as encouraging velocity from the pipeline perspective going into Q1, which I think gives us a good bit of optimism as we start this year from an order perspective. 
With respect to your question about the out-years, as I mentioned, you saw the -- you heard the remarks on 2017 and the CAGR for the out-year period. I think what we see is, as we are transitioning with the real ramp of the 500 starting in '18 and the 600 starting in '19, we'll see modest growth in each of those years from their respective entries into service, and then we'll see really more of the acceleration of the growth starting in 2020 when both of them are fully up and have ramped into the production."

But we do expect to be able to keep up that level of conversion in that range throughout this planning horizon that I described. 
As it relates to free cash flow -- or excuse me, CapEx, typically somewhere in the ballpark of 2% of revenues is where we tend to end up around CapEx. That, of course, depends on the timing and phasing of the various projects across the business. So it can perturbate a little bit back and forth. But certainly what's coming on the horizon with Ohio will bring with it some investment. We're still in the very early phases of discussing what the profile and timing of that looks like with the Navy, and so I don't think we're prepared to discuss any type of outsized CapEx investment in any one year beyond what I just described. But it certainly will -- we do not see it affecting that overall conversion rate through the plan horizon that I just described."

Again, do keep in mind that green aircraft will shift, including G500 green aircraft, will shift from '16 -- or from '17 into '18. So this is something that I think is more of an issue in this immediate transition as you try to think about '16 prior to restatement and '16 under the restatement and then how you take that restated '16 to then project 2017. 
I will point out one motion. Of the number you see in those exhibits around the difference, the delta, between the green and outfitted airplanes, we do have a number of, I don't have the exact number off the top of my head, but a number of aircraft that are associated with special mission programs, and those get inducted directly into the special mission process and don't go through a completion. So there's a natural delta there. And I'm sure Erin can give you some numbers after the call if we need to get into that level of detail. 
As it relates to the G500 certification, we're still on track this year. Everything is going well with the flight test program. And we're still targeting certification and entry into service, meaning an outfitted delivery, prior to the end of the year."

Look, as Kim described, there really is just one primary meaningful difference that we're talking about as it relates to the defense businesses. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to understate what the team has done here to go through this process because there's a lot of smaller puts and takes, but the big-ticket item is this move from the prospective method of accounting for these changes in our long-term estimates to the cumulative catch-up method. 
So the issue there is there's no one thing you can point to that can say this is directionally indicative from a trend perspective. Because what's happening here, every quarter, every year across the portfolio of these programs, we are performing updates to our estimates at complete, and we're making adjustments across that portfolio to our profit booking rate margins on those programs. So as we do that in a given quarter, you're going to have some programs go up, some programs go down. As you've seen with a number of our peers who have pretty much all been on this method even prior to this point, that can lead to somewhat more volatility under the cumulative catch-up method than we have experienced under the prospective method. 
I think you can reasonably expect somewhere in the order of magnitude, if you compare them to us historically, 2x or so the level of quarterly profit adjustment type impacts on the results. Am I saying that's what we'll see in the future? I can't -- I wouldn't be foolish enough to try and predict that. But it's all going to depend on what happens in a given quarter. 
What you saw in 2016 was that there were a handful more profit rate adjustments that had little to any impact under the prospective method in those periods, but when you take them all in one lump sum, they just drove a little bit more of that anomaly, a little bit more of that perturbation from quarter-to-quarter. So this is what we're going to, frankly, have to get into in a little more detail with you in the future when and if these things happen. And as we've said, we fully expect that somewhat increased level of volatility on a quarterly basis to be part of our story in the future."

We are seeing, frankly, a very good news story that we're bullish on across that period. And so given the restatement here in the period and the fact that you're having to sort of retune '16 as you now look at and evaluate '17, we frankly just thought it would be useful for you to get a little bit more of a picture so you weren't left in isolation with sort of do the 2 data points make a trend or not. Because that can be kind of a tough expectation, I think, for anybody assessing the results. So we wanted to show you a little bit more directional color on where we see the businesses going.

So they're done, done and out. But again, I think the key to remember is, what we're trying to do here in the moment -- and this, I believe, is the last time we'll do this, because green deliveries will just fade out of the discussion from this point forward. But when you're trying to think about in the moment, as we transition between the old rules and the new rules, some of the instinct might be, as you've articulated, that, wow, you get to recount the value associated with these green airplanes that didn't deliver outfitted at the end of 2016. But you have to keep in mind, that was going to happen at the end of 2017 as well, so there's an output on the other end that's sort of that natural flow of the business. And if you think of this as a steady in-production models -- the 650, the 550, the 450, the 280 -- you'd expect sort of that similar cadence coming out the other end. Where we -- so if you just leave it at that, it's essentially a net neutral, or close to it anyway, where I -- or actually Kim articulated it as a modest headwind. And when I say headwind, it's an accounting artifice headwind. It's not a business headwind. 
What's happening there is we would have had, if you imagine a G500 entering into service before the end of the year, there's quite naturally a handful of green G500s that are incremental to those in-production aircraft that are also going to tilt out of '17 and into '18. So on balance, we would see more of an outflow, if you will, or a tilt out of the year in '17 on the back end because of that phenomenon around the entry into service of the G500 even as we are seeing as a tilt inflow from the end of '16 into '17. So hence, our attempt to try to help you understand in the moment as we transition sort of what that impact of the shift of the new rules is on Gulfstream."

So when you look at it, the third quarter was actually higher because we had, on balance, favorable booking rate changes in the fourth quarter across that portfolio; on balance, had some negative book rating changes. Again, under the prospective method, as you're well aware and we've talked about many times, that gets cast out over the future, so there's virtually nil effect in the moment when you make those changes. 
You can see in the results it had a little bit more volatile in effect under the cum catch-up method. 
I don't think you can take that and translate or extend that into what does it mean for the margin rates of the business in 2017 and beyond. Those are pretty much disconnected, I think. Really, that's a function of -- as you know, we've experienced some cost growth at the Bath shipyard on the settlement of the A-12 program and some of the work we're doing on the DDG 1000 as well as the restart of the 51 program there. So that's sort of well documented and discussed. And we're working our way through that. And we have every expectation that we'll get that shipyard back to where we want it to be and as quickly as we can. So that's one influence. 
And the other is, of course, as we add more and more volume around the cost-plus Columbia class development effort, that, of course, is going to be dilutive in terms of margins with respect to how it compares to a fixed-price, full-rate production program. So that's really more what you're seeing going forward."

So look, as it relates to the defense budget, I don't know that there's anything more fundamental assumed than what we are seeing, which is notionally upward directional budgets that sort of underpin and support the defense programs across the board. Really what's it about more so is what's in the backlog. We've developed a historically high backlog across the company, and now we're all about executing that backlog. So a good share of what you see, particularly in Combat Systems and in Marine Systems, is all about just executing on that backlog and continuing to perform the way we have. So that gives us a great deal of confidence about that trajectory that I described. 
As it relates to Aerospace, so I alluded to before, if I had to guess, and I don't want to commit Phebe, but I'm fairly certain this will probably be the last time we talk about green deliveries because it's all about outfitted deliveries in the future. So to your point, right now, as we look at 2017, we're projecting somewhere in the range, from a large-cabin perspective, of, call it, 90 to 95 outfitted deliveries, and from a mid-cabin perspective somewhere in the range of 25 to 30 deliveries. 
As you are well aware, we tend not to look out beyond one year because we set production rates and work through those customer contracts on an annual basis. So we'll continue to update that on an annual basis, but that gives you a sense of what we're seeing as we head into 2017."

So you mentioned the backlog is down just slightly sequentially. And something important to point out there, particularly as it relates to Combat Systems, Kim alluded to the foreign exchange impact in that group as it relates to our annual sales. You have to keep in mind there's equally, if not more so, an impact on, if you will, the balance sheet for sales, that is, the backlog. And so we saw something in the order of magnitude of a $700 million reduction in Combat Systems backlog in 2016 as a result of that FX headwind. So that kind of gives you a sense of what's happening there. 
In terms of opportunities in the pipeline, you're right, it is quite robust, both on the domestic and the international front. We've got a number of competitions. There's an 8 by 8 vehicle in the U.K., there's opportunities in Poland and the Czech Republic, follow-on work in Austria. Really the list kind of goes on and on throughout both Europe and the Middle East for Combat Systems as it relates to international programs. 
Domestically, obviously we are looking forward to the ramp-up with recapitalization efforts and so on as it relates to Stryker ECP, Stryker lethality with the 30-millimeter gun, Abrams upgrades. What else? There's Marine Corps labs. Really it's just a very encouraging and robust list for this group, again, both domestically and across the board internationally. So really exciting to see. 
Your last part of your question, Aerospace slots, I think fundamentally the thing to -- the way to think about this is, with the good order activity we saw in the quarter, we continue to be encouraged by our EIS sort of next available slots for the various aircraft. The 650 remains essentially consistent with where we were last time, 24-ish months or so. The 550 remains in the 12-month range. 450, we actually only have one aircraft left to sell, so we should get that behind us this quarter. Which, by the way, I think is a great testament to this transition and the way Gulfstream has handled this. When you think about it from both sides of the spectrum, on the one end, there was the speculation about could we get the 500 into service when we said we could and doing what we said it would. And certainly the test program is demonstrating so far that it's meeting if not exceeding all of our expectations for what the airplane can do. And as we mentioned -- or I should say Phebe mentioned a quarter ago, we've now officially pulled that EIS in from first quarter '18 to fourth quarter '17. So that's on one end of the spectrum. 
But this point about 1 450 left, possibly the more difficult aspect of this transition was managing the supply chain, the order activity, the inventories and so on to close that out in a timely and secure fashion without exposing the company and manage this transition. And so far, so good. So that is really encouraging. So that's kind of what we see on the horizon from an EIS perspective for the various aircraft."

I'd also like to welcome Kim Kuryea, our Vice President and Controller, to the call and thank her for joining me today. 
Congratulations, Phebe. Welcome, Kim. Now let's get started. 
Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.62 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.23 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $807 million.
The results for the quarter beat analyst consensus by $0.08, mostly on a lower-than-anticipated tax provision. 
Revenue and operating earnings are up significantly against the year ago quarter by 5.4% and 7.8%, respectively.
Earnings from continuing operations are also up $43 million on the strength of a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin, offset in part by a lower effective tax rate in the year ago quarter. Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.22 or 9.2%.
So in summary, against the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue is up 5.4%, operating earnings are up 7.8%, earnings from continuing operations are up 5.6% and fully diluted earnings per share are up 9.2%.
Sequentially, the story is just as wholesome. Revenue is up $502 million or 6.5% and operating earnings are up $48 million or 4.5%. 
Earnings from continuing operations are also up by $40 million. And similarly, earnings per fully diluted share are up $0.14. 
So all in all, a very solid quarter with good performance all around. The Marine group's improved performance, both quarter-over-quarter and sequentially, is notable. In short, we were very pleased with the quarter. 
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.87 on revenue of $31.35 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $3.06 billion. We had full year margins of 13.7%, a record for GD.
Revenue for the year is down $116 million, somewhat less than half of a percent. Operating earnings, on the other hand, are up $131 million or 3.1% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations are up $97 million or 3.3%.
This, together with share repurchase activity and a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate, led quite naturally to an 8.7% improvement in diluted earnings per share. This was a very good year, a year of continuing improvement, a year of accomplishment.
Free cash flow from operations is $678 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.81 billion, which is 59% of earnings from continuing operations. 
As we had advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to be as robust as is typical for us. It was, in fact, less than 100% of net earnings. This happened for 2 reasons: first, we were working off a very large advanced payments received in late 2014 on a major combat systems program; and second, we expected an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream, consistent with building numerous test aircraft and preproduction parts in connection with the G500 and G600 programs. All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively beginning this year. 
In 2017, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 100% of net income,  give or take a little. We should keep this kind of cash performance up throughout the planning horizon. 
Let me briefly give you some color on the quarter in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Revenue was up both quarter-over-quarter and sequentially. Against the year ago quarter, sales are up $82 million or 3.8% and operating earnings are up $26 million or 6.3% as a result of a 50 basis point improvement in margins. 
On a sequential basis, revenue is up $207 million or 10.3% and operating earnings are essentially flat as a result of the anticipated compression in operating margin.
For the year, revenue is $8.36 billion and operating earnings are $1.72 billion with an operating margin of 20.5%. This is a year-over-year reduction of 5.5% in sales, almost $500 million, but operating earnings are up $12 million for the year on a 120 basis point improvement in margins. 
All in all, a very good year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and decent order intake, particularly good in the last half of the year.  This result was consistent with our guidance to you that we would hold earnings even with 2015. As I mentioned, earnings were actually up $12 million over 2015.
Order activity in the quarter was good and pipeline activity was actually robust. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8:1 dollar based and 0.9:1 in units of green delivery at Gulfstream. 
All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good. The second half of 2016 was actually strong from a pace of activity standpoint, and interest in the G500 and 600 is increasing nicely as we get closer to entering into service with these aircraft. 
The Combat Systems revenue was $1.68 billion and is up $160 million or 10.5%. And operating earnings are up $25 million or 10.7% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
Sequentially the story is even better. Sales are up $354 million or 26.6% and operating earnings are up $40 million or 18.3%. For the full year, sales are down $38 million or 0.7%. However, operating earnings are up $32 million or 3.6% on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin.
By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat lower revenue and stronger operating margins. 
Overall, Combat Systems is a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance. As you'll learn later in my remarks, this is a business group poised for quite significant growth in the 2017 to 2020 time frame as we begin delivering on our backlog. 
Marine group revenue of $2.04 billion in the quarter is up $59 million or 3% compared to the year ago quarter and essentially flat on a sequential basis. 
Operating earnings are up $14 million or 8.1% against the year ago quarter and up $20 million or 12% sequentially. 
Revenue for the year is up $189 million or 2.4%. Recall that this year's $189 million increase in annual revenue follows a $701 million increase in 2015 and a $600 million increase in 2014. That's more than 20% growth for the group over that 3-year period.
On the other hand, operating earnings for the year are down $3 million on a 30 basis point reduction in operating margins. 
So the story here is a good quarter on both a quarter-over-quarter and sequential basis. On an annual basis, we experienced better-than-anticipated revenue but not as good as expected operating margin, which left us relatively flat year-over-year. 
In the Information Systems and Technology group, revenue in the quarter is $2.28 billion, up $123 million or 5.7% against the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $244 million in the quarter are 6.1% better than the fourth quarter a year ago.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings are down $12 million or 4.7% on a 20 basis point reduction in margins and a 2.4% reduction in sales.
For the year, revenue is up $222 million or 2.5% and earnings are up $89 million or 9.9% on the strength of a 70 basis point improvement in margins; very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year, we forecast flat operating earnings for the group, so this was a very strong year for IS&T. 
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2016 was to expect revenue of $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion, an operating margin rate of 13.3% and a tax rate of 29.5% and return on sales of 9.1%.
We wound up the year light on revenue with $31.35 billion, but we exceeded our earnings expectation with operating margins of 13.7%, an effective tax rate of 27.6% and a return on sales of 9.8%. 
Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $9.20. We wound up at $9.87, $0.67 better. About $0.23 of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.25  from a lower-than-planned tax rate and the balance, about $0.19, from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly a very solid year by any measure. 
So before we go to guidance, I want Kim to make a few remarks and then talk about the fundamentals of our accounting rule adoption for 2017 and the restatement of 2016 under these new revenue recognition rules. 
All of the guidance I'll offer you for 2017 and for 2018 through 2020 as well will flow from the restatement of 2016, which is found in exhibits K-1 through K-3 of the press release. Kim?"

I'll start out by touching on just a few miscellaneous items related to 2016's financial performance.

I'll start out by touching on just a few miscellaneous items related to 2016's financial performance. 
The first thing I'll note is the foreign exchange rate volatility that we've seen throughout 2016. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on the growth experienced in our Combat Systems group given their increasing international activity. As Jason pointed out, the group's full year revenue was down 0.7% compared to 2015. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2015, the group's sales would have actually increased by 1.5% in 2016.
As a reminder, this has nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. What we're talking about is merely the translation of our various international businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes and the negative effect on that translation that comes with a strengthening U.S. dollar.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
For the full year, interest expense was $91 million versus $83 million in 2015. The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt, yielding more interest expense, and about a $450 million reduction in our cash balance associated with capital deployment activities, which resulted in slightly lower interest income. 
For 2017, we expect net interest expense of around $110 million. The increase is due to the full year effect of the increased debt and lower cash positions. 
We ended 2016 with a cash balance of $2.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.6 billion. That compares with cash of almost $2.8 billion and net debt of about $600 million at the end of 2015. Those changes are attributable to our capital deployment activities, which I'll walk through in just a minute. 
Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the year, very consistent with our 2015 effective rate of 27.7%. Our 2016 outcome was lower than anticipated principally due to the higher-than-expected benefits from increased international activity and employee stock option exercises during the year.
As we look forward to 2017, we expect an effective tax rate of about 28%, reflecting the fact that our international activity continues to increase and the tax benefit associated with stock options being a permanent part of the tax landscape. 
Let's move on to our pension plans. We contributed about $200 million to our plans in 2016, as forecast. For 2017, we expect that amount to be about the same, to be contributed mostly during the third quarter.
A quick note on discontinued operations. In the fourth quarter, we had a net $10 million loss in discontinued operations to record an accrual for an environmental matter related to a business we divested back in the early '80s. 
And finally, to summarize our activities on the capital deployment front for the year. We spent approximately $2 billion to repurchase 14.2 million shares in 2016 at an average price of a little less than $143 per share. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we disbursed $2.9 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2016 or 1.6x our free cash flow from operations for the year. 
Okay, that wraps up the discussion of 2016's financial performance and some expectations for interest expense, tax and pension contributions. Now I'd like to move on to an explanation of our 2017 accounting change.
On January 1 of this year, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC Topic 606, which addresses revenue from contracts with customers. This new standard outlines a 5-step model to determine how and when to recognize revenue on a contract-by-contract basis. 
For the vast majority of our contracts, we will continue to recognize revenue over time similar to what we've done in the past under the percentage of completion method. But for contracts that don't qualify for over time revenue recognition, we'll recognize revenue at a single point in time.
As we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q and in today's press release exhibits, we expect this new standard to have 2 notable impacts on our contract portfolio. 
The first change relates to how we will account for adjustments in our estimates associated with our long-term contracts. Starting in 2017, we'll utilize what's called the cumulative catch-up method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This is similar to what others in our industry have done for many years. 
In 2016 and prior, we used what's called the reallocation method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This meant that any changes in profit we anticipated on our long-term contracts were recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term rather than immediately when identified under the cumulative catch-up method.
As a result of this change, we may see larger and more variable impacts from period to period from adjustments in contract estimates, particularly on our contracts of greater value and with a longer performance period such as in our Marine Systems group.
The second notable change that the new standard will have on our financial statements is in our Aerospace group, specifically at Gulfstream. Starting in 2017, we'll have one revenue recognition point for Gulfstream aircraft: when the customer accepts the outfitted aircraft at entry into service. This is different than the revenue recognition model we utilized in 2016 and before. 
Our past practice had 2 revenue recognition points at 2 distinct contractual milestones: green aircraft delivery and final outfitted delivery. 
It's important to note that these 2 changes and any other changes brought about by the standard impact only the timing of when we recognize revenue and earnings and do not alter our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts.
Now to prepare for an effective discussion of our 2017 guidance, which is based on the new method of revenue recognition, we need a consistent foundation as a point of comparison. Therefore, we've restated our 2016 results as if we had been on the new revenue recognition standard for all of 2016. You can see the restated results for 2016 in exhibits K-1 through K-3 of our press release. 
Throughout 2017, as we speak with you and report in our Form 10-Qs, we'll compare our 2017 financial information to the restated 2016 results so all of our comparisons will be on the same basis.
I don't intend to walk you through all of the changes that you can see by examining the exhibits to our press release. But as you can see on Exhibit K-1 for 2016, as restated, both our consolidated revenue and operating earnings decline against the as-reported numbers. Similarly, the margin rate and diluted earnings per share follow suit. The biggest driver of this change is in Aerospace. Please refer to Exhibit K-3 in our press release.
Since under the new standard revenue at Gulfstream is now driven by outfitted deliveries, our restated 2016 revenue is lower, as we had fewer outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. Operating earnings are similarly impacted.
Likewise, operating margins go down due to mix shift between outfitted deliveries and the green deliveries. 
On the other hand, as we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q, the impact on 2015 would have been just the opposite, because in that year there were more outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. There is no other change in cost, pricing, R&D, SG&A spend or services revenue or margins. This is strictly related to the timing of the aircraft deliveries.
So the question is, how will all this impact Aerospace in 2017? Well, Jason will give you detailed guidance shortly, but in general, some of the 2016 green deliveries in excess of the completed deliveries should deliver in the first quarter, thereby giving the first quarter a boost versus the restated fourth quarter. That will be offset later in the year as we experience planned green deliveries that do not enter into service during the year. 
This natural phenomenon will be exacerbated by a number of green G500s that will not have revenue recognized at green delivery because of the new rule. So on balance, for the year, a modest accounting headwind for 2017. 
In short, the impact of these changes depends on the number and the mix of green versus outfitted deliveries in any period. 
Okay, let me wrap up by reminding you of something that I mentioned early in this discussion. This is about an accounting change that, in some circumstances, alters when we recognize revenue and earnings but does not impact our operations, our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts.
When you sit back and think about the restatement of 2016 and prior, everything that's occurred and been reported up to that point may have shifted around between the quarterly and annual reporting period. But if you look to the end of 2016 and recognize that the operating activities and cash flows of the company are unchanged up to that point, this is all about timing. We just have to look at the past through a new lens so that we can have a meaningful comparison to our future results. 
Jason, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you to address the 2017 guidance."

So let me provide some guidance for 2017 and some commentary on 2018 through 2020 initially by business group and then a company-wide roll-up. 
This year, we did a more detailed and extensive planning exercise around the 3-year period subsequent to 2017. So I want to take this opportunity to share with you our expectations for that period as well.
In Aerospace, we expect 2017 revenue to be $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016 as restated, but coincidentally similar to 2016 as reported. 
Operating earnings will be approximately $1.6 billion with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. The margin rate is somewhat lower than prior experience under the legacy accounting rules as a result of mix shift and increased R&D spending as well as an anticipated increase in pre-owned aircraft sales. 
In Aerospace, for the 5-year period 2016 through 2020, that is, 2016 as restated, we expect a sales CAGR of 5.3%. That CAGR rolls up modest sales increases in 2018 and 2019 with significant growth in 2020. For the same period, the operating earnings CAGR is expected to be 5.9%. 
These percentages are -- percentages, of course, imply a degree of precision that isn't possible in out-year forecasting. However, we believe they're directionally accurate. 
In Combat Systems, we expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% in 2017 with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. This implies a margin rate of around 15.6%.
For the period 2016 to 2020, the expected sales CAGR is about 8.7% and earnings CAGR about 9.6%. Combat Systems is in a period where several of our international programs are migrating from development, prototyping and low-rate initial production into full-scale production. This supports the growth rates I just discussed. 
The Marine group is expected to have revenue of $7.9 billion, a reduction of 2.6% against 2016 as restated. Operating earnings in 2017 are anticipated to be $680 million to $685 million with an operating margin rate around 8.6%.
The 2016 to 2020 sales CAGR is expected to be 5% with the strongest year-over-year growth in 2018. The expected earnings CAGR for the Marine group for 2016 to 2020 is about 9%. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect a modest improvement in revenue in 2017 and operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a 2016 to 2020 CAGR for sales and earnings of 4.5% and 5.3%, respectively.
So company-wide, all of this rolls up to $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion of revenue, up over 2016 restated numbers by more than 2.5%; operating earnings of $4.15 billion to $4.2 billion, up over 2016 by about 11.5%; and operating margin around 13.3%, about 110 basis points above 2016 restated.
Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 28% tax provision, as Kim mentioned, and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55 per fully diluted shares, up about 10% over 2016 under the new accounting rule.
With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it's a bit more balanced than most years: divide our guidance by 4, then take $0.10 off the first quarter, $0.05 off the second quarter, add $0.05 to the third quarter and add $0.10 to the fourth quarter, and that should give you the rough progression. 
So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effect of capital deployment.
With respect to capital deployment, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2017 for dividends and share repurchases, which will give a boost to the EPS guidance I've just given you. The amount of that boost will depend on the timing and share price.
For the period 2016 to 2020, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 5.6% and an operating earnings CAGR of 7.1%. This is simply a roll-up of the projections I've given you for the business groups. So we're quite bullish about 2018 through 2020 in all segments.
Now let me end my remarks there, and we'll start taking your questions."

So, look, as it relates to order activity, as I mentioned, we really saw a very encouraging increase in velocity in the second half of the year, and that really is representative across the entire model portfolio, including the new products. I think what we're seeing here is, as we expected, as both the G500 and G600 get closer to entering into service, we're starting to see that order interest continue to pick up. So we feel very good about where those airplanes are as they get closer to the EIS -- their respective EIS dates. 
Overall, as I said, it's not just order activity, which, again, we felt very good about in both the third and fourth quarters, but it's the velocity into what we think of as the pipeline. What comes in sometimes is not the same as what goes out, and we've talked about extended or protracted contract negotiations and the timing it takes to get aircraft contracts signed and completed. And as good as we saw the second half from an order perspective, we saw just as encouraging velocity from the pipeline perspective going into Q1, which I think gives us a good bit of optimism as we start this year from an order perspective. 
With respect to your question about the out-years, as I mentioned, you saw the -- you heard the remarks on 2017 and the CAGR for the out-year period. I think what we see is, as we are transitioning with the real ramp of the 500 starting in '18 and the 600 starting in '19, we'll see modest growth in each of those years from their respective entries into service, and then we'll see really more of the acceleration of the growth starting in 2020 when both of them are fully up and have ramped into the production."

But we do expect to be able to keep up that level of conversion in that range throughout this planning horizon that I described. 
As it relates to free cash flow -- or excuse me, CapEx, typically somewhere in the ballpark of 2% of revenues is where we tend to end up around CapEx. That, of course, depends on the timing and phasing of the various projects across the business. So it can perturbate a little bit back and forth. But certainly what's coming on the horizon with Ohio will bring with it some investment. We're still in the very early phases of discussing what the profile and timing of that looks like with the Navy, and so I don't think we're prepared to discuss any type of outsized CapEx investment in any one year beyond what I just described. But it certainly will -- we do not see it affecting that overall conversion rate through the plan horizon that I just described."

So this is something that I think is more of an issue in this immediate transition as you try to think about '16 prior to restatement and '16 under the restatement and then how you take that restated '16 to then project 2017. 
I will point out one motion. Of the number you see in those exhibits around the difference, the delta, between the green and outfitted airplanes, we do have a number of, I don't have the exact number off the top of my head, but a number of aircraft that are associated with special mission programs, and those get inducted directly into the special mission process and don't go through a completion. So there's a natural delta there. And I'm sure Erin can give you some numbers after the call if we need to get into that level of detail. 
As it relates to the G500 certification, we're still on track this year. Everything is going well with the flight test program. And we're still targeting certification and entry into service, meaning an outfitted delivery, prior to the end of the year."

Look, as Kim described, there really is just one primary meaningful difference that we're talking about as it relates to the defense businesses. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to understate what the team has done here to go through this process because there's a lot of smaller puts and takes, but the big-ticket item is this move from the prospective method of accounting for these changes in our long-term estimates to the cumulative catch-up method. 
So the issue there is there's no one thing you can point to that can say this is directionally indicative from a trend perspective. Because what's happening here, every quarter, every year across the portfolio of these programs, we are performing updates to our estimates at complete, and we're making adjustments across that portfolio to our profit booking rate margins on those programs. So as we do that in a given quarter, you're going to have some programs go up, some programs go down. As you've seen with a number of our peers who have pretty much all been on this method even prior to this point, that can lead to somewhat more volatility under the cumulative catch-up method than we have experienced under the prospective method. 
I think you can reasonably expect somewhere in the order of magnitude, if you compare them to us historically, 2x or so the level of quarterly profit adjustment type impacts on the results. Am I saying that's what we'll see in the future? I can't -- I wouldn't be foolish enough to try and predict that. But it's all going to depend on what happens in a given quarter. 
What you saw in 2016 was that there were a handful more profit rate adjustments that had little to any impact under the prospective method in those periods, but when you take them all in one lump sum, they just drove a little bit more of that anomaly, a little bit more of that perturbation from quarter-to-quarter. So this is what we're going to, frankly, have to get into in a little more detail with you in the future when and if these things happen. And as we've said, we fully expect that somewhat increased level of volatility on a quarterly basis to be part of our story in the future."

We are seeing, frankly, a very good news story that we're bullish on across that period. And so given the restatement here in the period and the fact that you're having to sort of retune '16 as you now look at and evaluate '17, we frankly just thought it would be useful for you to get a little bit more of a picture so you weren't left in isolation with sort of do the 2 data points make a trend or not. Because that can be kind of a tough expectation, I think, for anybody assessing the results. So we wanted to show you a little bit more directional color on where we see the businesses going.

So they're done, done and out. But again, I think the key to remember is, what we're trying to do here in the moment -- and this, I believe, is the last time we'll do this, because green deliveries will just fade out of the discussion from this point forward. But when you're trying to think about in the moment, as we transition between the old rules and the new rules, some of the instinct might be, as you've articulated, that, wow, you get to recount the value associated with these green airplanes that didn't deliver outfitted at the end of 2016. But you have to keep in mind, that was going to happen at the end of 2017 as well, so there's an output on the other end that's sort of that natural flow of the business. And if you think of this as a steady in-production models -- the 650, the 550, the 450, the 280 -- you'd expect sort of that similar cadence coming out the other end. Where we -- so if you just leave it at that, it's essentially a net neutral, or close to it anyway, where I -- or actually Kim articulated it as a modest headwind. And when I say headwind, it's an accounting artifice headwind. It's not a business headwind. 
What's happening there is we would have had, if you imagine a G500 entering into service before the end of the year, there's quite naturally a handful of green G500s that are incremental to those in-production aircraft that are also going to tilt out of '17 and into '18. So on balance, we would see more of an outflow, if you will, or a tilt out of the year in '17 on the back end because of that phenomenon around the entry into service of the G500 even as we are seeing as a tilt inflow from the end of '16 into '17. So hence, our attempt to try to help you understand in the moment as we transition sort of what that impact of the shift of the new rules is on Gulfstream."

So when you look at it, the third quarter was actually higher because we had, on balance, favorable booking rate changes in the fourth quarter across that portfolio; on balance, had some negative book rating changes. Again, under the prospective method, as you're well aware and we've talked about many times, that gets cast out over the future, so there's virtually nil effect in the moment when you make those changes. 
You can see in the results it had a little bit more volatile in effect under the cum catch-up method. 
I don't think you can take that and translate or extend that into what does it mean for the margin rates of the business in 2017 and beyond. Those are pretty much disconnected, I think. Really, that's a function of -- as you know, we've experienced some cost growth at the Bath shipyard on the settlement of the A-12 program and some of the work we're doing on the DDG 1000 as well as the restart of the 51 program there. So that's sort of well documented and discussed. And we're working our way through that. And we have every expectation that we'll get that shipyard back to where we want it to be and as quickly as we can. So that's one influence. 
And the other is, of course, as we add more and more volume around the cost-plus Columbia class development effort, that, of course, is going to be dilutive in terms of margins with respect to how it compares to a fixed-price, full-rate production program. So that's really more what you're seeing going forward."

So look, as it relates to the defense budget, I don't know that there's anything more fundamental assumed than what we are seeing, which is notionally upward directional budgets that sort of underpin and support the defense programs across the board. Really what's it about more so is what's in the backlog. We've developed a historically high backlog across the company, and now we're all about executing that backlog. So a good share of what you see, particularly in Combat Systems and in Marine Systems, is all about just executing on that backlog and continuing to perform the way we have. So that gives us a great deal of confidence about that trajectory that I described. 
As it relates to Aerospace, so I alluded to before, if I had to guess, and I don't want to commit Phebe, but I'm fairly certain this will probably be the last time we talk about green deliveries because it's all about outfitted deliveries in the future. So to your point, right now, as we look at 2017, we're projecting somewhere in the range, from a large-cabin perspective, of, call it, 90 to 95 outfitted deliveries, and from a mid-cabin perspective somewhere in the range of 25 to 30 deliveries. 
As you are well aware, we tend not to look out beyond one year because we set production rates and work through those customer contracts on an annual basis. So we'll continue to update that on an annual basis, but that gives you a sense of what we're seeing as we head into 2017."

So you mentioned the backlog is down just slightly sequentially. And something important to point out there, particularly as it relates to Combat Systems, Kim alluded to the foreign exchange impact in that group as it relates to our annual sales. You have to keep in mind there's equally, if not more so, an impact on, if you will, the balance sheet for sales, that is, the backlog. And so we saw something in the order of magnitude of a $700 million reduction in Combat Systems backlog in 2016 as a result of that FX headwind. So that kind of gives you a sense of what's happening there. 
In terms of opportunities in the pipeline, you're right, it is quite robust, both on the domestic and the international front. We've got a number of competitions. There's an 8 by 8 vehicle in the U.K., there's opportunities in Poland and the Czech Republic, follow-on work in Austria. Really the list kind of goes on and on throughout both Europe and the Middle East for Combat Systems as it relates to international programs. 
Domestically, obviously we are looking forward to the ramp-up with recapitalization efforts and so on as it relates to Stryker ECP, Stryker lethality with the 30-millimeter gun, Abrams upgrades. What else? There's Marine Corps labs. Really it's just a very encouraging and robust list for this group, again, both domestically and across the board internationally. So really exciting to see. 
Your last part of your question, Aerospace slots, I think fundamentally the thing to -- the way to think about this is, with the good order activity we saw in the quarter, we continue to be encouraged by our EIS sort of next available slots for the various aircraft. The 650 remains essentially consistent with where we were last time, 24-ish months or so. The 550 remains in the 12-month range. 450, we actually only have one aircraft left to sell, so we should get that behind us this quarter. Which, by the way, I think is a great testament to this transition and the way Gulfstream has handled this. When you think about it from both sides of the spectrum, on the one end, there was the speculation about could we get the 500 into service when we said we could and doing what we said it would. And certainly the test program is demonstrating so far that it's meeting if not exceeding all of our expectations for what the airplane can do. And as we mentioned -- or I should say Phebe mentioned a quarter ago, we've now officially pulled that EIS in from first quarter '18 to fourth quarter '17. So that's on one end of the spectrum. 
But this point about 1 450 left, possibly the more difficult aspect of this transition was managing the supply chain, the order activity, the inventories and so on to close that out in a timely and secure fashion without exposing the company and manage this transition. And so far, so good. So that is really encouraging. So that's kind of what we see on the horizon from an EIS perspective for the various aircraft."

I'd also like to welcome Kim Kuryea, our Vice President and Controller, to the call and thank her for joining me today. 
Congratulations, Phebe. Welcome, Kim. Now let's get started. 
Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.62 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.23 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $807 million.
The results for the quarter beat analyst consensus by $0.08, mostly on a lower-than-anticipated tax provision. 
Revenue and operating earnings are up significantly against the year ago quarter by 5.4% and 7.8%, respectively.
Earnings from continuing operations are also up $43 million on the strength of a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin, offset in part by a lower effective tax rate in the year ago quarter. Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.22 or 9.2%.
So in summary, against the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue is up 5.4%, operating earnings are up 7.8%, earnings from continuing operations are up 5.6% and fully diluted earnings per share are up 9.2%.
Sequentially, the story is just as wholesome. Revenue is up $502 million or 6.5% and operating earnings are up $48 million or 4.5%. 
Earnings from continuing operations are also up by $40 million. And similarly, earnings per fully diluted share are up $0.14. 
So all in all, a very solid quarter with good performance all around. The Marine group's improved performance, both quarter-over-quarter and sequentially, is notable. In short, we were very pleased with the quarter. 
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.87 on revenue of $31.35 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $3.06 billion. We had full year margins of 13.7%, a record for GD.
Revenue for the year is down $116 million, somewhat less than half of a percent. Operating earnings, on the other hand, are up $131 million or 3.1% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations are up $97 million or 3.3%.
This, together with share repurchase activity and a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate, led quite naturally to an 8.7% improvement in diluted earnings per share. This was a very good year, a year of continuing improvement, a year of accomplishment.
Free cash flow from operations is $678 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.81 billion, which is 59% of earnings from continuing operations. 
As we had advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to be as robust as is typical for us. It was, in fact, less than 100% of net earnings. This happened for 2 reasons: first, we were working off a very large advanced payments received in late 2014 on a major combat systems program; and second, we expected an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream, consistent with building numerous test aircraft and preproduction parts in connection with the G500 and G600 programs. All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively beginning this year. 
In 2017, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 100% of net income,  give or take a little. We should keep this kind of cash performance up throughout the planning horizon. 
Let me briefly give you some color on the quarter in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Revenue was up both quarter-over-quarter and sequentially. Against the year ago quarter, sales are up $82 million or 3.8% and operating earnings are up $26 million or 6.3% as a result of a 50 basis point improvement in margins. 
On a sequential basis, revenue is up $207 million or 10.3% and operating earnings are essentially flat as a result of the anticipated compression in operating margin.
For the year, revenue is $8.36 billion and operating earnings are $1.72 billion with an operating margin of 20.5%. This is a year-over-year reduction of 5.5% in sales, almost $500 million, but operating earnings are up $12 million for the year on a 120 basis point improvement in margins. 
All in all, a very good year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and decent order intake, particularly good in the last half of the year.  This result was consistent with our guidance to you that we would hold earnings even with 2015. As I mentioned, earnings were actually up $12 million over 2015.
Order activity in the quarter was good and pipeline activity was actually robust. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8:1 dollar based and 0.9:1 in units of green delivery at Gulfstream. 
All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good. The second half of 2016 was actually strong from a pace of activity standpoint, and interest in the G500 and 600 is increasing nicely as we get closer to entering into service with these aircraft. 
The Combat Systems revenue was $1.68 billion and is up $160 million or 10.5%. And operating earnings are up $25 million or 10.7% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
Sequentially the story is even better. Sales are up $354 million or 26.6% and operating earnings are up $40 million or 18.3%. For the full year, sales are down $38 million or 0.7%. However, operating earnings are up $32 million or 3.6% on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin.
By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat lower revenue and stronger operating margins. 
Overall, Combat Systems is a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance. As you'll learn later in my remarks, this is a business group poised for quite significant growth in the 2017 to 2020 time frame as we begin delivering on our backlog. 
Marine group revenue of $2.04 billion in the quarter is up $59 million or 3% compared to the year ago quarter and essentially flat on a sequential basis. 
Operating earnings are up $14 million or 8.1% against the year ago quarter and up $20 million or 12% sequentially. 
Revenue for the year is up $189 million or 2.4%. Recall that this year's $189 million increase in annual revenue follows a $701 million increase in 2015 and a $600 million increase in 2014. That's more than 20% growth for the group over that 3-year period.
On the other hand, operating earnings for the year are down $3 million on a 30 basis point reduction in operating margins. 
So the story here is a good quarter on both a quarter-over-quarter and sequential basis. On an annual basis, we experienced better-than-anticipated revenue but not as good as expected operating margin, which left us relatively flat year-over-year. 
In the Information Systems and Technology group, revenue in the quarter is $2.28 billion, up $123 million or 5.7% against the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $244 million in the quarter are 6.1% better than the fourth quarter a year ago.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings are down $12 million or 4.7% on a 20 basis point reduction in margins and a 2.4% reduction in sales.
For the year, revenue is up $222 million or 2.5% and earnings are up $89 million or 9.9% on the strength of a 70 basis point improvement in margins; very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year, we forecast flat operating earnings for the group, so this was a very strong year for IS&T. 
On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2016 was to expect revenue of $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion, an operating margin rate of 13.3% and a tax rate of 29.5% and return on sales of 9.1%.
We wound up the year light on revenue with $31.35 billion, but we exceeded our earnings expectation with operating margins of 13.7%, an effective tax rate of 27.6% and a return on sales of 9.8%. 
Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $9.20. We wound up at $9.87, $0.67 better. About $0.23 of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.25  from a lower-than-planned tax rate and the balance, about $0.19, from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly a very solid year by any measure. 
So before we go to guidance, I want Kim to make a few remarks and then talk about the fundamentals of our accounting rule adoption for 2017 and the restatement of 2016 under these new revenue recognition rules. 
All of the guidance I'll offer you for 2017 and for 2018 through 2020 as well will flow from the restatement of 2016, which is found in exhibits K-1 through K-3 of the press release. Kim?"

I'll start out by touching on just a few miscellaneous items related to 2016's financial performance. The first thing I'll note is the foreign exchange rate volatility that we've seen throughout 2016. In particular, this",1550,"Thanks, Jason, and good morning. I'll start out by touching on just a few miscellaneous items related to 2016's financial performance. 
The first thing I'll note is the foreign exchange rate volatility that we've seen throughout 2016. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on the growth experienced in our Combat Systems group given their increasing international activity. As Jason pointed out, the group's full year revenue was down 0.7% compared to 2015. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2015, the group's sales would have actually increased by 1.5% in 2016.
As a reminder, this has nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. What we're talking about is merely the translation of our various international businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes and the negative effect on that translation that comes with a strengthening U.S. dollar.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
For the full year, interest expense was $91 million versus $83 million in 2015. The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt, yielding more interest expense, and about a $450 million reduction in our cash balance associated with capital deployment activities, which resulted in slightly lower interest income. 
For 2017, we expect net interest expense of around $110 million. The increase is due to the full year effect of the increased debt and lower cash positions. 
We ended 2016 with a cash balance of $2.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.6 billion. That compares with cash of almost $2.8 billion and net debt of about $600 million at the end of 2015. Those changes are attributable to our capital deployment activities, which I'll walk through in just a minute. 
Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the year, very consistent with our 2015 effective rate of 27.7%. Our 2016 outcome was lower than anticipated principally due to the higher-than-expected benefits from increased international activity and employee stock option exercises during the year.
As we look forward to 2017, we expect an effective tax rate of about 28%, reflecting the fact that our international activity continues to increase and the tax benefit associated with stock options being a permanent part of the tax landscape. 
Let's move on to our pension plans. We contributed about $200 million to our plans in 2016, as forecast. For 2017, we expect that amount to be about the same, to be contributed mostly during the third quarter.
A quick note on discontinued operations. In the fourth quarter, we had a net $10 million loss in discontinued operations to record an accrual for an environmental matter related to a business we divested back in the early '80s. 
And finally, to summarize our activities on the capital deployment front for the year. We spent approximately $2 billion to repurchase 14.2 million shares in 2016 at an average price of a little less than $143 per share. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we disbursed $2.9 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2016 or 1.6x our free cash flow from operations for the year. 
Okay, that wraps up the discussion of 2016's financial performance and some expectations for interest expense, tax and pension contributions. Now I'd like to move on to an explanation of our 2017 accounting change.
On January 1 of this year, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC Topic 606, which addresses revenue from contracts with customers. This new standard outlines a 5-step model to determine how and when to recognize revenue on a contract-by-contract basis. 
For the vast majority of our contracts, we will continue to recognize revenue over time similar to what we've done in the past under the percentage of completion method. But for contracts that don't qualify for over time revenue recognition, we'll recognize revenue at a single point in time.
As we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q and in today's press release exhibits, we expect this new standard to have 2 notable impacts on our contract portfolio. 
The first change relates to how we will account for adjustments in our estimates associated with our long-term contracts. Starting in 2017, we'll utilize what's called the cumulative catch-up method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This is similar to what others in our industry have done for many years. 
In 2016 and prior, we used what's called the reallocation method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This meant that any changes in profit we anticipated on our long-term contracts were recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term rather than immediately when identified under the cumulative catch-up method.
As a result of this change, we may see larger and more variable impacts from period to period from adjustments in contract estimates, particularly on our contracts of greater value and with a longer performance period such as in our Marine Systems group.
The second notable change that the new standard will have on our financial statements is in our Aerospace group, specifically at Gulfstream. Starting in 2017, we'll have one revenue recognition point for Gulfstream aircraft: when the customer accepts the outfitted aircraft at entry into service. This is different than the revenue recognition model we utilized in 2016 and before. 
Our past practice had 2 revenue recognition points at 2 distinct contractual milestones: green aircraft delivery and final outfitted delivery. 
It's important to note that these 2 changes and any other changes brought about by the standard impact only the timing of when we recognize revenue and earnings and do not alter our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts.
Now to prepare for an effective discussion of our 2017 guidance, which is based on the new method of revenue recognition, we need a consistent foundation as a point of comparison. Therefore, we restated our 2016 results as if we had been on the new revenue recognition standard for all of 2016. You can see the restated results for 2016 in exhibits K-1 through K-3 of our press release. 
Throughout 2017, as we speak with you and report in our Form 10-Qs, we'll compare our 2017 financial information to the restated 2016 results so all of our comparisons will be on the same basis.
I don't intend to walk you through all of the changes that you can see by examining the exhibits to our press release. But as you can see on Exhibit K-1 for 2016, as restated, both our consolidated revenue and operating earnings decline against the as-reported numbers. Similarly, the margin rate and diluted earnings per share follow suit. The biggest driver of this change is in Aerospace. Please refer to Exhibit K-3 in our press release.
Since under the new standard revenue at Gulfstream is now driven by outfitted deliveries, our restated 2016 revenue is lower, as we had fewer outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. Operating earnings are similarly impacted.
Likewise, operating margins go down due to mix shift between outfitted deliveries and the green deliveries. 
On the other hand, as we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q, the impact on 2015 would have been just the opposite, because in that year there were more outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. There is no other change in cost, pricing, R&D, SG&A spend or services revenue or margins. This is strictly related to the timing of the aircraft deliveries.
So the question is, how will all this impact Aerospace in 2017? Well, Jason will give you detailed guidance shortly. But in general, some of the 2016 green deliveries in excess of the completed deliveries should deliver in the first quarter, thereby giving the first quarter a boost versus the restated fourth quarter. That will be offset later in the year as we experience planned green deliveries that do not enter into service during the year. 
This natural phenomenon will be exacerbated by a number of green G500s that will not have revenue recognized at green delivery because of the new rule. So on balance, for the year, a modest accounting headwind for 2017. 
In short, the impact of these changes depends on the number and the mix of green versus outfitted deliveries in any period. 
Okay, let me wrap up by reminding you of something that I mentioned early in this discussion. This is about an accounting change that, in some circumstances, alters when we recognize revenue and earnings but does not impact our operations, our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts.
When you sit back and think about the restatement of 2016 and prior and everything -- everything that's occurred and been reported up to that point may have shifted around between the quarterly and annual reporting period. But if you look to the end of 2016 and recognize that the operating activities and cash flows of the company are unchanged up to that point, this is all about timing. We just have to look at the past through a new lens so that we can have a meaningful comparison to our future results. 
Jason, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you to address the 2017 guidance."

So let me provide some guidance for 2017 and some commentary on 2018 through 2020 initially by business group and then a company-wide roll-up. 
This year, we did a more detailed and extensive planning exercise around the 3-year period subsequent to 2017. So I want to take this opportunity to share with you our expectations for that period as well.
In Aerospace, we expect 2017 revenue to be $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016 as restated but coincidentally similar to 2016 as reported. 
Operating earnings will be approximately $1.6 billion with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. The margin rate is somewhat lower than prior experience under the legacy accounting rules as a result of mix shift and increased R&D spending as well as an anticipated increase in pre-owned aircraft sales. 
In Aerospace, for the 5-year period 2016 through 2020, that is 2016 as restated, we expect a sales CAGR of 5.3%. That CAGR rolls up modest sales increases in 2018 and 2019 with significant growth in 2020. For the same period, the operating earnings CAGR is expected to be 5.9%. 
These percentages are -- percentages, of course, imply a degree of precision that isn't possible in out-year forecasting. However, we believe they're directionally accurate. 
In Combat Systems, we expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% in 2017 with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. This implies a margin rate of around 15.6%.
For the period 2016 to 2020, the expected sales CAGR is about 8.7% and earnings CAGR about 9.6%. Combat Systems is in a period where several of our international programs are migrating from development, prototyping and low-rate initial production into full-scale production. This supports the growth rates I just discussed. 
The Marine group is expected to have revenue of $7.9 billion, a reduction of 2.6% against 2016 as restated. Operating earnings in 2017 are anticipated to be $680 million to $685 million with an operating margin rate around 8.6%.
The 2016 to 2020 sales CAGR is expected to be 5% with the strongest year-over-year growth in 2018. The expected earnings CAGR for the Marine group for 2016 to 2020 is about 9%. 
Finally, in IS&T, we expect a modest improvement in revenue in 2017 and operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a 2016 to 2020 CAGR for sales and earnings of 4.5% and 5.3%, respectively.
So company-wide, all of this rolls up to $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion of revenue, up over 2016 restated numbers by more than 2.5%; operating earnings of $4.15 billion to $4.2 billion, up over 2016 by about 11.5%; and operating margin around 13.3%, about 110 basis points above 2016 restated.
Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 28% tax provision, as Kim mentioned, and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55 per fully diluted shares, up about 10% over 2016 under the new accounting rule.
With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it's a bit more balanced than most years: divide our guidance by 4, then take $0.10 off the first quarter, $0.05 off the second quarter, add $0.05 to the third quarter and add $0.10 to the fourth quarter. And that should give you the rough progression. 
So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effect of capital deployment.
With respect to capital deployment, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2017 for dividends and share repurchases, which will give a boost to the EPS guidance I've just given you. The amount of that boost will depend on the timing and share price.
For the period 2016 to 2020, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 5.6% and an operating earnings CAGR of 7.1%. This is simply a roll-up of the projections I've given you for the business groups. So we're quite bullish about 2018 through 2020 in all segments.
Now let me end my remarks there, and we'll start taking your questions."

So, look, as it relates to order activity, as I mentioned, we really saw a very encouraging increase in velocity in the second half of the year, and that really is representative across the entire model portfolio, including the new products. I think what we're seeing here is, as we expected, as both the G500 and G600 get closer to entering into service, we're starting to see that order interest continue to pick up. So we feel very good about where those airplanes are as they get closer to the EIS -- their respective EIS dates. 
Overall, as I said, it's not just order activity, which, again, we felt very good about in both the third and fourth quarters, but it's the velocity into the what we think of as the pipeline. What comes in sometimes is not the same as what goes out, and we've talked about extended or protracted contract negotiations and the timing it takes to get aircraft contracts signed and completed. And as good as we saw the second half from an order perspective, we saw just as encouraging velocity from the pipeline perspective going into Q1, which I think gives us a good bit of optimism as we start this year from an order perspective. 
With respect to your question about the out-years, as I mentioned, you saw the -- you heard the remarks on 2017 and the CAGR for the out-year period. I think what we see is, as we are transitioning with the real ramp of the 500 starting in '18 and the 600 starting in '19, we'll see modest growth in each of those years from their respective entries into service, and then we'll see really more of the acceleration of the growth starting in 2020 when both of them are fully up and have ramped into the production."

But we do expect to be able to keep up that level of conversion in that range throughout this planning horizon that I described. 
As it relates to free cash flow -- or excuse me, CapEx, typically somewhere in the ballpark of 2% of revenues is where we tend to end up around CapEx. That, of course, depends on the timing and phasing of the various projects across the business. So it can perturbate a little bit back and forth. But certainly, what's coming on the horizon with Ohio will bring with it some investment. We're still in the very early phases of discussing what the profile and timing of that looks like with the Navy, and so I don't think we're prepared to discuss any type of outsized CapEx investment in any one year beyond what I just described. But it certainly will -- we do not see it affecting that overall conversion rate through the plan horizon that I just described."

I will point out one motion. Of the number you see in those exhibits around the difference, the delta between the green and outfitted airplanes, we do have a number of -- I don't have the exact number off the top of my head, but a number of aircraft that are associated with special mission programs. And those get inducted directly into the special mission process and don't go to a completion. So there's a natural delta there, and I'm sure Erin can give you some numbers after the call if we need to get into that level of detail. 
As it relates to the G500 certification, we're still on track this year. Everything is going well with the flight test program. And we're still targeting certification and entry into service, meaning an outfitted delivery, prior to the end of the year."

Look, as Kim described, there really is just one primary meaningful difference that we're talking about as it relates to the defense businesses. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to understate what the team has done here to go through this process because there's a lot of smaller puts and takes. But the big-ticket item is this move from the prospective method of accounting for these changes in our long-term estimates to the cumulative catch-up method. 
So the issue there is there's no one thing you can point to that can say this is directionally indicative from a trend perspective. Because what's happening here, every quarter, every year across the portfolio of these programs, we are performing updates to our estimates at complete, and we're making adjustments across that portfolio to our profit booking rate margins on those programs. So as we do that in a given quarter, you're going to have some programs go up, some programs go down. As you've seen with a number of our peers who have pretty much all been on this method even prior to this point, that can lead to somewhat more volatility under the cumulative catch-up method than we have experienced under the prospective method. 
I think you can reasonably expect somewhere in the order of magnitude, if you compare them to us historically, 2x or so the level of quarterly profit adjustment type impacts on the results. Am I saying that's what we'll see in the future? I can't -- I wouldn't be foolish enough to try and predict that, but it's all going to depend on what happens in a given quarter. 
What you saw in 2016 was that there were a handful more profit rate adjustments that had little to any impact under the prospective method in those periods. But when you take them all in one lump sum, they just drove a little bit more of that anomaly, a little bit more of that perturbation from quarter-to-quarter. So this is what we're going to frankly have to get into in a little more detail with you in the future when and if these things happen. And as we've said, we fully expect that somewhat increased level of volatility on a quarterly basis to be part of our story in the future."

We are seeing, frankly, a very good news story that we're bullish on across that period. And so given the restatement here in the period and the fact that you're having to sort of retune '16 as you now look at and evaluate '17, we frankly just thought it would be useful for you to get a little bit more of a picture so you weren't left in isolation with sort of the 2 data points make a trend or not. Because that can be kind of a tough expectation, I think, for anybody assessing the results. So we wanted to show you a little bit more directional color on where we see the businesses going. 
And we think as we see that type of growth now coming over that period across the company and really shared by all 4 of our business groups, that, combined with the demonstrated operating leverage we think we've been able to bring to bear, really offers us great earnings trajectory over that midterm planning horizon."

So they're done, done and out. But again, I think the key to remember is, what we're trying to do here in the moment -- and this, I believe, is the last time we'll do this, because green deliveries will just fade out of the discussion from this point forward. But when you're trying to think about in the moment as we transition between the old rules and the new rules, some of the instinct might be, as you've articulated, that, wow, you get to recount the value associated with these green airplanes that didn't deliver outfitted at the end of 2016. But you have to keep in mind that was going to happen at the end of 2017 as well, so there's an output on the other end that's sort of that natural flow of the business. And if you think of this as a steady in-production models, the 650, the 550, the 450, the 280, you'd expect sort of that similar cadence coming out the other end where we -- so if you just leave it at that, it's essentially a net neutral, or close to it anyway, where I -- or actually Kim articulated it as a modest headwind. And when I say headwind, it's an accounting artifice headwind. It's not a business headwind. 
What's happening there is we would have had, if you imagine, a G500 entering into service before the end of the year. There's quite naturally a handful of green G500s that are incremental to those in-production aircraft that are also going to tilt out of '17 and into '18. So on balance, we would see more of an outflow, if you will, or a tilt out of the year in '17 on the back end because of that phenomenon around the entry into service of the G500. Even then, we are seeing as a tilt inflow from the end of '16 into '17. So hence, our attempt to try to help you understand in the moment as we transition sort of what that impact of the shift of the new rules is on Gulfstream."

So when you look at it, the third quarter was actually higher because we had, on balance, favorable booking rate changes in the fourth quarter across that portfolio; on balance, had some negative book rating changes. Again, under the prospective method, as you're well aware and we've talked about many times, that gets cast out over the future, so there's virtually nil effect in the moment when you make those changes. 
You can see in the results it had a little bit more volatile in effect under the cum catch-up method. 
I don't think you can take that and translate or extend that into what does it mean for the margin rates of the business in 2017 and beyond. Those are pretty much disconnected, I think. Really, that's a function of -- as you know, we've experienced some cost growth at the Bath shipyard on the settlement of the A-12 program and some of the work we're doing on the DDG 1000 as well as the restart of the 51 program there. So that's sort of well documented and discussed. And we're working our way through that, and we have every expectation that we'll get that shipyard back to where we want it to be and as quickly as we can. So that's one influence. 
And the other is, of course, as we add more and more volume around the cost-plus Columbia class development effort, that, of course, is going to be dilutive in terms of margins with respect to how it compares to a fixed-price, full-rate production program. So that's really more what you're seeing going forward."

So look, as it relates to the defense budget, I don't know that there's anything more fundamental assumed than what we are seeing, which is notionally upward directional budgets that sort of underpin and support the defense programs across the board. Really what's it about more so is what's in the backlog. We've developed a historically high backlog across the company, and now we're all about executing that backlog. So a good share of what you see, particularly in Combat Systems and in Marine Systems, is all about just executing on that backlog and continuing to perform the way we have. So that gives us a great deal of confidence about that trajectory that I described. 
As it relates to Aerospace, so I alluded to before, if I had to guess, and I don't want to commit, Phebe, but I'm fairly certain this will probably be the last time we talk about green deliveries because it's all about outfitted deliveries in the future. So to your point, right now as we look at 2017, we're projecting somewhere in the range, from a large-cabin perspective, of, call it, 90 to 95 outfitted deliveries. And from a mid-cabin perspective, somewhere in the range of 25 to 30 deliveries. 
As you are well aware, we tend not to look out beyond one year because we set production rates and work through those customer contracts on an annual basis. So we'll continue to update that on an annual basis, but that gives you a sense of what we're seeing as we head into 2017."

So you mentioned the backlog is down just slightly sequentially. And something important to point out there, particularly as it relates to Combat Systems, Kim alluded to the foreign exchange impact in that group as it relates to our annual sales. You have to keep in mind there's equally, if not more so, an impact on the, if you will, the balance sheet for sales, that is, the backlog. And so we saw something in the order of magnitude of a $700 million reduction in Combat Systems backlog in 2016 as a result of that FX headwind. So that kind of gives you a sense of what's happening there. 
In terms of opportunities in the pipeline, you're right, it is quite robust, both on the domestic and the international front. We've got a number of competitions. There's an 8 by 8 vehicle in the U.K., there's opportunities in Poland and the Czech Republic, follow-on work in Austria. Really the list kind of goes on and on throughout both Europe and the Middle East for Combat Systems as it relates to international programs. 
Domestically, obviously we are looking forward to the ramp-up with recapitalization efforts and so on as it relates to Stryker ECP, Stryker lethality with a 30-millimeter gun, Abrams upgrades. What else? There's Marine Corps labs. Really, it's just a very encouraging and robust list for this group, again, both domestically and across the board internationally. So really exciting to see. 
Your last part of your question, Aerospace slots, I think fundamentally, the thing to -- the way to think about this is with the good order activity we saw in the quarter, we continue to be encouraged by our EIS sort of next available slots for the various aircraft. The 650 remains essentially consistent with where we were last time, 24-ish months or so. The 550 remains in the 12-month range. 450, we actually only have one aircraft left to sell, so we should get that behind us this quarter, which by the way, I think, is a great testament to this transition in the way Gulfstream has handled this. When you think about it from both sides of the spectrum, on the one end, there was the speculation about could we get the 500 into service when we said we could and doing what we said it would. And certainly, the test program is demonstrating so far that it's meeting if not exceeding all of our expectations for what the airplane can do. And as we mentioned -- or I should say Phebe mentioned a quarter ago, we've now officially pulled that EIS in from first quarter '18 to fourth quarter '17. So that's on one end of the spectrum. 
But this point about 1 450 left, possibly the more difficult aspect of this transition was managing the supply chain, the order activity, the inventories and so on to close that out in a timely and secure fashion without exposing the company and manage this transition. And so far, so good. So that is really encouraging. So that's kind of what we see on the horizon from an EIS perspective for the various aircraft."

Allison has had a distinguished 14-year career in the finance department, most recently as the Controller for Mission Systems. We are pleased to have her here as our Staff VP for Investor Relations. 
As to the quarter commentary, I will keep my remarks somewhat brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward, quite good, and the comparisons are generally attractive. 
We reported earnings per share of $2.48 on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.4 billion. Operating earnings are slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $763 million. EPS of $2.48 was $0.16 better than consensus. We estimate that about 6 of that $0.16 was from operations in the form of higher-than-expected operating margin, offset modestly by somewhat lower-than-expected revenue. The remainder came from a lower effective tax rate, offset slightly by a somewhat higher-than-anticipated share count. 
With respect to cash, we had $533 million net cash provided by operating activities. After capital expenditure of $62 million, we had $471 million of free cash flow from operations, $56 million more than in the year-ago quarter.
While our total backlog at $60.4 billion is down $1.8 billion from year-end figures, they've remained quite robust. It is also significant to observe that the important funded portion of that backlog grew by approximately $1.5 billion to $53.3 billion. An impressive 88.2% of our total backlog is funded. 
The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter reflect, as you would expect, strong operating performance. All of the comparisons I will give you are with reference to 2016 numbers, as restated for the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules for this year. So compared to the first quarter 2016, revenue was down $35 million or 0.5%. However, our operating earnings were up $111 million or 12% over the prior year's quarter on the strength of 150 basis point improvement in operating margin. The operating margin in the quarter at 13.9% was particularly strong. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was down $213 million or 2.8%, but again, operating earnings were up $267 million or 34.8% on a 390 basis point improvement in margin. All of the foregoing is a reflection of very positive operating leverage. 
Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up 40% or 19.2% -- or $0.40, up 19.2% over the year-ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings and a lower tax rate and share count. 
Let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of each of our operating segment. First, Aerospace. Revenue was up by $293 million compared to Q1 2016, about 16.5% and up $249 million or 13.6% sequentially. Similarly, operating earnings were up $111 million or 33.4% against the year-ago quarter on a 280 basis point expansion in operating margins. Sequentially, operating earnings were up $169 million on a 640 basis point improvement in operating margins. The sequential result needs to be understood in the context of the restated 2016 revenue and earnings resulted from the new revenue recognition rules. In the fourth quarter, we had 9 more green aircraft receipt of certificate of airworthiness, and we had final deliveries to customers. This negatively impacted Q4 2016, as restated, because the green deliveries were no longer recognized. By the same token, we had 4 more entry into service deliveries in Q1 2017 than we had green aircraft receipt of certificate of airworthiness. That obviously helps the first quarter 2017 and should help next quarter as well. 
Orders for the group were typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, net earnings were $1.4 billion, and the dollar based book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter of 2012 through 2016. The aerospace average bookings for the first quarter over the last 5 years were $1.39 billion, a book-to-bill of about 0.7.
So it was a quarter with a lot of sales pipeline replenishment. It was part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. In particular, we noted sharp increases in activity levels in Europe and improved activity in China. I should also note that the activity has been good in April and has clearly shifted in favor of large cabin. This is quite encouraging. 
On the product development front, we anticipate a late completion of all -- or late October completion of all flight test requirements for the G500. This leads us to believe that FAA certification will follow within 60 days thereafter. By the way, we are going to apply our third G600 test airplane today. Think about it this way. We are flying 3 test airplanes in the first 4.5 months since first flight, really quite remarkable. So we are off to a very good start in the aerospace room, somewhat better than our guidance to you at the operating earnings level. We expected a strong first quarter for the reasons we discussed with you at the beginning of the year. However, the operating performance was better than expected.
Let me turn to the defense side of the business with Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, sales were up $42 million or 3.4%, and operating earnings were up $18 million or 9.6% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins. We had particularly strong performance on a quarter to year-ago quarter basis from European Land Systems. Sequentially, revenue was down $374 million, but operating earnings were down only $25 million on a 210 basis point improvement in operating margins. The sequential comparison is particularly difficult on a revenue basis because this always has a very strong fourth quarter largely related to contract deliveries at OTS and EOS. 
Also, in the quarter, we largely completed the transition from engineering and prototype production on our 2 large international vehicle programs for Canada, the Middle East and the U.K. These programs will now enter full production and continue a pace for the next several years.
Even given Combat's large backlog, they had a nice order activity in the quarter with a 0.7x book-to-bill. All in all, extremely strong operating performance once again at Combat Systems.
With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good operating leverage in the quarter. While revenue was down $182 million or 7.8% against the year-ago quarter and down $125 million sequentially, operating earnings of $236 million were essentially flat with the year-ago quarter on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in margins.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $5 million, once again, on an 80 basis point improvement in operating margins. These results are consistent with our guidance of around 11% operating margin. 
I think it's important to note that IS&T's backlog grew by $255 million in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1x, following strong book-to-bill of 1:1, on average, for the last 4 years. The significant orders in the quarter included a $450 million -- $415 million contract from the U.K. Ministry of Defense to design and develop its next-generation communication and information system; $85 million from the NATO Communications and Information Agency to upgrade its technical infrastructure; and $160 million from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency for the new campus seats. So a pretty good start to the year from a new business perspective at IS&T. 
Finally, let's turn to Marine. Revenue of 1.93 was down $188 million or 8.9% compared to the year-ago quarter but up $37 million or 2% sequentially. Operating earnings were down $23 million or 12.5% against the year-ago quarter and up $119 million sequentially. The revenue variance from the year-ago quarter was solely attributable to lower Virginia-class block 3 material volume, offset only partially by higher Colombia-class engineering volume and higher repair volume. Earnings were driven by a delay in the scheduled delivery on 1 ship in block 3 of Virginia-class submarine program. 
Our performance on the Virginia-class program continues to be solid. Also, at EB, we are over 40% complete on the design of the Colombia-class ballistic submarine, 4 years before start of construction. This performance is far better than any submarine first-of-class design maturity to construction start date in history. So we are pleased. 
That ship-over-ship performance on the remainder of the DDG 1000 is outstanding, and we have stabilized the DDG 51. Masco continues to show performance improvement on each of its ships. 
So the company is off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will continue to consolidate our improvements and strive to continue to improve our results. 
I'd like to turn the call over now to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt last year. 
On the capital deployment front, we spent $354 million on the repurchase of 1.9 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $584 million in shareholder-friendly actions during the first quarter, almost 125% of our free cash flow from operations. We continue to anticipate deploying all of our free cash flow this year to share repurchases and dividend. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.7 billion.
As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter. The lower first quarter rate was anticipated based on the timing of the vesting of our restricted stock and the associated tax benefits and is consistent with our full year tax rate forecast. So despite coming out of the gate with a lower rate, we're still anticipating an effective tax rate of about 28% for the year. 
Allison, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So think about flat in the near term. As we go out into the future, then it's our job to manage that growth appropriately. And as you can imagine, with all -- when you think about shipbuilding, it's all about planning. That's really the competitive advantage and the key to success in shipbuilding. So we have put in place very, very detailed hiring plans, training plans, supplier base plans and facility plans to support that growth. So as we sit here today, I'm very comfortable that we are both anticipating and thinking through the potential risk of both."

First, the DDG 1000 and then to your specific question on the 51.

And in fact, we have experienced the best ship-to-ship learning curve we have ever seen at Bath on that program. So to the extent that there was any risk, I believe that is behind us. With respect to the 51, just to give you a little bit of a background, we delivered the 1 15, which was our first ship in -- after the 4-plus-year break in production. We delivered that in February. We just loaded up to 1 16. But let me give you a little color here. That 4-year break caused us a bit of a challenge, which the DDG 1000 program exacerbated. And I think, by way of illustration, a recent example can give you a sense of how we've managed through all of this. For the [ DDG 1002 ], we had late equipment delivery into the shipyard that required us to rephase our production, and it created a production gap between the 1 16 and the 1 18. We will see some learning from ship-to-ship as we realize steady-state production on this. But the costs associated with those challenges were recognized in 2016.

But in this case, we used to have a fairly -- in the balance sheet categorization -- I'll try and be as quick as I can, on these accounts. We used to have what the court extensively related to the defense business and inventory that you could pretty, as a general statement, pretty closely correlate to the Aerospace business. The new rules have us categorizing these 2 accounts as what we call unbilled receivables and inventory now. And it now comingles some of the different pieces of the defense and commercial aerospace businesses. So there were some decreases in inventories associated with the defense businesses in the quarter, offsetting some of the increase that we've talked about in the Gulfstream business as we built up on the 500 and 600 programs. So there's a little bit of netting going on that you're seeing. But still the story on the aerospace and the working capital is consistent with the production ramp we've talked about."

So we had anticipated a lighter volume quarter. It was a touch lighter than we had anticipated, largely because as we changed administrations, we had some slowdown in the execution of the contract line item and a number of particular programs. So our view today is that we are very much poised to recover that, and we're holding to our guidance. Let me touch a little bit about, though, and I think this might be an opportune time, talk a little bit about how we built the guidance for this year and, equally importantly, in the out years. When we built our plan in the fall, we considered only those then known programs. We factored them accordingly and then built into our plans the attendant cash flow. To the extent, across the portfolio, that we see additional funding, that represents upside to us. That's true in Combat, in the Marine group and, particularly, in IS&T. So I think the understanding the context in which you built these plants will help you get some sense of our confidence in our revenue for the year as we stand today."

On the services side, we've been making a series of very targeted, small investments to augment our SBO capability and our managed fleet capability.

Alison has replaced Erin Linnihan, who is now reporting to me in a different capacity. Alison has had a distinguished 14-year career in the finance department, most recently as the Controller for Mission Systems. We are pleased to have her here as our Staff VP for Investor Relations. 
As for the quarter commentary, I will keep my remarks somewhat brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward, quite good, and the comparisons are generally attractive. 
We reported earnings per share of $2.48 on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.4 billion. Operating earnings are slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $763 million. EPS at $2.48 was $0.16 better than consensus. We estimate that about $0.06 of that $0.16 was from operations in the form of higher-than-expected operating margin, offset modestly by somewhat lower-than-expected revenue. The remainder came from a lower effective tax rate, offset slightly by a somewhat higher-than-anticipated share count. 
With respect to cash, we had $533 million net cash provided by operating activities. After capital expenditure of $62 million, we had $471 million of free cash flow from operations, $56 million more than in the year-ago quarter.
While our total backlog at $60.4 billion is down $1.8 billion from year-end figures, it remained quite robust. It is also significant to observe that the important funded portion of that backlog grew by approximately $1.5 billion to $53.3 billion. An impressive 88.2% of our total backlog is funded. 
The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter reflect, as you would expect, strong operating performance. All of the comparisons I will give you are with reference to 2016 numbers, as restated for the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules for this year. So compared to the first quarter 2016, revenue was down $35 million or 0.5%. However, our operating earnings were up $111 million or 12% over the prior year's quarter on the strength of a 150 basis point improvement in operating margin. The operating margin in the quarter at 13.9% was particularly strong. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was down $213 million or 2.8%, but again, operating earnings were up $267 million or 34.8% on a 390 basis point improvement in margin. All of the foregoing is a reflection of very positive operating leverage. 
Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up 40% or 19.2% -- or $0.40, up 19.2% over the year-ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings and a lower tax rate and share count. 
Let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of each of our operating segments. 
First, Aerospace. Revenue was up by $293 million compared to Q1 2016, about 16.5% and up $249 million or 13.6% sequentially. Similarly, operating earnings were up $111 million or 33.4% against the year-ago quarter on a 280 basis point expansion in operating margin. Sequentially, operating earnings were up $169 million on a 640 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
The sequential result needs to be understood in the context of the restated 2016 revenue and earnings resulted from the new revenue recognition rules. In the fourth quarter, we had 9 more green aircraft receipt of certificate of airworthiness than we had final deliveries to customers. This negatively impacted Q4 2016, as restated, because the green deliveries were no longer recognized. By the same token, we had 4 more entry into service deliveries in Q1 2017 than we had green aircraft receipt of certificate of airworthiness. That obviously helped the first quarter 2017 and should help next quarter as well. 
Orders for the group were typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, net earnings were $1.4 billion, and the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter of 2012 through 2016. The aerospace average booking for the first quarter over the last 5 years were $1.39 billion, a book-to-bill of about 0.7.
So it was a quarter with a lot of sales pipeline replenishment. It was part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. In particular, we noted sharp increases in activity levels in Europe and improved activity in China. I should also note that the activity has been good in April and has clearly shifted in favor of large cabin. This is quite encouraging. 
On the product development front, we anticipate a late completion of all -- late October completion of all flight test requirements for the G500. This leads us to believe that FAA certification will follow within 60 days thereafter. And by the way, we are going to apply our third G600 test airplane today. Think about it this way. We are flying 3 test airplanes in the first 4.5 months since first flight, really quite remarkable. 
So we are off to a very good start in the Aerospace group, somewhat better than our guidance to you at the operating earnings level. We expected a strong first quarter for the reasons we've discussed with you at the beginning of the year. However, the operating performance was better than expected.
Let me turn to the defense side of the business with Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, sales were up $42 million or 3.4%, and operating earnings were up $18 million or 9.6% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. We had particularly strong performance on a quarter to year-ago quarter basis from European Land Systems. Sequentially, revenue was down $374 million, but operating earnings were down only $25 million on a 210 basis point improvement in operating margin. The sequential comparison is particularly difficult on a revenue basis because this group always has a very strong fourth quarter largely related to contract deliveries at OTS and EoS. 
Also in the quarter, we largely completed the transition from engineering and prototype production on our 2 large international vehicle programs for Canada, the Mid East and the U.K. These programs will now enter full production and continue apace for the next several years.
Even given Combat's large backlog, they had a nice order activity in the quarter with a 0.7x book-to-bill. All in all, extremely strong operating performance once again at Combat Systems.
With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good operating leverage in the quarter. While revenue was down $182 million or 7.8% against the year-ago quarter and down $125 million sequentially, operating earnings of $236 million were essentially flat with the year-ago quarter on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in margin.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $5 million, once again, on an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin. These results are consistent with our guidance of an around 11% operating margin.
I think it's important to note that IS&T's backlog grew by $255 million in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1x, following strong book-to-bill of 1:1, on average, for the last 4 years. The significant orders in the quarter included a $450 million -- $415 million contract from the U.K. Ministry of Defense to design and develop its next-generation communication and information system; $85 million from the NATO Communication and Information Agency to upgrade its technical infrastructure; and $160 million from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency for the new Campus East. So a pretty good start to the year from a new business perspective at IS&T. 
Finally, let's turn to Marine. Revenue of $1.93 billion was down $188 million or 8.9% compared to the year-ago quarter but up $37 million or 2% sequentially. Operating earnings were down $23 million or 12.5% against the year-ago quarter and up $119 million sequentially. The revenue variance from the year-ago quarter was solely attributable to lower Virginia-class block 3 material volume, offset only partially by higher Colombia-class engineering volume and higher repair volume. Earnings were driven by a delay in the scheduled delivery on 1 ship in block 3 of Virginia-class submarine program. 
Our performance on the Virginia-class program continues to be solid. Also at EB, we are over 40% complete on the design of the Colombia-class ballistic missile submarine, 4 years before start of construction. This performance is far better than any submarine first-of-class design maturity to construction start date in history. So we are pleased. 
Bath ship-over-ship performance on the remainder of the DDG 1000s is outstanding, and we have stabilized the DDG 51s. NASSCO continues to show performance improvement on each of its ships. 
So the company is off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will continue to consolidate our improvements and strive to continue to improve our results. 
I'd like to turn the call over now to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt last year. 
On the capital deployment front, we spent $354 million on the repurchase of 1.9 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $584 million in shareholder-friendly actions during the first quarter, almost 125% of our free cash flow from operations. We continue to anticipate deploying all of our free cash flow this year to share repurchases and dividends. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.7 billion.
As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter. The lower first quarter rate was anticipated based on the timing of the vesting of our restricted stock and the associated tax benefit and is consistent with our full year tax rate forecast. So despite coming out of the gate with a lower rate, we're still anticipating an effective tax rate of about 28% for the year. 
Alison, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

And as you can imagine, with all -- when you think about shipbuilding, it's all about planning. That's really the competitive advantage and the key to success in shipbuilding. So we have put in place very, very detailed hiring plans, training plans, supplier base plans and facility plans to support that growth.

With respect to the 51s, just to give you a little bit of a background, we delivered the 115, which is -- was our first ship in -- after the 4-plus-year break in production. We delivered that in February. We just floated off the 116. But let me give you a little color here. That 4-year break caused us a bit of a challenge, which the DDG 1000 program exacerbated. And I think, by way of illustration, a recent example can give you a sense of how we've managed through all of this. For the DDG 1002, we had late equipment delivery into the shipyard that required us to re-phase our production, and it created a production gap between the 116 and the 118. We will see some learning from ship-to-ship as we realize steady-state production on this. But the costs associated with those challenges were recognized in 2016.

So the disequilibrium that I think I talked about back in '13, where we had a bunch of 650s on the tarmac that we had to go back in and retrofit, we do not anticipate anything like that for the 500 and 600 simply because the test airplane were really manufactured to production standard. So we won't go back. And as we have had changes and updates in some design parameters, we've done those at that time. So I don't anticipate -- in fact, there's nothing to indicate that we would see anything like we did in the 650. Does that answer your question?"

The new rules have us categorizing these 2 accounts as what we called unbilled receivables in inventories now. And it now comingles some of the different pieces of the defense and commercial Aerospace businesses. So there were some decreases in inventories associated with the defense businesses in the quarter, offsetting some of the increase that we've talked about in the Gulfstream business as we built up on the 500 and 600 programs. So there's a little bit of netting going on in there that you're seeing.

With respect to the IS&T revenue, let me talk about 2 things here. We had anticipated -- remember, these are 2 -- that the 2 businesses in that group are short-cycle businesses. So we had anticipated a lighter-volume quarter. It was a touch lighter than we had anticipated largely because as we changed administrations, there -- we had some slowdown in the execution of the contract line item in a number of particular programs. So our view today is that we are very much poised to recover that, and we're holding to our guidance. Let me touch a little bit about, though, and I think this might be an opportune time, talk to you a little bit about how we built the guidance for this year, and equally importantly, in the out years. When we built our plan in the fall, we considered only those then-known programs. We factored them accordingly and then built into our plans the [ intended ] cash flow. To the extent, across the defense portfolio, that we see additional funding, that represents upside to us. That's true in combat, in the marine group and particularly in IS&T.

Alison has replaced Erin Linnihan, who is now reporting to me in a different capacity. Alison has had a distinguished 14-year career in the finance department, most recently as the Controller for Mission Systems. We are pleased to have her here as our Staff VP for Investor Relations. 
As for the quarter commentary, I will keep my remarks somewhat brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward, quite good, and the comparisons are generally attractive. 
We reported earnings per share of $2.48 on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.4 billion. Operating earnings are slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $763 million. EPS at $2.48 was $0.16 better than consensus. We estimate that about $0.06 of that $0.16 was from operations in the form of higher-than-expected operating margin, offset modestly by somewhat lower-than-expected revenue. The remainder came from a lower effective tax rate, offset slightly by a somewhat higher-than-anticipated share count. 
With respect to cash, we had $533 million net cash provided by operating activities. After capital expenditure of $62 million, we had $471 million of free cash flow from operations, $56 million more than in the year-ago quarter.
While our total backlog at $60.4 billion is down $1.8 billion from year-end figures, it remained quite robust. It is also significant to observe that the important funded portion of that backlog grew by approximately $1.5 billion to $53.3 billion. An impressive 88.2% of our total backlog is funded. 
The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter reflect, as you would expect, strong operating performance. All of the comparisons I will give you are with reference to 2016 numbers, as restated for the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules for this year. So compared to the first quarter 2016, revenue was down $35 million or 0.5%. However, our operating earnings were up $111 million or 12% over the prior year's quarter on the strength of a 150 basis point improvement in operating margin. The operating margin in the quarter at 13.9% was particularly strong. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was down $213 million or 2.8%, but again, operating earnings were up $267 million or 34.8% on a 390 basis point improvement in margin. All of the foregoing is a reflection of very positive operating leverage. 
Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up 40% or 19.2% -- or $0.40, up 19.2% over the year-ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings and a lower tax rate and share count. 
Let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of each of our operating segments. 
First, Aerospace. Revenue was up by $293 million compared to Q1 2016, about 16.5% and up $249 million or 13.6% sequentially. Similarly, operating earnings were up $111 million or 33.4% against the year-ago quarter on a 280 basis point expansion in operating margin. Sequentially, operating earnings were up $169 million on a 640 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
The sequential result needs to be understood in the context of the restated 2016 revenue and earnings resulted from the new revenue recognition rules. In the fourth quarter, we had 9 more green aircraft receipt of certificate of airworthiness than we had final deliveries to customers. This negatively impacted Q4 2016, as we stated, because the green deliveries were no longer recognized. By the same token, we had 4 more entry into service deliveries in Q1 2017 than we had green aircraft receipt of certificate of airworthiness. That obviously helped the first quarter 2017 and should help next quarter as well. 
Orders for the group were typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, net earnings were $1.4 billion, and the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter of 2012 through 2016. The aerospace average booking for the first quarter over the last 5 years were $1.39 billion, a book-to-bill of about 0.7.
So it was a quarter with a lot of sales pipeline replenishment. It was part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. In particular, we noted sharp increases in activity levels in Europe and improved activity in China. I should also note that the activity has been good in April and has clearly shifted in favor of large cabin. This is quite encouraging. 
On the product development front, we anticipate a late completion of all -- late October completion of all flight test requirements for the G500. This leads us to believe that FAA certification will follow within 60 days thereafter. And by the way, we are going to fly our third G600 test airplane today. Think about it this way. We are flying 3 test airplanes in the first 4.5 months since first flight, really quite remarkable. 
So we are off to a very good start in the Aerospace group, somewhat better than our guidance to you at the operating earnings level. We expected a strong first quarter for the reasons we've discussed with you at the beginning of the year. However, the operating performance was better than expected.
Let me turn to the defense side of the business with Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, sales were up $42 million or 3.4%, and operating earnings were up $18 million or 9.6% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. We had particularly strong performance on a quarter to year-ago quarter basis from European Land Systems. Sequentially, revenue was down $374 million, but operating earnings were down only $25 million on a 210 basis point improvement in operating margin. The sequential comparison is particularly difficult on a revenue basis because this group always has a very strong fourth quarter largely related to contract deliveries at OTS and EoS. 
Also in the quarter, we largely completed the transition from engineering and prototype production on our 2 large international vehicle programs for Canada, the Mid East and the U.K. These programs will now enter full production and continue apace for the next several years.
Even given Combat's large backlog, they had a nice order activity in the quarter with a 0.7x book-to-bill. All in all, extremely strong operating performance once again at Combat Systems.
With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good operating leverage in the quarter. While revenue was down $182 million or 7.8% against the year-ago quarter and down $125 million sequentially, operating earnings of $236 million were essentially flat with the year-ago quarter on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in margin.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $5 million, once again, on an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin. These results are consistent with our guidance of an around 11% operating margin.
I think it's important to note that IS&T's backlog grew by $255 million in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1x, following strong book-to-bill of 1:1, on average, for the last 4 years. The significant orders in the quarter included a $450 million -- $415 million contract from the U.K. Ministry of Defense to design and develop its next-generation communication and information system; $85 million from the NATO Communication and Information Agency to upgrade its technical infrastructure; and $160 million from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency for the new Campus East. So a pretty good start to the year from a new business perspective at IS&T. 
Finally, let's turn to Marine. Revenue of $1.93 billion was down $188 million or 8.9% compared to the year-ago quarter but up $37 million or 2% sequentially. Operating earnings were down $23 million or 12.5% against the year-ago quarter and up $119 million sequentially. The revenue variance from the year-ago quarter was solely attributable to lower Virginia-class block 3 material volume, offset only partially by higher Colombia-class engineering volume and higher repair volume. Earnings were driven by a delay in the scheduled delivery on 1 ship in block 3 of Virginia-class submarine program. 
Our performance on the Virginia-class program continues to be solid. Also at EB, we are already over 40% complete on the design of the Colombia-class ballistic missile submarine, 4 years before start of construction. This performance is far better than any submarine first-of-class design maturity to construction start date in history. So we are pleased. 
Bath ship-over-ship performance on the remainder of the DDG 1000s is outstanding, and we have stabilized the DDG 51s. NASSCO continues to show performance improvement on each of its ships. 
So the company is off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will continue to consolidate our improvements and strive to continue to improve our results. 
I'd like to turn the call over now to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt last year. 
On the capital deployment front, we spent $354 million on the repurchase of 1.9 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $584 million in shareholder-friendly actions during the first quarter, almost 125% of our free cash flow from operations. We continue to anticipate deploying all of our free cash flow this year to share repurchases and dividends. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.7 billion.
As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter. The lower first quarter rate was anticipated based on the timing of the vesting of our restricted stock and the associated tax benefit and is consistent with our full year tax rate forecast. So despite coming out of the gate with a lower rate, we're still anticipating an effective tax rate of about 28% for the year. 
Alison, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So think about flat in the near term. As we go out into the future, then it's our job to manage that growth appropriately. And as you can imagine, with all -- when you think about shipbuilding, it's all about planning. That's really the competitive advantage and the key to success in shipbuilding. So we have put in place very, very detailed hiring plans, training plans, supplier base plans and facility plans to support that growth. So as we sit here today, I'm very comfortable that we are both anticipating and thinking through the potential risk of both."

And in fact, we have experienced the best ship-to-ship learning curve we have ever seen at Bath on that program. So to the extent that there was any risk, I believe that is behind us. With respect to the 51s, just to give you a little bit of a background, we delivered the 115, which is -- was our first ship in -- after the 4-plus-year break in production. We delivered that in February. We just floated off the 116. But let me give you a little color here. That 4-year break caused us a bit of a challenge, which the DDG 1000 program exacerbated. And I think, by way of illustration, a recent example can give you a sense of how we've managed through all of this. For the DDG 1002, we had late equipment delivery into the shipyard that required us to re-phase our production, and it created a production gap between the 116 and the 118. We will see some learning from ship-to-ship as we realize steady-state production on this. But the costs associated with those challenges were recognized in 2016.

So the disequilibrium that I think I talked about back in '13, where we had a bunch of 650s on the tarmac that we had to go back in and retrofit, we do not anticipate anything like that for the 500 and 600 simply because the test airplane were really manufactured to production standard.

The new rules have us categorizing these 2 accounts as what we called unbilled receivables in inventories now. And it now co-mingles some of the different pieces of the defense and commercial Aerospace businesses. So there were some decreases in inventories associated with the defense businesses in the quarter, offsetting some of the increase that we've talked about in the Gulfstream business as we built up on the 500 and 600 programs. So there's a little bit of netting going on in there that you're seeing.

So we had anticipated a lighter-volume quarter. It was a touch lighter than we had anticipated largely because as we changed administrations, there -- we had some slowdown in the execution of the contract line items in a number of particular programs. So our view today is that we are very much poised to recover that, and we're holding to our guidance. Let me touch a little bit about, though, and I think this might be an opportune time, talk to you a little bit about how we built the guidance for this year, and equally importantly, in the out years. When we built our plan in the fall, we considered only those then-known programs. We factored them accordingly and then built into our plans the attendant cash flow. To the extent, across the defense portfolio, that we see additional funding, that represents upside to us. That's true in combat, in the marine group and particularly in IS&T.

Alison has replaced Erin Linnihan, who is now reporting to me in a different capacity. Alison has had a distinguished 14-year career in the finance department, most recently as the Controller for Mission Systems. We are pleased to have her here as our Staff VP for Investor Relations. 
As for the quarter commentary, I will keep my remarks somewhat brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward, quite good, and the comparisons are generally attractive. 
We reported earnings per share of $2.48 on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.4 billion. Operating earnings are slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $763 million. EPS at $2.48 was $0.16 better than consensus. We estimate that about $0.06 of that $0.16 was from operations in the form of higher-than-expected operating margin, offset modestly by somewhat lower-than-expected revenue. The remainder came from a lower effective tax rate, offset slightly by a somewhat higher-than-anticipated share count. 
With respect to cash, we had $533 million net cash provided by operating activities. After capital expenditure of $62 million, we had $471 million of free cash flow from operations, $56 million more than in the year-ago quarter.
While our total backlog at $60.4 billion is down $1.8 billion from year-end figures, it remained quite robust. It is also significant to observe that the important funded portion of that backlog grew by approximately $1.5 billion to $53.3 billion. An impressive 88.2% of our total backlog is funded. 
The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter reflect, as you would expect, strong operating performance. All of the comparisons I will give you are with reference to 2016 numbers, as restated for the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules for this year. So compared to the first quarter 2016, revenue was down $35 million or 0.5%. However, our operating earnings were up $111 million or 12% over the prior year's quarter on the strength of a 150 basis point improvement in operating margin. The operating margin in the quarter at 13.9% was particularly strong. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was down $213 million or 2.8%, but again, operating earnings were up $267 million or 34.8% on a 390 basis point improvement in margin. All of the foregoing is a reflection of very positive operating leverage. 
Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up 40% or 19.2% -- or $0.40, up 19.2% over the year-ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings and a lower tax rate and share count. 
Let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of each of our operating segments. 
First, Aerospace. Revenue was up by $293 million compared to Q1 2016, about 16.5% and up $249 million or 13.6% sequentially. Similarly, operating earnings were up $111 million or 33.4% against the year-ago quarter on a 280 basis point expansion in operating margin. Sequentially, operating earnings were up $169 million on a 640 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
The sequential result needs to be understood in the context of the restated 2016 revenue and earnings resulted from the new revenue recognition rules. In the fourth quarter, we had 9 more green aircraft receipt of certificate of airworthiness than we had final deliveries to customers. This negatively impacted Q4 2016, as we stated, because the green deliveries were no longer recognized. By the same token, we had 4 more entry into service deliveries in Q1 2017 than we had green aircraft receipt of certificate of airworthiness. That obviously helped the first quarter 2017 and should help next quarter as well. 
Orders for the group were typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, net earnings were $1.4 billion, and the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter of 2012 through 2016. The aerospace average booking for the first quarter over the last 5 years were $1.39 billion, a book-to-bill of about 0.7.
So it was a quarter with a lot of sales pipeline replenishment. It was part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. In particular, we noted sharp increases in activity levels in Europe and improved activity in China. I should also note that the activity has been good in April and has clearly shifted in favor of large cabin. This is quite encouraging. 
On the product development front, we anticipate a late completion of all -- late October completion of all flight test requirements for the G500. This leads us to believe that FAA certification will follow within 60 days thereafter. And by the way, we are going to fly our third G600 test airplane today. Think about it this way. We are flying 3 test airplanes in the first 4.5 months since first flight, really quite remarkable. 
So we are off to a very good start in the Aerospace group, somewhat better than our guidance to you at the operating earnings level. We expected a strong first quarter for the reasons we've discussed with you at the beginning of the year. However, the operating performance was better than expected.
Let me turn to the defense side of the business with Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, sales were up $42 million or 3.4%, and operating earnings were up $18 million or 9.6% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. We had particularly strong performance on a quarter to year-ago quarter basis from European Land Systems. Sequentially, revenue was down $374 million, but operating earnings were down only $25 million on a 210 basis point improvement in operating margin. The sequential comparison is particularly difficult on a revenue basis because this group always has a very strong fourth quarter largely related to contract deliveries at OTS and EoS. 
Also in the quarter, we largely completed the transition from engineering and prototype production on our 2 large international vehicle programs for Canada, the Mid East and the U.K. These programs will now enter full production and continue apace for the next several years.
Even given Combat's large backlog, they had a nice order activity in the quarter with a 0.7x book-to-bill. All in all, extremely strong operating performance once again at Combat Systems.
With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good operating leverage in the quarter. While revenue was down $182 million or 7.8% against the year-ago quarter and down $125 million sequentially, operating earnings of $236 million were essentially flat with the year-ago quarter on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in margin.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $5 million, once again, on an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin. These results are consistent with our guidance of an around 11% operating margin.
I think it's important to note that IS&T's backlog grew by $255 million in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1x, following strong book-to-bill of 1:1, on average, for the last 4 years. The significant orders in the quarter included a $450 million -- $415 million contract from the U.K. Ministry of Defense to design and develop its next-generation communication and information system; $85 million from the NATO Communication and Information Agency to upgrade its technical infrastructure; and $160 million from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency for the new Campus East. So a pretty good start to the year from a new business perspective at IS&T. 
Finally, let's turn to Marine. Revenue of $1.93 billion was down $188 million or 8.9% compared to the year-ago quarter but up $37 million or 2% sequentially. Operating earnings were down $23 million or 12.5% against the year-ago quarter and up $119 million sequentially. The revenue variance from the year-ago quarter was solely attributable to lower Virginia-class block 3 material volume, offset only partially by higher Colombia-class engineering volume and higher repair volume. Earnings were driven by a delay in the scheduled delivery on 1 ship in block 3 of Virginia-class submarine program. 
Our performance on the Virginia-class program continues to be solid. Also at EB, we are already over 40% complete on the design of the Colombia-class ballistic missile submarine, 4 years before start of construction. This performance is far better than any submarine first-of-class design maturity to construction start date in history. So we are pleased. 
Bath ship-over-ship performance on the remainder of the DDG 1000s is outstanding, and we have stabilized the DDG 51s. NASSCO continues to show performance improvement on each of its ships. 
So the company is off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will continue to consolidate our improvements and strive to continue to improve our results. 
I'd like to turn the call over now to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt last year. 
On the capital deployment front, we spent $354 million on the repurchase of 1.9 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $584 million in shareholder-friendly actions during the first quarter, almost 125% of our free cash flow from operations. We continue to anticipate deploying all of our free cash flow this year to share repurchases and dividends. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.7 billion.
As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter. The lower first quarter rate was anticipated based on the timing of the vesting of our restricted stock and the associated tax benefit and is consistent with our full year tax rate forecast. So despite coming out of the gate with a lower rate, we're still anticipating an effective tax rate of about 28% for the year. 
Alison, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

And as you can imagine, with all -- when you think about shipbuilding, it's all about planning. That's really the competitive advantage and the key to success in shipbuilding. So we have put in place very, very detailed hiring plans, training plans, supplier base plans and facility plans to support that growth.

And in fact, we have experienced the best ship-to-ship learning curve we have ever seen at Bath on that program. So to the extent that there was any risk, I believe that is behind us. With respect to the 51s, just to give you a little bit of a background, we delivered the 115, which is -- was our first ship in -- after the 4-plus-year break in production. We delivered that in February. We just floated off the 116. But let me give you a little color here. That 4-year break caused us a bit of a challenge, which the DDG 1000 program exacerbated. And I think, by way of illustration, a recent example can give you a sense of how we've managed through all of this. For the DDG 1002, we had late equipment delivery into the shipyard that required us to re-phase our production, and it created a production gap between the 116 and the 118. We will see some learning from ship-to-ship as we realize steady-state production on this. But the costs associated with those challenges were recognized in 2016. So going forward, I'm very comfortable that the performance at Bath has stabilized. I like where they are."

The new rules have us categorizing these 2 accounts as what we called unbilled receivables in inventories now. And it now co-mingles some of the different pieces of the defense and commercial Aerospace businesses. So there were some decreases in inventories associated with the defense businesses in the quarter, offsetting some of the increase that we've talked about in the Gulfstream business as we built up on the 500 and 600 programs. So there's a little bit of netting going on in there that you're seeing.

So we had anticipated a lighter-volume quarter. It was a touch lighter than we had anticipated largely because as we changed administrations, there -- we had some slowdown in the execution of the contract line items in a number of particular programs. So our view today is that we are very much poised to recover that, and we're holding to our guidance. Let me touch a little bit about, though, and I think this might be an opportune time, talk to you a little bit about how we built the guidance for this year, and equally importantly, in the out years. When we built our plan in the fall, we considered only those then-known programs. We factored them accordingly and then built into our plans the attendant cash flow. To the extent, across the defense portfolio, that we see additional funding, that represents upside to us. That's true in combat, in the marine group and particularly in IS&T.

As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a solid second quarter with revenue of $7.68 billion and net earnings of $749 million. We reported EPS of $2.45 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year ago quarter and $0.02",2133,"Good morning. As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a solid second quarter with revenue of $7.68 billion and net earnings of $749 million. We reported EPS of $2.45 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year ago quarter and $0.02 per share better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that the sell side anticipated somewhat more revenue but lower margins and a somewhat higher tax rate. Operating earnings were about as forecast by the sell side. All in all, pretty close. 
Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue of $7.68 billion was $99 million or 1.3% lower. However, net earnings of $749 million were up $35 million or 4.9% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margins and 160 basis point lower effective tax rate. This led to EPS that was 6.5% better than the year ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue was up $234 million or 3.1% and operating earnings were up $21 million or 2% on a 10 basis point lower operating margin, still very respectable 13.8%. 
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Revenue was down $134 million, less than 1% against the first half of 2016. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $140 million or 7.2% on lower cost. Operating margins were 100 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $144 million or 10.5%. EPS was $0.55 better. 
In short, we had a very good first half, somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations and well ahead of last year. This leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance in a minute. 
But first let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and wrap that into our EPS guidance. 
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $2.08 billion was $206 million lower than the year ago quarter. However, operating earnings of $425 million or $1 million more on 190 basis point improvement in operating margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $4 million and operating earnings were down $18 million on a 90 basis points reduction in margin but remaining in excess of 20%. For the first half, revenue at $4.15 billion is up, $87 million against last year. Importantly, operating earnings at $868 million are up $112 million or 14.8% on a 230 basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $868 million in operating earnings for the first half of the year, aerospace is well positioned to achieve its earnings goals for the year. 
By the way, the call we previously told you that the new revenue recognition rules which helped us in the first 2 quarters of the year has had a negative impact in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. So expect lower operating margins in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter. You'll see this reflected in our guidance. 
Let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter and then some observations about the current state of the market, insofar as it impacts all stream. First in the quarter, the dollar-based book to bill was 0.9 to 1, which is very good. The mix is particularly advantageous. It was over 8% of the orders for large cabin aircraft. The G500 and 600 continue to build backlogs in advance of their entry into service, sufficient to ensure the success of these programs. Interestingly, the G550 bill backlog is well in the quarter. While we read the reports of weak demand and reduced deliveries across the industry, our experience is reasonable and steady demand for our products. We will deliver as many airplanes this year as we did last on an entry into service basis. 
Commentators frequently speak of weakness in the large-cabin market. Let me say that it is misleading to speak of a highly differentiated marketplace as if it were 1 market. Parts of the market are very active, particularly those market segments where there is new product. There are also market segments that are slow,, a largely because of the absence of product introduction. So we believe that the market is not only differentiated by segment, but also by the innovative offerings within this segment. 
We believe this is why demand for our products remain fairly consistent. We are comfortable with the anticipated third quarter orders based on early contract activity and contract discussion. The interest in the G650 and 650ER as well as the 550 remains quite good and supportive of next year's operating plan. In short, we expect a good third quarter and a second half from an orders perspective. 
Now let me say a few words about our progress towards certification of the G500 and 600. The G500 and 600 flying continues to go well. The aircraft are performing reliably and on schedule. The G500 testing includes 4 tests aircraft and 1 production aircraft with the full interior. The 4 test aircraft have entered the Tight Inspection Authorization or TIA flying phase. This phase is for actual certification credit. FAA pilots have joined Gulfstream flight crews on this TIA test. We continue to work collaboratively with the FAA to ensure optimal safety and efficient use of resources. We expect to complete certification flying in Q4 '17. Additionally, we continue to work closely with our suppliers to complete all component level testing this year. Once we have completed certification, the interior test aircraft, P-1, will enter service as our G500 demonstrator. It is important to note, however, that the G500 will not have any impact to revenue and earnings this year. That is the result of the new revenue recognition rule. 
The G600 now has 4 tests aircraft flying and the interior is being installed in the first production aircraft. We remain on schedule to certify in 2018. 
Let's now turn to the defense side of the house. First, combat system. Combat had a very good quarter as a relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.41 billion was $117 million more than the second quarter last year, up 9%. Similarly, operating earnings were $225 million, up $20 million, almost 10% better than second quarter 2016. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $127 million or almost 10% and operating earnings were up $20 million, again, almost 10% better. 
For the first half, revenue was up $159 million or 6.3% against the first half of 2016. Operating earnings were up $38 million, 9.7% on a 50 basis point margin expansion. Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well across our platforms, departments and ammunition portfolio. We continue to move nicely from engineering to production on our 2 large international orders. We also continue to win programs particularly out of our European Land Systems business. We are obviously trending in the right direction at combat systems. 
With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $2.08 billion with $101 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $6 million against the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $145 million and operating earnings were up $17 million on the higher revenue and a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, revenue of $4.01 billion was down $87 million or 2.1% against the first half of 2015. Operating earnings were also lower by [ 17 ] on a 30 basis points construction on margin. Work on our submarine programs, that is production on Block 3 and 4 for the Virginia class and engineering on the Columbia ballistic-missile submarine replacement, continue to perform nicely. 
With respect to our [indiscernible] shipyard, the challenges on the DDG 1000 and 51 restart ships are largely behind us and our ancillary ship and commercial businesses continues smoothly. In addition, we have seen an uptick in demand for repair across our repair yards, primarily in San Diego and Washington state. Marine Systems had been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so. Our operating margin should continue to improve over time. 
Turning to IS&T. The group continues to perform well on the bottom line despite some revenue headwind. Revenue of $2.1 billion was down $111 million against the year to quarter. On the other hand, operating earnings of $240 million were up against the year ago quarter by $6 million. There was an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, which is particularly impressive. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $42 million or 2%, but operating earnings were up $4 million on a 40 basis points improvement in margin. This quarter's 11.4% operating margin is exceptional in my view. 
The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue was down $293 million or 6.4%, but operating earnings were up $5 million on an 80 basis point improvement in margins. So once again, very strong operating leverage. For both our IT services and tactical communications and Intel business, our cost performance and market positioning have driven very nice win rates, not surprisingly, our IS&T backlog grew $175 million in the quarter with a book-to-bill of greater than 1 to 1 once again. In short, we believe the segment results leave us positioned to do well in the second half. 
Before I move on, let me give you a sense of the Defense environment, at least from my perspective. There's clear intent in the administration and in parts of the Congress for increased defense spending. We believe this intent will manifest in some level of increased defense spending in the procurement and R&D accounts. The question is how much and when? Relevant considerations include the dispatch with which Congress approved a higher defense budget and how soon the administration can propose and the Congress can approve the department senior leadership appointment. Without these appointments, it is difficult to process contracts and get authorized and appropriated funds obligated to contract. At this juncture, both are proceeding more slowly than we thought would happen. Nevertheless, we remain confident in the direction of Defense spending. 
So turning to guidance. Let me provide some guidance for the year for each segment, compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our driver EPS outlook. For aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016, operating earnings of approximately $1.6 billion with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. We now expect to be approximately $8.1 billion of revenue with margins of 19.5% to 19.6%. This implies pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. This will result in no change to the operating earnings forecast, still a very strong industry-leading performance. 
For combat, our previous guidance was to expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% over 2016, with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.9 billion, just slightly above the 7% growth over last year. And operating earnings of $925 million to $930 million. So pretty close to the original guidance with a slight upward bias. For the Marine group, we previously guided to revenue of $7.9 billion, margins at around 8.6% and operating earnings of $680  million to $685 million. We now expect revenue to be up another $160 million to $165 million, with margins consistent with the previous forecast, resulting in a modest improvement in operating earnings. 
For IS&T, we've got into revenue up modestly over 2016, operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion, with a margin rate of around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast is essentially flat and that operating earnings will be somewhat better at about 11.2% to 11.4%. So all of this rose up into revenue for General Dynamics of about $31 billion and operating margins of 13.3% to 13.5 -- 13.4% to 13.5%. Compared to initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue, operating earnings at the higher end of the forecasted range, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70 to $9.75. 
To help you further, our EPS guidance was $9.50 to $9.55. The $0.20 difference is $0.05 from operations, $0.05 to $0.06 from a lower tax rate and about $0.09 to $0.10 from share purchases. The EPS progression for the remainder of the year is down slightly in Q3 versus Q3 with Q4 looking similar this quarter. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $24 million versus $23 million in the second quarter of 2016. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $49 million versus $45 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt last year. 
For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $105 million. Our effective tax rate was 27.4% for the quarter and 26% year-to-date. As Phebe mentioned, we're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of 27.5%. That reflects a greater benefit associated with employee stock option exercises than originally anticipated. On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter, we purchased 2.7 million shares, bringing us to 4.6 million shares in the first half of the year for $900 million. In total, when combined with the dividend we've paid, through the first 6 months of 2017, we've spent $1.4 billion in shareholder friendly capital deployment, more than 1.5x our $857 million of free cash flow for the first half. This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $2.1 billion. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year to approximate 100% of the earnings and, in turn, deploying 100% of that free cash flow share repurchases and dividends. Allison, that concludes my remarks. And I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So that is pretty much a question of timing as the military services gear back up on their execution. The second side is on our services business. We had very slow execution of programs in several civilian agencies, primarily driven by uncertainty and in some cases, reduction in funding levels. I suspect some of that we'll obtain through the course of the year until the administration sorts out some of the funding for some of the civilian agencies.

Really, what we're seeing there is as we're moving from what we experienced in the past couple of years with large advanced payments and then the burn down of those advanced payments, which we've talked about at this point. As we move into production, you're seeing a more typical buildup of the unbilled receivables prior to delivery. And as we did move into the ramp up of deliveries, we'll begin to liquidate that unbilled receivables and we expect to see that the start to turn in the second half and hence, a bit more of the web and cash for the second half.

The design is going extremely well and we're on track to begin the build process exactly where we have thought we would. So we see the undersea deterrent and the undersea war fighting capability of the U.S. Navy as a key national security imperatives, as clearly evidenced by the Navy's interest in increasing subs. With respect to NASSCO, interesting to speculate for a moment. NASSCO has continued to perform very, very well. We have the potential for an additional ESB, I think that will be ESB 6 set, program formerly known as MLP. And you'll see that comes to pass.

The President's budget exceeded the budget or your host has exceeded the margin cap by $54 billion, the overseas contingency fund is that often acted as a release out for the cap. So perhaps, the Congress will consider doing something like that in addition to being able to take a number of just those caps. Both the Senate and House authorization bills are significant and excess of the President's budget. And the House Defense Appropriations Committee is now about 135, I think 30 and over the President's request. So look, what does all that mean?

We reported EPS of $2.45 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.0",2125,"Good morning.
As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a solid second quarter with revenue of $7.68 billion and net earnings of $749 million. We reported EPS of $2.45 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.02 per share better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that the sell side anticipated somewhat more revenue but lower margins and a somewhat higher tax rate. Operating earnings were about as forecast by the sell side, all in all pretty close. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue of $7.68 billion was $99 million or 1.3% lower. However, net earnings of $749 million were up $35 million or 4.9% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margins and a 160 basis point lower effective tax rate.
This led to EPS that was 6.5% better than the year-ago quarter.
Sequentially, revenue was up $234 million or 3.1% and operating earnings were up $21 million or 2% on a 10 basis point lower operating margin, a still very respectable 13.8%.
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Revenue was down $134 million, less than 1%, against the first half of 2016. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $140 million or 7.2% on lower costs. Operating margins were 100 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $144 million or 10.5%. EPS was $0.55 better.
In short, we had a very good first half somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations and well ahead of last year. This quite -- this leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance in a minute, but first, let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and wrap that into our EPS guidance.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $2.08 billion was $206 million lower than the year-ago quarter. However, operating earnings of $425 million were $1 million more on a 190 basis point improvement in operating margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $4 million and operating earnings were down $18 million on a 90 basis point reduction in margin but remaining in excess of 20%. For the first half, revenue at $4.15 billion is up $87 million against last year. Importantly, operating earnings at $868 million are up $112 million or 14.8% on a 230 basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $868 million in operating earnings for the first half of the year, Aerospace is well positioned to achieve its earning goals for the year.
By the way, recall we previously told you that the new revenue recognition rule which helped us in the first 2 quarters of the year has had a negative impact in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. So expect lower operating margins in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter. You'll see this reflected in our guidance.
Let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter and then some observations about the current state of the market insofar as it impacts Gulfstream.
First, in the quarter, the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.9 to 1, which is very good. The mix was particularly advantageous, with over 80% of the orders for large-cabin aircraft. The G500 and 600 continued to build backlog in advance of their entry into service, sufficient to ensure the success of these programs. Interestingly, the G550 built backlog as well in the quarter. While we read the reports of weak demand and reduced deliveries across the industry, our experience is reasonable and steady demand for our products. We will deliver as many airplanes this year, as we did last, on an entry-into-service basis. Commentators frequently speak of weakness in the large cabin market. Let me say that it is misleading to speak of a highly differentiated marketplace as if it were one market. Parts of the market are very active, particularly those market segments where there is new product. There are also market segments that are slow largely because of the absence of product introduction, so we believe that the market is not only differentiated by segment but also by the innovative offerings within the segments. We believe this is why demand for our products remains fairly consistent.
We are comfortable with the anticipated third quarter orders based on early contract activity and contract discussions. The interest in the G650 and 650ER as well as the G550 remains quite good and supportive of next year's operating plans. In short, we expect a good third quarter and a second half from an orders perspective.
Now let me say a few words about our progress towards certification of the G500 and 600. The G500 and 600 flying continues to go well. The aircraft are performing reliably and on schedule. The G500 testing includes 4 test aircraft and 1 production aircraft with a full interior. The 4 test aircraft have entered the Type Inspection Authorization or TIA flying phase. This phase is for actual certification credit. FAA pilots have joined Gulfstream flight crews on these TIA tests. We continue to work collaboratively with the FAA to ensure optimal safety and efficient use of resources. We expect to complete certification flying in Q4 '17. Additionally, we continue to work closely with our suppliers to complete all component-level testing this year. Once we have completed certification, the interior test aircraft, P1, will enter service as our G500 demonstrator. It is important to note, however, that the G500 will not have any impact to revenue and earnings this year. That is the result of the new revenue recognition rule.
The G600 now has 4 test aircraft flying, and the interior is being installed in the first production aircraft. We remain on schedule to certify in 2018.
Let's now turn to the defense side of the house.
First, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter, as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.41 billion was $117 million more than the second quarter last year, up 9%. Similarly, operating earnings were $225 million, up $20 million, almost 10% better than second quarter 2016. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $127 million or almost 10%. And operating earnings were up $20 million against -- again almost 10% better. For the first half, revenue was up $159 million or 6.3% against the first half of 2016. Operating earnings were up $38 million, 9.7% on a 50 basis point margin expansion.
Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well across our platforms, ordnance and ammunition portfolios. We continue to move nicely from engineering to production on our 2 large international orders. We also continue to win programs, particularly out of our European Land Systems business. We are obviously trending in the right direction at Combat Systems.
With respect to the marine group, revenue of $2.08 billion was $101 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $6 million against the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $145 million, and operating earnings were up $17 million on the higher revenue and a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, revenue of $4.01 billion was down $87 million or 2.1% against the first half of 2016. Operating earnings were also lower by $17 million on a 30 basis point contraction in margin.
Work on our submarine programs, that is production on Blocks III and IV for the Virginia class and engineering on the Columbia ballistic-missile submarine replacement, continued to perform nicely. With respect to our Bath shipyard, the challenges on the DDG 1000 and DDG 51 restart ships are largely behind us. And our auxiliary ship and commercial businesses continued smoothly. In addition, we have seen an uptick in demand for repair across our repair yards, primarily in San Diego and Washington State. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so. Our operating margin should continue to improve over time.
Turning to IS&T. The group continues to perform well on the bottom line despite some revenue headwinds. Revenue of $2.1 billion was down $111 million against the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, operating earnings of $240 million were up against the year-ago quarter by $6 million. There was an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $42 million or 2%, but operating earnings were up $4 million on a 40 basis point improvement in margin. This quarter's 11.4% operating margin is exceptional in my view. The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue was down $293 million or 6.4%, but operating earnings were up $5 million on an 80 basis point improvement in margins. So once again, very strong operating leverage.
For both our IT services and tactical communication and intel business, our cost performance and market positioning have driven very nice win rates. Not surprisingly, our IS&T backlog grew $175 million in the quarter, with a book-to-bill of greater than 1 to 1 once again. In short, we believe the segment results leave us positioned to do well in the second half.
Before I move on, let me give you a sense of the defense environment, at least from my perspective. There is clear intent in the administration and in parts of the Congress for increased defense spending. We believe this intent will manifest in some level of increased defense spending in the procurement and R&D accounts. The question is how much, and when? Relevant considerations include the dispatch with which Congress approved a higher defense budget and how soon the administration can propose and the Congress can approve the department senior leadership appointments. Without these appointments, it is difficult to process contracts and get authorized and appropriated funds obligated to contracts. At this juncture, both are proceeding more slowly than we thought would happen. Nevertheless, we remain confident in the direction of defense spending.
So turning to guidance, let me provide some guidance for the year for each segment, compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS outlook.
For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016; operating earnings of approximately $1.6 billion with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. We now expect to be approximately $8.1 billion of revenue with margins of 19.5% to 19.6%. This implies pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. This will result in no change to the operating earnings forecast, still a very strong industry-leading performance.
For combat, our previous guidance was to expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% over 2016, with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.9 billion, just slightly above the 7% growth over last year; and operating earnings of $925 million to $930 million. So pretty close to the original guidance, with a slight upward bias.
For the marine group, we previously guided to revenue of $7.9 billion, margins of around 8.6% and operating earnings of $680 million to $685 million. We now expect revenue to be up another $160 million to $165 million, with margins consistent with previous forecast, resulting in a modest improvement in operating earnings.
For IS&T, we guided to revenue up modestly over 2016, operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion with a margin rate around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast is essentially flat and that operating earnings will be somewhat better at about 11.2% to 11.4%.
So all of this rolls up into revenue for General Dynamics of about $31 billion and operating margins of 13.3 to 13.5 -- 13.4% to 13.5%. Compared to initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue, operating earnings at the higher end of the forecasted range, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70 to $9.75. To help you further: Our EPS guidance was $9.50 to $9.55. The $0.20 difference is $0.05 from operations, $0.05 to $0.06 from a lower tax rate and about $0.09 to $0.10 from share repurchases. The EPS progression for the remainder of the year is down slightly in Q3 versus Q2, with Q4 looking similar to this quarter.
I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $24 million versus $23 million in the second quarter of 2016. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $49 million versus $45 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt last year. For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $105 million.
Our effective tax rate was 27.4% for the quarter and 26% year-to-date. As Phebe mentioned, we're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of 27.5%. That reflects a greater benefit associated with employee stock option exercises than originally anticipated.
On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter, we purchased 2.7 million shares, bringing us to 4.6 million shares in the first half of the year for $900 million. In total, when combined with the dividend we've paid, through the first 6 months of 2017, we've spent $1.4 billion in shareholder-friendly capital deployment, more than 1.5x our $857 million of free cash flow for the first half. This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $2.1 billion. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year to approximate 100% of net earnings and in turn deploying 100% of that free cash flow to share repurchases and dividends.

We had very slow execution on programs in several civilian agencies, primarily driven by uncertainty and in some cases reduction in funding levels.

Really what we're seeing there is, as we're moving from what we experienced in the past couple of years with large advanced payments and then the burn-down of those advanced payments, which we've talked about ad nauseam at this point, as we move into production, you're seeing a more typical buildup of the unbilled receivables prior to delivery. And as we then move into a ramp-up of deliveries, we'll begin to liquidate that unbilled receivables. And we expect to see that to start to turn in the second half and hence a bit more of the ramp in the cash flow in the second half. So all part and parcel of moving from the development phase of that contract into production and a subsequent ramp in deliveries. So we'll see that unwind, beginning in the second half."

The design is going extremely well, and we're on track to begin the build process exactly when we thought we would. So we see the undersea deterrent and the undersea war-fighting capability of the U.S. Navy as a key national security imperative, as clearly evidenced by the navy's interest in increasing subs. With respect to NASSCO, interesting to speculate for a moment. NASSCO has continued to perform very, very well. We have the potential for an additional ESB. I think that will be ESB 6. That's a program formerly known as MLP. And we'll see if that comes to pass. We also have -- the navy has given us long lead funding for the second oiler.

But the President's budget exceeded the budget -- or his request exceeded the budget cap by $54 billion. OCO, the overseas contingency fund is often acted as a relief valve for the caps. So perhaps Congress will consider doing something like that in addition to being able to never adjust those caps. Both the Senate and the House authorization bills are significantly in excess of the President's budget. And the House defense appropriations committee is about $135 billion, I think, over the President's request. So look, what does all that mean? That right now it's a giant fur ball, and we're going to have to work through the process and see what comes out the other side. As I noted, I believe that there is real interest and desire in additional defense spending, which will manifest itself in [ tomorrow's ] additional funding and budget for defense. It's just a question of how much and what accounts and when. So we still have a ways to work through this process."

We reported EPS of $2.45 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.0",2125,"Good morning.
As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a solid second quarter with revenue of $7.68 billion and net earnings of $749 million. We reported EPS of $2.45 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.02 per share better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that the sell side anticipated somewhat more revenue but lower margins and a somewhat higher tax rate. Operating earnings were about as forecast by the sell side. All in all, pretty close. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue of $7.68 billion was $99 million or 1.3% lower. However, net earnings of $749 million were up $35 million or 4.9% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margins and a 160 basis point lower effective tax rate.
This led to EPS that was 6.5% better than the year-ago quarter.
Sequentially, revenue was up $234 million or 3.1% and operating earnings were up $21 million or 2% on a 10 basis point lower operating margin, a still very respectable 13.8%.
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Revenue was down $134 million, less than 1% against the first half of 2016. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $140 million or 7.2% on lower costs. Operating margins were 100 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $144 million or 10.5%. EPS was $0.55 better.
In short, we had a very good first half, somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations and well ahead of last year. This quite -- this leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance in a minute. But first, let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and wrap that into our EPS guidance.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $2.08 billion was $206 million lower than the year-ago quarter. However, operating earnings of $425 million were $1 million more on a 190 basis point improvement in operating margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $4 million and operating earnings were down $18 million on a 90 basis point reduction in margin, but remaining in excess of 20%. For the first half, revenue at $4.15 billion is up $87 million against last year. Importantly, operating earnings at $868 million are up $112 million or 14.8% on a 230 basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $868 million in operating earnings for the first half of the year, Aerospace is well-positioned to achieve its earning goals for the year.
By the way, recall we previously told you that the new revenue recognition rule which helped us in the first 2 quarters of the year would have a negative impact in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. So expect lower operating margins in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter. You'll see this reflected in our guidance.
Let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter and then some observations about the current state of the market, insofar as it impacts Gulfstream.
First, in the quarter, the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.9 to 1, which is very good. The mix was particularly advantageous, with over 80% of the orders for large cabin aircraft. The G500 and G600 continued to build backlog in advance of their entry into service, sufficient to ensure the success of these programs. Interestingly, the G550 built backlog as well in the quarter. While we read the reports of weak demand and reduced deliveries across the industry, our experience is reasonable and steady demand for our products. We will deliver as many airplanes this year as we did last, on an entry-into-service basis. Commentators frequently speak of weakness in the large cabin market. Let me say that it is misleading to speak of a highly differentiated marketplace as if it were one market. Parts of the market are very active, particularly those market segments where there is new product. There are also market segments that are slow, largely because of the absence of product introduction, so we believe that the market is not only differentiated by segment, but also by the innovative offerings within the segment. We believe this is why demand for our products remains fairly consistent.
We are comfortable with anticipated third quarter orders based on early contract activity and contract discussions. The interest in the G650 and 650ER as well as the G550 remains quite good and supportive of next year's operating plan. In short, we expect a good third quarter and a second half from an orders perspective.
Now let me say a few words about our progress towards certification of the G500 and G600. The G500 and G600 flying continues to go well. The aircraft are performing reliably and on schedule. The G500 testing includes 4 test aircraft and 1 production aircraft with a full interior. The 4 test aircraft have entered the Type Inspection Authorization or TIA flying phase. This phase is for actual certification credit. FAA pilots have joined Gulfstream flight crews on these TIA tests. We continue to work collaboratively with the FAA to ensure optimal safety and efficient use of resources. We expect to complete certification flying in Q4 '17. Additionally, we continue to work closely with our suppliers to complete all component-level testing this year. Once we have completed certification, the interior test aircraft, P1, will enter service as our G500 demonstrator. It is important to note, however, that the G500 will not have any impact to revenue and earnings this year. That is the result of the new revenue recognition rule.
The G600 now has 4 test aircraft flying, and the interior is being installed in the first production aircraft. We remain on schedule to certify in 2018.
Let's now turn to the defense side of the house.
First, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter, as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.41 billion was $117 million more than the second quarter last year, up 9%. Similarly, operating earnings were $225 million, up $20 million, almost 10% better than second quarter 2016. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $127 million or almost 10%. And operating earnings were up $20 million against -- again, almost 10% better. For the first half, revenue was up $159 million or 6.3% against the first half of 2016. Operating earnings were up $38 million, 9.7% on a 50 basis point margin expansion.
Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well across our platforms, ordnance and ammunition portfolios. We continue to move nicely from engineering to production on our 2 large international orders. We also continue to win programs, particularly out of our European Land Systems business. We are obviously trending in the right direction at Combat Systems.
With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $2.08 billion was $101 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $6 million against the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $145 million, and operating earnings were up $17 million on the higher revenue and a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, revenue of $4.01 billion was down $87 million or 2.1% against the first half of 2016. Operating earnings were also lower by $17 million on a 30 basis point contraction in margin.
Work on our submarine programs, that is, production on Blocks III and IV for the Virginia class and engineering on the Columbia ballistic-missile submarine replacement, continued to perform nicely. With respect to our Bath shipyard, the challenges on the DDG 1000 and DDG 51 restart ships are largely behind us. And our auxiliary ship and commercial businesses continue smoothly. In addition, we have seen an uptick in demand for repair across our repair yards, primarily in San Diego and Washington State. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so. Our operating margin should continue to improve over time.
Turning to IS&T. The group continues to perform well on the bottom line despite some revenue headwinds. Revenue of $2.1 billion was down $111 million against the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, operating earnings of $240 million were up against the year-ago quarter by $6 million. There was an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $42 million or 2%, but operating earnings were up $4 million on a 40 basis point improvement in margin. This quarter's 11.4% operating margin is exceptional, in my view. The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue was down $293 million or 6.4%, but operating earnings were up $5 million on an 80 basis point improvement in margins. So once again, very strong operating leverage.
For both our IT services and tactical communication and intel business, our cost performance and market positioning have driven very nice win rates. Not surprisingly, our IS&T backlog grew $175 million in the quarter, with a book-to-bill of greater than 1 to 1 once again. In short, we believe the segment results leave us positioned to do well in the second half.
Before I move on, let me give you a sense of the defense environment, at least from my perspective. There is clear intent in the administration and in parts of the Congress for increased defense spending. We believe this intent will manifest in some level of increased defense spending in the procurement and R&D accounts. The question is how much, and when? Relevant considerations include the dispatch with which Congress approves a higher defense budget and how soon the administration can propose and the Congress can approve the department senior leadership appointments. Without these appointments, it is difficult to process contracts and get authorized and appropriated funds obligated to contracts. At this juncture, both are proceeding more slowly than we thought would happen. Nevertheless, we remain confident in the direction of defense spending.
So turning to guidance, let me provide some guidance for the year for each segment, compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS outlook.
For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016; operating earnings of approximately $1.6 billion with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. We now expect to be approximately $8.1 billion of revenue with margins of 19.5% to 19.6%. This implies pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. This will result in no change to the operating earnings forecast, still a very strong industry-leading performance.
For Combat, our previous guidance was to expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% over 2016, with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.9 billion, just slightly above the 7% growth over last year; and operating earnings of $925 million to $930 million. So pretty close to the original guidance, with a slight upward bias.
For the Marine group, we previously guided to revenue of $7.9 billion, margins of around 8.6% and operating earnings of $680 million to $685 million. We now expect revenue to be up another $160 million to $165 million, with margins consistent with previous forecast, resulting in a modest improvement in operating earnings.
For IS&T, we guided to revenue up modestly over 2016, operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion with a margin rate around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast is essentially flat and that operating earnings will be somewhat better at about 11.2% to 11.4%.
So all of this rolls up into revenue for General Dynamics of about $31 billion and operating margins of 13.3 to 13.5 -- 13.4% to 13.5%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue, operating earnings at the higher end of the forecasted range, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70 to $9.75. To help you further, our EPS guidance was $9.50 to $9.55. The $0.20 difference is $0.05 from operations, $0.05 to $0.06 from a lower tax rate and about $0.09 to $0.10 from share repurchases. The EPS progression for the remainder of the year is down slightly in Q3 versus Q2, with Q4 looking similar to this quarter.
I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $24 million versus $23 million in the second quarter of 2016. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $49 million versus $45 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt last year. For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $105 million.
Our effective tax rate was 27.4% for the quarter and 26% year-to-date. As Phebe mentioned, we're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of 27.5%. That reflects a greater benefit associated with employee stock option exercises than originally anticipated.
On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter, we purchased 2.7 million shares, bringing us to 4.6 million shares in the first half of the year for $900 million. In total, when combined with the dividends we've paid, through the first 6 months of 2017, we've spent $1.4 billion in shareholder-friendly capital deployment, more than 1.5x our $857 million of free cash flow for the first half. This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $2.1 billion. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year to approximate 100% of net earnings and in turn, deploying 100% of that free cash flow to share repurchases and dividends.

So that's pretty much a question of timing as the military services gear back up on their execution. The second side is on our services business. We had very slow execution on programs in several civilian agencies, primarily driven by uncertainty, and in some cases, reduction in funding levels. I suspect some of that will obtain through the course of the year until the administration sorts out some of the funding for some of the civilian agencies. But that said, we believe that our products business is poised for growth for the remainder of the year.

Really what we're seeing there is as we're moving from what we experienced in the past couple of years with large advanced payments and then the burn-down of those advanced payments, which we've talked about ad nauseam at this point, as we move into production, you're seeing a more typical buildup of the unbilled receivables prior to delivery. And as we then move into a ramp-up of deliveries, we'll begin to liquidate that unbilled receivables. And we expect to see that to start to turn in the second half and hence a bit more of the ramp in the cash flow in the second half. So all part and parcel of moving from the development phase of that contract into production and a subsequent ramp in deliveries. So we'll see that unwind, beginning in the second half."

But given the ubiquitous amount of information that flows today, I think you all know as much as I do in terms of specificity. But the President's budget exceeded budget -- or his request exceeded the budget caps by $54 billion. OCO, the overseas contingency fund, has often acted as a relief valve for the caps. So perhaps Congress will consider doing something like that in addition to being able to, if we can ever adjust those caps. Both the Senate and the House authorization bills are significantly in excess of the President's budget. And the House Defense Appropriations Committee is about 100 -- or $35 billion, I think, over the President's request. So look, what does all that mean? That right now it's a giant fur ball, and we're going to have to work through the process and see what comes out the other side. As I noted, I believe that there is real interest and desire in additional defense spending, which will manifest itself in some more additional funding and budget for defense. It's just a question of how much and what accounts and when. So we still have a ways to work through this process."

We reported EPS of $2.45 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.0",2125,"Good morning.
As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a solid second quarter with revenue of $7.68 billion and net earnings of $749 million. We reported EPS of $2.45 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.02 per share better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that the sell side anticipated somewhat more revenue but lower margins and a somewhat higher tax rate. Operating earnings were about as forecast by the sell side. All in all, pretty close. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue of $7.68 billion was $99 million or 1.3% lower. However, net earnings of $749 million were up $35 million or 4.9% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margins and a 160 basis point lower effective tax rate.
This led to EPS that was 6.5% better than the year-ago quarter.
Sequentially, revenue was up $234 million or 3.1% and operating earnings were up $21 million or 2% on a 10 basis point lower operating margin, a still very respectable 13.8%.
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Revenue was down $134 million, less than 1% against the first half of 2016. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $140 million or 7.2% on lower costs. Operating margins were 100 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $144 million or 10.5%. EPS was $0.55 better.
In short, we had a very good first half, somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations and well ahead of last year. This quite -- this leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance in a minute. But first, let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and wrap that into our EPS guidance.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $2.08 billion was $206 million lower than the year-ago quarter. However, operating earnings of $425 million were $1 million more on a 190 basis point improvement in operating margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $4 million and operating earnings were down $18 million on a 90 basis point reduction in margin, but remaining in excess of 20%. For the first half, revenue at $4.15 billion is up $87 million against last year. Importantly, operating earnings at $868 million are up $112 million or 14.8% on a 230 basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $868 million in operating earnings for the first half of the year, Aerospace is well-positioned to achieve its earning goals for the year.
By the way, recall we previously told you that the new revenue recognition rule which helped us in the first 2 quarters of the year would have a negative impact in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. So expect lower operating margins in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter. You'll see this reflected in our guidance.
Let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter and then some observations about the current state of the market, insofar as it impacts Gulfstream.
First, in the quarter, the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.9 to 1, which is very good. The mix was particularly advantageous, with over 80% of the orders for large cabin aircraft. The G500 and G600 continued to build backlog in advance of their entry into service, sufficient to ensure the success of these programs. Interestingly, the G550 built backlog as well in the quarter. While we read the reports of weak demand and reduced deliveries across the industry, our experience is reasonable and steady demand for our products. We will deliver as many airplanes this year as we did last, on an entry-into-service basis. Commentators frequently speak of weakness in the large cabin market. Let me say that it is misleading to speak of a highly differentiated marketplace as if it were one market. Parts of the market are very active, particularly those market segments where there is new product. There are also market segments that are slow, largely because of the absence of product introduction, so we believe that the market is not only differentiated by segment, but also by the innovative offerings within the segment. We believe this is why demand for our products remains fairly consistent.
We are comfortable with anticipated third quarter orders based on early contract activity and contract discussions. The interest in the G650 and 650ER as well as the G550 remains quite good and supportive of next year's operating plan. In short, we expect a good third quarter and a second half from an orders perspective.
Now let me say a few words about our progress towards certification of the G500 and G600. The G500 and G600 flying continues to go well. The aircraft are performing reliably and on schedule. The G500 testing includes 4 test aircraft and 1 production aircraft with a full interior. The 4 test aircraft have entered the Type Inspection Authorization or TIA flying phase. This phase is for actual certification credit. FAA pilots have joined Gulfstream flight crews on these TIA tests. We continue to work collaboratively with the FAA to ensure optimal safety and efficient use of resources. We expect to complete certification flying in Q4 '17. Additionally, we continue to work closely with our suppliers to complete all component-level testing this year. Once we have completed certification, the interior test aircraft, P1, will enter service as our G500 demonstrator. It is important to note, however, that the G500 will not have any impact to revenue and earnings this year. That is the result of the new revenue recognition rule.
The G600 now has 4 test aircraft flying, and the interior is being installed in the first production aircraft. We remain on schedule to certify in 2018.
Let's now turn to the defense side of the house.
First, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter, as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.41 billion was $117 million more than the second quarter last year, up 9%. Similarly, operating earnings were $225 million, up $20 million, almost 10% better than second quarter 2016. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $127 million or almost 10%. And operating earnings were up $20 million against -- again, almost 10% better. For the first half, revenue was up $159 million or 6.3% against the first half of 2016. Operating earnings were up $38 million, 9.7% on a 50 basis point margin expansion.
Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well across our platforms, ordnance and ammunition portfolios. We continue to move nicely from engineering to production on our 2 large international orders. We also continue to win programs, particularly out of our European Land Systems business. We are obviously trending in the right direction at Combat Systems.
With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $2.08 billion was $101 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $6 million against the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $145 million, and operating earnings were up $17 million on the higher revenue and a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, revenue of $4.01 billion was down $87 million or 2.1% against the first half of 2016. Operating earnings were also lower by $17 million on a 30 basis point contraction in margin.
Work on our submarine programs, that is, production on Blocks III and IV for the Virginia class and engineering on the Columbia ballistic-missile submarine replacement, continued to perform nicely. With respect to our Bath shipyard, the challenges on the DDG 1000 and DDG 51 restart ships are largely behind us. And our auxiliary ship and commercial businesses continue smoothly. In addition, we have seen an uptick in demand for repair across our repair yards, primarily in San Diego and Washington State. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so. Our operating margin should continue to improve over time.
Turning to IS&T. The group continues to perform well on the bottom line despite some revenue headwinds. Revenue of $2.1 billion was down $111 million against the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, operating earnings of $240 million were up against the year-ago quarter by $6 million. There was an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $42 million or 2%, but operating earnings were up $4 million on a 40 basis point improvement in margin. This quarter's 11.4% operating margin is exceptional, in my view. The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue was down $293 million or 6.4%, but operating earnings were up $5 million on an 80 basis point improvement in margins. So once again, very strong operating leverage.
For both our IT services and tactical communication and intel business, our cost performance and market positioning have driven very nice win rates. Not surprisingly, our IS&T backlog grew $175 million in the quarter, with a book-to-bill of greater than 1 to 1 once again. In short, we believe the segment results leave us positioned to do well in the second half.
Before I move on, let me give you a sense of the defense environment, at least from my perspective. There is clear intent in the administration and in parts of the Congress for increased defense spending. We believe this intent will manifest in some level of increased defense spending in the procurement and R&D accounts. The question is how much, and when? Relevant considerations include the dispatch with which Congress approves a higher defense budget and how soon the administration can propose and the Congress can approve the department senior leadership appointments. Without these appointments, it is difficult to process contracts and get authorized and appropriated funds obligated to contracts. At this juncture, both are proceeding more slowly than we thought would happen. Nevertheless, we remain confident in the direction of defense spending.
So turning to guidance, let me provide some guidance for the year for each segment, compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS outlook.
For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016; operating earnings of approximately $1.6 billion with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. We now expect to be approximately $8.1 billion of revenue with margins of 19.5% to 19.6%. This implies pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. This will result in no change to the operating earnings forecast, still a very strong industry-leading performance.
For Combat, our previous guidance was to expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% over 2016, with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.9 billion, just slightly above the 7% growth over last year; and operating earnings of $925 million to $930 million. So pretty close to the original guidance, with a slight upward bias.
For the Marine group, we previously guided to revenue of $7.9 billion, margins of around 8.6% and operating earnings of $680 million to $685 million. We now expect revenue to be up another $160 million to $165 million, with margins consistent with previous forecast, resulting in a modest improvement in operating earnings.
For IS&T, we guided to revenue up modestly over 2016, operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion with a margin rate around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast is essentially flat and that operating earnings will be somewhat better at about 11.2% to 11.4%.
So all of this rolls up into revenue for General Dynamics of about $31 billion and operating margins of 13.3 to 13.5 -- 13.4% to 13.5%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue, operating earnings at the higher end of the forecasted range, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70 to $9.75. To help you further, our EPS guidance was $9.50 to $9.55. The $0.20 difference is $0.05 from operations, $0.05 to $0.06 from a lower tax rate and about $0.09 to $0.10 from share repurchases. The EPS progression for the remainder of the year is down slightly in Q3 versus Q2, with Q4 looking similar to this quarter.
I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $24 million versus $23 million in the second quarter of 2016. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $49 million versus $45 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt last year. For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $105 million.
Our effective tax rate was 27.4% for the quarter and 26% year-to-date. As Phebe mentioned, we're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of 27.5%. That reflects a greater benefit associated with employee stock option exercises than originally anticipated.
On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter, we purchased 2.7 million shares, bringing us to 4.6 million shares in the first half of the year for $900 million. In total, when combined with the dividends we've paid, through the first 6 months of 2017, we've spent $1.4 billion in shareholder-friendly capital deployment, more than 1.5x our $857 million of free cash flow for the first half. This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $2.1 billion. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year to approximate 100% of net earnings and in turn, deploying 100% of that free cash flow to share repurchases and dividends.

We had very slow execution on programs in several civilian agencies, primarily driven by uncertainty, and in some cases, reduction in funding levels. I suspect some of that will obtain through the course of the year until the administration sorts out some of the funding for some of the civilian agencies.

I guess at a macro level, what we've seen through the first half of the year is really on par with what we planned for the year, so nothing out of the ordinary. We expected a bit of a ramp to the second half, so as I mentioned, still targeting at or around 100% conversion. The buildup in working capital you mentioned was actually anticipated in connection with the Land Systems international programs. Really what we're seeing there is as we're moving from what we experienced in the past couple of years with large advanced payments and then the burn-down of those advanced payments, which we've talked about ad nauseam at this point, as we move into production, you're seeing a more typical buildup of the unbilled receivables prior to delivery. And as we then move into a ramp-up of deliveries, we'll begin to liquidate that unbilled receivables. And we expect to see that to start to turn in the second half and hence a bit more of the ramp in the cash flow in the second half. So all part and parcel of moving from the development phase of that contract into production and a subsequent ramp in deliveries. So we'll see that unwind, beginning in the second half."

With respect to NASSCO, interesting to speculate for a moment. NASSCO has continued to perform very, very well. We have the potential for an additional ESB. I think that will be ESB 6. That's a program formerly known as MLP. And we'll see if that comes to pass. We also have -- the Navy has given us long lead funding for the second oiler.

But given the ubiquitous amount of information that flows today, I think you all know as much as I do in terms of specificity. But the President's budget exceeded budget -- or his request exceeded the budget caps by $54 billion. OCO, the overseas contingency fund, has often acted as a relief valve for the caps. So perhaps Congress will consider doing something like that in addition to being able to, if we can ever adjust those caps. Both the Senate and the House authorization bills are significantly in excess of the President's budget. And the House Defense Appropriations Committee is about 100 -- or $35 billion, I think, over the President's request. So look, what does all that mean? That right now it's a giant fur ball, and we're going to have to work through the process and see what comes out the other side. As I noted, I believe that there is real interest and desire in additional defense spending, which will manifest itself in some more additional funding and budget for defense. It's just a question of how much and what accounts and when. So we still have a ways to work through this process."

As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.52 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.58 billion, operating earnings of $1.052 billion and income from continuing operations of $764 million, a 10.1%  return on sales. The EPS performance was $0.16 better than the year-ago quarter and $0.09 better than consensus. 
Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was down $77 million or 1%, but operating earnings were up $37 million, a 3.6% increase. And income from continuing operations was up $33 million, a 4.5% increase. 
The quarter's operating margin at 13.9% is 60 basis points better than the third quarter of 2016. Once again, we enjoyed very positive operating leverage. Sequentially, revenue was down $95 million or 1.2%, while operating earnings were down $4 million and operating margin was up 10 basis points. From an operating perspective, the second and third quarters look a lot of like as we said they would. The $0.07 EPS improvement was driven by a modestly lower share count and 180-basis-point lower effective tax rate in the third quarter. 
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was [ up ] $211 million, less than 1%. However, operating earnings ar up $177 million or 6% and operating margins are up 90 basis points. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations are also up $177 million or 8.4%, and earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.71, 10.5% better year-to-date.
With respect to cash, we had very efficient conversion in the quarter. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $871 million and free cash flow from operations of $751 million. For year-to-date, we have free cash flow from operations slightly in excess of $1.6 billion. 
As you can see from the chart attached to our press release, an important story in the quarter was the very healthy backlog increase. The total backlog of $63.9 billion is a $5.4 billion increase in excess of 9% over the second quarter. It was a very good contract activity in all of our grips with particularly strong order intake in the Marine group. I should point out that each of our defense businesses enjoyed backlog growth with the exception of NASSCO, and it didn't miss by much. 
Let me say a few words about each of our business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $70 million or 3.6% compared to the third quarter of 2016, and operating earnings increased $8 million or 2.1% to $385 million on an operating margin of 19.3%. On a sequential basis, the group experienced $83 million less in revenue, about 4% and a $40 million reduction in operating earnings attributable to 120-basis-point contraction margins.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up $157 million or 2.6% and operating earnings are up $120 million or 10.6% on 150-basis-point improvement in operating margin. 
We had good order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.8 to 1 book-to-bill measured on a dollar basis. But Gulfstream alone was a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill on both a dollar value and a number of units basis. I can also tell you that our pipeline and active sales discussions are quite good. We are again reasonably optimistic about our order intake in the fourth quarter and I expect it to look much like the third quarter if not somewhat better. 
Our certification flying continues to progress well, including the addition of test points required to extend the G500 and G600 range. As we announced during the recent air show, additional testing has enabled us to increase the G500 range by 200 nautical miles at 0.85 mark and 600 nautical mile at 0.90 mark. It's really quite remarkable that the G500 with a 5200 nautical mile range of 0.85 mark can travel 4400 nautical mark at 0.90. This was the approximate range of a G450 at 0.80 mark. 
On the G600, our additional validation test are proven an additional 300 nautical miles at 0.85 mark as well as 300 nautical miles at 0.90. The additional testing required for the specific fuel consumption at the center of gravity test point have ensured proper performance and safety margins in both aircraft. Although this in the program schedule, we believe the result and value to our customers was worth the effort. 
While flying has progressed on schedule, testing by one of our suppliers for component level qualification associated with the concurrent FOA and the certification has added a new complexity at the end of the program. While we accounted for this type of supplier impacting our plan, one of our suppliers apparently didn't anticipate the additional as a test required and is somewhat behind. We expect to resolve this issue and deliver the G500 to our customers as planned. If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. So we're still on track and we continue to monitor the supplier closely as we near the end of the certification program. 
Turning to combat systems. The group had an excellent quarter with revenue of $1.5 billion, operating earnings of $247 million and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. As you would expect, the quarter-over-quarter sequential and year-to-date comparisons are all quite favorable. Compared to third quarter of 2016, revenue was up $173 million or 13%, and earnings were up $38 million or 18.2% on an 80-basis-point improvement in margin. 
On a sequential basis, revenue was up $86 million or 16.1% and operating earnings were up $22 million or 9.8% on a 60-basis-point improvement in operating margin. 
Year-to-date, revenue was up over 2016 by $332 million or 8.6%. Operating earnings are up $76 million or 12.6% on a 60-basis-point improvement in operating margin. 
Combat Systems remains on course for a very good year. We fully anticipate that the fourth quarter will see around a 15% increase in revenue over this quarter, but also some degradation in operating margin as a result of a mix shift to new programs so that the increase in operating earnings will be more modest in the revenue increase. 
All of our major programs are performing very well. We continue to see opportunities for growth, both internationally and domestically for the group. 
The Marine group reported revenue of $1.93 billion, a $144 million or 6.9% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. Similarly, revenue was down sequentially by $148 million or 7.1%. And year-to-date revenue of $5.94 billion is lower by $231 million or 3.7%. Revenue across the year has been down based on Virginia Class Block 3 timing, slowdown in the Columbia program design work as a result of extended negotiations over the IPPD contract and the wind down some of the commercial work at NASSCO. These revenue headwinds are now largely behind us. 
Operating earnings for the third quarter at $179 million were down by $18 million compared to last year's quarter. On a sequential basis, the group's operating margins improved 70 basis points, which led to a $1 million increase in operating earnings despite the $148 million decrease in revenue. It's very nice to have margins in the group north of 9% once again. While this is encouraging, we'll have to see whether it's sustainable. 
And finally, IS&T. While IS&T's revenue at $2.15 billion was down $176 million or 7.6% against last year's quarter, it was up $50 million sequentially. Year-to-date revenue was $6.4 billion is down $469 million or 6.8% over last year. However, we expect a strong fourth quarter and will be essentially flat with 2016 for the year. 
Revenue has been lower during the year, primarily on timing. Lower-than-expected Army product sales impacted the third quarter and the army had trouble executing after the 6-month CR and, of course, the change in administrations slowed some execution as well. We recovered a lot of this revenue in the fourth quarter, but don't have enough time to recover at all. Some anticipated revenue will slip into next year, but we're in good position to hold 2017 revenue close to the 2016 level. 
In sharp contrast, operating earnings of $253 million were up $14 million or 5.9% compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 140-basis-point improvement in operating margins. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings were up $13 million or 11.7% operating margins, which is a 30-basis-point improvement. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings are up $19 million, a 2.7% increase on a 110-basis-point improvement in operating margin. So IS&T has managed to overcome less-than-anticipated revenue with very strong operating performance. 
So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year is concerned. We fully expect the fourth quarter to look much like the other 3 from an operating earnings perspective. However, we expect the higher effective tax rate in the quarter leading to a lower reported EPS. For the year, stronger-than-expected operating results year-to-date, a lower than planned tax rate and a modestly lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operations now goes to a range from $9.75 to $9.80. This late in the year, we anticipate our end of the year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance, so the ranges narrow. 
And finally in closing, as it is that this is at this time of the year to ask about next year. Let me remind you that we have our planning process later fall when the businesses get better inside into the upcoming year. The guidance that we gave you last January was grounded in that process, and as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piece next year at this juncture. You'll hear from us in detail in January as has been our costume for many years. 
I'd now like to turn the call back to bill to cover some additional financial items."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the third quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense year-to-date to $76 million versus $68 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter last year. 
For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $110 million, which includes the impact of the issuance of $1 billion of debt in the third quarter in anticipation of the repayment of $900 million in notes maturing in the fourth quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was 25.6% for the quarter and 25.8% year-to-date. We're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of approximately 27%. The lower rate in the quarter and our reduced forecast for the year both attributable to the finalization of open tax years and a greater benefit from employee stock option exercises in previously forecast. 
On the capital deployment front, in the third quarter, we purchased 1.2 million shares, bringing us to 5.9 million shares in the first 9 months of 2017 for $1.1 billion. In total, when combined with the dividends we've paid to the first 9 months, we've spent $1.9 billion or nearly 120% of our free cash flow year-to-date. We've also made a number of small acquisitions in our Aerospace and IS&T groups this year, totaling $364 million. This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion and a net debt position of $2.2 billion. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year to approach 100% of earnings from continuing operations, and we'll continue to deploy 100% of that free cash flow, less the amount spent in acquisitions, to dividends and share repurchases.

This is strictly a paperwork exercise that we're going through and really has to do with them as we noted, that this will pass points that have allowed the additional range as well as I've mentioned the simultaneous -- this is the first time we've done a simultaneous FAA and EIS, European aviation Authority certification. And really, that is a benefit to our customers to achieve those simultaneous certification, so we can accommodate the deliveries to our international customers. But long story short, this is not any type of risk item to the program. It's strictly a matter of getting for paperwork for the certification process. As it relates to 2018, as I've mentioned, deliveries are still on schedule but with our original plan and our original contractual customer dates. You may recall that for a while there, we were optimistically considering that there might be an opportunity to advance that entry into service by 3 or 4 months. We had this opportunity to go after additional capability in the aircraft, and we did that knowing that we would still be able to meet our original customer commitments, while achieving that additional capability. So really, no impact there. And likewise to your question, no impact on our expected 2018 deliveries. The production and the delivery schedule remain intact as we originally anticipated, and so we don't see any modification there."

And as we've talked about that, it is a development cost-plus type contracts. So it will come at relatively lower margins that will continue to have a modest dilutive effect for the group. So that's no different, I think, than what we talked about after this point. It's good to have that contract in place, so we can keep moving forward. But the margin impact is consistent with what we've talked about, historically."

But certainly, we see the balance sheet as an opportunity for when and if strategic opportunities come up that we are ready to be agile and move quickly with those opportunities.We saw that in small dose here in the first 9 months.

For the year, I believe the number was somewhere in the ballpark of $200 million. I don't think that's changed. And as it relates to closing out the year, we've got a big fourth quarter lined up. But frankly, that's not unusual for us. It's a pretty typical pattern for us.

But the 15% increase sequentially is entirely consistent with our original forecast of the group -- the Combat Systems group being up 7%, maybe a touch higher approximately 7% full year over 2016. So we're really comfortable with that, and that's in the backlog. As it relates to IS&T, as I said, it is a steep curve in the quarter, but we feel very good about it. The pieces are in place to achieve that growth. There are a lot of moving parts, but it's in the backlog. We had a good September, which leads us to feel very -- we're very well positioned to close out the year in a strong fashion. Most of that growth is coming out of the products business and the order cadence is there to support that. So again, while there's a lot of moving parts, we feel very good about where we are and the pieces are in place to get there. In terms of the impact of the acquisition, I would say that's not the big driver. It has an impact, but to be honest with you, I don't actually have that number in front of me. The big driver is the catch up from the timing we've seen throughout the year and it's the impact that it had on our Mission Systems product business. We've talked a good bit about those timing effects of the Army procurement and some of the civil agencies, and so, that we've seen delayed by the 6-month plus CR and so on, but we feel good about the timing starting to catch back up this year. If we don't get fully back to the 2016 level, to be close in the timing will just deliver over in the '17 and '18."

So we feel very comfortable with where we're headed for '18. And frankly beyond that, the impact will depend on future Army decisions, so it probably wouldn't be appropriate to speculate and get out ahead of them at this point. What I can tell you is as you are well aware, IS&T is a makeup of vast portfolio of lots of different opportunities and programs. And so even this one, if it has some impact, it's not going to be win the changes our overall long term outlook for the group.

I know the number in aggregate for the quarter was right [ around ] the $100 million, which was off a little bit from the second quarter but higher in the second quarter. And that's, of course, right in line with the increased variability we anticipated seeing with these changes under the new revenue recognition model. It did have a good favorable effect on IS&T. So I think we had 11.7% margins in the quarter for IS&T. That's not likely to be sustained in the fourth quarter. Albeit, the margins will continue to be strong for the group in the fourth quarter, but we'll see that come back down a little bit. Little bit of an impact in combat systems, but not too much with respect to changes in estimates or true-ups. And in Marine Systems, we did see a couple of modest, albeit a handful of booking rate changes in some of those programs, which in this case, I'll just happen to line it positively. So you saw them or it is in the Marine Systems in the quarter. So I would frankly expect to see the Marine Systems margin tick back down a little bit in the fourth quarter, but still to show good progress in those yards. So bottom line, it had an effect. It was favorable in the quarter, but not an outsized way compared to where we've been in the past. And again, at barring a similar trend in the fourth quarter, we expect to see some of those margins march back down a little bit in the range which we consider to be more normal."

So the growth in the group so far this year has really largely been attributable to the ramp in the international program that we've discussed. We started the delivery process for those programs. And in fact, we're now up at forward production for the large Middle East program coming out of Canada. We've started to make initial deliveries, and I think we've made the first handful deliveries on the U.K. AJAX program. That will start to build rate and come up the full rate throughout and toward the end of next year, so you'll see some ramp next year attributable to that. And that will sustain out for the next couple of years beyond the Middle East international program, as I said, is absolute rate and pretty steady state for the next couple of years. And now we're starting to see the start up a U.S. domestic ground forces recap, and we'll see that more of an influence in the fourth quarter. So I would expect more of the growth that we see in the fourth quarter to be about those programs. And really, that dovetails into your margin question because we'll start to see those come in at traditional sort of U.S. Defense entry-level program margins. And so that will have somewhat of a dilutive effect on the Combat Systems group margins in the fourth quarter as we start of those programs. So it really nice layering of the international programs. The Middle East having a big effect this year, army recap starting this year and moving into next year and then the U.K. program ramping next year and beyond. So I think it's a wholesome position for combat to be in and supported by the tremendous backlog that they see in that group."

As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.52 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.58 billion, operating earnings of $1.052 billion and income from continuing operations of $764 million, a 10.1%  return on sales. The EPS performance was $0.16 better than the year-ago quarter and $0.09 better than consensus. 
Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was down $77 million or 1%; but operating earnings were up $37 million, a 3.6% increase; and income from continuing operations was up $33 million, a 4.5% increase. 
The quarter's operating margin at 13.9% is 60 basis points better than the third quarter of 2016. Once again, we enjoyed very positive operating leverage. Sequentially, revenue was down $95 million or 1.2%, while operating earnings were down $4 million and operating margin was up 10 basis points. From an operating perspective, the second and third quarters look a lot of like as we said they would. The $0.07 EPS improvement was driven by a modestly lower share count and 180 basis point lower effective tax rate in the third quarter. 
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was off $211 million, less than 1%. However, operating earnings are up $177 million or 6% and operating margins are up 90 basis points. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations are also up $177 million or 8.4%, and earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.71, 10.5% better year-to-date.
With respect to cash, we had very efficient conversion in the quarter. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $871 million and free cash flow from operations of $751 million. For year-to-date, we have free cash flow from operations slightly in excess of $1.6 billion. 
As you can see from the chart attached to our press release, an important story in the quarter was the very healthy backlog increase. The total backlog of $63.9 billion is a $5.4 billion increase in excess of 9% over the second quarter. There was very good contract activity in all of our groups with particularly strong order intake in the Marine group. I should point out that each of our defense businesses enjoyed backlog growth with the exception of NASSCO, and it didn't miss by much. 
Let me say a few words about each of our business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $70 million or 3.6% compared to the third quarter of 2016, and operating earnings increased $8 million or 2.1% to $385 million on an operating margin of 19.3%. On a sequential basis, the group experienced $83 million less in revenue, about 4%, and a $40 million reduction in operating earnings attributable to 120 basis point contraction in margins.  On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up $157 million or 2.6% and operating earnings are up $120 million or 10.6% on 150 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
We had good order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.8 to 1 book-to-bill measured on a dollar value of orders basis. But Gulfstream alone was a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill on both the dollar value and the number of units basis. I can also tell you that our pipeline and active sales discussions are quite good. We are again reasonably optimistic about our order intake in the fourth quarter, and I expect it to look much like the third quarter, if not somewhat better. 
Our certification flying continues to progress well, including the addition of test points required to extend the G500 and G600 range. As we announced during the recent NBAA Air Show, additional testing has enabled us to increase the G500 range by 200 nautical miles at 0.85 mark and 600 nautical mile at 0.90 mark. It's really quite remarkable that the G500 with a 5,200 nautical mile range of 0.85 mark can travel 4,400 nautical mile at 0.90. This was the approximate range of the G450 at 0.80 mark.  On the G600, our additional validation tests have proven an additional 300 nautical miles at 0.85 mark as well as 300 nautical miles at 0.90 mark. The additional testing required for the specific fuel consumption and center of gravity test points have ensured proper performance and safety margins in both aircraft. Although this late in the program schedule, we believe the result and value to our customers was worth the effort. 
While flying has progressed on schedule, testing by one of our suppliers for component level qualification associated with the concurrent FAA and the EIS certification has added a new complexity at the end of the program. While we accounted for this type of supplier impacting our plan, one of our suppliers apparently didn't anticipate the additional EIS test requirements and is somewhat behind. We expect to resolve this issue and deliver the G500 to our customers as planned. If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. So we're still on track and we continue to monitor the supplier closely as we near the end of the certification program. 
Turning to combat systems. The group had an excellent quarter with revenue of $1.5 billion, operating earnings of $247 million and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. As you would expect, the quarter-over-quarter sequential and year-to-date comparisons are all quite favorable. Compared to third quarter of 2016, revenue was up $173 million or 13%, and earnings were up $38 million or 18.2% on an 80 basis point improvement in margin.  On a sequential basis, revenue was up $86 million or 6.1% and operating earnings were up $22 million or 9.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin.  Year-to-date, revenue was up over 2016 by $332 million or 8.6%. Operating earnings are up $76 million or 12.6% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
Combat Systems remains on course for a very good year. We fully anticipate that the fourth quarter will see around a 15% increase in revenue over this quarter but also some degradation in operating margin as a result of a mix shift to new programs, so that the increase in operating earnings will be more modest than the revenue increase.  All of our major programs are performing very well. We continue to see opportunities for growth, both internationally and domestically for the group. 
The Marine group reported revenue of $1.93 billion, a $144 million or 6.9% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. Similarly, revenue was down sequentially by $148 million or 7.1%, and year-to-date revenue of $5.94 billion is lower by $231 million or 3.7%. Revenue across the year has been down based on Virginia-class Block III timing, a slowdown in the Columbia program design work as a result of extended negotiations over the IPPD contract and the wind down some of the commercial work at NASSCO. These revenue headwinds are now largely behind us. 
Operating earnings for the third quarter at $179 million were down by $18 million compared to last year's quarter. On a sequential basis, the group's operating margins improved 70 basis points, which led to a $1 million increase in operating earnings despite the $148 million decrease in revenue. It's very nice to have margins in the group north of 9% once again. While this is encouraging, we'll have to see whether it's sustainable. 
And finally, IS&T. While IS&T's revenue at $2.15 billion was down $176 million or 7.6% against last year's quarter, it was up $50 million sequentially. Year-to-date revenue of $6.4 billion is down $469 million or 6.8% over last year. However, we expect a strong fourth quarter and we'll be essentially flat with 2016 for the year. 
Revenue has been lower during the year, primarily on timing. Lower-than-expected Army product sales impacted the third quarter and the Army had trouble executing after the 6-month CR and, of course, the change in administration slowed some execution as well. We'll recover a lot of this revenue in the fourth quarter, but don't have enough time to recover it all. Some anticipated revenue will slip into next year, but we're in good position to hold 2017 revenue close to the 2016 level. 
In sharp contrast, operating earnings of $253 million were up $14 million or 5.9% compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 140 basis point improvement in operating margins. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings were up $13 million or 11.7% operating margins, which is a 30 basis point improvement. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings are up $19 million, a 2.7% increase on a 110 basis point improvement in the operating margins. So IS&T has managed to overcome less-than-anticipated revenue with its very strong operating performance. 
So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year are concerned? We fully expect the fourth quarter to look much like the other 3 from an operating earnings perspective. However, we expect the higher effective tax rate in the quarter leading to a lower reported EPS. For the year, stronger-than-expected operating results year-to-date, a lower than planned tax rate and a modestly lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operations now goes to a range from $9.75 to $9.80. This late in the year, we anticipate our end-of-year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance, so the ranges narrow. 
And finally in closing, as tempting as it is at this time of the year to ask about next year, let me remind you that we have our planning process later this fall when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. The guidance that we gave you last January was grounded in that process, and as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from us in detail in January as has been our custom for many years. 
I'd now like to turn the call back to Bill to cover some additional financial items."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the third quarter of 2016.

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the third quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense year-to-date to $76 million versus $68 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter last year.  For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $110 million, which includes the impact of the issuance of $1 billion of debt in the third quarter in anticipation of the repayment of $900 million in notes maturing in the fourth quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was 25.6% for the quarter and 25.8% year-to-date. We're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of approximately 27%. The lower rate in the quarter and our reduced forecast for the year both attributable to the finalization of open tax years and a greater benefit from employee stock option exercises than previously forecast. 
On the capital deployment front, in the third quarter, we purchased 1.2 million shares, bringing us to 5.9 million shares in the first 9 months of 2017 for $1.1 billion. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid through the first 9 months, we've spent $1.9 billion or nearly 120% of our free cash flow year-to-date. We've also made a number of small acquisitions in our Aerospace and IS&T groups this year, totaling $364 million. This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion and a net debt position of $2.2 billion.

So first off, I'm really not at liberty to get into any specifics around the specific supplier. That's somewhat confidential information that Gulfstream needs to deal with, but I can tell you that this is not an issue that has to do with anything related to flight test or the flying capabilities or the readiness of the airplanes to go into service. This is strictly a paperwork exercise that we're going through and really, it has to do with -- as we've noted, the additional test points that have allowed the additional range as well as, I've mentioned the simultaneous -- this is the first time we've done a simultaneous FAA and EASA, that's the European Aviation Authority certification. And really, that is a benefit to our customers to achieve those simultaneous certifications, so we can accommodate the deliveries to our international customers. But long story short, this is not -- any type of a risk item to the program is strictly a matter of getting through paperwork through that certification process. As it relates to 2018, as I mentioned, deliveries are still on schedule with our original plan and our original contractual customer dates. You may recall that for a while there, we were optimistically considering that there might be an opportunity to advance that entry into service by 3 or 4 months. We had this opportunity to go after additional capability in the aircraft, and we did that knowing that we would still be able to meet our original customer commitments while achieving that additional capability. So really, no impact there. And likewise to your question, no impact on our expected 2018 deliveries. The production and the delivery schedule remain intact as we originally anticipated, and so we don't see any modification there."

I think as we look forward, we -- a couple of things. We like our credit rating, where we stand today and we don't look to modify that. But certainly, we see the balance sheet as an opportunity for when and if strategic opportunities come up that we are ready to be agile and move quickly with those opportunities.You saw that in small dose here in the first 9 months.

The pieces are in place to achieve that growth. There are a lot of moving parts, but it's in the backlog. We had a good September, which leads us to feel very -- like we're very well positioned to close out the year in a strong fashion. Most of that growth is coming out of the products business and the order cadence is there to support that. So again, while there's a lot of moving parts, we feel very good about where we are and the pieces are in place to get there. In terms of the impact of the acquisition, I would say that's not the big driver. It has an impact but I -- to be honest with you, I don't actually have that number in front of me. The big driver is the catch up from the timing we've seen throughout the year and its impact that it's had on our Mission Systems product business. We've talked a good bit about those timing effects of the Army procurement and some of the civil agencies and so on, that we've seen delayed by the 6-month-plus CR and so on, but we feel good about that timing starting to catch back up this year. If we don't get fully back to the 2016 level, it'll be close in that timing, we'll just spill over a little bit into '17  or into -- and '18, excuse me."

So look, I think bottom line, when you think about this tactical network backbone for the Army, that is absolutely a square in our core as anything else that's out there. And so we feel very good about the fact that we will continue to be a player from a -- systems integration role moving forward. Obviously, the Army is yet to define what its revised tactical network and baseline is going to be, so we'll -- we don't want to get out ahead of that. But as we see it right now, the decisions that have been made to date and what's on the table at this point, has a minimal revenue impact, if any, to 2018. So we feel very comfortable with where we're headed for '18. And frankly beyond that, the impact will depend on future Army decisions, so it probably wouldn't be appropriate to speculate and get out ahead of them at this point. What I can tell you is, as you are well aware, IS&T is a makeup of vast portfolio of lots of different opportunities and programs. And so -- even this one, if it has some impact, it's not going to be one of the changes to our overall long-term outlook for the group. So we feel comfortable that our multiyear CAGR for the group, which I think we gave you at 4.5% or so, remains intact at this point."

And that's, of course, right in line with the increased variability we anticipated seeing with these changes under the new revenue recognition model. It did have a good favorable effect on IS&T. You saw -- I think we had 11.7% margins in the quarter for IS&T. That's not likely to be sustained in the fourth quarter, albeit, the margins will continue to be strong for the group in the fourth quarter, but we'll see that come back down a little bit. A little bit of an impact in Combat Systems, but not too much with respect to changes in estimates or true-ups. And in Marine Systems, we did see a couple of modest, albeit, a handful of booking rate changes on some of those programs, which in this case, all just happened to line up positively. And so you saw the strong margin in Marine Systems in the quarter. So I would, frankly, expect to see the Marine Systems margin tick back down a little bit in the fourth quarter, but still to show good progress in those yards. So it -- bottom line, it had an effect. It was favorable in the quarter, but not in an outsized way compared to where we've been in the past.

The -- so the growth in the group so far this year has really largely been attributable to the ramp in the international programs that we've discussed. We've started the delivery process for those programs. And in fact, we're now up at full rate production for the larger Middle East program coming out to Canada. We've started to make initial deliveries on -- and I think we've made the first handful of deliveries on the U.K. AJAX program. That will start to build rate and come up to full rate throughout and toward the end of next year, so you'll see some ramp next year attributable to that. And that'll sustain out through the next couple of years beyond -- the Middle East international program, as I said, has absolute rate and must be pretty steady state for the next couple of years. And now we're starting to see the startup of U.S. domestic ground forces recap, and we'll see that more of an influence in the fourth quarter. So I would expect more of the growth that we see in the fourth quarter to be about those programs. And really, that dovetails into your margin question because we'll start to see those come in at traditional sort of U.S. Defense entry-level program margins. And so that will have somewhat of a dilutive effect on the Combat Systems group margins in the fourth quarter as we start up those programs. So a really nice layering of the international programs. The Middle East having a big effect this year, army recap starting this year and moving into next year and then the U.K. program ramping next year and beyond. So I think it's a wholesome position for Combat to be in and supported by the tremendous backlog that they see in that group."

As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.52 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.58 billion, operating earnings of $1.052 billion and income from continuing operations of $764 million, a 10.1% return on sales. The EPS performance was $0.16 better than the year-ago quarter and $0.09 better than consensus. 
Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was down $77 million or 1%; but operating earnings were up $37 million, a 3.6% increase; and income from continuing operations was up $33 million, a 4.5% increase. 
The quarter's operating margin at 13.9% is 60 basis points better than the third quarter of 2016. Once again, we enjoyed very positive operating leverage. Sequentially, revenue was down $95 million or 1.2%, while operating earnings were down $4 million and operating margin was up 10 basis points. From an operating perspective, the second and third quarters look a lot alike as we said they would. The $0.07 EPS improvement was driven by a modestly lower share count and 180 basis point lower effective tax rate in the third quarter. 
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was off $211 million, less than 1%. However, operating earnings are up $177 million or 6% and operating margins are up 90 basis points. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations are also up $177 million or 8.4%, and earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.71, 10.5% better year-to-date.
With respect to cash, we had very efficient conversion in the quarter. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $871 million and free cash flow from operations of $751 million. For year-to-date, we have free cash flow from operations slightly in excess of $1.6 billion. 
As you can see from the charts attached to our press release, an important story in the quarter was the very healthy backlog increase. The total backlog of $63.9 billion is a $5.4 billion increase in excess of 9% over the second quarter. There was very good contract activity in all of our groups with particularly strong order intake in the Marine group. I should point out that each of our defense businesses enjoyed backlog growth with the exception of NASSCO, and it didn't miss by much. 
Let me say a few words about each of our business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $70 million or 3.6% compared to the third quarter of 2016, and operating earnings increased $8 million or 2.1% to $385 million on an operating margin of 19.3%. On a sequential basis, the group experienced $83 million less in revenue, about 4%, and a $40 million reduction in operating earnings attributable to 120 basis point contraction in margins.  On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up $157 million or 2.6% and operating earnings are up $120 million or 10.6% on 150 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
We had good order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.8 to 1 book-to-bill measured on a dollar value of orders basis. But Gulfstream alone was a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill on both the dollar value and the number of units basis. I can also tell you that our pipeline and active sales discussions are quite good. We are again reasonably optimistic about our order intake in the fourth quarter, and I expect it to look much like the third quarter, if not somewhat better. 
Our certification flying continues to progress well, including the additional test points required to extend the G500 and G600 range. As we announced during the recent NBAA Air Show, additional testing has enabled us to increase the G500 range by 200 nautical miles at 0.85 mach and 600 nautical mile at 0.90 mach. It's really quite remarkable that the G500 with a 5,200 nautical mile range of 0.85 mach can travel 4,400 nautical mile at 0.90. This was the approximate range of the G450 at 0.80 mach.  On the G600, our additional validation tests have proven an additional 300 nautical miles at 0.85 mach as well as 300 nautical miles at 0.90 mach. The additional testing required for the specific fuel consumption and center of gravity test points have ensured proper performance and safety margins in both aircraft. Although this length in the program schedule, we believe the result and value to our customers was worth the effort. 
While flying has progressed on schedule, testing by one of our suppliers for component level qualification associated with the concurrent FAA and the EASA certification has added a new complexity at the end of the program. While we accounted for this type of supplier impact in our plan, one of our suppliers apparently didn't anticipate the additional EASA test requirements and is somewhat behind. We expect to resolve this issue and deliver the G500 to our customers as planned. If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. So we're still on track and we continue to monitor the supplier closely as we near the end of the certification program. 
Turning to combat systems. The group had an excellent quarter with revenue of $1.5 billion, operating earnings of $247 million and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. As you would expect, the quarter-over-quarter sequential and year-to-date comparisons are all quite favorable. Compared to third quarter of 2016, revenue was up $173 million or 13%, and earnings were up $38 million or 18.2% on an 80 basis point improvement in margin.  On a sequential basis, revenue was up $86 million or 6.1% and operating earnings were up $22 million or 9.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin.  Year-to-date, revenue was up over 2016 by $332 million or 8.6%. Operating earnings are up $76 million or 12.6% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
Combat Systems remains on course for a very good year. We fully anticipate that the fourth quarter will see around a 15% increase in revenue over this quarter but also some degradation in operating margin as a result of a mix shift to new programs, so that the increase in operating earnings will be more modest than the revenue increase.  All of our major programs are performing very well. We continue to see opportunities for growth, both internationally and domestically for the group. 
The Marine group reported revenue of $1.93 billion, a $144 million or 6.9% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. Similarly, revenue was down sequentially by $148 million or 7.1%, and year-to-date revenue of $5.94 billion is lower by $231 million or 3.7%. Revenue across the year has been down based on Virginia-class Block III timing, a slowdown in the Columbia program design work as a result of extended negotiations over the IPPD contract and the wind down of some of the commercial work at NASSCO. These revenue headwinds are now largely behind us. 
Operating earnings for the third quarter at $179 million were down by $18 million compared to last year's quarter. On a sequential basis, the group's operating margins improved 70 basis points, which led to a $1 million increase in operating earnings despite the $148 million decrease in revenue. It's very nice to have margins in the group north of 9% once again. While this is encouraging, we'll have to see whether it's sustainable. 
And finally, IS&T. While IS&T's revenue at $2.15 billion was down $176 million or 7.6% against last year's quarter, it was up $50 million sequentially. Year-to-date revenue of $6.4 billion is down $469 million or 6.8% over last year. However, we expect a strong fourth quarter and we'll be essentially flat with 2016 for the year. 
Revenue has been lower during the year, primarily on timing. Lower-than-expected Army product sales impacted the third quarter and the Army had trouble executing after the 6-month CR and, of course, the change in administration slowed some execution as well. We'll recover a lot of this revenue in the fourth quarter, but don't have enough time to recover it all. Some anticipated revenue will slip into next year, but we're in good position to hold 2017 revenue close to the 2016 level. 
In sharp contrast, operating earnings of $253 million were up $14 million or 5.9% compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 140 basis point improvement in operating margins. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings were up $13 million or 11.7% operating margins, which is a 30 basis point improvement. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings are up $19 million, a 2.7% increase on a 110 basis point improvement in the operating margin. So IS&T has managed to overcome less-than-anticipated revenue with a very strong operating performance. 
So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year are concerned? We fully expect the fourth quarter to look much like the other 3 from an operating earnings perspective. However, we expect the higher effective tax rate in the quarter leading to a lower reported EPS. For the year, stronger-than-expected operating results year-to-date, a lower than planned tax rate and a modestly lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operations now goes to a range from $9.75 to $9.80. This late in the year, we anticipate our end-of-year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance, so the range is narrow. 
And finally in closing, as tempting as it is at this time of the year to ask about next year, let me remind you that we have our planning process later this fall when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. The guidance that we gave you last January was grounded in that process, and as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from us in detail in January as has been our custom for many years. 
I'd now like to turn the call back to Bill to cover some additional financial items."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the third quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense year-to-date to $76 million versus $68 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017",323,"Thank you, Jason. 
Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the third quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense year-to-date to $76 million versus $68 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter last year.  For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $110 million, which includes the impact of the issuance of $1 billion of debt in the third quarter in anticipation of the repayment of $900 million in notes maturing in the fourth quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was 25.6% for the quarter and 25.8% year-to-date. We're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of approximately 27%. The lower rate in the quarter and our reduced forecast for the year both attributable to the finalization of open tax years and a greater benefit from employee stock option exercises than previously forecast. 
On the capital deployment front, in the third quarter, we purchased 1.2 million shares, bringing us to 5.9 million shares in the first 9 months of 2017 for $1.1 billion. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid through the first 9 months, we've spent $1.9 billion or nearly 120% of our free cash flow year-to-date. We've also made a number of small acquisitions in our Aerospace and IS&T groups this year, totaling $364 million. This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion and a net debt position of $2.2 billion. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year to approach 100% of earnings from continuing operations, and we'll continue to deploy 100% of that free cash flow, less the amount spent on acquisitions, to dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, we will move to the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Denise, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?"

So first off, I'm really not at liberty to get into any specifics around the specific supplier. That's somewhat confidential information that Gulfstream needs to deal with, but I can tell you that this is not an issue that has to do with anything related to flight test or the flying capabilities or the readiness of the airplanes to go into service. This is strictly a paperwork exercise that we're going through and really, it has to do with -- as we've noted, the additional test points that have allowed the additional range as well as, I've mentioned the simultaneous -- this is the first time we've done a simultaneous FAA and EASA, that's the European Aviation Authority certification. And really, that is a benefit to our customers to achieve those simultaneous certifications, so that we can accommodate the deliveries to our international customers. But long story short, this is not -- any type of a risk item to the program is strictly a matter of getting through paperwork through that certification process. As it relates to 2018, as I mentioned, deliveries are still on schedule with our original plan and our original contractual customer dates. You may recall that for a while there, we were optimistically considering that there might be an opportunity to advance that entry into service by 3 or 4 months. We had this opportunity to go after additional capability in the aircraft, and we did that knowing that we would still be able to meet our original customer commitments while achieving that additional capability. So really, no impact there. And likewise to your question, no impact on our expected 2018 deliveries. The production and the delivery schedule remain intact as we originally anticipated, and so we don't see any modification there."

So on the first question, you read that correctly. And I -- it may be a subtlety that we're articulating because it's relevant in the moment, but it's always been our approach that with respect to capital deployment, I mentioned a minute ago the dividend approach, that's steady and repeatable.  M&A is there, if and when we find accretive and core acquisitions and then the residual from a tactical standpoint, is share repurchase. So I don't think that's any different than what we've talked about, it's just, I think, become relevant as you've seen it here in the third quarter this year. So that is absolutely the case. As it relates to pension, we did make our scheduled pension contributions. So no change to the outlook with respect to that. For the year, I believe the number was somewhere in the ballpark of $200 million. I don't think that's changed. And as it relates to closing out the year, we've got a big fourth quarter lined up. But frankly, that's not unusual for us. It's a pretty typical pattern for us. And one of the things we -- I think would look to as the biggest driver behind the ramp there in the fourth quarter is the transition to billing and delivery and collection on these major international programs is starting to unwind a good bit of that working capital in the fourth quarter. That's the single biggest driver that brings us down that curve."

I think as it relates to the impact on share repurchase, as I said, that's always tactical. And while we targeted 100% return between dividend and share repurchase, modified by the acquisition activity, that's a rough number because it's tactical. It's something we shoot for. If it were a 10-point sort of bullet point at the target then it wouldn't be tactical, we'd be driving toward a fixed answer. And if you look back over the past couple of years, we've, in fact, well exceeded the 100% return benchmark, and this year, we're on target to meet that. So I don't know that it has any direct implication. We'll just have to assess each of those opportunities when they come up and see what they do with respect to the implications on the long-term leverage."

So I'd have to check and we can go back offline and discuss the math. But the 15-ish percent increase sequentially is entirely consistent with our original forecast of the group -- the Combat Systems group being up 7%, maybe a touch higher, approximately 7% full year over 2016. So we're very comfortable with that, and that's in the backlog. As it relates to IS&T, as I said, it is a steep curve in the quarter, but we feel very good about it. The pieces are in place to achieve that growth. There are a lot of moving parts, but it's in the backlog. We had a good September, which leads us to feel very -- like we're very well positioned to close out the year in a strong fashion. Most of that growth is coming out of the products business and the order cadence is there to support that. So again, while there's a lot of moving parts, we feel very good about where we are and the pieces are in place to get there. In terms of the impact of the acquisition, I would say that's not the big driver. It has an impact but I -- to be honest with you, I don't actually have that number in front of me. The big driver is the catch up from the timing we've seen throughout the year and its impact that it's had on our Mission Systems product business. We've talked a good bit about those timing effects of the Army procurement and some of the civil agencies and so on, that we've seen delayed by the 6-month-plus CR and so on, but we feel good about that timing starting to catch back up this year. If we don't get fully back to the 2016 level, it'll be close and that timing would just spill over a little bit into '17  or into -- into '18, excuse me."

So look, I think bottom line, when you think about this tactical network backbone for the Army, that is absolutely a square in our core as anything else that's out there.

Obviously, the Army is yet to define what its revised tactical network and baseline is going to be, so we'll -- we don't want to get out ahead of that. But as we see it right now, the decisions that have been made to date and what's on the table at this point, has a minimal revenue impact, if any, to 2018. So we feel very comfortable with where we're headed for '18. And frankly beyond that, the impact will depend on future Army decisions, so it probably wouldn't be appropriate to speculate and get out ahead of them at this point. What I can tell you is, as you are well aware, IS&T is a makeup of a vast portfolio of lots of different opportunities and programs. And so -- even this one, if it has some impact, it's not going to be one of the changes of our overall long-term outlook for the group. So we feel comfortable that our multiyear CAGR for the group, which I think we gave you at 4.5% or so, remains intact at this point."

You saw -- I think we had 11.7% margins in the quarter for IS&T. That's not likely to be sustained in the fourth quarter, albeit, the margins will continue to be strong for the group in the fourth quarter, but we'll see that come back down a little bit. A little bit of an impact in Combat Systems, but not too, too much with respect to changes in estimates or true-ups. And in Marine Systems, we did see a couple of modest, albeit, a handful of booking rate changes on some of those programs, which in this case, all just happened to line up positively. And so you saw the strong margin in Marine Systems in the quarter. So I would, frankly, expect to see the Marine Systems margin tick back down a little bit in the fourth quarter, but still to show good progress in those yards. So it -- bottom line, it had an effect. It was favorable in the quarter, but not in an outsized way compared to where we've been in the past.

We've started to make initial deliveries on -- I think we've made the first handful of deliveries on the U.K. AJAX program. That will start to build rate and come up to full rate throughout and toward the end of next year, so you'll see some ramp next year attributable to that. And that'll sustain out through the next couple of years beyond -- the Middle East international program, as I said, is at full rate and must be pretty steady state for the next couple of years. And now we're starting to see the startup of the U.S. domestic ground forces recap, and we'll see that more of an influence in the fourth quarter. So I would expect more of the growth that we see in the fourth quarter to be about those programs. And really, that dovetails into your margin question because we'll start to see those come in at traditional sort of U.S. Defense entry-level program margins. And so that will have somewhat of a dilutive effect on the Combat Systems group margins in the fourth quarter as we start up those programs. So a really nice layering of the international programs. The Middle East having a big effect this year, army recap starting this year and moving into next year and then the U.K. program ramping next year and beyond. So I think it's a wholesome position for Combat to be in and supported by the tremendous backlog that they see in that group."

I'd like to start by sharing with everyone that Phebe is not able to be here today as she was unfortunately hit with a bad case of the flu. She's asked me to cover today's call, and I've invited our Controller, Bill Moss, to join me. We all wish Phebe a full and speedy recovery, but for now, let's get on with the results. 
As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.52 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.58 billion, operating earnings of $1.052 billion and income from continuing operations of $764 million, a 10.1% return on sales. The EPS performance was $0.16 better than the year-ago quarter and $0.09 better than consensus. 
Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was down $77 million or 1%; but operating earnings were up $37 million, a 3.6% increase; and income from continuing operations was up $33 million, a 4.5% increase. 
The quarter's operating margin at 13.9% is 60 basis points better than the third quarter of 2016. Once again, we enjoyed very positive operating leverage. Sequentially, revenue was down $95 million or 1.2%, while operating earnings were down $4 million and operating margin was up 10 basis points. From an operating perspective, the second and third quarters look a lot alike as we said they would. The $0.07 EPS improvement was driven by a modestly lower share count and 180 basis point lower effective tax rate in the third quarter. 
On a year-to-date basis, revenue was off $211 million, less than 1%. However, operating earnings are up $177 million or 6% and operating margins are up 90 basis points. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations are also up $177 million or 8.4%, and earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.71, 10.5% better year-to-date.
With respect to cash, we had very efficient conversion in the quarter. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $871 million and free cash flow from operations of $751 million. For year-to-date, we have free cash flow from operations slightly in excess of $1.6 billion. 
As you can see from the charts attached to our press release, an important story in the quarter was the very healthy backlog increase. The total backlog of $63.9 billion is a $5.4 billion increase in excess of 9% over the second quarter. There was very good contract activity in all of our groups with particularly strong order intake in the Marine group. I should point out that each of our defense businesses enjoyed backlog growth with the exception of NASSCO, and it didn't miss by much. 
Let me say a few words about each of our business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $70 million or 3.6% compared to the third quarter of 2016, and operating earnings increased $8 million or 2.1% to $385 million on an operating margin of 19.3%. On a sequential basis, the group experienced $83 million less in revenue, about 4%, and a $40 million reduction in operating earnings attributable to 120 basis point contraction in margins.  On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up $157 million or 2.6% and operating earnings are up $120 million or 10.6% on 150 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
We had good order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.8 to 1 book-to-bill measured on a dollar value of orders basis. But Gulfstream alone was a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill on both the dollar value and the number of units basis. I can also tell you that our pipeline and active sales discussions are quite good. We are again reasonably optimistic about our order intake in the fourth quarter, and I expect it to look much like the third quarter, if not somewhat better. 
Our certification flying continues to progress well, including the additional test points required to extend the G500 and G600 range. As we announced during the recent NBAA Air Show, additional testing has enabled us to increase the G500 range by 200 nautical miles at 0.85 mach and 600 nautical mile at 0.90 mach. It's really quite remarkable that the G500 with a 5,200 nautical mile range of 0.85 mach can travel 4,400 nautical mile at 0.90. This was the approximate range of the G450 at 0.80 mach.  On the G600, our additional validation tests have proven an additional 300 nautical miles at 0.85 mach as well as 300 nautical miles at 0.90 mach. The additional testing required for the specific fuel consumption and center of gravity test points have ensured proper performance and safety margins in both aircraft. Although this length in the program schedule, we believe the result and value to our customers was worth the effort. 
While flying has progressed on schedule, testing by one of our suppliers for component level qualification associated with the concurrent FAA and the EASA certification has added a new complexity at the end of the program. While we accounted for this type of supplier impact in our plan, one of our suppliers apparently didn't anticipate the additional EASA test requirements and is somewhat behind. We expect to resolve this issue and deliver the G500 to our customers as planned. If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. So we're still on track and we continue to monitor the supplier closely as we near the end of the certification program. 
Turning to combat systems. The group had an excellent quarter with revenue of $1.5 billion, operating earnings of $247 million and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. As you would expect, the quarter-over-quarter sequential and year-to-date comparisons are all quite favorable. Compared to third quarter of 2016, revenue was up $173 million or 13%, and earnings were up $38 million or 18.2% on an 80 basis point improvement in margin.  On a sequential basis, revenue was up $86 million or 6.1% and operating earnings were up $22 million or 9.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin.  Year-to-date, revenue was up over 2016 by $332 million or 8.6%. Operating earnings are up $76 million or 12.6% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. 
Combat Systems remains on course for a very good year. We fully anticipate that the fourth quarter will see around a 15% increase in revenue over this quarter but also some degradation in operating margin as a result of a mix shift to new programs, so that the increase in operating earnings will be more modest than the revenue increase.  All of our major programs are performing very well. We continue to see opportunities for growth, both internationally and domestically for the group. 
The Marine group reported revenue of $1.93 billion, a $144 million or 6.9% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. Similarly, revenue was down sequentially by $148 million or 7.1%, and year-to-date revenue of $5.94 billion is lower by $231 million or 3.7%. Revenue across the year has been down based on Virginia-class Block III timing, a slowdown in the Columbia program design work as a result of extended negotiations over the IPPD contract and the wind down of some of the commercial work at NASSCO. These revenue headwinds are now largely behind us. 
Operating earnings for the third quarter at $179 million were down by $18 million compared to last year's quarter. On a sequential basis, the group's operating margins improved 70 basis points, which led to a $1 million increase in operating earnings despite the $148 million decrease in revenue. It's very nice to have margins in the group north of 9% once again. While this is encouraging, we'll have to see whether it's sustainable. 
And finally, IS&T. While IS&T's revenue at $2.15 billion was down $176 million or 7.6% against last year's quarter, it was up $50 million sequentially. Year-to-date revenue of $6.4 billion is down $469 million or 6.8% over last year. However, we expect a strong fourth quarter and we'll be essentially flat with 2016 for the year. 
Revenue has been lower during the year, primarily on timing. Lower-than-expected Army product sales impacted the third quarter and the Army had trouble executing after the 6-month CR and, of course, the change in administration slowed some execution as well. We'll recover a lot of this revenue in the fourth quarter, but don't have enough time to recover it all. Some anticipated revenue will slip into next year, but we're in good position to hold 2017 revenue close to the 2016 level. 
In sharp contrast, operating earnings of $253 million were up $14 million or 5.9% compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 140 basis point improvement in operating margins. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings were up $13 million or 11.7% operating margins, which is a 30 basis point improvement. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings are up $19 million, a 2.7% increase on a 110 basis point improvement in the operating margin. So IS&T has managed to overcome less-than-anticipated revenue with a very strong operating performance. 
So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year are concerned? We fully expect the fourth quarter to look much like the other 3 from an operating earnings perspective. However, we expect the higher effective tax rate in the quarter leading to a lower reported EPS. For the year, stronger-than-expected operating results year-to-date, a lower than planned tax rate and a modestly lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operations now goes to a range from $9.75 to $9.80. This late in the year, we anticipate our end-of-year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance, so the range is narrow. 
And finally in closing, as tempting as it is at this time of the year to ask about next year, let me remind you that we have our planning process later this fall when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. The guidance that we gave you last January was grounded in that process, and as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from us in detail in January as has been our custom for many years. 
I'd now like to turn the call back to Bill to cover some additional financial items."

Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the third quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense year-to-date to $76 million versus $68 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017",323,"Thank you, Jason. 
Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the third quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense year-to-date to $76 million versus $68 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter last year.  For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $110 million, which includes the impact of the issuance of $1 billion of debt in the third quarter in anticipation of the repayment of $900 million in notes maturing in the fourth quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was 25.6% for the quarter and 25.8% year-to-date. We're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of approximately 27%. The lower rate in the quarter and our reduced forecast for the year both attributable to the finalization of open tax years and a greater benefit from employee stock option exercises than previously forecast. 
On the capital deployment front, in the third quarter, we purchased 1.2 million shares, bringing us to 5.9 million shares in the first 9 months of 2017 for $1.1 billion. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid through the first 9 months, we've spent $1.9 billion or nearly 120% of our free cash flow year-to-date. We've also made a number of small acquisitions in our Aerospace and IS&T groups this year, totaling $364 million. This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion and a net debt position of $2.2 billion. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year to approach 100% of earnings from continuing operations, and we'll continue to deploy 100% of that free cash flow, less the amount spent on acquisitions, to dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, we will move to the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Denise, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?"

So first off, I'm really not at liberty to get into any specifics around the specific supplier. That's somewhat confidential information that Gulfstream needs to deal with, but I can tell you that this is not an issue that has to do with anything related to flight test or the flying capabilities or the readiness of the airplanes to go into service. This is strictly a paperwork exercise that we're going through and really, it has to do with -- as we've noted, the additional test points that have allowed the additional range as well as, I've mentioned the simultaneous -- this is the first time we've done a simultaneous FAA and EASA, that's the European Aviation Authority certification. And really, that is a benefit to our customers to achieve those simultaneous certifications, so that we can accommodate the deliveries to our international customers. But long story short, this is not -- any type of a risk item to the program is strictly a matter of getting through paperwork through that certification process. As it relates to 2018, as I mentioned, deliveries are still on schedule with our original plan and our original contractual customer dates. You may recall that for a while there, we were optimistically considering that there might be an opportunity to advance that entry into service by 3 or 4 months. We had this opportunity to go after additional capability in the aircraft, and we did that knowing that we would still be able to meet our original customer commitments while achieving that additional capability. So really, no impact there. And likewise to your question, no impact on our expected 2018 deliveries. The production and the delivery schedule remain intact as we originally anticipated, and so we don't see any modification there."

You saw that in small dose here in the first 9 months. That's a little bit more of a toe in the water compared to where we've been for the past few years. Where that leads us, we’ll see.  It really is all about continuing to find accretive opportunities that are in our core, and that's really never changed. That's always been the case and that really is what we hold that balance sheet firepower for."

And I -- it may be a subtlety that we're articulating because it's relevant in the moment, but it's always been our approach that with respect to capital deployment, I mentioned a minute ago the dividend approach, that's steady and repeatable.  M&A is there, if and when we find accretive and core acquisitions and then the residual from a tactical standpoint, is share repurchase. So I don't think that's any different than what we've talked about, it's just, I think, become relevant as you've seen it here in the third quarter this year. So that is absolutely the case. As it relates to pension, we did make our scheduled pension contributions. So no change to the outlook with respect to that. For the year, I believe the number was somewhere in the ballpark of $200 million. I don't think that's changed. And as it relates to closing out the year, we've got a big fourth quarter lined up. But frankly, that's not unusual for us. It's a pretty typical pattern for us. And one of the things we -- I think would look to as the biggest driver behind the ramp there in the fourth quarter is the transition to billing and delivery and collection on these major international programs is starting to unwind a good bit of that working capital in the fourth quarter.

If it were a 10-point sort of bullet point at the target then it wouldn't be tactical, we'd be driving toward a fixed answer.

So I'd have to check and we can go back offline and discuss the math. But the 15-ish percent increase sequentially is entirely consistent with our original forecast of the group -- the Combat Systems group being up 7%, maybe a touch higher, approximately 7% full year over 2016. So we're very comfortable with that, and that's in the backlog. As it relates to IS&T, as I said, it is a steep curve in the quarter, but we feel very good about it. The pieces are in place to achieve that growth. There are a lot of moving parts, but it's in the backlog. We had a good September, which leads us to feel very -- like we're very well positioned to close out the year in a strong fashion. Most of that growth is coming out of the products business and the order cadence is there to support that. So again, while there's a lot of moving parts, we feel very good about where we are and the pieces are in place to get there. In terms of the impact of the acquisition, I would say that's not the big driver. It has an impact but I -- to be honest with you, I don't actually have that number in front of me. The big driver is the catch up from the timing we've seen throughout the year and its impact that it's had on our Mission Systems product business. We've talked a good bit about those timing effects of the Army procurement and some of the civil agencies and so on, that we've seen delayed by the 6-month-plus CR and so on, but we feel good about that timing starting to catch back up this year. If we don't get fully back to the 2016 level, it'll be close and that timing would just spill over a little bit into '17  or into -- into '18, excuse me."

But as we see it right now, the decisions that have been made to date and what's on the table at this point, has a minimal revenue impact, if any, to 2018. So we feel very comfortable with where we're headed for '18. And frankly beyond that, the impact will depend on future Army decisions, so it probably wouldn't be appropriate to speculate and get out ahead of them at this point. What I can tell you is, as you are well aware, IS&T is a makeup of a vast portfolio of lots of different opportunities and programs. And so -- even this one, if it has some impact, it's not going to be one of the changes of our overall long-term outlook for the group.

That's not likely to be sustained in the fourth quarter, albeit, the margins will continue to be strong for the group in the fourth quarter, but we'll see that come back down a little bit. A little bit of an impact in Combat Systems, but not too, too much with respect to changes in estimates or true-ups. And in Marine Systems, we did see a couple of modest, albeit, a handful of booking rate changes on some of those programs, which in this case, all just happened to line up positively. And so you saw the strong margin in Marine Systems in the quarter. So I would, frankly, expect to see the Marine Systems margin tick back down a little bit in the fourth quarter, but still to show good progress in those yards. So it -- bottom line, it had an effect.

The -- so the growth in the group so far this year has really largely been attributable to the ramp in the international programs that we've discussed. We've started the delivery process for those programs. And in fact, we're now up at full rate production for the larger Middle East program coming out to Canada. We've started to make initial deliveries on -- I think we've made the first handful of deliveries on the U.K. AJAX program. That will start to build rate and come up to full rate throughout and toward the end of next year, so you'll see some ramp next year attributable to that. And that'll sustain out through the next couple of years beyond -- the Middle East international program, as I said, is at full rate and must be pretty steady state for the next couple of years. And now we're starting to see the startup of the U.S. domestic ground forces recap, and we'll see that more of an influence in the fourth quarter. So I would expect more of the growth that we see in the fourth quarter to be about those programs. And really, that dovetails into your margin question because we'll start to see those come in at traditional sort of U.S. Defense entry-level program margins. And so that will have somewhat of a dilutive effect on the Combat Systems group margins in the fourth quarter as we start up those programs. So a really nice layering of the international programs. The Middle East having a big effect this year, army recap starting this year and moving into next year and then the U.K. program ramping next year and beyond. So I think it's a wholesome position for Combat to be in and supported by the tremendous backlog that they see in that group."

So we're at a steady 2 per year now and into the foreseeable future. There is conversation around what to do in years when a Columbia submarine is delivered. And so we'll have to see if there's opportunity, from a budget standpoint, to add Virginia-class there. But bottom line, we stand ready to do that. We have the capacity to do it and it, frankly, comes at a relatively minimal investment. The investments at this point, moving forward, that we're evaluating for Electric Boat really have to do with the Block V module for the -- Virginia payload module on the next Virginia-class contract, and of course, the Columbia investments, all of which we're in the process of discussing with the Navy."
