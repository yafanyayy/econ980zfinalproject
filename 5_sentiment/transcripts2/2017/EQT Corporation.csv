Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's conference call. 
With me today are Dave Porges, Chief Executive Officer; Steve Schlotterbeck, President of EQT and President of Exploration and Production; Robert McNally, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Lisa Hyland, Executive Vice President of Midstream.
This call will be replayed for a 7-day period beginning at approximately 1:30 Eastern Time today. The telephone number for the replay is (201) 612-7415 with the confirmation code of 13637701. The call will also be replayed for 7 days on our website. 
To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 a.m. today, which requires that we take the last question of this call at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is (201) 689-7817.
In a moment, Rob will summarize EQT's year-end 2016 results, and Steve will give a brief operational update. Following the prepared remarks, Dave, Steve, Rob and Lisa will all be available to answer your questions.
First, I have one administrative note. As a result of the asset drop-downs into EQM, we changed our reporting format for the midstream business unit. We now report gathering results and transmission results separately, which aligns with EQM's reporting. The midstream assets that were not dropped into EQM are now rolled into the EQT production's results. For your use, we have posted on our website the Q4 and full year 2016 results using the old format as well as the 2016 quarterly results using the new format.
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website; and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2016, which will be filed with the SEC next week.
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob McNally."

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2016 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share compared to 75% -- $0.75 adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable",719,"Thanks, Pat. Good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2016 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share compared to 75% -- $0.75 adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $816 million in 2016 compared to $825 million in 2015.
The high-level story for the year was very strong volume growth in a lower commodity price environment. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT's corporate's results. EQT recorded $322 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2016 and $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Notably, 2016 production volumes were 26% higher than last year and gathering volumes were up by 21%. Due to the lower commodity prices, adjusted EPS and adjusted operating cash flow were both down versus 2015, although results in both used [ph] were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing the results year-over-year. 
Now looking at the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.25 per diluted share. That compares to adjusted loss per share of $0.07 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $327 million in the fourth quarter compared to $239 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Production sales volume was 28% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 while commodity prices were slightly lower. During the quarter, we realized better-than-expected average differential due to a colder December. 
In the fourth quarter, EQT completed the final drop of midstream assets to EQT Midstream Partners for $275 million. The drop included Allegheny Valley Connector, transmission and storage system, along with several Marcellus gathering systems. The sale did not include a small gathering system, which were sold in a separate transaction for $75 million, resulting in total proceeds of $350 million from the transactions.
Now I'll move on to a brief discussion of results by business segment. I will limit my discussion to the full year results as explanations for the full year for the most part applies to the fourth quarter as well.
Starting with the production result. EQT Production achieved record production sales volume of 759 Bcfe for 2016, again, representing a 26% increase over 2015. As has been the case for many years now, the story in 2016 at EQT Production was strong production growth driven by production from our Marcellus shale wells. 2016 was our [ph] seventh straight year of more than 25% sales volume growth. However, lower average realized price has more than offset the increased production in our financial results. The average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $2.47 per Mcf for 2016, which was $0.62 or 20% lower than last year. For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were $2.1 billion or 6% higher year-over-year. DD&A, gathering, transmission, processing and SG&A were all higher, again consistent with the significant production growth. Per unit LOE, including production taxes, were 21% lower for the year as volume increased more than expenses. 
Now moving on to the Midstream results. EQT gathering operating income was $289 million, up 19% year-over-year, mainly as a result of increased gathering revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $109 million or $17 million higher than 2015.
Looking at EQT transmission. Operating income was $238 million, 12% higher than 2015. Operating revenues were $40 million higher than 2015, primarily due to affiliate contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts primarily on the Ohio Valley Connector, which was placed into service on October 1, 2016. Operating expenses were $100 million or $10 million higher than in 2015.
And finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the year in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.4 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet, excluding EQM. We currently forecast $1.3 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. So we're fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion of 2017 CapEx, which excludes EQM and EQGP with operating cash flow as well as current cash on hand.
So with that, I will turn the call over to Steve."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we announced in early December, we're planning to invest $1.5 billion in 2017, including $1.3 billion for well development. Our 2017 sales volume guidance is between 810 and 830 Bcfe wi",798,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we announced in early December, we're planning to invest $1.5 billion in 2017, including $1.3 billion for well development. Our 2017 sales volume guidance is between 810 and 830 Bcfe with a 2017 growth coming primarily from completing wells which were spudded in 2016. Our 2017 activity will result in 15% to 20% growth in 2018, and we expect to grow in the 15% to 20% range for at least the next several years.
Moving on to year-end reserves. Our 2016 year-end total proved reserves increased 35% to 13.5 Tcfe versus year-end 2015. This increase was driven by our 2016 acquisition activity and our drilling efforts, which continue to expand the boundaries of our core Marcellus and Upper Devonian development areas. Acquisitions added approximately 2.4 Tcfe, 2.1 of which is associated with PUD reserves that we will be developing over the next 5 years. Drilling activity resulted in 2.4 Tcfe of extensions, discoveries and other additions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, we replaced 246% of our 2016 production. With the acquisitions factored in, we replaced 555% of our 2016 production. 
Consistent with our consolidation strategy, the average lateral length of our PUDs is more than 600 feet longer than those booked in 2015. It's also worth noting that our 2.4 Tcfe of acquired proved reserves is only associated with the reserves directly associated with that new acreage. Over 600 Bcfe of this year's proved reserves resulted from the synergies created from our leasing and acquisition activity. These synergies allowed the lengthening of laterals on our existing acreage and are a key driver of our consolidation strategy that not only adds proved reserves, it also dramatically improves the economics of our existing development opportunities. 
We continue to focus on operational efficiencies, and the combination of longer laterals and technical improvements has decreased our per unit development costs year-over-year. Our development cost for Marcellus wells completed in 2016 was $0.72 per Mcfe, 10% lower than the $0.80 per Mcfe for last year's Marcellus wells. Compared to last year, total probable and possible reserves are 2.1 Tcf lower due to a 7.2 Tcf reduction in the Huron. However, Marcellus and Upper Devonian probable and possible reserves are up 5.3 Tcfe or 83% from 2015.
Regarding our total resource potential figures. It should come as no surprise that our acquisition helped increase our estimates significantly, but I do want to emphasize that our Utica estimates still only reflect the 30 Tcfe associated with what we believe is in the core. Additionally, the only proved Utica reserve booked this year are from the 5 producing wells, which still have approximately 39 Bcfe of net remaining reserves. We have not yet booked any proved, undeveloped, probable or possible reserves in the Utica.
The questions on investors' minds most recently have been on the status of MVP, the Utica and consolidation. I'll briefly update you on these 3 topics. There's not much update on MVP. Last September, we received a FERC draft Environmental Impact Statement, and the comment period on the draft EIS ended in late December. We are currently preparing responses to a FERC environmental information request, which is typical for the process as the commission works to develop the final EIS. We continue to target a late 2018 in-service date.
On the Utica, since last quarter, we have not turned any new wells online. We are currently fracking the BIG-177 in West Virginia and we're also currently drilling another well in Greene County, Pennsylvania. We plan on spudding 7 Utica test wells during 2017.
On consolidation, as I mentioned last quarter, we had a 230,000 net core Marcellus acres from 2013 to 2016. We believe the biggest benefit from continued consolidation is the economic benefits of longer laterals. We will continue to look to add acreage that bolts on or fills in our existing core acreage position. This week, we purchased an additional 14,000 core West Virginia acres, primarily in Marion and Monongalia Counties, West Virginia for $130 million. Consistent with our objective of extending laterals, this acquisition will allow us to extend 64 well locations from an average of 1,900 feet to 5,700 feet. The latest deal is consistent with our previous comments on consolidation. One, we are focused in our core motivated by longer laterals; and two, small deals are more likely than large acreage deals for corporate transactions.
Our focus continues to be increasing shareholder value by focusing on full-cycle returns. We will accomplish this by driving development and operating costs lower, expanding optionality in our sales portfolio to improve our realized prices and maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to weather the inevitable commodity price cycles.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Pat Kane."

More likely, you'll see changes in how we or how -- differences in how we function, between Dave and I. So we have different personalities and different approaches to things, but I think the general strategy will remain consistent, and that is to focus clearly on increasing shareholder value. Ultimately, a lot of that comes from driving costs lower. And I think we -- you've heard us talk about it, but 2 big themes here are consolidation and innovation. So we've talked a lot about longer laterals and the economic benefits we get from that. And over the past 8 years or so with the Marcellus, you've seen the progress us and the industry has made on improving returns through innovation and new technologies, and we will continue to try and be a leader in that area. So I think there's always been a strong operational focus as well as a strong financial focus. You will see that continue, although I think there will probably be less financial engineering that will be needed in the future than we've seen over the past 7 years or so."

And that said, the bigger position we build in the core area certainly facilitates additional trades with our partners. We're also trying to consolidate their positions because they see the value as well. So you're going to see both, and I think we'd like to continue to do some acquisition activity. As I mentioned, we think the smaller deals, like we've done, are much more likely than any sort of large strategic merging of big players."

And we feel strongly in the data that's coming in, is confirming our belief that within that certain area that we show in our investor presentation. Within that area, it is a use it or lose it proposition. And incrementally, the MPV per acre is significantly higher if we take the Upper Devonian now in conjunction with the Marcellus than if we don't and then lose the opportunity forever. So we feel even more certain about that conclusion today than we did even 6 months ago. But I think because of the number of wells we have producing, I think we have a high level of certainty about the results and what the right approach is in that area."

That will take some more time to conclude how much or if there's a benefit there, but we continue to experiment and look for better ways on the completion side. I would say our innovations are solely focused on drilling and completion activities, though. And a couple of areas that we're doing a lot of work in are kind of more on the logistical side. So we're doing a lot of operations research kind of work on our rig scheduling and our frac scheduling and how we move and transport water. And what we're finding through some pretty advanced modeling is our previous assumptions about what was optimum turn out to be pretty far off. And the conclusions from these models really aren't intuitive. Very difficult for a human being to look at spreadsheet and come up with the optimum schedule. So we're just starting that kind of work. We think the applicability to our business could be pretty widespread and potentially pretty dramatic in terms of lowering our unit operating cost. So a lot of work happening in that area. It'll take some time, but we're pretty excited about it."

So one example we did is, we brought in a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University to help us with this modeling because it's pretty advanced stuff for, certainly for someone like me. And the first thing he did is he did a look back on a group of pads in Greene County that we already drilled. So we had -- we knew what that was optimal. And our typical assumption was generally, if we have multi-well pads drill all the wells with a rig. It's very expensive to move rigs, about $0.5 million every time we move a rig, so we thought it was best to drill all the wells, move the rig somewhere else, bring in the frac crews, bring in the water and the sand, and frac all the wells back-to-back, and then bring them all online. And if you look back and build this model, which incorporated the logistics of the water, logistics of the crews, the downtime associated with the production, the pipeline capacities and capacity availability and a number of other variables, and the rig schedule that printed out look like a pig's breakfast. I mean, it was moving rigs a lot more often than we thought but said that we would've created significantly more value have we followed to that schedule. So that really opened our eyes, and we really thought this might really add some value at this look at this kind of results everywhere else. So we're starting to apply that, again, to rig and frac scheduling but also just helping us decide how to better design our pipeline systems to make that capital more efficient. And importantly, the best ways to move our water because that's becoming a bigger and bigger piece of our cost structure."

Regarding how many others are out there, it's always hard to say because they're always -- there's been for the past years a fairly steady flow of opportunities, and we've been involved in all our most of those. And I think we're still optimistic that, that flow is going to continue. But it's hard to predict. At any given time, there's 2 or 3 that are, I'd say, active. But sometimes, active means there's a day room and the sellers clearly motivated to sell. And other times active means we're in discussions with a party and it seems like there might be a deal to be done, but sometimes it doesn't work out so. I would say for the scale of acquisitions we've been doing, we expect to float and continue for at least a while."

So generally speaking, and there are lots of variables, so none of this is for certain, but delaying the notice to proceed at least on that part of it is possible to get the partial notice to proceed on the compressor station. But pipeline construction delayed in the February, it might get difficult to get the trees cleared and the tree clearing window to hold to that end of 2018 time frame.

Certainly, prices are a big factor, but available capacity where the gathering systems have capacity to market, where we have processing capacity and we -- at least, personally, I'm always reluctant to make short-term changes in our plans based on short-term changes in commodity prices, especially given that the 9- to 12-month delay from when we change our plans to when we're getting the production online. It just seems like every time we try and do that, we're never in sync with the market. We're always chasing the market, and it's changed by the time we benefit from it. So the moves would have to be dramatic, and we have to have the view that they're going to be sustained before we would really work, rework calendar year development plan."

This call will be replayed for a 7-day period beginning at approximately 1:30 Eastern Time today. The telephone number for the replay is (201) 612-7415 with the confirmation code of 13637701. The call will also be replayed for 7 days on our website. 
To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 a.m. today, which requires that we take the last question of this call at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is (201) 689-7817.
In a moment, Rob will summarize EQT's year-end 2016 results, and Steve will give a brief operational update. Following the prepared remarks, Dave, Steve, Rob and Lisa will all be available to answer your questions.
First, I have one administrative note. As a result of the asset drop-downs into EQM, we changed our reporting format for the midstream business unit. We now report gathering results and transmission results separately, which aligns with EQM's reporting. The midstream assets that were not dropped into EQM are now rolled into the EQT production's results. For your use, we have posted on our website the Q4 and full year 2016 results using the old format as well as the 2016 quarterly results using the new format.
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website; and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2016, which will be filed with the SEC next week.
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob McNally."

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2016 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share compared to 75% -- $0.75 adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable",718,"Thanks, Pat. Good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2016 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share compared to 75% -- $0.75 adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $816 million in 2016 compared to $825 million in 2015.
The high-level story for the year was very strong volume growth in a lower commodity price environment. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT's corporate's results. EQT recorded $322 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2016 and $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Notably, 2016 production volumes were 26% higher than last year and gathering volumes were up by 21%. Due to the lower commodity prices, adjusted EPS and adjusted operating cash flow were both down versus 2015, although results in both used [ph] were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing the results year-over-year. 
Now looking at the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.25 per diluted share. That compares to adjusted loss per share of $0.07 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $327 million in the fourth quarter compared to $239 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Production sales volume was 28% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 while commodity prices were slightly lower. During the quarter, we realized better-than-expected average differential due to a colder December. 
In the fourth quarter, EQT completed the final drop of midstream assets to EQT Midstream Partners for $275 million. The drop included Allegheny Valley Connector, transmission and storage system, along with several Marcellus gathering systems. The sale did not include a small gathering system, which were sold in a separate transaction for $75 million, resulting in total proceeds of $350 million from the transactions.
Now I'll move on to a brief discussion of results by business segment. I will limit my discussion to the full year results as explanations for the full year for the most part applies to the fourth quarter as well.
Starting with the production result. EQT Production achieved record production sales volume of 759 Bcfe for 2016, again, representing a 26% increase over 2015. As has been the case for many years now, the story in 2016 at EQT Production was strong production growth driven by production from our Marcellus shale wells. 2016 was our seventh straight year of more than 25% sales volume growth. However, lower average realized price has more than offset the increased production in our financial results. The average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $2.47 per Mcf for 2016, which was $0.62 or 20% lower than last year. For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were $2.1 billion or 6% higher year-over-year. DD&A, gathering, transmission, processing and SG&A were all higher, again consistent with the significant production growth. Per unit LOE, including production taxes, were 21% lower for the year as volume increased more than expenses. 
Now moving on to the Midstream results. EQT gathering operating income was $289 million, up 19% year-over-year, mainly as a result of increased gathering revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $109 million or $17 million higher than 2015.
Looking at EQT transmission. Operating income was $238 million, 12% higher than 2015. Operating revenues were $40 million higher than 2015, primarily due to affiliate contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts primarily on the Ohio Valley Connector, which was placed into service on October 1, 2016. Operating expenses were $100 million or $10 million higher than in 2015.
And finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the year in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.4 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet, excluding EQM. We currently forecast $1.3 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. So we're fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion of 2017 CapEx, which excludes EQM and EQGP with operating cash flow as well as current cash on hand.
So with that, I will turn the call over to Steve."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we announced in early December, we're planning to invest $1.5 billion in 2017, including $1.3 billion for well development. Our 2017 sales volume guidance is between 810 and 830 Bcfe wi",798,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we announced in early December, we're planning to invest $1.5 billion in 2017, including $1.3 billion for well development. Our 2017 sales volume guidance is between 810 and 830 Bcfe with a 2017 growth coming primarily from completing wells which were spudded in 2016. Our 2017 activity will result in 15% to 20% growth in 2018, and we expect to grow in the 15% to 20% range for at least the next several years.
Moving on to year-end reserves. Our 2016 year-end total proved reserves increased 35% to 13.5 Tcfe versus year-end 2015. This increase was driven by our 2016 acquisition activity and our drilling efforts, which continue to expand the boundaries of our core Marcellus and Upper Devonian development areas. Acquisitions added approximately 2.4 Tcfe, 2.1 of which is associated with PUD reserves that we will be developing over the next 5 years. Drilling activity resulted in 2.4 Tcfe of extensions, discoveries and other additions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, we replaced 246% of our 2016 production. With the acquisitions factored in, we replaced 555% of our 2016 production. 
Consistent with our consolidation strategy, the average lateral length of our PUDs is more than 600 feet longer than those booked in 2015. It's also worth noting that our 2.4 Tcfe of acquired proved reserves is only associated with the reserves directly associated with that new acreage. Over 600 Bcfe of this year's proved reserves resulted from the synergies created from our leasing and acquisition activity. These synergies allowed the lengthening of laterals on our existing acreage and are a key driver of our consolidation strategy that not only adds proved reserves, it also dramatically improves the economics of our existing development opportunities. 
We continue to focus on operational efficiencies, and the combination of longer laterals and technical improvements has decreased our per unit development costs year-over-year. Our development cost for Marcellus wells completed in 2016 was $0.72 per Mcfe, 10% lower than the $0.80 per Mcfe for last year's Marcellus wells. Compared to last year, total probable and possible reserves are 2.1 Tcf lower due to a 7.2 Tcf reduction in the Huron. However, Marcellus and Upper Devonian probable and possible reserves are up 5.3 Tcfe or 83% from 2015.
Regarding our total resource potential figures. It should come as no surprise that our acquisition helped increase our estimates significantly, but I do want to emphasize that our Utica estimates still only reflect the 30 Tcfe associated with what we believe is in the core. Additionally, the only proved Utica reserve booked this year are from the 5 producing wells, which still have approximately 39 Bcfe of net remaining reserves. We have not yet booked any proved, undeveloped, probable or possible reserves in the Utica.
The questions on investors' minds most recently have been on the status of MVP, the Utica and consolidation. I'll briefly update you on these 3 topics. There's not much update on MVP. Last September, we received a FERC draft Environmental Impact Statement, and the comment period on the draft EIS ended in late December. We are currently preparing responses to a FERC environmental information request, which is typical for the process as the commission works to develop the final EIS. We continue to target a late 2018 in-service date.
On the Utica, since last quarter, we have not turned any new wells online. We are currently fracking the BIG-177 in West Virginia and we're also currently drilling another well in Greene County, Pennsylvania. We plan on spudding 7 Utica test wells during 2017.
On consolidation, as I mentioned last quarter, we had a 230,000 net core Marcellus acres from 2013 to 2016. We believe the biggest benefit from continued consolidation is the economic benefits of longer laterals. We will continue to look to add acreage that bolts on or fills in our existing core acreage position. This week, we purchased an additional 14,000 core West Virginia acres, primarily in Marion and Monongalia Counties, West Virginia for $130 million. Consistent with our objective of extending laterals, this acquisition will allow us to extend 64 well locations from an average of 1,900 feet to 5,700 feet. The latest deal is consistent with our previous comments on consolidation. One, we are focused in our core motivated by longer laterals; and two, small deals are more likely than large acreage deals for corporate transactions.
Our focus continues to be increasing shareholder value by focusing on full-cycle returns. We will accomplish this by driving development and operating costs lower, expanding optionality in our sales portfolio to improve our realized prices and maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to weather the inevitable commodity price cycles.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Pat Kane."

So we have different personalities and different approaches to things, but I think the general strategy will remain consistent, and that is to focus clearly on increasing shareholder value. Ultimately, a lot of that comes from driving costs lower. And I think we -- you've heard us talk about it, but 2 big themes here are consolidation and innovation. So we've talked a lot about longer laterals and the economic benefits we get from that. And over the past 8 years or so with the Marcellus, you've seen the progress us and the industry has made on improving returns through innovation and new technologies, and we will continue to try and be a leader in that area. So I think there's always been a strong operational focus as well as a strong financial focus. You will see that continue, although I think there will probably be less financial engineering that will be needed in the future than we've seen over the past 7 years or so."

And we feel strongly in the data that's coming in, is confirming our belief that within that certain area that we show in our investor presentation.

So we feel even more certain about that conclusion today than we did even 6 months ago. But I think because of the number of wells we have producing, I think we have a high level of certainty about the results and what the right approach is in that area."

That will take some more time to conclude how much or if there's a benefit there, but we continue to experiment and look for better ways on the completion side. I would say our innovations are solely focused on drilling and completion activities, though. And a couple of areas that we're doing a lot of work in are kind of more on the logistical side. So we're doing a lot of operations research kind of work on our rig scheduling and our frac scheduling and how we move and transport water. And what we're finding through some pretty advanced modeling is our previous assumptions about what was optimum turn out to be pretty far off. And the conclusions from these models really aren't intuitive. Very difficult for a human being to look at spreadsheet and come up with the optimum schedule. So we're just starting that kind of work. We think the applicability to our business could be pretty widespread and potentially pretty dramatic in terms of lowering our unit operating cost. So a lot of work happening in that area.

So one example we did is we brought in a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University to help us with this modeling because it's pretty advanced stuff for -- certainly for someone like me. And the first thing he did was he did a look back on a group of pads in Greene County that we had already drilled. So we had -- we knew what we -- and thought was optimum. And our typical assumption was, generally, if we have multi-well pads, drill all the wells with the rig. It's very expensive to move rigs. It's about $0.5 million every time we move a rig. So we thought it was best to drill all the wells, move the rig somewhere else, bring in the frac crews, bring in the water and the sand and frac all the wells back to back and then bring them all online. And if you look back and build this model, which incorporated the logistics of the water, logistics of the crews, the downtime associated with the production, the pipeline capacities and capacity availability and a number of other variables, and the rig schedule that it printed out looked like a pig's breakfast. I mean, it was moving rigs a lot more often than we thought but said that we would have created significantly more value have we followed that schedule. So that really opened our eyes, and we really thought, well, this might really add some value if this -- if we get this kind of results everywhere else. So we're starting to apply that, again, to rig and frac scheduling but also to helping us decide how to better design our pipeline systems to make that capital more efficient, and importantly, the best ways to move our water because that's becoming a bigger and bigger piece of our cost structure."

And I will mention on it just because it's what makes us a bit unique is all of that acreage is either fee, about 1/2 of it is in fee, so 100% net revenue interest; and the other half is held by production by shallow wells. So we'll control that acreage forever and have a very high net revenue interest. Regarding how many others are out there, it's always hard to say because they're always -- there's been for the past year or so a fairly steady flow of opportunities, and we've been involved in all or most of those. And I think we're still optimistic that, that flow is going to continue. But it's hard to predict. At any given time, there's 2 or 3 that are, I'd say, active. But sometimes, active means there's a data room and the seller's clearly motivated to sell. And other times active means we're in discussions with a party and it seems like there might be a deal to be done, but sometimes it doesn't work out. So I would say for the scale of acquisitions we've been doing, we expect the flow to continue for at least a while."

But delaying the notice to proceed, at least on that part of it because it's possible to get a partial notice to proceed on the compressor stations.

And we -- at least, personally, I'm always reluctant to make short-term changes in our plans based on short-term changes in commodity prices, especially given the 9- to 12-month delay from when we change our plans to when we're getting the production online. It just seems like every time we try and do that, we're never in sync with the market. We're always chasing the market that it's changed by the time we benefit from it.

To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 a.m. today, which requires that we take the last question of this call at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is (201) 689-7817.
In a moment, Rob will summarize EQT's year-end 2016 results, and Steve will give a brief operational update. Following the prepared remarks, Dave, Steve, Rob and Lisa will all be available to answer your questions.
First, I have one administrative note. As a result of the asset drop-downs into EQM, we changed our reporting format for the midstream business unit. We now report gathering results and transmission results separately, which aligns with EQM's reporting. The midstream assets that were not dropped into EQM are now rolled into the EQT production's results. For your use, we have posted up on our website the Q4 and full year 2016 results using the old format as well as the 2016 quarterly results using the new format.
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website; and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2016, which will be filed with the SEC next week.
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob McNally."

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2016 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share compared to 75% -- $0.75 adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable",718,"Thanks, Pat. Good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2016 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share compared to 75% -- $0.75 adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $816 million in 2016 compared to $825 million in 2015.
The high-level story for the year was very strong volume growth in a lower commodity price environment. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT's corporate results. EQT recorded $322 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2016 and $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Notably, 2016 production volumes were 26% higher than last year and gathering volumes were up by 21%. Due to the lower commodity prices, adjusted EPS and adjusted operating cash flow were both down versus 2015, although results in both years were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing the results year-over-year. 
Now looking at the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.25 per diluted share. That compares to adjusted loss per share of $0.07 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $327 million in the fourth quarter compared to $239 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Production sales volume was 28% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 while commodity prices were slightly lower. During the quarter, we realized better-than-expected average differential due to a colder December. 
In the fourth quarter, EQT completed the final drop of midstream assets to EQT Midstream Partners for $275 million. The drop included Allegheny Valley Connector transmission and storage system along with several Marcellus gathering systems. The sale did not include a small gathering system, which was sold in a separate transaction for $75 million, resulting in total proceeds of $350 million from the transactions.
Now I'll move on to a brief discussion of results by business segment. I will limit my discussion to the full year results as explanations for the full year, for the most part, apply to the fourth quarter as well.
Starting with the production result. EQT Production achieved record production sales volume of 759 Bcfe for 2016, again, representing a 26% increase over 2015. As has been the case for many years now, the story in 2016 at EQT Production was strong production growth driven by production from our Marcellus shale wells. 2016 was our seventh straight year of more than 25% sales volume growth. However, lower average realized price has more than offset the increased production in our financial results. The average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $2.47 per Mcf for 2016, which was $0.62 or 20% lower than last year. For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were $2.1 billion or 6% higher year-over-year. DD&A, gathering, transmission, processing and SG&A were all higher, again consistent with the significant production growth. Per unit LOE, including production taxes, were 21% lower for the year as volume increased more than expenses. 
Now moving on to the Midstream results. EQT gathering operating income was $289 million, up 19% year-over-year, mainly as a result of increased gathering revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $109 million or $17 million higher than 2015.
Looking at EQT transmission. Operating income was $238 million, 12% higher than 2015. Operating revenues were $40 million higher than 2015, primarily due to affiliate contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts primarily on the Ohio Valley Connector, which was placed into service on October 1, 2016. Operating expenses were $100 million or $10 million higher than in 2015.
And finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the year in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.4 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet, excluding EQM. We currently forecast $1.3 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. So we are fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion of 2017 CapEx, which excludes EQM and EQGP with operating cash flow as well as current cash on hand.
So with that, I will turn the call over to Steve."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we announced in early December, we are planning to invest $1.5 billion in 2017, including $1.3 billion for well development. Our 2017 sales volume guidance is between 810 and 830 Bcfe w",800,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we announced in early December, we are planning to invest $1.5 billion in 2017, including $1.3 billion for well development. Our 2017 sales volume guidance is between 810 and 830 Bcfe with a 2017 growth coming primarily from completing wells which were spud in 2016. Our 2017 activity will result in 15% to 20% growth in 2018, and we expect to grow in the 15% to 20% range for at least the next several years.
Moving on to year-end reserves. Our 2016 year-end total proved reserves increased 35% to 13.5 Tcfe versus year-end 2015. This increase was driven by our 2016 acquisition activity and our drilling efforts, which continue to expand the boundaries of our core Marcellus and Upper Devonian development areas. Acquisitions added approximately 2.4 Tcfe, 2.1 Tcfe of which is associated with PUD reserves that we will be developing over the next 5 years. Drilling activity resulted in 2.4 Tcfe of extensions, discoveries and other additions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, we replaced 246% of our 2016 production. With the acquisitions factored in, we replaced 555% of our 2016 production. 
Consistent with our consolidation strategy, the average lateral length of our PUDs is more than 600 feet longer than those booked in 2015. It's also worth noting that our 2.4 Tcfe of acquired proved reserves is only associated with the reserves directly associated with that new acreage. Over 600 Bcfe of this year's proved reserves resulted from the synergies created from our leasing and acquisition activity. These synergies allowed the lengthening of laterals on our existing acreage and are a key driver of our consolidation strategy that not only adds proved reserves, it also dramatically improves the economics of our existing development opportunities. 
We continue to focus on operational efficiencies, and the combination of longer laterals and technical improvements has decreased our per unit development costs year-over-year. Our development cost for Marcellus wells completed in 2016 was $0.72 per Mcfe, 10% lower than the $0.80 per Mcfe for last year's Marcellus wells. Compared to last year, total probable and possible reserves are 2.1 Tcf lower due to a 7.2 Tcf reduction in the Huron. However, Marcellus and Upper Devonian probable and possible reserves are up 5.3 Tcfe or 83% from 2015.
Regarding our total resource potential figures. It should come as no surprise that our acquisition helped increase our estimates significantly, but I do want to emphasize that our Utica estimates still only reflect the 30 Tcfe associated with what we believe is in the core. Additionally, the only proved Utica reserves booked this year are from the 5 producing wells, which still have approximately 39 Bcfe of net remaining reserves. We have not yet booked any proved, undeveloped, probable or possible reserves in the Utica.
The questions on investors' minds most recently have been on the status of MVP, the Utica and consolidation. I'll briefly update you on these 3 topics. There's not too much update on MVP. Last September, we received a FERC draft Environmental Impact Statement, and the comment period on the draft EIS ended in late December. We are currently preparing responses to a FERC environmental information request, which is typical for the process as the commission works to develop the final EIS. We continue to target a late 2018 in-service date.
On the Utica, since last quarter, we have not turned any new wells online. We are currently fracking the BIG-177 in West Virginia and we're also currently drilling another well in Greene County, Pennsylvania. We plan on spudding 7 Utica test wells during 2017.
On consolidation, as I mentioned last quarter, we added 230,000 net core Marcellus acres from 2013 to 2016. We believe the biggest benefit from continued consolidation is the economic benefits of longer laterals. We will continue to look to add acreage that bolts on or fills in our existing core acreage position. This week, we purchased an additional 14,000 core West Virginia acres, primarily in Marion and Monongalia Counties, West Virginia for $130 million. Consistent with our objective of extending laterals, this acquisition will allow us to extend 64 well locations from an average of 1,900 feet to 5,700 feet. The latest deal is consistent with our previous comments on consolidation. One, we are focused in our core, motivated by longer laterals; and two, small deals are more likely than large acreage deals or corporate transactions.
Our focus continues to be increasing shareholder value by focusing on full-cycle returns. We will accomplish this by driving development and operating costs lower, expanding optionality in our sales portfolio to improve our realized prices and maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to weather the inevitable commodity price cycles.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Pat Kane."

So we have different personalities and different approaches to things, but I think the general strategy will remain consistent, and that is to focus clearly on increasing shareholder value. Ultimately, a lot of that comes from driving costs lower. And I think we -- you've heard us talk about it, but 2 big themes here are consolidation and innovation. So we've talked a lot about longer laterals and the economic benefits we get from that. And over the past 8 years or so with the Marcellus, you've seen the progress us and the industry has made on improving returns through innovation and new technologies, and we will continue to try and be a leader in that area. So I think there's always been a strong operational focus as well as a strong financial focus. You will see that continue, although I think there will probably be less financial engineering that will be needed in the future than we've seen over the past 7 years or so."

We're not quite ready to announce any revisions to our type curves, but I would expect that we'll have an update by the next call. We just want to get a little more data there. And we're expanding that to -- we're now testing even higher proppant loads. That will take some more time to conclude how much or if there's a benefit there, but we continue to experiment and look for better ways on the completion side. 
I would say our innovations are solely focused on drilling and completion activities, though. And a couple of areas that we're doing a lot of work in are kind of more on the logistical side. So we're doing a lot of operations research kind of work on our rig scheduling and our frac scheduling and how we move and transport water. And what we're finding through some pretty advanced modeling is our previous assumptions about what was optimum turn out to be pretty far off. And the conclusions from these models really aren't intuitive. Very difficult for a human being to look at spreadsheet and come up with the optimum schedule. So we're just starting that kind of work. We think the applicability to our business could be pretty widespread and potentially pretty dramatic in terms of lowering our unit operating cost. So a lot of work happening in that area. It'll take some time, but we're pretty excited about it."

So one example we did is we brought in a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University to help us with this modeling because it's pretty advanced stuff for -- certainly for someone like me. And the first thing he did was he did a look back on a group of pads in Greene County that we had already drilled. So we had -- we knew what we had thought was optimum. And our typical assumption was, generally, if we have multi-well pads, drill all the wells with the rig. It's very expensive to move rigs. It's about $0.5 million every time we move a rig. So we thought it was best to drill all the wells, move the rig somewhere else, bring in the frac crews, bring in the water and the sand and frac all the wells back to back and then bring them all online. And if you look back and build this model, which incorporated the logistics of the water, logistics of the crews, the downtime associated with the production, the pipeline capacities and capacity availability and a number of other variables, and the rig schedule that it printed out looked like a pig's breakfast. I mean, it was moving rigs a lot more often than we thought but said that we would have created significantly more value had we followed that schedule. So that really opened our eyes, and we really thought, well, this might really add some value if this -- if we get this kind of results everywhere else. So we're starting to apply that, again, to rig and frac scheduling but also to helping us decide how to better design our pipeline systems to make that capital more efficient, and importantly, the best ways to move our water because that's becoming a bigger and bigger piece of our cost structure."

And I will mention on it just because it's -- makes this one a bit unique is all of that acreage is either fee, about 1/2 of it is in fee, so 100% net revenue interest; and the other half is held by production by shallow wells. So we'll control that acreage forever and have a very high net revenue interest. 
Regarding how many others are out there, it's always hard to say because they're always -- there's been for the past year or so a fairly steady flow of opportunities, and we've been involved in all or most of those. And I think we're still optimistic that, that flow is going to continue. But it's hard to predict. At any given time, there's 2 or 3 that are, I'd say, active. But sometimes, active means there's a data room and the seller is clearly motivated to sell. And other times active means we're in discussions with a party and it seems like there might be a deal to be done, but sometimes it doesn't work out. So I would say for the scale of acquisitions we've been doing, we expect the flow to continue for at least a while."

To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 a.m. today, which requires that we take the last question of this call at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is (201) 689-7817.
In a moment, Rob will summarize EQT's year-end 2016 results, and Steve will give a brief operational update. Following the prepared remarks, Dave, Steve, Rob and Lisa will all be available to answer your questions.
First, I have one administrative note. As a result of the asset drop-downs into EQM, we changed our reporting format for the midstream business unit. We now report gathering results and transmission results separately, which aligns with EQM's reporting. The midstream assets that were not dropped into EQM are now rolled into the EQT production's results. For your use, we have posted up on our website the Q4 and full year 2016 results using the old format as well as the 2016 quarterly results using the new format.
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website; and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2016, which will be filed with the SEC next week.
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob McNally."

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2016 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share compared to 75% -- $0.75 adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable",718,"Thanks, Pat. Good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2016 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share compared to 75% -- $0.75 adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $816 million in 2016 compared to $825 million in 2015.
The high-level story for the year was very strong volume growth in a lower commodity price environment. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT's corporate results. EQT recorded $322 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2016 and $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Notably, 2016 production volumes were 26% higher than last year and gathering volumes were up by 21%. Due to the lower commodity prices, adjusted EPS and adjusted operating cash flow were both down versus 2015, although results in both years were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing the results year-over-year. 
Now looking at the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.25 per diluted share. That compares to adjusted loss per share of $0.07 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $327 million in the fourth quarter compared to $239 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Production sales volume was 28% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 while commodity prices were slightly lower. During the quarter, we realized better-than-expected average differential due to a colder December. 
In the fourth quarter, EQT completed the final drop of midstream assets to EQT Midstream Partners for $275 million. The drop included Allegheny Valley Connector transmission and storage system along with several Marcellus gathering systems. The sale did not include a small gathering system, which was sold in a separate transaction for $75 million, resulting in total proceeds of $350 million from the transactions.
Now I'll move on to a brief discussion of results by business segment. I will limit my discussion to the full year results as explanations for the full year, for the most part, apply to the fourth quarter as well.
Starting with the production result. EQT Production achieved record production sales volume of 759 Bcfe for 2016, again, representing a 26% increase over 2015. As has been the case for many years now, the story in 2016 at EQT Production was strong production growth driven by production from our Marcellus shale wells. 2016 was our seventh straight year of more than 25% sales volume growth. However, lower average realized price has more than offset the increased production in our financial results. The average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $2.47 per Mcf for 2016, which was $0.62 or 20% lower than last year. For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were $2.1 billion or 6% higher year-over-year. DD&A, gathering, transmission, processing and SG&A were all higher, again consistent with the significant production growth. Per unit LOE, including production taxes, were 21% lower for the year as volume increased more than expenses. 
Now moving on to the Midstream results. EQT gathering operating income was $289 million, up 19% year-over-year, mainly as a result of increased gathering revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $109 million or $17 million higher than 2015.
Looking at EQT transmission. Operating income was $238 million, 12% higher than 2015. Operating revenues were $40 million higher than 2015, primarily due to affiliate contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts primarily on the Ohio Valley Connector, which was placed into service on October 1, 2016. Operating expenses were $100 million or $10 million higher than in 2015.
And finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the year in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.4 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet, excluding EQM. We currently forecast $1.3 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. So we are fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion of 2017 CapEx, which excludes EQM and EQGP with operating cash flow as well as current cash on hand.
So with that, I will turn the call over to Steve."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we announced in early December, we are planning to invest $1.5 billion in 2017, including $1.3 billion for well development. Our 2017 sales volume guidance is between 810 and 830 Bcfe w",800,"Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we announced in early December, we are planning to invest $1.5 billion in 2017, including $1.3 billion for well development. Our 2017 sales volume guidance is between 810 and 830 Bcfe with a 2017 growth coming primarily from completing wells which were spud in 2016. Our 2017 activity will result in 15% to 20% growth in 2018, and we expect to grow in the 15% to 20% range for at least the next several years.
Moving on to year-end reserves. Our 2016 year-end total proved reserves increased 35% to 13.5 Tcfe versus year-end 2015. This increase was driven by our 2016 acquisition activity and our drilling efforts, which continue to expand the boundaries of our core Marcellus and Upper Devonian development areas. Acquisitions added approximately 2.4 Tcfe, 2.1 Tcfe of which is associated with PUD reserves that we will be developing over the next 5 years. Drilling activity resulted in 2.4 Tcfe of extensions, discoveries and other additions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, we replaced 246% of our 2016 production. With the acquisitions factored in, we replaced 555% of our 2016 production. 
Consistent with our consolidation strategy, the average lateral length of our PUDs is more than 600 feet longer than those booked in 2015. It's also worth noting that our 2.4 Tcfe of acquired proved reserves is only associated with the reserves directly associated with that new acreage. Over 600 Bcfe of this year's proved reserves resulted from the synergies created from our leasing and acquisition activity. These synergies allowed the lengthening of laterals on our existing acreage and are a key driver of our consolidation strategy that not only adds proved reserves, it also dramatically improves the economics of our existing development opportunities. 
We continue to focus on operational efficiencies, and the combination of longer laterals and technical improvements has decreased our per unit development costs year-over-year. Our development cost for Marcellus wells completed in 2016 was $0.72 per Mcfe, 10% lower than the $0.80 per Mcfe for last year's Marcellus wells. Compared to last year, total probable and possible reserves are 2.1 Tcf lower due to a 7.2 Tcf reduction in the Huron. However, Marcellus and Upper Devonian probable and possible reserves are up 5.3 Tcfe or 83% from 2015.
Regarding our total resource potential figures. It should come as no surprise that our acquisition helped increase our estimates significantly, but I do want to emphasize that our Utica estimates still only reflect the 30 Tcfe associated with what we believe is in the core. Additionally, the only proved Utica reserves booked this year are from the 5 producing wells, which still have approximately 39 Bcfe of net remaining reserves. We have not yet booked any proved, undeveloped, probable or possible reserves in the Utica.
The questions on investors' minds most recently have been on the status of MVP, the Utica and consolidation. I'll briefly update you on these 3 topics. There's not too much update on MVP. Last September, we received a FERC draft Environmental Impact Statement, and the comment period on the draft EIS ended in late December. We are currently preparing responses to a FERC environmental information request, which is typical for the process as the commission works to develop the final EIS. We continue to target a late 2018 in-service date.
On the Utica, since last quarter, we have not turned any new wells online. We are currently fracking the BIG-177 in West Virginia and we're also currently drilling another well in Greene County, Pennsylvania. We plan on spudding 7 Utica test wells during 2017.
On consolidation, as I mentioned last quarter, we added 230,000 net core Marcellus acres from 2013 to 2016. We believe the biggest benefit from continued consolidation is the economic benefits of longer laterals. We will continue to look to add acreage that bolts on or fills in our existing core acreage position. This week, we purchased an additional 14,000 core West Virginia acres, primarily in Marion and Monongalia Counties, West Virginia for $130 million. Consistent with our objective of extending laterals, this acquisition will allow us to extend 64 well locations from an average of 1,900 feet to 5,700 feet. The latest deal is consistent with our previous comments on consolidation. One, we are focused in our core, motivated by longer laterals; and two, small deals are more likely than large acreage deals or corporate transactions.
Our focus continues to be increasing shareholder value by focusing on full-cycle returns. We will accomplish this by driving development and operating costs lower, expanding optionality in our sales portfolio to improve our realized prices and maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to weather the inevitable commodity price cycles.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Pat Kane."

So we've talked a lot about longer laterals and the economic benefits we get from that. And over the past 8 years or so with the Marcellus, you've seen the progress us and the industry has made on improving returns through innovation and new technologies, and we will continue to try and be a leader in that area.

That will take some more time to conclude how much or if there's a benefit there, but we continue to experiment and look for better ways on the completion side. I would say our innovations are solely focused on drilling and completion activities, though. And a couple of areas that we're doing a lot of work in are kind of more on the logistical side. So we're doing a lot of operations research kind of work on our rig scheduling and our frac scheduling and how we move and transport water. And what we're finding through some pretty advanced modeling is our previous assumptions about what was optimum turn out to be pretty far off. And the conclusions from these models really aren't intuitive. Very difficult for a human being to look at spreadsheet and come up with the optimum schedule. So we're just starting that kind of work. We think the applicability to our business could be pretty widespread and potentially pretty dramatic in terms of lowering our unit operating cost. So a lot of work happening in that area.

So one example we did is we brought in a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University to help us with this modeling because it's pretty advanced stuff for -- certainly for someone like me. And the first thing he did was he did a look back on a group of pads in Greene County that we had already drilled. So we had -- we knew what we had thought was optimum. And our typical assumption was, generally, if we have multi-well pads, drill all the wells with the rig. It's very expensive to move rigs. It's about $0.5 million every time we move a rig. So we thought it was best to drill all the wells, move the rig somewhere else, bring in the frac crews, bring in the water and the sand and frac all the wells back to back and then bring them all online. And if you look back and build this model, which incorporated the logistics of the water, logistics of the crews, the downtime associated with the production, the pipeline capacities and capacity availability and a number of other variables, and the rig schedule that it printed out looked like a pig's breakfast. I mean, it was moving rigs a lot more often than we thought but said that we would have created significantly more value had we followed that schedule. So that really opened our eyes, and we really thought, well, this might really add some value if this -- if we get this kind of results everywhere else. So we're starting to apply that, again, to rig and frac scheduling but also to helping us decide how to better design our pipeline systems to make that capital more efficient, and importantly, the best ways to move our water because that's becoming a bigger and bigger piece of our cost structure."

Regarding how many others are out there, it's always hard to say because they're always -- there's been for the past year or so a fairly steady flow of opportunities, and we've been involved in all or most of those. And I think we're still optimistic that, that flow is going to continue. But it's hard to predict. At any given time, there's 2 or 3 that are, I'd say, active. But sometimes, active means there's a data room and the seller is clearly motivated to sell. And other times active means we're in discussions with a party and it seems like there might be a deal to be done, but sometimes it doesn't work out. So I would say for the scale of acquisitions we've been doing, we expect the flow to continue for at least a while."

But that said, there are possible mitigants to that in terms of, again, partial notices to proceed or possibilities of being able to extend the tree cutting window. So lots of variables, but those are some key dates we're shooting for."

Before reviewing first quarter results, I want highlight our recent acreage acquisitions.

Before reviewing first quarter results, I want highlight our recent acreage acquisitions. 
During the quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions adding 67,400 core Marcellus acres, for $652 million, funded with cash on hand. We've been very active consolidating our acreage position in our Marcellus core, increasing our position by over 222,000 net acres, which represents the most Marcellus acres acquired by a single producer since 2015. 
On the pricing side, we have seen significant improvement throughout our various markets. The average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $3.50 per Mcfe, a 33% increase compared to the $2.63 realized in the first quarter last year. 
The stronger pricing environment was also reflected in our average differential for the quarter, which was negative $0.13 per [ m ]. This is a $0.54 improvement from the fourth quarter of 2016 and a $0.09 improvement from the first quarter of 2016. 
The improved pricing also highlights the value of our diversified firm capacity portfolio, which provides significant takeaway capacity to premium markets. 
During the quarter, additional contracted capacity and higher utilization of this capacity to move our gas to these markets resulted in both higher realized price and higher transportation cost for the quarter compared to our guidance. We expect continued improvement to our realized price as incremental pipeline projects come online, including the MVP pipeline, which will provide access to the premium Southeast market. 
As you'll in our updated slide deck, we expect our basis to improve from negative $0.25 in 2017 to negative $0.13 in 2019, based on forward pricing at our markets.
I'll now provide a brief overview of the first quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.43 compared to $0.05 in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $322 million as compared to $217 million in the first quarter of 2016. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. 
EQT recorded $86.7 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $82.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
Starting with production results, production sales volume of 190 Bcfe for the first quarter was 6% higher than the first quarter of 2016, which was on the low end of our guidance as we completed fewer wells than we had planned for the first quarter. 
As discussed, the realized price including cash held derivatives was $3.50 per Mcfe, a 33% increase compared to the $2.63 in the first quarter of last year. 
Operating revenues totaled $828.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, which was $345 million higher than the first quarter of 2016. 
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $571.2 million or 17% higher, quarter-over-quarter. 
Transmission expenses were $43.4 million higher due to volumes moved by Rockies Express Pipeline and at Ohio Valley Connector. We were paying for some rig capacity last year, but since we were unable to physically move our produced gas to recs in the first quarter of 2016, we used that capacity for marketing. 
When we use pipeline capacity for marketing, we net the cost of the transportation against the recoveries realized. The cost of the pipeline capacity used to move our produced gas is recognized as an operating expense. The increase in transportation expense of this quarter was slightly due to us using more of our transportation capacity to move our gas driving higher transportation cost and higher realized prices. 
Processing expenses were $16.7 million higher, consistent with higher wet gas volumes. Production taxes were $6.2 million higher as a result of better pricing. Gathering expenses and DD&A were all higher, consistent with production growth. Excluding a legal charge of $5 million, SG&A was essentially flat, while lease operating expense excluding production taxes were $1.6 million lower.
Moving on to midstream, EQT gathering income was $73.6 million, $1 million higher than the first quarter of 2016 on increased gathering revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. 
Total operating expenses were $28.7 million or $3.3 million in 2016. Looking at EQT Transmission, operating income was $71.5 million, 11% higher than the first quarter of 2016. Operating revenues were $13.3 million higher over first quarter 2016, primarily due to EQT's firm commitment on the OVC or Ohio Valley Connector, which was placed into service October 1, 2016.  Operating expenses were $29.6 million or $6.3 million higher than the same quarter of 2016. 
And then finally, our stated liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $857  million of cash in the balance sheet, which excludes EQM. 
We currently forecast about $1.3  billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200  million of distributions to EQT, EQGP. 
So we are fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion 2017 CapEx forecast excluding EQM and EQGP, with that expected operating cash flow as well as the current cash we have on hand. 
Okay, with that, I will turn the call over to Dave."

For those of you that I have not met, I am [ David Schlotzer ] and I was appointed President of EQT's Production business unit in March of this year. I've been with EQT for 10 years and have been employed in the oil and gas industry for about 29 years, with the majority of my time spent on the operations side. I most recently manage the engineering, geology and planning functions for EQT Production and I have been involved with the growth and expansion of EQT's Marcellus and Utica development program since inception. I will now make some comments about the quarter.
As Rob mentioned, our sales volume for the first quarter was at the low end of guidance at 190 Bcfe. This was primarily driven by completing 0 wells in plan, as we did not add frac crews as quickly as anticipated due to the tighter than expected market. 
We are, however, reiterating our full year guidance and have additional frac scheduled to come on at the beginning of June, at which time we expect to quickly get back on track with our 2017 turn in line schedule. 
Our business plan also anticipated sales volumes to be flat Q2 versus Q1. We are now projecting Q2 sales volume between 190 and 195 Bcfe.
Our 2017 growth will be back-end loaded as we expected, and we will exit 2017 at approximately 2.6 Bcf per day. 
As you saw on today's news release, we recently increased our EUR estimates for our core Marcellus by 14% to 2.4 Bcfe per thousand foot. This reflects enhancements to our standard frac design, which among other things, increase the sand and water per foot of pay. 
We continue to experiment with even larger frac jobs, which we expect to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the frac. At this point, however, it is too early to know if the economics will be improved, because as you may expect, the bigger jobs come higher cost as well as impact to lateral spacing.
We are confident in our technologies and methodology and we'll provide an update as our progress continues.
On the last call, Michael Hall asked about our well results in the dry Marcellus window in West Virginia. We currently have only 10 wells producing in Marion and Eastern Wetzel County, but our preliminary EUR estimate for this area is 2.4 Bcfe per 1,000-foot, which is consistent with our average EUR for our core development area. We are very encouraged by this productivity.
Finally, an update on our Utica program. As we've indicated during previous call, we continue to work in understanding the reservoir and improving costs and have decided to not share individual well results as we move along. We have completed the big 177 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia and it is online. Our 2017 plan calls for drilling 7 wells and we are currently drilling more well in Greene County, PA and should have that well online in the second quarter. 
After we achieve even more, we will move the rig to Armstrong County, Pennsylvania to drill the next unit well. With these test wells, we are getting a better understanding of the production mechanisms, recoveries and the economics of Utica, which was our overall goal of the 2017 program. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Steve."

From our large share buyback program in the early 2000s, the sale of our LDC business in 2013 to our creation of EQM and EQGP and our current consolidation efforts, EQT has always focused on creating long-term shareholder value. 
I assure you that I will continue to focus on doing what is best for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.
We are blessed to have an outstanding set of assets in one of the largest and most economic natural gas basins in the world. We are already the largest gas producer in the Marcellus and the fourth-largest in the U.S. We also have the largest midstream business in of the Appalachian basin. 
There are tremendous synergies between the 2 businesses that we have leveraged for the benefit of EQT, EQM and EQGP investors. As you probably know, I believe there are significant benefits to consolidation in our core development areas. 
Over the past decade, we've made tremendous advances in operating efficiencies by focusing on finding ways to improve how we drill and complete our wells. These improvements have dramatically lowered the per-unit cost of the gas we develop. Unfortunately, these improved techniques are easily transferred between producers and the advantages gained are short lived, as other producers adopt the same best practices. So while our development and operating costs have improved dramatically, the economic value added has not increased in concert as of the supply of gas increased pushing gas prices down. 
The next wave of efficiencies will come from consolidation of the scattered acreage position in Appalachia. This consolidation will drive longer laterals, more wells per pad, improved water and operating logistics and more efficient gathering and transmission pipelines. These advantages will be more difficult to replicate and the consolidators will hold a competitive advantage that will yield higher returns for their shareholders. 
I think, further consolidation within the Marcellus core is the best path to creating a sustained competitive advantage and increasing shareholder value.
To date, we've been very successful implementing this strategy and we are beginning to see the value creation from it. We've added over 220,000 core Marcellus acres since the beginning of 2016. Our focus is on adjacent acres to what we already own and it's facilitating an increase in average lateral length of our Marcellus wells, from 5,900 feet in 2015 to over 8,000 feet in 2017. 
As you can see in our slides, at a constant $2.50 local gas price, adding 2,000 lateral feet increases returns from 39% to 52%. 
As we continue to consolidate, I think it is realistic for us to get to a point where we are drilling 10,000-foot laterals, increasing returns at the same gas price to 62%. 
Our midstream business also benefits from our consolidation efforts. By increasing our inventory, the runway for midstream investments supporting production guess longer. This opens the door to build gathering systems and makes MVP expansion and interstate pipes further south more likely. 
As we implement initiatives to strategically expand our footprint and drive stronger returns, we remain squarely focused on innovation throughout our operations. I am proud of our culture of innovation at EQT and we are focused on leveraging that to continue to improve safety, reduce operating costs and improve returns on our investment. 
In my opinion, the commodity price cycles are here to stay get immediate to be profitable through the cycle. Our continued focus of innovation will enable us to achieve these objectives. 
I thank you for your continued support as shareholders of EQT and I'll now hand the call over to Pat Kane."

Before reviewing first quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisitions. 
During the quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions adding 67,400 core Marcellus acres for $652 million, funded with cash on hand. We've been very active consolidating our acreage position in our Marcellus core, increasing our position by over 222,000 net acres, which represents the most Marcellus acres acquired by a single producer since 2015. 
On the pricing side, we have seen significant improvement throughout our various markets. The average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $3.50 per Mcfe, a 33% increase compared to the $2.63 realized in the first quarter of last year. 
The stronger pricing environment was also reflected in our average differential for the quarter, which was negative $0.13 per m. This is a $0.54 improvement from the fourth quarter of 2016 and a $0.09 improvement from the first quarter of 2016. 
The improved pricing also highlights the value of our diversified firm capacity portfolio, which provides significant takeaway capacity to premium markets. 
During the quarter, additional contracted capacity and higher utilization of this capacity to move our gas to these markets resulted in both higher realized price and higher transportation cost for the quarter compared to our guidance. We expect continued improvement to our realized price as incremental pipeline projects come online, including the MVP pipeline, which will provide access to the premium Southeast market. 
As you'll see in our updated slide deck, we expect our basis to improve from negative $0.25 in 2017 to negative $0.13 in 2019, based on forward pricing at our markets.
I'll now provide a brief overview of the first quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.43 compared to $0.05 in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $322 million as compared to $217 million in the first quarter of 2016. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings' results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. 
EQT recorded $86.7 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $82.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
Starting with production results. Production sales volume of 190 Bcfe for the first quarter was 6% higher than the first quarter of 2016, which was on the low end of our guidance as we completed fewer wells than we had planned for the first quarter. 
As discussed, the realized price, including cash held derivatives, was $3.50 per Mcfe, a 33% increase compared to the $2.63 in the first quarter of last year. 
Operating revenues totaled $828.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, which was $345 million higher than the first quarter of 2016.
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $571.2 million or 17% higher quarter-over-quarter. 
Transmission expenses were $43.4 million higher due to volumes moved by Rockies Express Pipeline and Ohio Valley Connector. We were paying for some REX capacity last year, but since we were unable to physically move our produced gas to REX in the first quarter of 2016, we used that capacity for marketing. 
When we use pipeline capacity for marketing, we net the cost of the transportation against the recoveries realized. The cost of the pipeline capacity used to move our produced gas is recognized as an operating expense. The increase in transportation expense this quarter was largely due to us using more of our own transportation capacity to move our gas, driving higher transportation cost and higher realized prices. 
Processing expenses were $16.7 million higher, consistent with higher wet gas volumes. Production taxes were $6.2 million higher as a result of better pricing. Gathering expenses and DD&A were all higher, consistent with production growth. Excluding a legal charge of $5 million, SG&A was essentially flat, while lease operating expense, excluding production taxes, were $1.6 million lower.
Moving on to midstream, EQT gathering income was $73.6 million, $1 million higher than the first quarter of 2016 on increased gathering revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. 
Total operating expenses were $28.7 million or $3.3 million in 2016. Looking at EQT Transmission, operating income was $71.5 million, 11% higher than the first quarter of 2016. Operating revenues were $13.3 million higher over first quarter 2016, primarily due to EQT's firm commitment on the OVC, or Ohio Valley Connector, which was placed into service on October 1, 2016.  Operating expenses were $29.6 million or $6.3 million higher than the same quarter of 2016. 
And then finally, our stated liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $857  million of cash in the balance sheet, which excludes EQM. 
We currently forecast about $1.3 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. 
So we are fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion 2017 CapEx forecast, excluding EQM and EQGP, with that expected operating cash flow as well as the current cash we have on hand. 
Okay, with that, I will turn the call over to Dave."

For those of you that I have not met, I am David Schlosser, and I was appointed President of EQT's Production business unit in March of this year. I've been with EQT for 10 years and has been employed in the oil and gas industry for about 29 years, with the majority of my time spent on the operations side. I most recently manage the engineering, geology and planning functions for EQT Production, and I have been involved with the growth and expansion of EQT's Marcellus and Utica development program since inception. I will now make some comments about the quarter.
As Rob mentioned, our sales volume for the first quarter was at the low end of guidance at 190 Bcfe. This was primarily driven by completing 0 wells in plan, as we did not add frac crews as quickly as anticipated due to the tighter-than-expected market. 
We are, however, reiterating our full year guidance and have additional frac crews scheduled to come on at the beginning of June, at which time we expect to quickly get back on track with our 2017 turn-in-line schedule. 
Our business plan also anticipated sales volumes to be flat Q2 versus Q1. We are now projecting Q2 sales volume between 190 and 195 Bcfe.
Our 2017 growth will be back-end loaded as we expected, and we will exit 2017 at approximately 2.6 Bcf per day. 
As you saw on today's news release, we recently increased our EUR estimates for our core Marcellus by 14% to 2.4 Bcfe per thousand foot. This reflects enhancements to our standard frac design, which among other things, increase the sand and water per foot of pay. 
We continue to experiment with even larger frac jobs, which we expect to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the fracs. At this point, however, it is too early to know if the economics will be improved, because as you may expect, with bigger jobs come higher cost as well as impact to lateral spacing.
We are confident in our technologies and methodology, and we'll provide update as our progress continues.
On the last call, Michael Hall asked about our well results in the dry Marcellus window in West Virginia. We currently have only 10 wells producing in Marion and eastern Wetzel County, but our preliminary EUR estimate for this area is 2.4 Bcfe per 1,000 foot, which is consistent with our average EUR for our core development area. We are very encouraged by this productivity.
Finally, an update on our Utica program. As we've indicated during previous calls, we continue to work in understanding the reservoir and improving costs and have decided to not share individual well results as we move along. We have completed the Big 177 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia and it is online. Our 2017 plan calls for drilling 7 wells, and we are currently drilling the Moore well in Greene County, PA and should have that well online in the second quarter. 
After we TD the Moore, we will move the rig to Armstrong County, Pennsylvania to drill the next Utica well. With these test wells, we are getting a better understanding of the production mechanisms, recoveries and the economics of Utica, which was our overall goal of the 2017 program. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Steve."

With this being my first call as CEO, I want to take a few minutes to comment on my strategy for EQT. 
I've been on the management team for many years and have been an active participant in shaping and implementing our strategy, so in many ways, it is a continuation of the strategy that EQT has been successfully executing. The one thing I'm most proud of as a member of the management team is EQT's history of focusing on creating shareholder value. From our large share buyback program in the early 2000s, the sale of our LDC business in 2013 to our creation of EQM and EQGP and our current consolidation efforts, EQT has always focused on creating long-term shareholder value. 
I assure you that I will continue to focus on doing what is best for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.
We are blessed to have an outstanding set of assets in one of the largest and most economic natural gas basins in the world. We are already the largest gas producer in the Marcellus and the fourth largest in the U.S. We also have the largest midstream business in of the Appalachian Basin. 
There are tremendous synergies between the 2 businesses that we have leveraged for the benefit of EQT, EQM and EQGP investors. As you probably know, I believe there are significant benefits to consolidation in our core development areas. 
Over the past decade, we've made tremendous advances in operating efficiencies by focusing on finding ways to improve how we drill and complete our wells. These improvements have dramatically lowered the per-unit cost of the gas we develop. Unfortunately, these improved techniques are easily transferred between producers and the advantages gained are short lived, as other producers adopt the same best practices. So while our development and operating costs have improved dramatically, the economic value added has not increased in concert as the supply of gas increased, pushing gas prices down. 
The next wave of efficiencies will come from consolidation of the scattered acreage positions in Appalachia. This consolidation will drive longer laterals, more wells per pad, improved water and operating logistics and more efficient gathering and transmission pipelines. These advantages will be more difficult to replicate and the consolidators will hold a competitive advantage that will yield higher returns for their shareholders. 
I think further consolidation within the Marcellus core is the best path to creating a sustained competitive advantage, increasing shareholder value.
To date, we've been very successful implementing this strategy and we are beginning to see the value creation from it. We've added over 220,000 core Marcellus acres since the beginning of 2016. Our focus is on adjacent acres to what we already own and has facilitated an increase in average lateral length of our Marcellus wells from 5,900 feet in 2015 to over 8,000 feet in 2017. 
As you can see in our slides, at a constant $2.50 local gas price, adding 2,000 lateral feet increases returns from 39% to 52%. 
As we continue to consolidate, I think it is realistic for us to get to a point where we are drilling 10,000-foot laterals, increasing returns at the same gas price to 62%. 
Our midstream business also benefits from our consolidation efforts. By increasing our inventory, the runway for midstream investments supporting production gets longer. This opens the door to build gathering systems and makes MVP expansion and interstate pipes further south more likely. 
As we implement initiatives to strategically expand our footprint and drive stronger returns, we remain squarely focused on innovation throughout our operations. I am proud of our culture of innovation at EQT, and we are focused on leveraging that to continue to improve safety, reduce operating costs and improve returns on our investment. 
In my opinion, the commodity price cycles are here to stay get immediate to be profitable through the cycle. Our continued focus of innovation will enable us to achieve these objectives. 
I thank you for your continued support as shareholders of EQT, and I'll now hand the call over to Pat Kane."

So it's a bit tough to answer that, and I'll just mention that may be again a little off track here, but one other factor that's ongoing that can affect how we allocate capital between our development areas is around something called joint development and cotenancy in West Virginia.

A lot of equipment, a lot of crews were shot down during the downturn and this rebound is happening fairly quickly and as you know, really quickly in the Permian. A lot of that equipment and crews are between basins. So we're seeing a lot of that, but I think, over time, and I think fairly quickly, the service companies will recommission a lot of equipment and rehire a lot of the hands that were let go. So I think there's a time period here where the demand is outstripping the supply, but that will equalize going forward. So I think, I don't see any real long-term concerns around that and certainly, not related to our consolidation efforts. I think, consolidation only improves the efficiency of all of that activity, means we can get more done with less crews as we consolidate."

Before reviewing first quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisitions.

Before reviewing first quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisitions. 
During the quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions adding 67,400 core Marcellus acres for $652 million, funded with cash on hand. We've been very active consolidating our acreage position in our Marcellus core, increasing our position by over 222,000 net acres, which represents the most Marcellus acres acquired by a single producer since 2015. 
On the pricing side, we have seen significant improvement throughout our various markets. The average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $3.50 per Mcfe, a 33% increase compared to the $2.63 realized in the first quarter of last year. 
The stronger pricing environment was also reflected in our average differential for the quarter, which was negative $0.13 per m. This is a $0.54 improvement from the fourth quarter of 2016 and a $0.09 improvement from the first quarter of 2016. 
The improved pricing also highlights the value of our diversified firm capacity portfolio, which provides significant takeaway capacity to premium markets. 
During the quarter, additional contracted capacity and higher utilization of this capacity to move our gas to these markets resulted in both higher realized price and higher transportation cost for the quarter compared to our guidance. We expect continued improvement to our realized price as incremental pipeline projects come online, including the MVP pipeline, which will provide access to the premium Southeast market. 
As you'll see in our updated slide deck, we expect our basis to improve from negative $0.25 in 2017 to negative $0.13 in 2019, based on forward pricing at our markets.
I'll now provide a brief overview of the first quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.43 compared to $0.05 in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $322 million as compared to $217 million in the first quarter of 2016. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings' results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. 
EQT recorded $86.7 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $82.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
Starting with production results. Production sales volume of 190 Bcfe for the first quarter was 6% higher than the first quarter of 2016, which was on the low end of our guidance as we completed fewer wells than we had planned for the first quarter. 
As discussed, the realized price, including cash held derivatives, was $3.50 per Mcfe, a 33% increase compared to the $2.63 in the first quarter of last year. 
Operating revenues totaled $828.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, which was $345 million higher than the first quarter of 2016.
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $571.2 million or 17% higher quarter-over-quarter. 
Transmission expenses were $43.4 million higher due to volumes moved by Rockies Express Pipeline and Ohio Valley Connector. We were paying for some REX capacity last year, but since we were unable to physically move our produced gas to REX in the first quarter of 2016, we used that capacity for marketing. 
When we use pipeline capacity for marketing, we net the cost of the transportation against the recoveries realized. The cost of the pipeline capacity used to move our produced gas is recognized as an operating expense. The increase in transportation expense this quarter was largely due to us using more of our own transportation capacity to move our gas, driving higher transportation cost and higher realized prices. 
Processing expenses were $16.7 million higher, consistent with higher wet gas volumes. Production taxes were $6.2 million higher as a result of better pricing. Gathering expenses and DD&A were all higher, consistent with production growth. Excluding a legal charge of $5 million, SG&A was essentially flat, while lease operating expense, excluding production taxes, were $1.6 million lower.
Moving on to midstream, EQT gathering income was $73.6 million, $1 million higher than the first quarter of 2016 on increased gathering revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. 
Total operating expenses were $28.7 million or $3.3 million in 2016. Looking at EQT Transmission, operating income was $71.5 million, 11% higher than the first quarter of 2016. Operating revenues were $13.3 million higher over first quarter 2016, primarily due to EQT's firm commitment on the OVC, or Ohio Valley Connector, which was placed into service on October 1, 2016.  Operating expenses were $29.6 million or $6.3 million higher than the same quarter of 2016. 
And then finally, our stated liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $857  million of cash in the balance sheet, which excludes EQM. 
We currently forecast about $1.3 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. 
So we are fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion 2017 CapEx forecast, excluding EQM and EQGP, with that expected operating cash flow as well as the current cash we have on hand. 
Okay, with that, I will turn the call over to Dave."

For those of you that I have not met, I am David Schlosser, and I was appointed President of EQT's Production business unit in March of this year. I've been with EQT for 10 years and have been employed in the oil and gas industry for about 29 years, with the majority of my time spent on the operations side. I most recently managed the engineering, geology and planning functions for EQT Production, and I have been involved with the growth and expansion of EQT's Marcellus and Utica development program since inception. I will now make some comments about the quarter.
As Rob mentioned, our sales volume for the first quarter was at the low end of guidance at 190 Bcfe. This was primarily driven by completing 0 wells in plan, as we did not add frac crews as quickly as anticipated due to the tighter-than-expected market. 
We are, however, reiterating our full year guidance and have additional frac crews scheduled to come on at the beginning of June, at which time we expect to quickly get back on track with our 2017 turn-in-line schedule. 
Our business plan also anticipated sales volumes to be flat Q2 versus Q1. We are now projecting Q2 sales volume between 190 and 195 Bcfe.
Our 2017 growth will be back-end loaded as we expected, and we will exit 2017 at approximately 2.6 Bcf per day. 
As you saw on today's news release, we recently increased our EUR estimates for our core Marcellus by 14% to 2.4 Bcfe per thousand foot. This reflects enhancements to our standard frac design, which among other things, increase the sand and water per foot of pay. 
We continue to experiment with even larger frac jobs, which we expect to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the fracs. At this point, however, it is too early to know if the economics will be improved, because as you may expect, with bigger jobs come higher costs as well as impact to lateral spacing.
We are confident in our technologies and methodology, and we'll provide update as our progress continues.
On the last call, Michael Hall asked about our well results in the dry Marcellus window in West Virginia. We currently have only 10 wells producing in Marion and eastern Wetzel County, but our preliminary EUR estimate for this area is 2.4 Bcfe per 1,000 foot, which is consistent with our average EUR for our core development area. We are very encouraged by this productivity.
Finally, an update on our Utica program. As we've indicated during previous calls, we continue to work in understanding the reservoir and improving costs and have decided to not share individual well results as we move along. We have completed the Big 177 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia and it is online. Our 2017 plan calls for drilling 7 wells, and we are currently drilling the Moore well in Greene County, PA and should have that well online in the second quarter. 
After we TD the Moore, we will move the rig to Armstrong County, Pennsylvania to drill the next Utica well. With these test wells, we are getting a better understanding of the production mechanisms, recoveries and the economics of Utica, which was our overall goal of the 2017 program. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Steve."

With this being my first call as CEO, I want to take a few minutes to comment on my strategy for EQT. 
I've been on the management team for many years and have been an active participant in shaping and implementing our strategy, so in many ways, it is a continuation of the strategy that EQT has been successfully executing. The one thing I'm most proud of as a member of the management team is EQT's history of focusing on creating shareholder value. From our large share buyback program in the early 2000s, the sale of our LDC business in 2013 to our creation of EQM and EQGP and our current consolidation efforts, EQT has always focused on creating long-term shareholder value. 
I assure you that I will continue to focus on doing what is best for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.
We are blessed to have an outstanding set of assets in one of the largest and most economic natural gas basins in the world. We are already the largest gas producer in the Marcellus and the fourth largest in the U.S. We also have the largest midstream business in of the Appalachian Basin. 
There are tremendous synergies between the 2 businesses that we have leveraged for the benefit of EQT, EQM and EQGP investors. As you probably know, I believe there are significant benefits to consolidation in our core development areas. 
Over the past decade, we've made tremendous advances in operating efficiencies by focusing on finding ways to improve how we drill and complete our wells. These improvements have dramatically lowered the per-unit cost of the gas we develop. Unfortunately, these improved techniques are easily transferred between producers and the advantages gained are short lived, as other producers adopt the same best practices. So while our development and operating costs have improved dramatically, the economic value added has not increased in concert as the supply of gas increased, pushing gas prices down. 
The next wave of efficiencies will come from consolidation of the scattered acreage positions in Appalachia. This consolidation will drive longer laterals, more wells per pad, improved water and operating logistics and more efficient gathering and transmission pipelines. These advantages will be more difficult to replicate and the consolidators will hold a competitive advantage that will yield higher returns for their shareholders. 
I think further consolidation within the Marcellus core is the best path to creating a sustained competitive advantage, increasing shareholder value.
To date, we've been very successful implementing this strategy and we are beginning to see the value creation from it. We've added over 220,000 core Marcellus acres since the beginning of 2016. Our focus is on adjacent acres to what we already own and has facilitated an increase in average lateral length of our Marcellus wells from 5,900 feet in 2015 to over 8,000 feet in 2017. 
As you can see in our slides, at a constant $2.50 local gas price, adding 2,000 lateral feet increases returns from 39% to 52%. 
As we continue to consolidate, I think it is realistic for us to get to a point where we are drilling 10,000-foot laterals, increasing returns at the same gas price to 62%. 
Our midstream business also benefits from our consolidation efforts. By increasing our inventory, the runway for midstream investments supporting production gets longer. This opens the door to build gathering systems and makes MVP expansion and interstate pipes further south more likely. 
As we implement initiatives to strategically expand our footprint and drive stronger returns, we remain squarely focused on innovation throughout our operations. I am proud of our culture of innovation at EQT, and we are focused on leveraging that to continue to improve safety, reduce operating costs and improve returns on our investment. 
In my opinion, the commodity price cycles are here to stay and we need to be profitable through the cycle. Our continued focus of innovation will enable us to achieve these objectives. 
I thank you for your continued support as shareholders of EQT, and I'll now hand the call over to Pat Kane."

Outside of that box, it doesn't make sense to codevelop, even though in some of the areas, there is good the Upper Devonian potential. it's just okay to wait, to drill those wells until much later. Regarding the current balance, it's hard question to answer, Neal, because of the consolidation we've done. We are currently kind of incorporating the new acreage and redoing our development plans to focus on making the best investments we can. So that's shifting around our focus a little bit from a certain areas into other areas and we haven't really finished that. So it's a bit tough to answer that, and I'll just mention that may be I'm getting a little off track here, but one other factor that's ongoing that can affect how we allocate capital between our development areas is around something called joint development and cotenancy in West Virginia. We've talked about it a few times over the years, its legislative fixes to the old antiquated oil and gas wells in West Virginia that we and the industry have been trying to get updated for quite a while now. It remains in flux. We're hopeful there'll be a special session this summer, where it gets brought up again. And the outcome of that could potentially have impacts on how we allocate our capital across that development area.

Before reviewing first quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisitions. 
During the quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions adding 67,400 core Marcellus acres for $652 million, funded with cash on hand. We've been very active consolidating our acreage position in our Marcellus core, increasing our position by over 222,000 net acres, which represents the most Marcellus acres acquired by a single producer since 2015. 
On the pricing side, we have seen significant improvement throughout our various markets. The average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $3.50 per Mcfe, a 33% increase compared to the $2.63 realized in the first quarter of last year. 
The stronger pricing environment was also reflected in our average differential for the quarter, which was negative $0.13 per m. This is a $0.54 improvement from the fourth quarter of 2016 and a $0.09 improvement from the first quarter of 2016. 
The improved pricing also highlights the value of our diversified firm capacity portfolio, which provides significant takeaway capacity to premium markets. 
During the quarter, additional contracted capacity and higher utilization of this capacity to move our gas to these markets resulted in both higher realized price and higher transportation cost for the quarter compared to our guidance. We expect continued improvement to our realized price as incremental pipeline projects come online, including the MVP pipeline, which will provide access to the premium Southeast market. 
As you'll see in our updated slide deck, we expect our basis to improve from negative $0.25 in 2017 to negative $0.13 in 2019, based on forward pricing at our markets.
I'll now provide a brief overview of the first quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.43 compared to $0.05 in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $322 million as compared to $217 million in the first quarter of 2016. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings' results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. 
EQT recorded $86.7 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $82.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
Starting with production results. Production sales volume of 190 Bcfe for the first quarter was 6% higher than the first quarter of 2016, which was on the low end of our guidance as we completed fewer wells than we had planned for the first quarter. 
As discussed, the realized price, including cash held derivatives, was $3.50 per Mcfe, a 33% increase compared to the $2.63 in the first quarter of last year. 
Operating revenues totaled $828.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, which was $345 million higher than the first quarter of 2016.
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $571.2 million or 17% higher quarter-over-quarter. 
Transmission expenses were $43.4 million higher due to volumes moved by Rockies Express Pipeline and Ohio Valley Connector. We were paying for some REX capacity last year, but since we were unable to physically move our produced gas to REX in the first quarter of 2016, we used that capacity for marketing. 
When we use pipeline capacity for marketing, we net the cost of the transportation against the recoveries realized. The cost of the pipeline capacity used to move our produced gas is recognized as an operating expense. The increase in transportation expense this quarter was largely due to us using more of our own transportation capacity to move our gas, driving higher transportation cost and higher realized prices. 
Processing expenses were $16.7 million higher, consistent with higher wet gas volumes. Production taxes were $6.2 million higher as a result of better pricing. Gathering expenses and DD&A were all higher, consistent with production growth. Excluding a legal charge of $5 million, SG&A was essentially flat, while lease operating expense, excluding production taxes, were $1.6 million lower.
Moving on to midstream, EQT gathering income was $73.6 million, $1 million higher than the first quarter of 2016 on increased gathering revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. 
Total operating expenses were $28.7 million or $3.3 million in 2016. Looking at EQT Transmission, operating income was $71.5 million, 11% higher than the first quarter of 2016. Operating revenues were $13.3 million higher over first quarter 2016, primarily due to EQT's firm commitment on the OVC, or Ohio Valley Connector, which was placed into service on October 1, 2016.  Operating expenses were $29.6 million or $6.3 million higher than the same quarter of 2016. 
And then finally, our stated liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $857  million of cash in the balance sheet, which excludes EQM. 
We currently forecast about $1.3 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. 
So we are fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion 2017 CapEx forecast, excluding EQM and EQGP, with that expected operating cash flow as well as the current cash we have on hand. 
Okay, with that, I will turn the call over to Dave."

For those of you that I have not met, I am David Schlosser, and I was appointed President of EQT's Production business unit in March of this year. I've been with EQT for 10 years and have been employed in the oil and gas industry for about 29 years, with the majority of my time spent on the operations side. I most recently managed the engineering, geology and planning functions for EQT Production, and I have been involved with the growth and expansion of EQT's Marcellus and Utica development program since inception. I will now make some comments about the quarter.
As Rob mentioned, our sales volume for the first quarter was at the low end of guidance at 190 Bcfe. This was primarily driven by completing 0 wells in plan, as we did not add frac crews as quickly as anticipated due to the tighter-than-expected market. 
We are, however, reiterating our full year guidance and have additional frac crews scheduled to come on at the beginning of June, at which time we expect to quickly get back on track with our 2017 turn-in-line schedule. 
Our business plan also anticipated sales volumes to be flat Q2 versus Q1. We are now projecting Q2 sales volume between 190 and 195 Bcfe.
Our 2017 growth will be back-end loaded as we expected, and we will exit 2017 at approximately 2.6 Bcf per day. 
As you saw on today's news release, we recently increased our EUR estimates for our core Marcellus by 14% to 2.4 Bcfe per thousand foot. This reflects enhancements to our standard frac design, which among other things, increase the sand and water per foot of pay. 
We continue to experiment with even larger frac jobs, which we expect to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the fracs. At this point, however, it is too early to know if the economics will be improved, because as you may expect, with bigger jobs come higher costs as well as impact to lateral spacing.
We are confident in our technologies and methodology, and we'll provide update as our progress continues.
On the last call, Michael Hall asked about our well results in the dry Marcellus window in West Virginia. We currently have only 10 wells producing in Marion and eastern Wetzel County, but our preliminary EUR estimate for this area is 2.4 Bcfe per 1,000 foot, which is consistent with our average EUR for our core development area. We are very encouraged by this productivity.
Finally, an update on our Utica program. As we've indicated during previous calls, we continue to work in understanding the reservoir and improving costs and have decided to not share individual well results as we move along. We have completed the Big 177 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia and it is online. Our 2017 plan calls for drilling 7 wells, and we are currently drilling the Moore well in Greene County, PA and should have that well online in the second quarter. 
After we TD the Moore, we will move the rig to Armstrong County, Pennsylvania to drill the next Utica well. With these test wells, we are getting a better understanding of the production mechanisms, recoveries and the economics of Utica, which was our overall goal of the 2017 program. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Steve."

With this being my first call as CEO, I want to take a few minutes to comment on my strategy for EQT. 
I've been on the management team for many years and have been an active participant in shaping and implementing our strategy, so in many ways, it is a continuation of the strategy that EQT has been successfully executing. The one thing I'm most proud of as a member of the management team is EQT's history of focusing on creating shareholder value. From our large share buyback program in the early 2000s, the sale of our LDC business in 2013 to our creation of EQM and EQGP and our current consolidation efforts, EQT has always focused on creating long-term shareholder value. 
I assure you that I will continue to focus on doing what is best for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.
We are blessed to have an outstanding set of assets in one of the largest and most economic natural gas basins in the world. We are already the largest gas producer in the Marcellus and the fourth largest in the U.S. We also have the largest midstream business in of the Appalachian Basin. 
There are tremendous synergies between the 2 businesses that we have leveraged for the benefit of EQT, EQM and EQGP investors. As you probably know, I believe there are significant benefits to consolidation in our core development areas. 
Over the past decade, we've made tremendous advances in operating efficiencies by focusing on finding ways to improve how we drill and complete our wells. These improvements have dramatically lowered the per-unit cost of the gas we develop. Unfortunately, these improved techniques are easily transferred between producers and the advantages gained are short lived, as other producers adopt the same best practices. So while our development and operating costs have improved dramatically, the economic value added has not increased in concert as the supply of gas increased, pushing gas prices down. 
The next wave of efficiencies will come from consolidation of the scattered acreage positions in Appalachia. This consolidation will drive longer laterals, more wells per pad, improved water and operating logistics and more efficient gathering and transmission pipelines. These advantages will be more difficult to replicate and the consolidators will hold a competitive advantage that will yield higher returns for their shareholders. 
I think further consolidation within the Marcellus core is the best path to creating a sustained competitive advantage, increasing shareholder value.
To date, we've been very successful implementing this strategy and we are beginning to see the value creation from it. We've added over 220,000 core Marcellus acres since the beginning of 2016. Our focus is on adjacent acres to what we already own and has facilitated an increase in average lateral length of our Marcellus wells from 5,900 feet in 2015 to over 8,000 feet in 2017. 
As you can see in our slides, at a constant $2.50 local gas price, adding 2,000 lateral feet increases returns from 39% to 52%. 
As we continue to consolidate, I think it is realistic for us to get to a point where we are drilling 10,000-foot laterals, increasing returns at the same gas price to 62%. 
Our midstream business also benefits from our consolidation efforts. By increasing our inventory, the runway for midstream investments supporting production gets longer. This opens the door to build gathering systems and makes MVP expansion and interstate pipes further south more likely. 
As we implement initiatives to strategically expand our footprint and drive stronger returns, we remain squarely focused on innovation throughout our operations. I am proud of our culture of innovation at EQT, and we are focused on leveraging that to continue to improve safety, reduce operating costs and improve returns on our investment. 
In my opinion, the commodity price cycles are here to stay and we need to be profitable through the cycle. Our continued focus of innovation will enable us to achieve these objectives. 
I thank you for your continued support as shareholders of EQT, and I'll now hand the call over to Pat Kane."

Outside of that box, it doesn't make sense to codevelop, even though in some of the areas, there is good the Upper Devonian potential. it's just okay to wait, to drill those wells until much later. Regarding the current balance, it's hard question to answer, Neal, because of the consolidation we've done. We are currently kind of incorporating the new acreage and redoing our development plans to focus on making the best investments we can. So that's shifting around our focus a little bit from a certain areas into other areas and we haven't really finished that. So it's a bit tough to answer that, and I'll just mention that maybe I'm getting a little off track here, but one other factor that's ongoing that can affect how we allocate capital between our development areas is around something called joint development and cotenancy in West Virginia. We've talked about it a few times over the years, its legislative fixes to the old antiquated oil and gas wells in West Virginia that we and the industry have been trying to get updated for quite a while now. It remains in flux. We're hopeful there'll be a special session this summer, where it gets brought up again. And the outcome of that could potentially have impacts on how we allocate our capital across that development area. So that's a long-winded answer to tell you that it's in flux and I can't give you a good number right now."

First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued our second quarter earnings release and posted a slide presentation. Both are available on our website at www.eqt.com and included, among other things, comments about EQT's pending acquisition of Rice Energy. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation or an offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval. In connection with the proposed transaction, EQT expects to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 and joint proxy statement later today. These and other documents filed by EQT and Rice with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at EQT's website, www.eqt.com, or Rice's website, www.riceenergy.com, as applicable, or at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. 
You should review such materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information regarding the proposed transaction. To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP; are consolidated in EQT's result. 
Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is (201) 689-7817. 
In a moment, Rob and Dave will summarize EQT's second quarter results, and Steve will give a brief update on the Rice acquisition. Following the prepared remarks, Steve, Rob, Dave and Lisa will be available to answer your questions. 
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and on the risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website. 
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Robert McNally."

As Pat mentioned, the proxy statement will be filed later today and will be available on our website, Rice's website or the SEC website. Steve is going to have further comments on the transaction in a few minutes. 
I'll provide an overview of the second quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.06 compared to a $0.38 loss in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $223 million as compared to $105 million for the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $118 million. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. 
Moving to production. Production sales volume of 198 Bcfe for the second quarter was 7% higher than the second quarter of 2016 and was slightly ahead of the high end of our guidance range. The realized price, including cash-settled derivatives, was $2.86 per Mcfe, a 36% increase compared to $2.11 per Mcfe in the second quarter last year. Operating revenue for the production company totaled $631 million for the second quarter of 2017, which is was $554 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. 
Total operating expenses at EQT production were $578 million or 10% higher quarter-over-quarter, consistent with volume growth. Transmission expenses were almost $38 million higher due to volumes transported on the Rockies Express pipeline and the Ohio Valley Connector. As mentioned on our first quarter call, we are paying for some REX capacity last year. But since we are unable to physically move or produce gas to REX in the second quarter of 2016, we use that capacity for marketing. When we used pipeline capacity for marketing, we net the cost of the transportation against the recoveries realized. The cost of pipeline capacity used to move our produced gas is recognized as an operating expense. 
Processing expenses were $17.7 million higher, consistent with higher wet gas volumes, primarily related to our recent acreage acquisitions. Gathering expenses and DD&A were all higher, consistent with production growth. Production taxes were $1.8 million higher as a result of higher impact fees due to increased drilling activity in Pennsylvania and better pricing. Lease operating expenses, excluding production taxes, were $3.3 million lower. Excluding the impact of prior year pension settlement and legal expenses, SG&A was slightly favorable for the quarter as we reduced our Kentucky cost structure when we integrated the Kentucky gathering operations into production in 2016. 
During the quarter, our liquid story was strong, reflected by an increase in volumes and higher pricing environment. NGLs sales volume and realized price were significantly higher. 
Regarding pricing, the average realized price, including cash-settled derivatives, was $2.86 per Mcfe, a 36% increase compared to the $2.11 per Mcfe in the second quarter of last year. The average differential for the quarter, which was a negative $0.64 per Mcfe was within the stated guidance range for the quarter. This is a $0.51 decrease from the first quarter of 2017 but a $0.15 improvement from the second quarter of 2016. Approximately 80% of our local basis of exposure for the balance of 2017 is locked in and is reflected in our differential guidance. The minimal effects of declining local pricing highlight the value of our diversified firm capacity portfolio, which provides significant takeaway capacity to premium markets. We continue to expect improvement in our realized price as incremental pipeline projects come online, including the Mountain Valley Pipeline project, which will provide an access to the premium Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets. 
Now moving to Midstream results. EQT gathering operating income was $83.3 million, $10.1 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. Operating revenue was $112.1 million, a $12 million increase over the second quarter of 2016, driven by production development in the Marcellus shale. This was slightly offset by increased operating expenses, which totaled $28.8 million for the quarter, a $1.9 million increase over the same period last year. 
Looking at EQT transmission. Second quarter operating income was $57.8 million, $1.9 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. Firm reservation fee revenue was $79.5 million, $19.2 million higher than the second quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of EQT contracting for additional firm capacity on the OVC. 
Operating revenues were $86.8 million, an $8.9 million increase over the second quarter of 2016. While operating expenses were $29 million, a $7 million increase over the second quarter of 2016, with approximately $5 million of the $7 million increase being DD&A. 
I will close my remarks by providing you with our liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $561 million of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes EQM. We are forecasting $1.2 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. We are fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion 2017 CapEx forecast, which excludes EQM and land acquisitions with the expected operating cash flow and the current cash that we have on hand. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to David."

As Rob mentioned, our sales volume for the second quarter was 198 Bcfe, which exceeded the high end of guidance by 3 Bcfe. Operationally, we now have 7 frackers secured and expect to operate at this pace for the remainder of the year. With these in place, we anticipate approximately 55 Marcellus and Upper Devonian wells to be turned online in the third quarter and 58 in the fourth quarter. This is approximately 3x the pace of the first 6 months of this year, during which we had 19 wells turned in line the first quarter and 17 wells in the second quarter. As you would expect, the production impact of this increased completion activity will be weighted to the fourth quarter and is reflected in our current guidance. Additionally, with the success of our ongoing consolidation efforts, we now expect our 2017 drilling program to have an average lateral length of 8,400 feet, which is 11% higher than our 2016 average. 
Now let's move on to our Deep Utica test program. As we mentioned in previous calls, our capital allocated to projects that we expect will deliver the best returns. And as we continue to lengthen laterals and improve efficiency in the Marcellus, the hurdle rate for other investments continues to increase. As an example, given our contiguous acreage position of the pending Rice transaction, we expect Marcellus wells in Greene and Washington counties to average at least 12,000 feet. Based on recent Utica results and current development costs, we estimate a Utica well would need to achieve at least 4 Bcf per 1,000 feet to be competitive with a 12,000-foot Marcellus well. And so far, we believe there are only 2 deep Utica wells that meet or exceed that threshold. In short, we are multiple years of long lateral inventory in the Marcellus. And when comparing the 2 plays, it is difficult for the Utica to compete. For these reasons, we have made the decision to suspend our Utica test program and focus our efforts on Marcellus development as we integrate the assets we've acquired over the past 1.5 years. This year's Utica programs was planned to contribute 18 Bcfe to our annual volume.

As you're aware, the big news of the quarter was the June 19 announcement that we entered into an agreement to acquire Rice Energy. Rice is an outstanding strategic and operational fit for us, and we anticipate th",712,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everybody. As you're aware, the big news of the quarter was the June 19 announcement that we entered into an agreement to acquire Rice Energy. Rice is an outstanding strategic and operational fit for us, and we anticipate the combined entities will capture significant operating efficiencies, improve overall well economics and deliver stronger returns to our shareholders. We also believe this transaction will enhance our options to address EQT some of the parts discount, which we have previously discussed. We've spoken with many of our shareholders and other industry experts since the announcement, and we're pleased with the positive and enthusiastic feedback received. In discussing this compelling transaction, we received questions in our ability to address the some of the parts discount and around our synergies estimates for the merger. I will address both of these topics today. 
First, on addressing on sum of the parts. The Rice acquisition does not impact the timing of addressing our sum of the parts discount. In fact, we believe these transactions will enhance our options to address the sum of the parts discount, which we have previously discussed. Addressing the sum of the parts discount is a priority for the board, and we will develop a plan by the end of the 2018 that we believe is in the best interest of EQT and all shareholders. These options could include splitting companies, selling one of the businesses, collapsing EQM and EQGP to support a buyback program, as well as several other scenarios. Our analysis will be a comprehensive one, which not only validates all feasible alternatives for addressing the discount, we'll also include a full analysis of the potential tax implications of the current tax reform effort in Washington. As you can appreciate, this is a longer-term development, and we do not have additional details to share. 
The second most common question has been around synergies. We are confident that the PV of the synergies are in excess of the $2.5 billion laid out in the deal announcement. As you will see in our updated slide deck, which was posted to our website and filed with SEC this morning, the $2.5 billion only covers categories of synergies, $1.9 billion of which are efficiencies driven by longer laterals, high-grading the drilling program to drill longer laterals first and lower surface costs, including fewer roads, pads, water pits and well lines. Those savings are in our control, and we are forecasting $200 million in 2018 and $350 million per year for the following 9 years. The other $600 million is from a reduction of a $100 million of G&A per year discounted for 10 years. Given the overlap of the businesses and after careful evaluation, we believe the $2.5 billion is a conservative estimate and are confident in our ability to achieve these targets. 
In addition to the quantified synergies, there are significant synergies that are harder to quantify. We listed them in our presentation this morning, along with ranges of potential value. If you took the high end of the ranges of each category, the additional synergies are well in excess of the $2.5 billion that we've already quantified. A few examples are: increasing well recoveries by combining EQT and Rice's best drilling and completion techniques is worth $500 million for every 1% increase in EUR per foot. Increased leverage in acquiring drilling and fracking services is worth $300 million for every 1% improvement in service cost. And G&A savings beyond the 10 years is worth approximately $500 million. There are several other additional synergies discussed in our updated IR deck, and I would encourage you to review our new deck for the full slate of additional synergies. I think you will also conclude that our original estimate of $2.5 billion of synergies is very conservative, and we expect to be able to exceed that amount by a fair margin. 
We continue to make strong progress towards completing the transaction and recently received antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission, one of the customary closing conditions of the transaction. Rice is an outstanding, strategic and operational fit for us, and we are excited to complete the transaction in the fourth quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pat for Q&A."

So the West Virginia lateral is one. That's a -- if you assume that we could increase the average lateral in West Virginia by 2,000 feet, at the same time, delaying a significant amount of the West Virginia development because it will be more focused on Pennsylvania. So all that is incorporated into this number. The reason that we think that might be possible or at least a portion of that is possible is we've clearly found that time equals more length, especially in West Virginia because of the, frankly, antiquated oil and gas regulations they have. It takes a lot of time to piece together longer laterals. And as a result of the Rice acquisition and shifting our focus to Pennsylvania, that will buy us a lot more time to work the existing locations in West Virginia. And ultimately, they will be longer when we drill than they otherwise would have been. So that's what's behind that. And I would stress on that -- on the sheet in our IR presentation, those are ranges of values. We're not necessarily saying that we expect to achieve 100% of all of those, but I would expect that we will achieve some amount of -- probably all of them or nearly all of them. And that's one. So we picked 2,000 feet because we think that's plausible, but it will be hard to quantify and hard to measure and will occur somewhere down the road. On the -- I think the buying power is self-explanatory. That's just having more leverage because of our scale in negotiating service contracts. And/or, if that's not possible, having an upscale, enough certainty with our drilling programs that -- if it made sense, we could ourselves get into the service business, if that made more sense to make sure we got some synergies there, although I think more likely would be that we're just able to negotiate better contracts. The marketing optimization is again, because of the scale and the amount of gas that we will have available to sell, the thought in our commercial group that they'll be able to negotiate better sales contracts. That one is a $0.05 improvement in realized price -- would yield $1.4 billion in value. I can't guarantee we'll get $0.05, but we should be able to negotiate better sales contracts. So there should be some value there, for sure. LOE optimization is, again, we haven't built that into our synergies. But clearly, because of the operational overlap of the 2 companies, we would fully expect to realize some unit LOE improvements. And we've quoted a $0.03 improvement yields, $800 million in additional value. We talked about the G&A. We've only discounted that for 10 years. If you assume that, that continues in perpetuity, it's another $0.5 billion, but we tend to be more conservative on our estimate. And finally, MVP expansion. Because of the extra or the increased production that we'll have, it's possible that, that expansion opportunity could be accelerated by up to 3 years [indiscernible] that value and has a PV of about $200 million. And the biggest one is the thought that, between the 2 companies, we've got a lot of data on completion practices in this core area of the Marcellus, and both companies have independently done a lot of science and analysis and gathered tremendous amounts of data. And we put those 2 databases together and can explore the best techniques in various areas. Almost certainly, we will be able to come up with best practices going both ways that improve the returns of our wells. Hard to predict how much that will be. But for example, if we increased the EURs by 5%, that's an additional $2.5 billion of synergies. So that's a particularly powerful one and one that I fully expect to capture some, if not all, of that amount of synergy. Maybe a little more long-winded than you wanted."

You have different acreage dedications, different midstream companies, different net revenue interest, different terms of leases. So it takes a lot of effort to get the swaps done. It also gives us more time to work on the joint development and cotenancy legislation in West Virginia that we still feel needs to happen in West Virginia, and we still remain cautiously optimistic that, with more time, we will get that legislation through. That would be a big improvement for West Virginia lateral lengths and economics and make West Virginia more competitive in certain areas with our Pennsylvania opportunities. So having more time to work on that before we drill the wells is certainly a big advantage."

So I do want to be clear, the numbers that are shown on the page are all the numbers at the high end of the ranges. And I think it's probably a bit optimistic to assume that we could capture all of that. So I don't want anyone to take away from this that we're saying we're going to get another $7.5 billion on top of the $2.5 billion. I do fully expect we will get some amount probably from each of those categories. And I will -- probably a good time to mention this. The -- one of the reasons that we didn't provide these upfront is, these -- to your question, these are far more difficult to prove and to do a look back on and demonstrate that we capture it and to quantify how much we got and when we got it because of the nature of them versus the 2 categories of synergies that we talked about initially, which, a, we have extremely high confidence we will get at least get that much; and two, we will easily be able to demonstrate how we performed versus those estimates. These will be much more difficult to demonstrate how much we were able to get. So with that caveat, these were all -- so that ones related to a development program is like incremental EUR improvements, that was -- to get to the $2.5 billion, that assumes 5% of every well point forward. So that assumes starting day 1. So that's probably, frankly, a bit aggressive. It will take a little time of study to get the data in and have engineers look at it, implement new practices, but that applies to several thousand wells. So if we missed the first few dozen, it probably doesn't change the value that much. And most of them are similar. It assumes applying that improvement on the pro forma development plan."

So from a competition for capital standpoint, those corners of the box just won't compete for our capital, but might be attractive to someone else.

And I've been very pleased at that because I wasn't quite sure how it would be received, even though I think it is -- is clearly the most prudent strategy for companies in the natural gas business. And hearing more companies start to talk about that, which I think is also very positive development. I would say that -- that's another -- so I'm going to go back to the Rice transaction. Another reason I think this transaction is so transformative for our shareholders is not only is it accretive immediately to EQT shareholders, not only does it give us an industry-leading cost structure and capital efficiencies in a very competitive commodity market, it will allow this strategy of prudent and profitable growth with the return of cash to shareholders to really happen. Absent the -- those cost improvements and the capital efficiencies, it's much harder to adopt that strategy and be able to sustain it and do it in a way that really moves the needle. With our ability to drill these longer laterals and lower cost structure, I think it really makes that strategy extremely compelling. So yes, that is what we are headed toward, and I think you really start to see the benefits of it probably in 2020 when we are growing, we think, in the mid-teens and substantially less than our cash flow."

And there are certain areas of the Upper Devonian, we do strongly believe that you lose that opportunity. But I think what you will see, Holly, is going forward, a diminishing share of Upper Devonian relative to Marcellus. So we have even more compelling Marcellus opportunities now that Upper Devonian won't have to compete with and you may see as avoid those areas of Upper Devonian for now. So we don't lose it, but we'll be drilling long Marcellus wells outside of that Upper Devonian codevelopment area. So I do think -- you will continue to see some Upper Devonian capital deployed, but as a proportion of our total capital, I think you'll see it -- a steady decline and probably a fairly dramatic decline."

The Rice transaction made it an easy decision given that the hurdle for the Utica to be better than our Marcellus opportunities went up significantly. So it was pretty obvious decision because of the Rice transaction. Absent the Rice transaction, I think we were probably still in test mode with the thought that we could get there. One thing we have learned over the past 6 months is while, in a lot of cases, we can drill wells in that $12 million to $14 million range, still, occasionally, you have a troublesome well, and the costs go well above that. And we average that in, the learning curve was going to be probably a little longer than we thought. So we would have -- absent the Rice transaction, we would have been incorporating that and try to figure out, ""Well, how confident are we that the average will be in that range and we probably need to get the results of a few more wells."" So my guess would be, we'll probably drill a few more wells to get the data and then make a decision. And it could have gone either way. But with the Rice transaction, it's a no-brainer. We just don't think our Utica opportunities are likely to be able to compete with our new Marcellus opportunities."

And again, we'd have to check the numbers, but it's something like that. And if the Marcellus is drilled, because the 2 companies have drilled wells, say, toe to toe, but the Upper Devonian hasn't been drilled, so the combined acreage allows a 16,000-foot Upper Devonian, the return on that investment is probably identical to a 12,000-foot Marcellus well that we would drill.

First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued our second quarter earnings release and posted a slide presentation. Both are available on our website at www.eqt.com and included, among other things, comments about EQT's pending acquisition of Rice Energy. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation or an offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval. 
In connection with the proposed transaction, EQT expects to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 and joint proxy statement later today. These and other documents filed by EQT and Rice with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at EQT's website, www.eqt.com, or Rice's website, www.riceenergy.com, as applicable, or at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. 
You should review such materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information regarding the proposed transaction. To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP; are consolidated in EQT's results. 
Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is (201) 689-7817. 
In a moment, Rob and Dave will summarize EQT's second quarter results, and Steve will give a brief update on the Rice acquisition. Following the prepared remarks, Steve, Rob, Dave and Lisa will be available to answer your questions. 
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and on the risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website. 
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob McNally."

Before reviewing the second quarter results, I do want to briefly give you an update on the Rice Energy acquisition. As a reminder, on June 19, we announced our intent to acquire Rice for 0.37 EQT shares plus $5.30",927,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Before reviewing the second quarter results, I do want to briefly give you an update on the Rice Energy acquisition. As a reminder, on June 19, we announced our intent to acquire Rice for 0.37 EQT shares plus $5.30 per Rice share. As Pat mentioned, the proxy statement will be filed later today and will be available on our website, Rice's website or the SEC website. Steve is going to have further comments on the transaction in a few minutes. 
We'll now provide an overview of the second quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.06 compared to a $0.38 loss in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $223 million as compared to $105 million for the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $118 million. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. 
Moving to production. Production sales volume of 198 Bcfe for the second quarter was 7% higher than the second quarter of 2016 and was slightly ahead of the high end of our guidance range. The realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $2.86 per Mcfe, a 36% increase compared to $2.11 per Mcfe in the second quarter of last year. Operating revenue for the production company totaled $631 million for the second quarter of 2017, which was $554 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. 
Total operating expenses at EQT production were $578 million or 10% higher quarter-over-quarter, consistent with volume growth. Transmission expenses were almost $38 million higher due to volumes transported on the Rockies Express pipeline and the Ohio Valley Connector. As mentioned on our first quarter call, we are paying for some REX capacity last year. But since we are unable to physically move or produce gas to REX in the second quarter of 2016, we used that capacity for marketing. When we use pipeline capacity for marketing, we net the cost of the transportation against the recoveries realized. The cost of pipeline capacity used to move our produced gas is recognized as an operating expense. 
Processing expenses were $17.7 million higher, consistent with higher wet gas volumes, primarily related to our recent acreage acquisitions. Gathering expenses and DD&A were all higher, consistent with production growth. Production taxes were $1.8 million higher as a result of higher impact fees due to increased drilling activity in Pennsylvania and better pricing. Lease operating expenses, excluding production taxes, were $3.3 million lower. Excluding the impact of prior year pension settlement and legal expenses, SG&A was slightly favorable for the quarter as we reduced our Kentucky cost structure when we integrated the Kentucky gathering operations into production in 2016. 
During the quarter, our liquid story was strong, reflected by an increase in volumes and a higher pricing environment. NGLs sales volume and realized price were significantly higher. Regarding pricing, the average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $2.86 per Mcfe, a 36% increase compared to the $2.11 per Mcfe in the second quarter of last year. 
The average differential for the quarter, which was a negative $0.64 per Mcfe was within the stated guidance range for the quarter. This is a $0.51 decrease from the first quarter of 2017, but a $0.15 improvement from the second quarter of 2016. Approximately 80% of our local basis exposure for the balance of 2017 is locked in and is reflected in our differential guidance. The minimal effects of decline in local pricing highlight the value of our diversified firm capacity portfolio, which provides significant takeaway capacity to premium markets. We continue to expect improvement in our realized price as incremental pipeline projects come online, including the Mountain Valley Pipeline project, which will provide access to the premium Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets. 
Now moving to Midstream results. EQT gathering operating income was $83.3 million, $10.1 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. Operating revenue was $112.1 million, a $12 million increase over the second quarter of 2016, driven by production development in the Marcellus shale. This was slightly offset by increased operating expenses, which totaled $28.8 million for the quarter, a $1.9 million increase over the same period last year. 
Looking at EQT transmission. Second quarter operating income was $57.8 million, $1.9 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. Firm reservation fee revenue was $79.5 million, $19.2 million higher than the second quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of EQT contracting for additional firm capacity on the OVC. 
Operating revenues were $86.8 million, an $8.9 million increase over the second quarter of 2016. While operating expenses were $29 million, a $7 million increase over the second quarter of 2016, with approximately $5 million of the $7 million increase being DD&A. 
I will close my remarks by providing you with our liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $561 million of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes EQM. We are forecasting $1.2 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. We are fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion 2017 CapEx forecast, which excludes EQM and land acquisitions with the expected operating cash flow and the current cash that we have on hand. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to David."

As Rob mentioned, our sales volume for the second quarter was 198 Bcfe, which exceeded the high end of guidance by 3 Bcfe. Operationally, we now have 7 frackers secured and expect to operate at this pace for the remainder of the year. With these crews in place, we anticipate approximately 55 Marcellus and Upper Devonian wells to be turned online in the third quarter and 58 in the fourth quarter. This is approximately 3x the pace of the first 6 months of this year, during which we had 19 wells turned in line in the first quarter and 17 wells in the second quarter. 
As you would expect, the production impact of this increased completion activity will be weighted to the fourth quarter and is reflected in our current guidance. Additionally, with the success of our ongoing consolidation efforts, we now expect our 2017 drilling program to have an average lateral length of 8,400 feet, which is 11% higher than our 2016 average. 
Now let's move on to our deep Utica test program. As we've mentioned during previous calls, our capital is allocated to projects that we expect will deliver the best returns. And as we continue to lengthen laterals and improve efficiency in the Marcellus, the hurdle rate for other investments continues to increase. As an example, given our contiguous acreage position of the pending Rice transaction, we expect Marcellus wells in Greene and Washington counties to average at least 12,000 feet. 
Based on recent Utica results and current development costs, we estimate a Utica well would need to achieve at least 4 Bcf per 1,000 feet to be competitive with a 12,000-foot Marcellus well. And so far, we believe there are only 2 deep Utica wells that meet or exceed that threshold. In short, we have multiple years of long lateral inventory in the Marcellus. And when comparing the 2 plays, it is difficult for the Utica to compete. 
For these reasons, we have made the decision to suspend our Utica test program and focus our efforts on Marcellus development as we integrate the assets we've acquired over the past 1.5 years. This year's Utica program was planned to contribute 18 Bcfe to our annual volume. Therefore, the suspension will impact our production guidance, which is now adjusted to be 205 to 210 Bcfe for the third quarter and 825 to 840 Bcfe for the full year. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve."

As you're aware, the big news of the quarter was the June 19 announcement that we entered into an agreement to acquire Rice Energy. Rice is an outstanding, strategic and operational fit for us, and we anticipate t",700,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everybody. As you're aware, the big news of the quarter was the June 19 announcement that we entered into an agreement to acquire Rice Energy. Rice is an outstanding, strategic and operational fit for us, and we anticipate the combined entities will capture significant operating efficiencies, improve overall well economics and deliver stronger returns to our shareholders. We also believe this transaction will enhance our options to address EQT sum-of-the-parts discount, which we have previously discussed. 
We have spoken with many of our shareholders and other industry experts since the announcement, and we are pleased with the positive and enthusiastic feedback received. In discussing this compelling transaction, we received questions in our ability to address the sum-of-the-parts discount and around our synergies estimates for the merger. I will address both of these topics today. 
First, on addressing the sum of the parts. The Rice acquisition does not impact the timing of addressing our sum-of-the-parts discount. In fact, we believe these transactions will enhance our options to address the sum-of-the-parts discount, which we have previously discussed. Addressing the sum-of-the-parts discount is a priority for the board, and we will develop a plan by the end of 2018 that we believe is in the best interest of EQT and all shareholders. 
These options could include splitting companies, selling one of the businesses, collapsing EQM and EQGP to support a buyback program as well as several other scenarios. Our analysis will be a comprehensive one, which not only evaluates all feasible alternatives for addressing the discount. We will also include a full analysis of the potential tax implications of the current tax reform effort in Washington. As you can appreciate, this is a longer-term development, and we do not have additional details to share. 
The second most common question has been around synergies. We are confident that the PV of the synergies are in excess of the $2.5 billion laid out in the deal announcement. As you will see in our updated slide deck, which was posted to our website and filed with the SEC this morning, the $2.5 billion only covers categories of synergies, $1.9 billion of which are efficiencies driven by longer laterals, high-grading the drilling program to drill longer laterals first and lower surface costs, including fewer roads, pads, water pits and well lines. Those savings are in our control, and we are forecasting $200 million in 2018 and $350 million per year for the following 9 years. The other $600 million is from a reduction of a $100 million of G&A per year discounted for 10 years. Given the overlap of the businesses and after careful evaluation, we believe that $2.5 billion is a conservative estimate and are confident in our ability to achieve these targets. 
In addition to the quantified synergies, there are significant synergies that are harder to quantify. We listed them in our presentation this morning, along with ranges of potential value. If you took the high end of the ranges of each category, the additional synergies are well in excess of the $2.5 billion that we've already quantified. A few examples are: increasing well recoveries by combining EQT and Rice's best drilling and completion techniques is worth $500 million for every 1% increase in EUR per foot; increased leverage in acquiring drilling and fracking services is worth $300 million for every 1% improvement in service cost; and G&A savings beyond the 10 years is worth approximately $500 million. 
There are several other additional synergies discussed in our updated IR deck, and I would encourage you to review our new deck for the full slate of additional synergies. I think you will also conclude that our original estimate of $2.5 billion in synergies is very conservative, and we expect to be able to exceed that amount by a fair margin. 
We continue to make strong progress towards completing the transaction and recently received antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission, one of the customary closing conditions of the transaction. Rice is an outstanding, strategic and operational fit for us, and we are excited to complete the transaction in the fourth quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pat for Q&A."

So the West Virginia lateral is one. That's a -- if you assume that we could increase the average lateral in West Virginia by 2,000 feet, at the same time delaying a significant amount of the West Virginia development because we'll be more focused on Pennsylvania, so all that's incorporated into this number. The reason that we think that might be possible or at least a portion of that is possible is we've clearly found that time equals more length, especially in West Virginia because of the, frankly, antiquated oil and gas regulations they have, it takes a lot of time to piece together longer laterals. And as a result of the Rice acquisition and shifting our focus to Pennsylvania, that will buy us a lot more time to work the existing locations in West Virginia. And ultimately, they will be longer when we drill than they otherwise would have been. So that's what's behind that. And I would stress on that -- on the sheet in our IR presentation, those are ranges of values. We're not necessarily saying that we expect to achieve 100% of all of those, but I would expect that we will achieve some amount of probably all of them or nearly all of them. And that's one. So we picked 2,000 feet because we think that's plausible, but it will be hard to quantify and hard to measure and will occur somewhat down the road. On the -- I think the buying power is self-explanatory. That's just having more leverage because of our scale in negotiating service contracts. And/or, if that's not possible, having enough scale and enough certainty with our drilling programs that, if it made sense, we could ourselves get into the service business, if that made more sense to make sure we got some synergies there, although I think more likely would be that we're just able to negotiate better contracts. The marketing optimization is again, because of the scale and the amount of gas that we will have available to sell, the thought in our commercial group that they will be able to negotiate better sales contracts, that one is a $0.05 improvement in realized price. It would yield $1.4 billion in value. I can't guarantee we'll get $0.05, but we should be able to negotiate better sales contracts. So there should be some value there for sure. LOE optimization is, again, we haven't built that into our synergies. But clearly, because of the operational overlap of the 2 companies, we would fully expect to realize some unit LOE improvements. And we've quoted a $0.03 improvement yields, $800 million in additional value. We talked about the G&A. We've only discounted that for 10 years. If you assume that, that continues in perpetuity, it's another $0.5 billion. But we tended to be more conservative on our estimate. And finally, MVP expansion. Because of the extra or the increased production that we'll have, it's possible that, that expansion opportunity could be accelerated by up to 3 years. [indiscernible] that value and has a PV of about $200 million. And the biggest one is the thought that between the 2 companies, we've got a lot of data on completion practices in this core area of the Marcellus. And both companies have independently done a lot of science and analysis and gathered tremendous amounts of data, and we put those 2 databases together and can explore the best techniques in various areas. Almost certainly, we will be able to come up with best practices going both ways that improve the returns of our wells. Hard to predict how much that will be. But for example, if we increased the EURs by 5%, that's an additional $2.5 billion of synergies. So that's a particularly powerful one and one that I fully expect to capture some if not all of that amount of synergy. That maybe a little long-winded than you wanted."

You have different acreage dedications to different midstream companies. You have different  net revenue interest, different terms in the leases. So it takes a lot of effort to get the swaps done. It also gives us more time to work on the joint development and cotenancy legislation in West Virginia that we still feel needs to happen in West Virginia, and we still remain cautiously optimistic that with more time, we will get that legislation through. That would be a big improvement for West Virginia lateral lengths and economics and make West Virginia more competitive in certain areas with our Pennsylvania opportunities.

So I don't want anyone to take away from this that we're saying we're going to get another $7.5 billion on top of the $2.5 billion. I do fully expect we will get some amount probably from each of those categories. And I will -- it's probably a good time to mention this, but one of the reasons that we didn't provide these upfront is these -- to your question, Neal, these are far more difficult to prove and to do a look back on and demonstrate that we captured it and to quantify how much we got and when we got it because of the nature of them versus the 2 categories of synergies that we talked about initially, which, a, we have extremely high confidence we will get at least get that much; and two, we will easily be able to demonstrate how we performed versus those estimates. These will be much more difficult to demonstrate how much we were able to get. So with that caveat, these were all sort of ones that are related to a development program so like incremental EUR improvements. That was -- to get to the $2.5 billion, that assumed 5% every well going forward. So that assumes starting day 1. So that's probably, frankly, a bit aggressive. It will take a little time to study to get the data in and have engineers look at it, implement new practices, but that applies to several thousand wells. So if we missed the first few dozen, it probably doesn't change the value that much. And most of them are similar. It assumes applying that improvement on the pro forma development plan."

And you're hearing more companies start to talk about that, which I think is also very positive development. I will say that's another -- so I'm going to go back to the Rice transaction. Another reason I think this transaction is so transformative for our shareholders is not only is it accretive immediately to EQT shareholders, not only does it give us an industry-leading cost structure and capital efficiencies in a very competitive commodity market. It will allow this strategy of prudent and profitable growth with return of cash to shareholders to really happen. Absent the -- those cost improvements and the capital efficiencies, it's much harder to adopt that strategy and be able to sustain it and do it in a way that really moves the needle. With our ability to drill these longer laterals and lower cost structure, I think it really makes that strategy extremely compelling. So yes, that is what we are headed toward, and I think you really start to see the benefits of it probably in 2020 when we are growing, we think, in the mid-teens and substantially less than our cash flow."

So we have even more compelling Marcellus opportunities now that Upper Devonian will have to compete with and you may see us avoid those areas of Upper Devonian for now. So we don't lose it, but we will be drilling long Marcellus wells outside of that Upper Devonian codevelopment area. So I do think you will continue to see some Upper Devonian capital deployed.

The Rice transaction made it an easy decision given that the hurdle for the Utica to be better than our Marcellus opportunities went up significantly. So it was a pretty obvious decision because of the Rice transaction. Absent the Rice transaction, I think we were probably still in test mode with the thought that we could get there. One thing we have learned over the past 6 months is while, in a lot of cases, we can drill wells in that $12 million to $14 million range, still, occasionally, you have a troublesome well, and the costs go well above that. And when you average that in, the learning curve was going to be probably a little longer than we thought. So we would have -- absent the Rice transaction, we would have been incorporating that and trying to figure out, well, how confident are we that the average will be in that range and what we probably need to get the results of a few more wells. So my guess would be, we'll probably drill a few more wells to get the data and then make a decision. And it could have gone either way. But with the Rice transaction, it's a no-brainer. We just don't think our Utica opportunities are likely to be able to compete with our new Marcellus opportunities."

And again, we'd have to check the numbers, but it's something like that. And if the Marcellus is drilled, because the 2 companies have drilled wells, say, toe to toe, but the Upper Devonian hasn't been drilled, so the combined acreage allows a 16,000-foot Upper Devonian, the return on that investment is probably identical to a 12,000-foot Marcellus well that we would drill.

The replay for this call will be available this evening for 7 days. The telephone number for the replay is (201) 612-7415. The confirmation code is 13650782. The call will also be replayed for 7 days on our website. 
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued our second quarter earnings release and posted a slide presentation. Both are available on our website at www.eqt.com and included, among other things, comments about EQT's pending acquisition of Rice Energy. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation or an offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval. 
In connection with the proposed transaction, EQT expects to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 and joint proxy statement later today. These and other documents filed by EQT and Rice with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at EQT's website, www.eqt.com, or Rice's website, www.riceenergy.com, as applicable, or at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. 
You should review such materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information regarding the proposed transaction. To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP; are consolidated in EQT's results. 
Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is (201) 689-7817. 
In a moment, Rob and Dave will summarize EQT's second quarter results, and Steve will give a brief update on the Rice acquisition. Following the prepared remarks, Steve, Rob, Dave and Lisa will be available to answer your questions. 
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and on the risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website. 
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob McNally."

Before reviewing the second quarter results, I do want to briefly give you an update on the Rice Energy acquisition.

Before reviewing the second quarter results, I do want to briefly give you an update on the Rice Energy acquisition. As a reminder, on June 19, we announced our intent to acquire Rice for 0.37 EQT shares plus $5.30 per Rice share. As Pat mentioned, the proxy statement will be filed later today and will be available on our website, Rice's website or the SEC website. Steve is going to have further comments on the transaction in a few minutes. 
We'll now provide an overview of the second quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.06 compared to a $0.38 loss in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $223 million as compared to $105 million for the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $118 million. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. 
Moving to production. Production sales volume of 198 Bcfe for the second quarter was 7% higher than the second quarter of 2016 and was slightly ahead of the high end of our guidance range. The realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $2.86 per Mcfe, a 36% increase compared to $2.11 per Mcfe in the second quarter of last year. Operating revenue for the production company totaled $631 million for the second quarter of 2017, which was $554 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. 
Total operating expenses at EQT production were $578 million or 10% higher quarter-over-quarter, consistent with volume growth. Transmission expenses were almost $38 million higher due to volumes transported on the Rockies Express pipeline and the Ohio Valley Connector. As mentioned on our first quarter call, we are paying for some REX capacity last year. But since we are unable to physically move or produce gas to REX in the second quarter of 2016, we used that capacity for marketing. When we use pipeline capacity for marketing, we net the cost of the transportation against the recoveries realized. The cost of pipeline capacity used to move our produced gas is recognized as an operating expense. 
Processing expenses were $17.7 million higher, consistent with higher wet gas volumes, primarily related to our recent acreage acquisitions. Gathering expenses and DD&A were all higher, consistent with production growth. Production taxes were $1.8 million higher as a result of higher impact fees due to increased drilling activity in Pennsylvania and better pricing. Lease operating expenses, excluding production taxes, were $3.3 million lower. Excluding the impact of prior year pension settlement and legal expenses, SG&A was slightly favorable for the quarter as we reduced our Kentucky cost structure when we integrated the Kentucky gathering operations into production in 2016. 
During the quarter, our liquid story was strong, reflected by an increase in volumes and a higher pricing environment. NGLs sales volume and realized price were significantly higher. Regarding pricing, the average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $2.86 per Mcfe, a 36% increase compared to the $2.11 per Mcfe in the second quarter of last year. 
The average differential for the quarter, which was a negative $0.64 per Mcfe was within the stated guidance range for the quarter. This is a $0.51 decrease from the first quarter of 2017, but a $0.15 improvement from the second quarter of 2016. Approximately 80% of our local basis exposure for the balance of 2017 is locked in and is reflected in our differential guidance. The minimal effects of decline in local pricing highlight the value of our diversified firm capacity portfolio, which provides significant takeaway capacity to premium markets. We continue to expect improvement in our realized price as incremental pipeline projects come online, including the Mountain Valley Pipeline project, which will provide access to the premium Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets. 
Now moving to Midstream results. EQT gathering operating income was $83.3 million, $10.1 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. Operating revenue was $112.1 million, a $12 million increase over the second quarter of 2016, driven by production development in the Marcellus shale. This was slightly offset by increased operating expenses, which totaled $28.8 million for the quarter, a $1.9 million increase over the same period last year. 
Looking at EQT transmission. Second quarter operating income was $57.8 million, $1.9 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. Firm reservation fee revenue was $79.5 million, $19.2 million higher than the second quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of EQT contracting for additional firm capacity on the OVC. 
Operating revenues were $86.8 million, an $8.9 million increase over the second quarter of 2016. While operating expenses were $29 million, a $7 million increase over the second quarter of 2016, with approximately $5 million of the $7 million increase being DD&A. 
I will close my remarks by providing you with our liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $561 million of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes EQM. We are forecasting $1.2 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. We are fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion 2017 CapEx forecast, which excludes EQM and land acquisitions with the expected operating cash flow and the current cash that we have on hand. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to David."

As Rob mentioned, our sales volume for the second quarter was 198 Bcfe, which exceeded the high end of guidance by 3 Bcfe. Operationally, we now have 7 frack crews secured and expect to operate at this pace for the remainder of the year. With these crews in place, we anticipate approximately 55 Marcellus and Upper Devonian wells to be turned online in the third quarter and 58 in the fourth quarter. This is approximately 3x the pace of the first 6 months of this year, during which we had 19 wells turned in line in the first quarter and 17 wells in the second quarter. 
As you would expect, the production impact of this increased completion activity will be weighted to the fourth quarter and is reflected in our current guidance. Additionally, with the success of our ongoing consolidation efforts, we now expect our 2017 drilling program to have an average lateral length of 8,400 feet, which is 11% higher than our 2016 average. 
Now let's move on to our deep Utica test program. As we've mentioned during previous calls, our capital is allocated to projects that we expect will deliver the best returns. And as we continue to lengthen laterals and improve efficiency in the Marcellus, the hurdle rate for other investments continues to increase. As an example, given our contiguous acreage position of the pending Rice transaction, we expect Marcellus wells in Greene and Washington counties to average at least 12,000 feet. 
Based on recent Utica results and current development costs, we estimate a Utica well would need to achieve at least 4 Bcf per 1,000 feet to be competitive with a 12,000-foot Marcellus well. And so far, we believe there are only 2 deep Utica wells that meet or exceed that threshold. In short, we have multiple years of long lateral inventory in the Marcellus. And when comparing the 2 plays, it is difficult for the Utica to compete. 
For these reasons, we have made the decision to suspend our Utica test program and focus our efforts on Marcellus development as we integrate the assets we've acquired over the past 1.5 years. This year's Utica program was planned to contribute 18 Bcfe to our annual volume. Therefore, the suspension will impact our production guidance, which is now adjusted to be 205 to 210 Bcfe for the third quarter and 825 to 840 Bcfe for the full year. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve."

As you're aware, the big news of the quarter was the June 19 announcement that we entered into an agreement to acquire Rice Energy. Rice is an outstanding, strategic and operational fit for us, and we anticipate the combined entities will capture significant operating efficiencies, improve overall well economics and deliver stronger returns to our shareholders. We also believe this transaction will enhance our options to address EQT sum-of-the-parts discount, which we have previously discussed. 
We have spoken with many of our shareholders and other industry experts since the announcement, and we are pleased with the positive and enthusiastic feedback received. In discussing this compelling transaction, we received questions in our ability to address the sum-of-the-parts discount and around our synergies estimates for the merger. I will address both of these topics today. 
First, on addressing the sum of the parts. The Rice acquisition does not impact the timing of addressing our sum-of-the-parts discount. In fact, we believe these transactions will enhance our options to address the sum-of-the-parts discount, which we have previously discussed. Addressing the sum-of-the-parts discount is a priority for the board, and we will develop a plan by the end of 2018 that we believe is in the best interest of EQT and all shareholders. 
These options could include splitting the companies, selling one of the businesses, collapsing EQM and EQGP to support a buyback program as well as several other scenarios. Our analysis will be a comprehensive one, which not only evaluates all feasible alternatives for addressing the discount. We will also include a full analysis of the potential tax implications of the current tax reform effort in Washington. As you can appreciate, this is a longer-term development, and we do not have additional details to share. 
The second most common question has been around synergies. We are confident that the PV of the synergies are in excess of the $2.5 billion laid out in the deal announcement. As you will see in our updated slide deck, which was posted to our website and filed with the SEC this morning, the $2.5 billion only covers categories of synergies, $1.9 billion of which are efficiencies driven by longer laterals, high-grading the drilling program to drill longer laterals first and lower surface costs, including fewer roads, pads, water pits and well lines. Those savings are in our control, and we are forecasting $200 million in 2018 and $350 million per year for the following 9 years. The other $600 million is from a reduction of a $100 million of G&A per year discounted for 10 years. Given the overlap of the businesses and after careful evaluation, we believe that $2.5 billion is a conservative estimate and are confident in our ability to achieve these targets. 
In addition to the quantified synergies, there are significant synergies that are harder to quantify. We listed them in our presentation this morning, along with ranges of potential value. If you took the high end of the ranges of each category, the additional synergies are well in excess of the $2.5 billion that we've already quantified. A few examples are: increasing well recoveries by combining EQT and Rice's best drilling and completion techniques is worth $500 million for every 1% increase in EUR per foot; increased leverage in acquiring drilling and fracking services is worth $300 million for every 1% improvement in service cost; and G&A savings beyond the 10 years is worth approximately $500 million. 
There are several other additional synergies discussed in our updated IR deck, and I would encourage you to review our new deck for the full slate of additional synergies. I think you will also conclude that our original estimate of $2.5 billion in synergies is very conservative, and we expect to be able to exceed that amount by a fair margin. 
We continue to make strong progress towards completing the transaction and recently received antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission, one of the customary closing conditions of the transaction. Rice is an outstanding strategic and operational fit for us, and we are excited to complete the transaction in the fourth quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pat for Q&A."

So the West Virginia lateral is one. That's a -- if you assume that we could increase the average lateral in West Virginia by 2,000 feet, at the same time delaying a significant amount of the West Virginia development because we'll be more focused on Pennsylvania, so all that's incorporated into this number. The reason that we think that might be possible or at least a portion of that is possible is we've clearly found that time equals more length, especially in West Virginia because of the, frankly, antiquated oil and gas regulations they have, it takes a lot of time to piece together longer laterals. And as a result of the Rice acquisition and shifting our focus to Pennsylvania, that will buy us a lot more time to work the existing locations in West Virginia. And ultimately, they will be longer when we drill than they otherwise would have been. So that's what's behind that. And I would stress on that -- on the sheet in our IR presentation, those are ranges of values. We're not necessarily saying that we expect to achieve 100% of all of those, but I would expect that we will achieve some amount of probably all of them or nearly all of them. And that's one. So we picked 2,000 feet because we think that's plausible, but it will be hard to quantify and hard to measure and will occur somewhat down the road. On the -- I think the buying power is self-explanatory. That's just having more leverage because of our scale in negotiating service contracts. And/or, if that's not possible, having enough scale and enough certainty with our drilling programs that, if it made sense, we could ourselves get into the service business, if that made more sense to make sure we got some synergies there, although I think more likely would be that we're just able to negotiate better contracts. The marketing optimization is again, because of the scale and the amount of gas that we will have available to sell, the thought in our commercial group that they will be able to negotiate better sales contracts, that one is a $0.05 improvement in realized price. It would yield $1.4 billion in value. I can't guarantee we'll get $0.05, but we should be able to negotiate better sales contracts. So there should be some value there for sure. LOE optimization is, again, we haven't built that into our synergies. But clearly, because of the operational overlap of the 2 companies, we would fully expect to realize some unit LOE improvements. And we've quoted a $0.03 improvement yields, $800 million in additional value. We talked about the G&A. We've only discounted that for 10 years. If you assume that, that continues in perpetuity, it's another $0.5 billion. But we tended to be more conservative on our estimate. And finally, MVP expansion. Because of the extra or the increased production that we'll have, it's possible that, that expansion opportunity could be accelerated by up to 3 years, which pulls forward that value and has a PV of about $200 million. And the biggest one is the thought that between the 2 companies, we've got a lot of data on completion practices in this core area of the Marcellus. And both companies have independently done a lot of science and analysis and gathered tremendous amounts of data, and we put those 2 databases together and can explore the best techniques in various areas. Almost certainly, we will be able to come up with best practices going both ways that improve the returns of our wells. Hard to predict how much that will be. But for example, if we increased the EURs by 5%, that's an additional $2.5 billion of synergies. So that's a particularly powerful one and one that I fully expect to capture some if not all of that amount of synergy. That maybe a little long-winded than you wanted."

You have different acreage dedications to different midstream companies. You have different net revenue interest, different terms in the leases. So it takes a lot of effort to get the swaps done. It also gives us more time to work on the joint development and cotenancy legislation in West Virginia that we still feel needs to happen in West Virginia, and we still remain cautiously optimistic that with more time, we will get that legislation through. That would be a big improvement for West Virginia lateral lengths and economics and make West Virginia more competitive in certain areas with our Pennsylvania opportunities. So having more time to work on that before we drill the wells is certainly a big advantage."

So I don't want anyone to take away from this that we're saying we're going to get another $7.5 billion on top of the $2.5 billion. I do fully expect we will get some amount probably from each of those categories. And I will -- it's probably a good time to mention this, but one of the reasons that we didn't provide these upfront is these -- to your question, Neal, these are far more difficult to prove and to do a look back on and demonstrate that we captured it and to quantify how much we got and when we got it because of the nature of them versus the 2 categories of synergies that we talked about initially, which, a, we have extremely high confidence we will get at least get that much; and two, we will easily be able to demonstrate how we performed versus those estimates. These will be much more difficult to demonstrate how much we were able to get. So with that caveat, these were all -- so the ones that are related to a development program so like incremental EUR improvements. That was -- to get to the $2.5 billion, that assumed 5% every well pulling forward. So that assumes starting day 1. So that's probably, frankly, a bit aggressive. It will take a little time to study to get the data in and have engineers look at it, implement new practices, but that applies to several thousand wells. So if we missed the first few dozen, it probably doesn't change the value that much. And most of them are similar. It assumes applying that improvement on the pro forma development plan."

And even absent the Rice transaction on the EQT side, we currently have plans to drill quite a few wells that are north of 12,000 feet where our own acreage allows it. So you will see some longer laterals coming even before the Rice transaction closes or before we start to get the benefits from it. But by the end of -- early 2019 is when you'll see the full force in effect of the combined company."

First of all, the shareholder response, I think, has been -- been extremely well received. And I've been very pleased at that because I wasn't quite sure how it would be received, even though I think it is clearly the most prudent strategy for companies in the natural gas business. And you're hearing more companies start to talk about that, which I think is also very positive development. I will say that's another -- so I'm going to go back to the Rice transaction. Another reason I think this transaction is so transformative for our shareholders is not only is it accretive immediately to EQT shareholders, not only does it give us an industry-leading cost structure and capital efficiencies in a very competitive commodity market. It will allow this strategy of prudent and profitable growth with return of cash to shareholders to really happen. Absent the -- those cost improvements and the capital efficiencies, it's much harder to adopt that strategy and be able to sustain it and do it in a way that really moves the needle. With our ability to drill these long laterals and lower cost structure, I think it really makes that strategy extremely compelling. So yes, that is what we are headed toward, and I think you really start to see the benefits of it probably in 2020 when we are growing, we think, in the mid-teens and substantially less than our cash flow."

So if that opportunity gets proved up by someone else anytime soon, we have that opportunity and can restart activity there quickly without losing anything. In certain areas of the Upper Devonian, we do strongly believe that you lose that opportunity. But I think what you will see, Holly, is going forward, a diminishing share of Upper Devonian relative to Marcellus. So we have even more compelling Marcellus opportunities now that Upper Devonian will have to compete with and you may see us avoid those areas of Upper Devonian for now. So we don't lose it, but we will be drilling long Marcellus wells outside of that Upper Devonian codevelopment area. So I do think you will continue to see some Upper Devonian capital deployed. But as a proportion of our total capital, I think you'll see it -- a steady decline and probably a fairly dramatic decline."

The Rice transaction made it an easy decision given that the hurdle for the Utica to be better than our Marcellus opportunities went up significantly. So it was a pretty obvious decision because of the Rice transaction. Absent the Rice transaction, I think we were probably still in test mode with the thought that we could get there. One thing we have learned over the past 6 months is while, in a lot of cases, we can drill wells in that $12 million to $14 million range, still, occasionally, you have a troublesome well, and the costs go well above that. And when you average that in, the learning curve was going to be probably a little longer than we thought. So we would have -- absent the Rice transaction, we would have been incorporating that and trying to figure out, well, how confident are we that the average will be in that range and what we probably need to get the results of a few more wells. So my guess would be, we'll probably drill a few more wells to get the data and then make a decision. And it could have gone either way. But with the Rice transaction, it's a no-brainer.

First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued our second quarter earnings release and posted a slide presentation. Both are available on our website at www.eqt.com and included, among other things, comments about EQT's pending acquisition of Rice Energy. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation or an offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval. 
In connection with the proposed transaction, EQT expects to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 and joint proxy statement later today. These and other documents filed by EQT and Rice with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at EQT's website, www.eqt.com, or Rice's website, www.riceenergy.com, as applicable, or at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. 
You should review such materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information regarding the proposed transaction. To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP; are consolidated in EQT's results. 
Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is (201) 689-7817. 
In a moment, Rob and Dave will summarize EQT's second quarter results, and Steve will give a brief update on the Rice acquisition. Following the prepared remarks, Steve, Rob, Dave and Lisa will be available to answer your questions. 
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and on the risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website. 
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob McNally."

Before reviewing the second quarter results, I do want to briefly give you an update on the Rice Energy acquisition.

Before reviewing the second quarter results, I do want to briefly give you an update on the Rice Energy acquisition. As a reminder, on June 19, we announced our intent to acquire Rice for 0.37 EQT shares plus $5.30 per Rice share. As Pat mentioned, the proxy statement will be filed later today and will be available on our website, Rice's website or the SEC website. Steve is going to have further comments on the transaction in a few minutes. 
We'll now provide an overview of the second quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.06 compared to a $0.38 loss in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $223 million as compared to $105 million for the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $118 million. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. 
Moving to production. Production sales volume of 198 Bcfe for the second quarter was 7% higher than the second quarter of 2016 and was slightly ahead of the high end of our guidance range. The realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $2.86 per Mcfe, a 36% increase compared to $2.11 per Mcfe in the second quarter of last year. Operating revenue for the production company totaled $631 million for the second quarter of 2017, which was $554 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. 
Total operating expenses at EQT production were $578 million or 10% higher quarter-over-quarter, consistent with volume growth. Transmission expenses were almost $38 million higher due to volumes transported on the Rockies Express pipeline and the Ohio Valley Connector. As mentioned on our first quarter call, we are paying for some REX capacity last year. But since we are unable to physically move or produce gas to REX in the second quarter of 2016, we used that capacity for marketing. When we use pipeline capacity for marketing, we net the cost of the transportation against the recoveries realized. The cost of pipeline capacity used to move our produced gas is recognized as an operating expense. 
Processing expenses were $17.7 million higher, consistent with higher wet gas volumes, primarily related to our recent acreage acquisitions. Gathering expenses and DD&A were all higher, consistent with production growth. Production taxes were $1.8 million higher as a result of higher impact fees due to increased drilling activity in Pennsylvania and better pricing. Lease operating expenses, excluding production taxes, were $3.3 million lower. Excluding the impact of prior year pension settlement and legal expenses, SG&A was slightly favorable for the quarter as we reduced our Kentucky cost structure when we integrated the Kentucky gathering operations into production in 2016. 
During the quarter, our liquid story was strong, reflected by an increase in volumes and a higher pricing environment. NGLs sales volume and realized price were significantly higher. Regarding pricing, the average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $2.86 per Mcfe, a 36% increase compared to the $2.11 per Mcfe in the second quarter of last year. 
The average differential for the quarter, which was a negative $0.64 per Mcfe was within the stated guidance range for the quarter. This is a $0.51 decrease from the first quarter of 2017, but a $0.15 improvement from the second quarter of 2016. Approximately 80% of our local basis exposure for the balance of 2017 is locked in and is reflected in our differential guidance. The minimal effects of decline in local pricing highlight the value of our diversified firm capacity portfolio, which provides significant takeaway capacity to premium markets. We continue to expect improvement in our realized price as incremental pipeline projects come online, including the Mountain Valley Pipeline project, which will provide access to the premium Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets. 
Now moving to Midstream results. EQT gathering operating income was $83.3 million, $10.1 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. Operating revenue was $112.1 million, a $12 million increase over the second quarter of 2016, driven by production development in the Marcellus shale. This was slightly offset by increased operating expenses, which totaled $28.8 million for the quarter, a $1.9 million increase over the same period last year. 
Looking at EQT transmission. Second quarter operating income was $57.8 million, $1.9 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. Firm reservation fee revenue was $79.5 million, $19.2 million higher than the second quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of EQT contracting for additional firm capacity on the OVC. 
Operating revenues were $86.8 million, an $8.9 million increase over the second quarter of 2016. While operating expenses were $29 million, a $7 million increase over the second quarter of 2016, with approximately $5 million of the $7 million increase being DD&A. 
I will close my remarks by providing you with our liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $561 million of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes EQM. We are forecasting $1.2 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. We are fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion 2017 CapEx forecast, which excludes EQM and land acquisitions with the expected operating cash flow and the current cash that we have on hand. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to David."

With these crews in place, we anticipate approximately 55 Marcellus and Upper Devonian wells to be turned online in the third quarter and 58 in the fourth quarter. This is approximately 3x the pace of the first 6 months of this year, during which we had 19 wells turned in line in the first quarter and 17 wells in the second quarter. 
As you would expect, the production impact of this increased completion activity will be weighted to the fourth quarter and is reflected in our current guidance. Additionally, with the success of our ongoing consolidation efforts, we now expect our 2017 drilling program to have an average lateral length of 8,400 feet, which is 11% higher than our 2016 average. 
Now let's move on to our deep Utica test program. As we've mentioned during previous calls, our capital is allocated to projects that we expect will deliver the best returns. And as we continue to lengthen laterals and improve efficiency in the Marcellus, the hurdle rate for other investments continues to increase. As an example, given our contiguous acreage position of the pending Rice transaction, we expect Marcellus wells in Greene and Washington counties to average at least 12,000 feet. 
Based on recent Utica results and current development costs, we estimate a Utica well would need to achieve at least 4 Bcf per 1,000 feet to be competitive with a 12,000-foot Marcellus well. And so far, we believe there are only 2 deep Utica wells that meet or exceed that threshold. In short, we have multiple years of long lateral inventory in the Marcellus. And when comparing the 2 plays, it is difficult for the Utica to compete. 
For these reasons, we have made the decision to suspend our Utica test program and focus our efforts on Marcellus development as we integrate the assets we've acquired over the past 1.5 years. This year's Utica program was planned to contribute 18 Bcfe to our annual volume. Therefore, the suspension will impact our production guidance, which is now adjusted to be 205 to 210 Bcfe for the third quarter and 825 to 840 Bcfe for the full year. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve."

As you're aware, the big news of the quarter was the June 19 announcement that we entered into an agreement to acquire Rice Energy. Rice is an outstanding, strategic and operational fit for us, and we anticipate t",701,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everybody. As you're aware, the big news of the quarter was the June 19 announcement that we entered into an agreement to acquire Rice Energy. Rice is an outstanding, strategic and operational fit for us, and we anticipate the combined entities will capture significant operating efficiencies, improve overall well economics and deliver stronger returns to our shareholders. We also believe this transaction will enhance our options to address EQT sum-of-the-parts discount, which we have previously discussed. 
We have spoken with many of our shareholders and other industry experts since the announcement, and we are pleased with the positive and enthusiastic feedback received. In discussing this compelling transaction, we received questions in our ability to address the sum-of-the-parts discount and around our synergies estimates for the merger. I will address both of these topics today. 
First, on addressing the sum of the parts. The Rice acquisition does not impact the timing of addressing our sum-of-the-parts discount. In fact, we believe these transactions will enhance our options to address the sum-of-the-parts discount, which we have previously discussed. Addressing the sum-of-the-parts discount is a priority for the board, and we will develop a plan by the end of 2018 that we believe is in the best interest of EQT and all shareholders. 
These options could include splitting the companies, selling one of the businesses, collapsing EQM and EQGP to support a buyback program as well as several other scenarios. Our analysis will be a comprehensive one, which not only evaluates all feasible alternatives for addressing the discount. We will also include a full analysis of the potential tax implications of the current tax reform effort in Washington. As you can appreciate, this is a longer-term development, and we do not have additional details to share. 
The second most common question has been around synergies. We are confident that the PV of the synergies are in excess of the $2.5 billion laid out in the deal announcement. As you will see in our updated slide deck, which was posted to our website and filed with the SEC this morning, the $2.5 billion only covers categories of synergies, $1.9 billion of which are efficiencies driven by longer laterals, high-grading the drilling program to drill longer laterals first and lower surface costs, including fewer roads, pads, water pits and well lines. Those savings are in our control, and we are forecasting $200 million in 2018 and $350 million per year for the following 9 years. The other $600 million is from a reduction of a $100 million of G&A per year discounted for 10 years. Given the overlap of the businesses and after careful evaluation, we believe that $2.5 billion is a conservative estimate and are confident in our ability to achieve these targets. 
In addition to the quantified synergies, there are significant synergies that are harder to quantify. We listed them in our presentation this morning, along with ranges of potential value. If you took the high end of the ranges of each category, the additional synergies are well in excess of the $2.5 billion that we've already quantified. A few examples are: increasing well recoveries by combining EQT and Rice's best drilling and completion techniques is worth $500 million for every 1% increase in EUR per foot; increased leverage in acquiring drilling and fracking services is worth $300 million for every 1% improvement in service cost; and G&A savings beyond the 10 years is worth approximately $500 million. 
There are several other additional synergies discussed in our updated IR deck, and I would encourage you to review our new deck for the full slate of additional synergies. I think you will also conclude that our original estimate of $2.5 billion in synergies is very conservative, and we expect to be able to exceed that amount by a fair margin. 
We continue to make strong progress towards completing the transaction and recently received antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission, one of the customary closing conditions of the transaction. Rice is an outstanding strategic and operational fit for us, and we are excited to complete the transaction in the fourth quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pat for Q&A."

So the West Virginia lateral is one. That's a -- if you assume that we could increase the average lateral in West Virginia by 2,000 feet, at the same time delaying a significant amount of the West Virginia development because we'll be more focused on Pennsylvania, so all that's incorporated into this number. The reason that we think that might be possible or at least a portion of that is possible is we've clearly found that time equals more length, especially in West Virginia because of the, frankly, antiquated oil and gas regulations they have, it takes a lot of time to piece together longer laterals. And as a result of the Rice acquisition and shifting our focus to Pennsylvania, that will buy us a lot more time to work the existing locations in West Virginia. And ultimately, they will be longer when we drill than they otherwise would have been. So that's what's behind that. And I would stress on that -- on the sheet in our IR presentation, those are ranges of values. We're not necessarily saying that we expect to achieve 100% of all of those, but I would expect that we will achieve some amount of probably all of them or nearly all of them. And that's one. So we picked 2,000 feet because we think that's plausible, but it will be hard to quantify and hard to measure and will occur somewhat down the road. On the -- I think the buying power is self-explanatory. That's just having more leverage because of our scale in negotiating service contracts. And/or, if that's not possible, having enough scale and enough certainty with our drilling programs that, if it made sense, we could ourselves get into the service business, if that made more sense to make sure we got some synergies there, although I think more likely would be that we're just able to negotiate better contracts. The marketing optimization is again, because of the scale and the amount of gas that we will have available to sell, the thought in our commercial group that they will be able to negotiate better sales contracts, that one is a $0.05 improvement in realized price. It would yield $1.4 billion in value. I can't guarantee we'll get $0.05, but we should be able to negotiate better sales contracts. So there should be some value there for sure. LOE optimization is, again, we haven't built that into our synergies. But clearly, because of the operational overlap of the 2 companies, we would fully expect to realize some unit LOE improvements. And we've quoted a $0.03 improvement yields, $800 million in additional value. We talked about the G&A. We've only discounted that for 10 years. If you assume that, that continues in perpetuity, it's another $0.5 billion. But we tended to be more conservative on our estimate. And finally, MVP expansion. Because of the extra or the increased production that we'll have, it's possible that, that expansion opportunity could be accelerated by up to 3 years, which pulls forward that value and has a PV of about $200 million. And the biggest one is the thought that between the 2 companies, we've got a lot of data on completion practices in this core area of the Marcellus. And both companies have independently done a lot of science and analysis and gathered tremendous amounts of data, and we put those 2 databases together and can explore the best techniques in various areas. Almost certainly, we will be able to come up with best practices going both ways that improve the returns of our wells. Hard to predict how much that will be. But for example, if we increased the EURs by 5%, that's an additional $2.5 billion of synergies. So that's a particularly powerful one and one that I fully expect to capture some if not all of that amount of synergy. That maybe a little long-winded than you wanted."

So swaps, for sure. We have a lot of acreage that overlaps with one of our big competitors down there, but swaps are particularly difficult to work out. You have different acreage dedications to different midstream companies. You have different net revenue interest, different terms in the leases. So it takes a lot of effort to get the swaps done. It also gives us more time to work on the joint development and cotenancy legislation in West Virginia that we still feel needs to happen in West Virginia, and we still remain cautiously optimistic that with more time, we will get that legislation through. That would be a big improvement for West Virginia lateral lengths and economics and make West Virginia more competitive in certain areas with our Pennsylvania opportunities. So having more time to work on that before we drill the wells is certainly a big advantage."

So I do want to be clear, the numbers that are shown on that page are all the numbers at the high end of the ranges. And I think it's probably a bit optimistic to assume that we could capture all of that. So I don't want anyone to take away from this that we're saying we're going to get another $7.5 billion on top of the $2.5 billion. I do fully expect we will get some amount probably from each of those categories. And I will -- it's probably a good time to mention this, but one of the reasons that we didn't provide these upfront is these -- to your question, Neal, these are far more difficult to prove and to do a look back on and demonstrate that we captured it and to quantify how much we got and when we got it because of the nature of them versus the 2 categories of synergies that we talked about initially, which, a, we have extremely high confidence we will get at least get that much; and two, we will easily be able to demonstrate how we performed versus those estimates. These will be much more difficult to demonstrate how much we were able to get. So with that caveat, these were all -- so the ones that are related to a development program so like incremental EUR improvements. That was -- to get to the $2.5 billion, that assumed 5% every well pulling forward. So that assumes starting day 1. So that's probably, frankly, a bit aggressive. It will take a little time to study to get the data in and have engineers look at it, implement new practices, but that applies to several thousand wells. So if we missed the first few dozen, it probably doesn't change the value that much. And most of them are similar. It assumes applying that improvement on the pro forma development plan."

And you're hearing more companies start to talk about that, which I think is also very positive development. I will say that's another -- so I'm going to go back to the Rice transaction. Another reason I think this transaction is so transformative for our shareholders is not only is it accretive immediately to EQT shareholders, not only does it give us an industry-leading cost structure and capital efficiencies in a very competitive commodity market. It will allow this strategy of prudent and profitable growth with return of cash to shareholders to really happen. Absent the -- those cost improvements and the capital efficiencies, it's much harder to adopt that strategy and be able to sustain it and do it in a way that really moves the needle. With our ability to drill these long laterals and lower cost structure, I think it really makes that strategy extremely compelling. So yes, that is what we are headed toward, and I think you really start to see the benefits of it probably in 2020 when we are growing, we think, in the mid-teens and substantially less than our cash flow."

In certain areas of the Upper Devonian, we do strongly believe that you lose that opportunity. But I think what you will see, Holly, is going forward, a diminishing share of Upper Devonian relative to Marcellus. So we have even more compelling Marcellus opportunities now that Upper Devonian will have to compete with and you may see us avoid those areas of Upper Devonian for now. So we don't lose it, but we will be drilling long Marcellus wells outside of that Upper Devonian codevelopment area. So I do think you will continue to see some Upper Devonian capital deployed.

So it was a pretty obvious decision because of the Rice transaction. Absent the Rice transaction, I think we were probably still in test mode with the thought that we could get there. One thing we have learned over the past 6 months is while, in a lot of cases, we can drill wells in that $12 million to $14 million range, still, occasionally, you have a troublesome well, and the costs go well above that. And when you average that in, the learning curve was going to be probably a little longer than we thought. So we would have -- absent the Rice transaction, we would have been incorporating that and trying to figure out, well, how confident are we that the average will be in that range and what we probably need to get the results of a few more wells. So my guess would be, we'll probably drill a few more wells to get the data and then make a decision. And it could have gone either way. But with the Rice transaction, it's a no-brainer.

The replay for this call will be available starting this evening for a 7-day period. The telephone number for the replay is (201) 612-7415 with the confirmation code of 13650784. The call will also be replayed for 7 days on the website. 
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued our third quarter earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor portion of our website, www.eqt.com. Included in the release are comments regarding EQT's pending acquisition of Rice Energy. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval. In connection with the proposed transaction, EQT has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a joint proxy statement, prospectus regarding the proposed transaction, which registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC. The joint proxy statement, prospectus and other documents filed by EQT and Rice with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at EQT's website, www.eqt.com or Rice's website, www.riceenergy.com, as applicable, or at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. You should review such materials filed with the SEC carefully as they would include important information regarding the proposed transaction, including information about EQT and Rice and their respective directors, executive officers and employees, who may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect to the proposed transaction and a description of their direct and indirect interest via security holdings or otherwise. The special meeting of EQT shareholders is scheduled to be held on November 9. Given investor focus on the transaction, we will keep our prepared remarks brief today in order to facilitate your questions. 
To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP; are consolidated in EQT results. 
Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial number for that call is (201) 689-7817. 
In a moment, Rob will summarize the third quarter results, and Steve will give a brief update. Following their prepared remarks, Steve, Rob, Dave and Jerry will be available to answer your questions. 
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and other risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Q, which are on file with SEC and on our website. 
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob McNally."

I will keep my comments in the quarter brief because it was a relatively clean an straightforward quarter, and we expect there's more interest in some of the nonoperational topics. As you read in the press release",635,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I will keep my comments in the quarter brief because it was a relatively clean an straightforward quarter, and we expect there's more interest in some of the nonoperational topics. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.12 compared to a $0.28 loss per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016. 
Net income and adjusted net income and EPS for the 3 months ended September 30, 2017, were favorably impacted by a decrease in the estimated effective annual income tax rate and discrete items totaling $29.7 million that resulted in an income tax benefit that added $0.17 to adjusted EPS this quarter. 
Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $205.9 million as compared to $166.5 million for the third quarter of 2016. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $82.1 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $78.1 million in the third quarter of 2016. 
So moving to production. Sales volumes were 205.1 Bcfe for the third quarter, representing a 5% increase over the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we experienced approximately 3.5 Bcfe of curtailments which were not expected. Curtailments resulted from outages on third-party systems. Despite this impact, third quarter production fell within the stated guidance range for the quarter. 
Additionally, given how close we are in timing to the Rice vote, we will not provide guidance for the fourth quarter, but we'll tell you that our full year 2017 volumes are on track with previously stated guidance. And we expect the EQT-only exit rate to be approximately 2.7 Bcfe per day. 
The third quarter 2017 realized price included cash derivatives was $2.76 per Mcfe, a 26% increase compared to the third quarter of last year. 
Operating revenue for the production company totaled $597.7 million, which was $89.6 million higher than the third quarter of 2016. 
Total production operating expenses were $585.6 million for the quarter, which is 1% higher than the second quarter of 2017, which is consistent with the volume growth that we experienced. 
Moving on to pricing. Local basis was a bit weaker than we expected. However, a majority of our 2017 local basis exposure is locked in, resulting in a third quarter differential of negative $0.85 per Mcf, which was within our guidance range for the quarter. This differential represents a $0.21 decline over the second quarter of 2017 but is a $0.36 improvement over the third quarter of 2016. 
Now moving on to midstream results. EQT gathering operating income was $85.8 million, $13.3 million higher than the third quarter of 2016. Operating revenue was $116.5 million, a $17.4 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $30.7 million, a $4.1 million increase over the same period last year. EQT transmission operating income was $59.7 million, $6 million higher than third quarter of 2016. Operating revenues were $90.7 million, a $13.1 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. Operating expenses were $31 million for the quarter, which is a $7.1 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. 
I will close up my remarks by providing you a brief liquidity update. As you may have seen, we successfully completed a bond offering at a blended coupon rate of 3.14%. This offering brought in $3 billion of proceeds that will be used together with previous cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance the cash portion of the acquisition, repay existing Rice indebtedness and redeem EQT bonds that are due in early 2018. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Steve."

Through this dialogue, we've listened to many opinions and heard many suggestions. Consistent with what we've always done, we take action when we feel it's in our shareholders' best interest. To that point, over the last few months, we've taken the following steps, all of which were driven by doing what's in the best interest of our shareholders. We committed to establishing a board committee to evaluate options for addressing the sum-of-the-parts discount. We committed to announcing the decision of that review by the end of the first quarter 2018. We committed to adding 2 new independent directors to the board with a focus on midstream experience. We committed to include these new directors on the committee tasked with the sum-of-the-parts review. We committed to moving the director nomination deadline to be after the sum-of-the-parts decision announcement. And lastly, we removed volume growth as a metric from future compensation plans and will replace it with return on capital and operating and development cost metrics. In short, we've listened to our shareholders, and we've acted. 
Before opening the call to your questions, and since we are now 2 weeks away from the vote deadline, I do want to emphasize once again the merits of the Rice transaction. The primary driver of success in our industry is being the low-cost producer, and the most impactful way to drive per unit cost lower is through longer laterals. Establishing a dominant footprint of highly contiguous acreage that allows for sustained long lateral development is a real competitive advantage. This is what the Rice transaction creates for us. Our competitors may be able to replicate things like new drilling technology or new drilling techniques, but they can't replicate an acreage position that supports 12,000-foot laterals in the core of the Marcellus. 
While this is the main attribute of the transaction, there are many benefits of the transaction that create real value for our shareholders. The deal is 20% cash flow accretive in 2018 and 30% in 2019. It is accretive to NAV per share. We are confident in our ability to deliver the $2.5 billion of base synergy value and also deliver significant value from upside synergies. There's substantial midstream synergies to be realized. And lastly, our ability to address the sum of the parts in the most shareholder value-accretive way is enhanced by creating a more robust upstream and midstream business. 
In conclusion, we appreciate the dialogue that we've had with our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support, and we urge you to please vote for the Rice transaction on the white proxy card. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pat for Q&A."

So yes, we have disclosed that we expect between $100 million and $200 million per year for additional fill-in acreage to put these laterals together. That's actually consistent with what it already takes for us to achieve our roughly 8,000-foot lateral average per day. So without Rice, we spend -- I think we spend about $140 million per year getting to 8,000 feet. We expect to continue to spend roughly that much to put together the 12,000-foot laterals with Rice. So that's just part of what we do, and we do it every day. We've got a large land department. It's the second-biggest apartment in the upstream company, second only to the field personnel, the operators. And they work every day putting the jigsaw puzzle together. That's what they do. So this is part and parcel of what we do every day, and that won't change with Rice. In fact, in a lot of ways, it will facilitate that work because it will be -- since we're -- the overlay with Rice is -- there's such a good overlay that we're frequently running into Rice when we're trying to fill in those holes. And if we have Rice consolidated with us, then picking up those missing pieces will likely be easier and perhaps even cheaper."

And I'll give you a couple other stats that maybe will relay some confidence, especially in contrast to some of the noise that's been out there. In Greene County, which is where the bulk of this acreage is -- a lot in Washington, too. But if you just focus on Greene County for a second. Greene County has a total acreage of 370,000 acres. To date, over the last 11 years, 75,000 of those acres have been developed. So the gas is being drained from 75,000 acres. At least 295,000 acres in Greene County alone that are yet -- are as of now undrilled, undeveloped and undrained. That's about 80% of the acreage in Greene County still is available to produce gas. And one other stat for some for Greene County, again, there's 370,000 acres, again, after the Rice transaction, EQT will control 212,000 of those acres. So 57% of the county will be under the control of EQT, where 80% of that is remaining to be drilled. So there's lots of remaining inventory acreage. Tremendous amount of resource in place.

But I think -- you can look at most of those, and it's not hard to wrap your head around. There will be value created there. Obviously, purchasing power. I mean, contract for drilling and fracking services. The more work we offer, the better rates we get. With Rice, we'll be able to offer more work. So we'll get better prices. Both -- I mean -- EQT and Rice have been among the leaders in Appalachia in terms of developing the new techniques and technologies to improve recoveries. And the way that works is a lot of that is testing various ideas that the technical folks have. EQT engineers have certain ideas that we tested, and the testing involves drilling a well, modifying the technique, getting the well in line, gathering production data over many months or a year to determine whether that new technique was effective or not. So you can only test a certain number of ideas. So EQT's tested ideas. We've had -- Rice has tested ideas they've had. They're not necessarily the same ideas. So when we can get the databases and the technical teams together to review all of that data as one, there certainly will be best practices from both sides that can be combined to improve recoveries and lower costs, so -- it's hard to predict exactly what those techniques are at this point. We have to do the work and get the technical teams working on it, but not hard to imagine that there is going to be incremental value there, and it could be significant because it doesn't take much improvement in recovery to drive a significant amount of shareholder value. And then there's a risk of 7 upside synergies you can see in our presentation, so I think there's plenty of upside. But the deal makes a ton of sense even if we don't get any of that, which won't happen."

The replay for this call will be available starting this evening for a 7-day period. The telephone number for the replay is (201) 612-7415 with a confirmation code of 13650784. The call will also be replayed for 7 days on our website. 
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued our third quarter earnings release, which can be accessed on our -- the Investor portion of our website, www.eqt.com. 
Included in the release are comments regarding EQT's pending acquisition of Rice Energy. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval. In connection with the proposed transaction, EQT has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a joint proxy statement, prospectus regarding the proposed transaction [Audio Gap] which registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC. The joint proxy statement, prospectus and other documents filed by EQT and Rice with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at EQT's website, www.eqt.com; or Rice's website, www.riceenergy.com, as applicable; or at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. 
You should review such materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information regarding the proposed transaction, including information about EQT and Rice and their respective directors, executive officers and employees who may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect to the proposed transaction and a description of their direct and indirect interest by security holdings or otherwise. The special meeting of EQT shareholders is scheduled to be held on November 9. Given investor focus on the transaction, we will keep our prepared remarks brief today in order to facilitate your questions. 
To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP; are consolidated in EQT results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial number for that call is (201) 689-7817. 
In a moment, Rob will summarize the third quarter results and Steve will give a brief update. Following their prepared remarks, Steve, Rob, Dave and Jerry will be available to answer your questions. 
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs which are on file with SEC and on our website. 
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob McNally."

I will keep my comments on the quarter brief as it was a relatively clean and straightforward quarter and we expect there's more interest in some of the nonoperational topics. 
As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.12 compared to a $0.28 loss per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016. Net income and adjusted net income and EPS for the 3 months ended September 30, 2017, were favorably impacted by a decrease in the estimated effective annual income tax rate and discrete items totaling $29.7 million that resulted in an income tax benefit that added $0.17 to adjusted EPS this quarter. 
Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $205.9 million as compared to $166.5 million for the third quarter of 2016. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $82.1 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $78.1 million in the third quarter of 2016. 
So moving to production. Sales volumes were 205.1 Bcfe for the third quarter, representing a 5% increase over the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we experienced approximately 3.5 Bcfe of curtailments which were not expected. The curtailments resulted from outages on third-party systems. Despite this impact, third quarter production fell within the stated guidance range for the quarter. 
Additionally, given how close we are in timing to the Rice vote, we will not provide guidance for the fourth quarter, but we'll tell you that our full year 2017 volumes are on track with previously stated guidance. And we expect the EQT-only exit rate to be approximately 2.7 Bcfe per day. 
The third quarter 2017 realized price, including cash-settled derivatives, was $2.76 per Mcfe, a 26% increase compared to the third quarter of last year. Operating revenue for the production company totaled $597.7 million, which was $89.6 million higher than the third quarter of 2016. 
Total production operating expenses were $585.6 million for the quarter, which is 1% higher than the second quarter of 2017, which is consistent with the volume growth that we experienced. 
Moving on to pricing. Local basis was a bit weaker than we expected. However, a majority of our 2017 local basis exposure is locked in, resulting in a third quarter differential of negative $0.85 per Mcf, which was within our guidance range for the quarter. This differential represents a $0.21 decline over the second quarter of 2017 but is a $0.36 improvement over the third quarter of 2016. 
Now moving on to midstream results. EQT gathering operating income was $85.8 million, $13.3 million higher than the third quarter of 2016. Operating revenue was $116.5 million, a $17.4 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. Operating expenses for the quarter were $30.7 million, a $4.1 million increase over the same period last year. 
EQT transmission operating income was $59.7 million, $6 million higher than third quarter of 2016. Operating revenues were $90.7 million, a $13.1 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. Operating expenses were $31 million for the quarter, which a $7.1 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. 
I will close out my remarks by providing you with a brief liquidity update. As you may have seen, we successfully completed a bond offering at a blended coupon rate of 3.14%. This offering brought in $3 billion of proceeds that will be used together with previous cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance the cash portion of the acquisition, repay existing Rice indebtedness and redeem EQT bonds that are due in early 2018. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Steve."

Through this dialogue, we've listened to many opinions and heard many suggestions. Consistent with what we've always done, we take action when we feel it's in our shareholders' best interest. To that point, over the last few months, we've taken the following steps, all of which were driven by doing what's in the best interest of our shareholders. 
We committed to establishing a board committee to evaluate options for addressing the sum-of-the-parts discount. We committed to announcing the decision of that review by the end of the first quarter 2018. We committed to adding 2 new independent directors to the board with a focus on midstream experience. We committed to include these new directors on the committee tasked with the sum-of-the-parts review. We committed to moving the director nomination deadline to be after the sum-of-the-parts decision announcement. And lastly, we removed volume growth as a metric from future compensation plans and will replace it with return on capital and operating and development cost metrics. In short, we've listened to our shareholders and we've acted. 
Before opening the call to your questions, and since we are now 2 weeks away from the vote deadline, I do want to emphasize once again the merits of the Rice transaction. The primary driver of success in our industry is being the low-cost producer, and the most impactful way to drive per unit costs lower is through longer laterals. Establishing a dominant footprint of highly contiguous acreage that allows for sustained long lateral development is a real competitive advantage. This is what the Rice transaction creates for us. Our competitors may be able to replicate things like new drilling technology or new drilling techniques, but they can't replicate an acreage position that supports 12,000-foot laterals in the core of the Marcellus. 
While this is the main attribute of the transaction, there are many benefits of the transaction that create real value for our shareholders. The deal is 20% cash flow accretive in 2018 and 30% in 2019. It is accretive to NAV per share. We are confident in our ability to deliver the $2.5 billion of base synergy value and also deliver significant value from upside synergies. There are substantial midstream synergies to be realized. And lastly, our ability to address the sum of the parts in the most shareholder value-accretive way is enhanced by creating a more robust upstream and midstream business. 
In conclusion, we appreciate the dialogue that we've had with our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support, and we urge you to please vote for the Rice transaction on the white proxy card. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pat for Q&A."

So yes, we have disclosed that we expect between $100 million and $200 million per year for additional fill-in acreage to put these laterals together. That's actually consistent with what it already takes for us to achieve our roughly 8,000-foot lateral average today. So without Rice, we spend -- I think we spend about $140 million per year getting to 8,000 feet. We expect to continue to spend roughly that much to put together the 12,000-foot laterals with Rice. So that's just part of what we do, and we do it every day. We've got a large land department. It's the second-biggest department in the upstream company, second only to the field personnel, the operators. And they work every day putting the jigsaw puzzle together. That's what they do. So this is part and parcel of what we do every day, and that won't change with Rice. In fact, in a lot of ways, it will facilitate that work because it will be -- since we're -- the overlay with Rice is -- there's such a good overlay that we're frequently running into Rice when we're trying to fill in those holes. And if we have Rice consolidated with us, then picking up those missing pieces will likely be easier and perhaps even cheaper."

But I can say for certainty, the only way any contracts get renegotiated is if both parties come out with a win. It has to be a win-win, there will be no transfer in value between the 2 companies."

In Greene County, which is where the bulk of this acreage is -- there's lot in Washington, too, but if you just focus on Greene County for a second. Greene County has a total acreage of 370,000 acres. To date, over the last 11 years, 75,000 of those acres have been developed. So the gas is being drained from 75,000 acres. At least 295,000 acres in Greene County alone that un-yet -- are, as of now, undrilled and undeveloped and undrained. That's about 80% of the acreage in Greene County still is available to produce gas. And one other stat for us and for Greene County, again, there's 370,000 acres. After the Rice transaction, EQT will control 212,000 of those acres. So 57% of the county will be under the control of EQT, where 80% of that is remaining to be drilled.

Both -- I mean -- EQT and Rice have been amongst the leaders in Appalachia in terms of developing the new techniques and technologies to improve recoveries. And the way that works is a lot of that is testing various ideas that the technical folks have. EQT engineers have certain ideas that we've tested.

So you can only test a certain number of ideas. So EQT's tested ideas we've had, Rice has tested ideas they've had, they're not necessarily the same ideas. So when we can get the databases and the technical teams together to review all of that data as one, there certainly will be best practices from both sides that can be combined to improve recoveries and lower costs. So it's hard to predict exactly what those techniques are at this point. We have to do the work and get the technical teams working on it. But not hard to imagine that there is going to be incremental value there. And it could be significant because it doesn't take much improvement in recovery to drive a significant amount of shareholder value. And then there's a list of 7 upside synergies you can see in our presentation. So I think there's plenty of upside. But the deal makes a ton of sense even if we don't get any of that, which won't happen."

First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued our third quarter earnings release, which can be accessed on our -- the Investor portion of our website, www.eqt.com. 
Included in the release are comments regarding EQT's pending acquisition of Rice Energy. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval. In connection with the proposed transaction, EQT has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transaction 
[Audio Gap] 
which registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC. The joint proxy statement/prospectus and other documents filed by EQT and Rice with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at EQT's website, www.eqt.com; or Rice's website, www.riceenergy.com, as applicable; or at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. 
You should review such materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information regarding the proposed transaction, including information about EQT and Rice and their respective directors, executive officers and employees who may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect to the proposed transaction and a description of their direct and indirect interests by security holdings or otherwise. The special meeting of EQT shareholders is scheduled to be held on November 9. Given investor focus on the transaction, we will keep our prepared remarks brief today in order to facilitate your questions. 
To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial number for that call is (201) 689-7817. 
In a moment, Rob will summarize the third quarter results and Steve will give a brief update. Following their prepared remarks, Steve, Rob, Dave and Jerry will be available to answer your questions. 
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs which are on file with SEC and on our website. 
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob McNally."

I will keep my comments on the quarter brief as it was a relatively clean and straightforward quarter and we expect there's more interest in some of the nonoperational topics. 
As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.12 compared to a $0.28 loss per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016. Net income and adjusted net income and EPS for the 3 months ended September 30, 2017, were favorably impacted by a decrease in the estimated effective annual income tax rate and discrete items totaling $29.7 million that resulted in an income tax benefit that added $0.17 to adjusted EPS this quarter. 
Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $205.9 million as compared to $166.5 million for the third quarter of 2016. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $82.1 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $78.1 million in the third quarter of 2016. 
So moving to production. Sales volumes were 205.1 Bcfe for the third quarter, representing a 5% increase over the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we experienced approximately 3.5 Bcfe of curtailments which were not expected. The curtailments resulted from outages on third-party systems. Despite this impact, third quarter production fell within the stated guidance range for the quarter. 
Additionally, given how close we are in timing to the Rice vote, we will not provide guidance for the fourth quarter, but we'll tell you that our full year 2017 volumes are on track with previously stated guidance. And we expect the EQT-only exit rate to be approximately 2.7 Bcfe per day. 
The third quarter 2017 realized price, including cash-settled derivatives, was $2.76 per Mcfe, a 26% increase compared to the third quarter of last year. Operating revenue for the production company totaled $597.7 million, which was $89.6 million higher than the third quarter of 2016. 
Total production operating expenses were $585.6 million for the quarter, which is 1% higher than the second quarter of 2017, which is consistent with the volume growth that we experienced. 
Moving on to pricing. Local basis was a bit weaker than we expected. However, a majority of our 2017 local basis exposure is locked in, resulting in a third quarter differential of negative $0.85 per Mcf, which was within our guidance range for the quarter. This differential represents a $0.21 decline over the second quarter of 2017 but it is a $0.36 improvement over the third quarter of 2016. 
Now moving on to midstream results. EQT gathering operating income was $85.8 million, $13.3 million higher than the third quarter of 2016. Operating revenue was $116.5 million, a $17.4 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. Operating expenses for the quarter were $30.7 million, a $4.1 million increase over the same period last year. 
EQT transmission operating income was $59.7 million, $6 million higher than third quarter of 2016. Operating revenues were $90.7 million, a $13.1 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. Operating expenses were $31 million for the quarter, which is a $7.1 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. 
I will close out my remarks by providing you with a brief liquidity update. As you may have seen, we successfully completed a bond offering at a blended coupon rate of 3.14%. This offering brought in $3 billion of proceeds that will be used together with previous cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance the cash portion of the acquisition, repay existing Rice indebtedness and redeem EQT bonds that are due in early 2018. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Steve."

Through this dialogue, we've listened to many opinions and heard many suggestions. Consistent with what we've always done, we take action when we feel it's in our shareholders' best interest. To that point, over the last few months, we've taken the following steps, all of which were driven by doing what's in the best interest of our shareholders. 
We committed to establishing a board committee to evaluate options for addressing the sum-of-the-parts discount. We committed to announcing the decision of that review by the end of the first quarter 2018. We committed to adding 2 new independent directors to the board with a focus on midstream experience. We committed to include these new directors on the committee tasked with the sum-of-the-parts review. We committed to moving the director nomination deadline to be after the sum-of-the-parts decision announcement. And lastly, we removed volume growth as a metric from future compensation plans and will replace it with return on capital and operating and development cost metrics. In short, we've listened to our shareholders and we've acted. 
Before opening the call to your questions, and since we are now 2 weeks away from the vote deadline, I do want to emphasize once again the merits of the Rice transaction. The primary driver of success in our industry is being the low-cost producer, and the most impactful way to drive per unit costs lower is through longer laterals. Establishing a dominant footprint of highly contiguous acreage that allows for sustained long lateral development is a real competitive advantage. This is what the Rice transaction creates for us. Our competitors may be able to replicate things like new drilling technology or new drilling techniques, but they can't replicate an acreage position that supports 12,000-foot laterals in the core of the Marcellus. 
While this is the main attribute of the transaction, there are many benefits of the transaction that create real value for our shareholders. The deal is 20% cash flow accretive in 2018 and 30% in 2019. It is accretive to NAV per share. We are confident in our ability to deliver the $2.5 billion of base synergy value and also deliver significant value from upside synergies. There are substantial midstream synergies to be realized. And lastly, our ability to address the sum of the parts in the most shareholder value-accretive way is enhanced by creating a more robust upstream and midstream business. 
In conclusion, we appreciate the dialogue that we've had with our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support, and we urge you to please vote for the Rice transaction on the white proxy card. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pat for Q&A."

So yes, we have disclosed that we expect between $100 million and $200 million per year for additional fill-in acreage to put these laterals together. That's actually consistent with what it already takes for us to achieve our roughly 8,000-foot lateral average today. So without Rice, we spend -- I think we spend about $140 million per year getting to 8,000 feet. We expect to continue to spend roughly that much to put together the 12,000-foot laterals with Rice. So that's just part of what we do, and we do it every day. We've got a large land department. It's the second-biggest department in the upstream company, second only to the field personnel, the operators. And they work every day putting the jigsaw puzzle together. That's what they do. So this is part and parcel of what we do every day, and that won't change with Rice. In fact, in a lot of ways, it will facilitate that work because it will be -- since we're -- the overlay with Rice is -- there's such a good overlay that we're frequently running into Rice when we're trying to fill in those holes. And if we have Rice consolidated with us, then picking up those missing pieces will likely be easier and perhaps even cheaper."

I just gave you one stat that supports that confidence, where we're going to come out of the gate above the average. And that's -- I think that's pretty remarkable, given that we have to re-permit all this. We have to get started from scratch. So high, high confidence. And I'll give you a couple other stats that maybe will relay some confidence, especially in contrast to some of the noise that's been out there. In Greene County, which is where the bulk of this acreage is -- there's lot in Washington, too, but if you just focus on Greene County for a second. Greene County has a total acreage of 370,000 acres. To date, over the last 11 years, 75,000 of those acres have been developed. So the gas is being drained from 75,000 acres. That leaves 295,000 acres in Greene County alone that are un-yet -- are, as of now, undrilled and undeveloped and undrained. That's about 80% of the acreage in Greene County still is available to produce gas. And one other stat for -- so for Greene County, again, there's 370,000 acres. After the Rice transaction, EQT will control 212,000 of those acres. So 57% of the county will be under the control of EQT, where 80% of that is remaining to be drilled. So there's lots of remaining inventory acreage. Tremendous amount of resource in place. So very, very confident in our ability to deliver on that synergy."

But I think you can look at most of those, and it's not hard to wrap your head around. There will be value created there. So obviously, purchasing power. We know when we contract for drilling and fracking services, the more work we offer, the better rates we get. With Rice, we'll be able to offer more work. So we'll get better prices. Both -- I mean -- EQT and Rice have been amongst the leaders in Appalachia in terms of developing the new techniques and technologies to improve recoveries. And the way that works is a lot of that is testing various ideas that the technical folks have. EQT engineers have certain ideas that we've tested. And the testing involves drilling a well, modifying a technique, getting the well in line, gathering production data over many months or a year to determine whether that new technique was effective or not. So you can only test a certain number of ideas. So EQT's tested ideas we've had. Rice has tested ideas they've had. They're not necessarily the same ideas. So when we can get the databases and the technical teams together to review all of that data as one, there certainly will be best practices from both sides that can be combined to improve recoveries and lower costs. So it's hard to predict exactly what those techniques are at this point. We have to do the work and get the technical teams working on it. But not hard to imagine that there is going to be incremental value there. And it could be significant because it doesn't take much improvement in recovery to drive a significant amount of shareholder value. And then there's a list of 7 upside synergies you can see in our presentation. So I think there's plenty of upside. But the deal makes a ton of sense even if we don't get any of that, which won't happen."

First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued our third quarter earnings release, which can be accessed on our -- the Investor portion of our website, www.eqt.com. 
Included in the release are comments regarding EQT's pending acquisition of Rice Energy. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval. In connection with the proposed transaction, EQT has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transaction 
[Audio Gap] 
which registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC. The joint proxy statement/prospectus and other documents filed by EQT and Rice with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at EQT's website, www.eqt.com; or Rice's website, www.riceenergy.com, as applicable; or at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. 
You should review such materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information regarding the proposed transaction, including information about EQT and Rice and their respective directors, executive officers and employees who may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect to the proposed transaction and a description of their direct and indirect interests by security holdings or otherwise. The special meeting of EQT shareholders is scheduled to be held on November 9. Given investor focus on the transaction, we will keep our prepared remarks brief today in order to facilitate your questions. 
To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial number for that call is (201) 689-7817. 
In a moment, Rob will summarize the third quarter results and Steve will give a brief update. Following their prepared remarks, Steve, Rob, Dave and Jerry will be available to answer your questions. 
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs which are on file with SEC and on our website. 
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob McNally."

I will keep my comments on the quarter brief as it was a relatively clean and straightforward quarter and we expect there's more interest in some of the nonoperational topics. 
As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.12 compared to a $0.28 loss per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016. Net income and adjusted net income and EPS for the 3 months ended September 30, 2017, were favorably impacted by a decrease in the estimated effective annual income tax rate and discrete items totaling $29.7 million that resulted in an income tax benefit that added $0.17 to adjusted EPS this quarter. 
Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $205.9 million as compared to $166.5 million for the third quarter of 2016. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $82.1 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $78.1 million in the third quarter of 2016. 
So moving to production. Sales volumes were 205.1 Bcfe for the third quarter, representing a 5% increase over the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we experienced approximately 3.5 Bcfe of curtailments which were not expected. The curtailments resulted from outages on third-party systems. Despite this impact, third quarter production fell within the stated guidance range for the quarter. 
Additionally, given how close we are in timing to the Rice vote, we will not provide guidance for the fourth quarter, but we'll tell you that our full year 2017 volumes are on track with previously stated guidance. And we expect the EQT-only exit rate to be approximately 2.7 Bcfe per day. 
The third quarter 2017 realized price, including cash-settled derivatives, was $2.76 per Mcfe, a 26% increase compared to the third quarter of last year. Operating revenue for the production company totaled $597.7 million, which was $89.6 million higher than the third quarter of 2016. 
Total production operating expenses were $585.6 million for the quarter, which is 1% higher than the second quarter of 2017, which is consistent with the volume growth that we experienced. 
Moving on to pricing. Local basis was a bit weaker than we expected. However, a majority of our 2017 local basis exposure is locked in, resulting in a third quarter differential of negative $0.85 per Mcf, which was within our guidance range for the quarter. This differential represents a $0.21 decline over the second quarter of 2017 but it is a $0.36 improvement over the third quarter of 2016. 
Now moving on to midstream results. EQT gathering operating income was $85.8 million, $13.3 million higher than the third quarter of 2016. Operating revenue was $116.5 million, a $17.4 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. Operating expenses for the quarter were $30.7 million, a $4.1 million increase over the same period last year. 
EQT transmission operating income was $59.7 million, $6 million higher than third quarter of 2016. Operating revenues were $90.7 million, a $13.1 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. Operating expenses were $31 million for the quarter, which is a $7.1 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. 
I will close out my remarks by providing you with a brief liquidity update. As you may have seen, we successfully completed a bond offering at a blended coupon rate of 3.14%. This offering brought in $3 billion of proceeds that will be used together with previous cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance the cash portion of the acquisition, repay existing Rice indebtedness and redeem EQT bonds that are due in early 2018. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Steve."

Through this dialogue, we've listened to many opinions and heard many suggestions. Consistent with what we've always done, we take action when we feel it's in our shareholders' best interest. To that point, over the last few months, we've taken the following steps, all of which were driven by doing what's in the best interest of our shareholders. 
We committed to establishing a board committee to evaluate options for addressing the sum-of-the-parts discount. We committed to announcing the decision of that review by the end of the first quarter 2018. We committed to adding 2 new independent directors to the board with a focus on midstream experience. We committed to include these new directors on the committee tasked with the sum-of-the-parts review. We committed to moving the director nomination deadline to be after the sum-of-the-parts decision announcement. And lastly, we removed volume growth as a metric from future compensation plans and will replace it with return on capital and operating and development cost metrics. In short, we've listened to our shareholders and we've acted. 
Before opening the call to your questions, and since we are now 2 weeks away from the vote deadline, I do want to emphasize once again the merits of the Rice transaction. The primary driver of success in our industry is being the low-cost producer, and the most impactful way to drive per unit costs lower is through longer laterals. Establishing a dominant footprint of highly contiguous acreage that allows for sustained long lateral development is a real competitive advantage. This is what the Rice transaction creates for us. Our competitors may be able to replicate things like new drilling technology or new drilling techniques, but they can't replicate an acreage position that supports 12,000-foot laterals in the core of the Marcellus. 
While this is the main attribute of the transaction, there are many benefits of the transaction that create real value for our shareholders. The deal is 20% cash flow accretive in 2018 and 30% in 2019. It is accretive to NAV per share. We are confident in our ability to deliver the $2.5 billion of base synergy value and also deliver significant value from upside synergies. There are substantial midstream synergies to be realized. And lastly, our ability to address the sum of the parts in the most shareholder value-accretive way is enhanced by creating a more robust upstream and midstream business. 
In conclusion, we appreciate the dialogue that we've had with our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support, and we urge you to please vote for the Rice transaction on the white proxy card. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pat for Q&A."

So yes, we have disclosed that we expect between $100 million and $200 million per year for additional fill-in acreage to put these laterals together. That's actually consistent with what it already takes for us to achieve our roughly 8,000-foot lateral average today. So without Rice, we spend -- I think we spend about $140 million per year getting to 8,000 feet. We expect to continue to spend roughly that much to put together the 12,000-foot laterals with Rice. So that's just part of what we do, and we do it every day. We've got a large land department. It's the second-biggest department in the upstream company, second only to the field personnel, the operators. And they work every day putting the jigsaw puzzle together. That's what they do. So this is part and parcel of what we do every day, and that won't change with Rice. In fact, in a lot of ways, it will facilitate that work because it will be -- since we're -- the overlay with Rice is -- there's such a good overlay that we're frequently running into Rice when we're trying to fill in those holes. And if we have Rice consolidated with us, then picking up those missing pieces will likely be easier and perhaps even cheaper."

I will say, with Rice, it's much more achievable than without Rice. Without Rice and without the improved cost structure, the ability to do that, it's still there, but the growth rates will be less attractive because we'll have to spend more money to get the same growth rate than we would with the Rice transaction because of all of the benefits we've talked about. So I think conceptually, it is the right direction for EQT, and frankly, the entire industry. I hope others go that direction as well. And that seems to be gaining traction, so I think others are talking about that and contemplating it. But again, it's much more doable and it will be much more attractive with Rice than without Rice."

I just gave you one stat that supports that confidence, where we're going to come out of the gate above the average. And that's -- I think that's pretty remarkable, given that we have to re-permit all this. We have to get started from scratch. So high, high confidence. And I'll give you a couple other stats that maybe will relay some confidence, especially in contrast to some of the noise that's been out there. In Greene County, which is where the bulk of this acreage is -- there's lot in Washington, too, but if you just focus on Greene County for a second. Greene County has a total acreage of 370,000 acres. To date, over the last 11 years, 75,000 of those acres have been developed. So the gas is being drained from 75,000 acres. That leaves 295,000 acres in Greene County alone that are un-yet -- are, as of now, undrilled and undeveloped and undrained. That's about 80% of the acreage in Greene County still is available to produce gas. And one other stat for -- so for Greene County, again, there's 370,000 acres. After the Rice transaction, EQT will control 212,000 of those acres. So 57% of the county will be under the control of EQT, where 80% of that is remaining to be drilled. So there's lots of remaining inventory acreage. Tremendous amount of resource in place. So very, very confident in our ability to deliver on that synergy."

But I think you can look at most of those, and it's not hard to wrap your head around. There will be value created there. So obviously, purchasing power. We know when we contract for drilling and fracking services, the more work we offer, the better rates we get. With Rice, we'll be able to offer more work. So we'll get better prices. Both -- I mean -- EQT and Rice have been amongst the leaders in Appalachia in terms of developing the new techniques and technologies to improve recoveries. And the way that works is a lot of that is testing various ideas that the technical folks have. EQT engineers have certain ideas that we've tested. And the testing involves drilling a well, modifying a technique, getting the well in line, gathering production data over many months or a year to determine whether that new technique was effective or not. So you can only test a certain number of ideas. So EQT's tested ideas we've had. Rice has tested ideas they've had. They're not necessarily the same ideas. So when we can get the databases and the technical teams together to review all of that data as one, there certainly will be best practices from both sides that can be combined to improve recoveries and lower costs. So it's hard to predict exactly what those techniques are at this point. We have to do the work and get the technical teams working on it. But not hard to imagine that there is going to be incremental value there. And it could be significant because it doesn't take much improvement in recovery to drive a significant amount of shareholder value. And then there's a list of 7 upside synergies you can see in our presentation. So I think there's plenty of upside. But the deal makes a ton of sense even if we don't get any of that, which won't happen."
