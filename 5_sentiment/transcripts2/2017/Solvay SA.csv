Thanks, everyone, to participate in our call. I know that this is a busy day within a busy week, but we are pleased to report to you what we think are a strong results to finish the year 2016, so I'm here with Karim, our CFO; and Kimberly, in charge of IR. And I will try to give you with Karim in as shorter time as possible to be leave enough time for question and try to give you the headlines on these results. 
So again, I think a strong year where we've been delivered on our priorities. Maybe start off with transformation, we have finalized our exit from PVC businesses. We started this project 3 years ago. It has been, in some cases, a long and complex project, but along the year, we have finalized our exit from INOVYN, so we are not anymore in PVC Europe. We have finalized the -- on December 27 for exit from, a rough and complex ride due to some regulatory issues with antitrust authorities, which have delayed this project. And , we are -- it was a quick process we've announced it in November. And as you've probably seen, we've closed this process, the divestiture yesterday. So we are not anymore in PVC, with one exception, with , our 50-50 JV with North Shore, performing today, we are in good cash cost position, and the business that will continue to operate for the foreseeable future. We have also in terms of portfolio announced the agreement to sell Acetow business to Blackstone. We expect to close this transaction in the first half of 2017, leaving a good business, but with limited growth prospect, and which was not anymore in line with our whole strategy.
On the acquisition side, 2016 was the year of the integration. Cytec is today fully integrated into Solvay quickly and very effective as far as the synergy generation is concerned, we are significantly above our initial synergy target. We'll continue to work on the transformation of our portfolio. And what's important to keep in mind is that transformation of the portfolio is also bringing a transformation in our customer, the least customer profile. Our key customers today are dramatically different from those of 5 years ago. And we are, indeed, usually in a very unique position of being a sole supplier of large blue-chip companies on their most important development project.
Going to the results. 
Q4 was, indeed, a quarter where we've seen a return to volume growth, less pronounced seasonality than what we've seen at the end of 2015. Good growth across many diverse market, including agro, auto, consumer and healthcare. Smart devices and in oil and gas, although we still see a negative comparison with Q4 of 2015, sequentially, with the increase in the oil price and with the increase in exploration and production activities in North America, we see a sequential significant improvement year-on-year.
So full year EBITDA growth of 7.5%, in line with our initial guidance and our midterm strategic roadmap. Strong pricing power. We have 3 years of strong pricing power, overall, an impact of pricing power, which is in excess of EUR 400 million during this full year, so -- and this illustrates the strength of our position, which allows us in inflationary or deflationary energy and home material environment to continue to expand our margin, leading us in 2016 with a record 21% EBITDA margin. That's a company record, that's very good in comparison with our European and even North American peers, and this is again a consequence the quality of our portfolio. Cytec synergies, I was mentioning it, EUR 70 million year-to-date, EUR 25 million in the last quarter, with means a run rate of EUR 100 million. Very strong. I'll remind you that when we first presented this project in July 2015, we were targeting EUR 100 million synergies in 2018, so we are significantly ahead of our expectation. Momentum continues in excellence program. We continued to deliver significantly in all these improvement programs, which cover, the group, both in terms of geographic business, but also functional activities, manufacturing, commercial supply chain. We are actively developing literally hundred of action plans, allowing us to bring in 2016 more than EUR 200 million of contribution to our EBITDA. On the last 3 years, we have a total of around EUR 1 billion of impact, which is again significantly ahead of our initial expectation.
This year was also a year of a strong cash generation. Free cash flow at EUR 866 million. This is clearly the consequence of a clear focus on cash generation, again, in line with what we have shared with you along the year and especially at our Capital Market Day in September. If we look at continuing operation, which means if we exclude Chemlogics Vinythai, we have generated EUR 736 million of free cash flow.
Maybe just a word on non-financial performance. We are communicating, not just on financial indicators, but also on some nonfinancial indicators. Probably, the headline there in 2016 is a 19% reduction in greenhouse gases emission intensity. That's the impact of our portfolio transformation, but also the impact of a strong focus on energy optimization, energy mix. We want indeed to continue to drive our CO2 intensity down, and this year was a benchmark or at least a milestone in terms of reducing CO2 intensity.
So a year in which we have continued to execute our strategy, and we were able to overcome a number of headwinds, especially in Advanced Materials with the smart device segment, advance formulation with the advance formulation with the North American oil and gas environment. And I think that these good result despite this headwind reflects the strength of our multi-specialty portfolio and our business model.
Karim, can you give us a bit more insight on our financial results? And I will then conclude with a few comments."

As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis, and I am going to refer to a few slides that are available on our website. Before I get into this, I just want to clarify for the avoidance of any",1042,"Of course. thank you, Jean-Pierre. As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis, and I am going to refer to a few slides that are available on our website. 
Before I get into this, I just want to clarify for the avoidance of any doubt that the comparators we're using are those that are restated for the fact that Acetow and Vinythai are treated as discontinued operations.
Let's start with sales on Slide #13. 
The facts are, sales are down 5% for the full year. Overall volumes are flat, with solid growth in important market such as automotive, consumer goods, semiconductors, agro, home and personal care. And that helped to offset the headwinds that Jean-Pierre talked about in oil and gas, smart devices and aerospace. Prices are down 2.3% in a deflationary environment with lower raw material process being passed through to customers, primarily in Polyamide. Plus, there's been some market pressure, which is totally understandable in oil and gas and in Latin America as well.
But let's talk about EBITDA on Page 14, Slide 14. 
Jean-Pierre did indicate the 7.5%, and the record margin of 21%. A few points I'd like to highlight in overall terms. There is strong momentum in terms of excellence and synergies, and that shows itself in 2 particular respects. Our access program, you see that the contribution to the positive pricing power. But also, on fixed costs, the fact that our fixed costs are down EUR 61 million despite inflationary cost increases of over EUR 8[ph] million, it's estimated a real focus on cost discipline and excellence. Clearly, as you know as well that we hedge the majority of our net transaction foreign exchange 9 months forward, and that contributed about EUR 110 million to our bottom line in 2016. 
Now if we turn to each of the key segments. 
Advanced Materials increased 3%. Margins expanded 2% to 26%. Specialty Polymers stands out a very strong performance, with growth in automotive, batteries, consumer goods, healthcare, outpacing quite a marked slowdown, lower demand in smart devices. Composites, as you know, has faced a declining build rates in wide-body platforms. There were inventory adjustments which put pressure on the segment. The market now seems to have stabilized. Special delivered double-digit growth, with good momentum in automotive catalysts, semiconductors, with growth in silica was unfortunately masked by the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.
Advanced Formulations, sales are down, EBITDA is down 7%, but margins were largely stable at 18%. That to my mind is worth noting in particular, because it represents the variable of fixed costs in that segment. As another example on this focus on the bottom line delivery. As we know, oil and gas was under pressure throughout most of the year, but we did see a sequential improvement in Q4 against Q3, indicating that our activity is starting to increase following the high your rig counts that we have been noticing for a while now. There was good growth in other care markets: agro, coatings, other industrial standout, and that helped to partially mitigate and offset the decline in oil and gas. Technology Solutions, a leading business in mining remains resilient and finished the year quite neutral despite the significant headwinds facing the industry.
Performance Chemicals advanced by 11%. Its margins achieved a new record at 28%. What did we see? We saw soda ash really going from strength to strength. Bicarbonate in 2016, which had double-digit growth, supported in part, by the new plant. And there was good demand for soda ash, which was very much in line with the previous year as well. Peroxide performed well and it benefited from volume growth within new plants in China as well.
Operational excellence really stands out as the key contributor to our performance, and that is something which really helps to preserve our leadership positions and at least in terms of the industry cost curves, very, very strong positions.
Looking forward, we do see limited impact from new capacities in 2017, although, clearly, one[ph] expect margin pressures stemming from not least from increasing energy costs. Functional Polymers was a very strong performer when you see a 57% increase in EBITDA, when you see a margin expansion from 9.5% to 15% in the space of one year. As you would expect, Polyamide led that strength, led that growth, in volume growth particularly in automotive and industrial applications, but also, as you know, that growth was supplemented and really underpinned by a very, very strong focus and delivery in operational excellence.
Corporate costs, you won't be surprised to see that they were down 5% and that simply is the fact that we are determined to maintain cost discipline and deliver those synergies, and that helped to obviously overcome inflation.
Now turning to net income on Slide 15. There is little to really highlight other than the fact that net income has progressed by 10%, aided by the fact that our effective tax rate is down from 32% to 28.5%. The other aspect is, clearly, as to why that improvement in tax is driven largely by the evolution in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings.
Cash. Jean-Pierre has given you the headlines of our cash generation. And on Slide 16, you'll see the bridge and the key components of that. I won't repeat what Jean-Pierre said, but I will highlight 2 or 3 things. One, the driver of the cash have high-quality behind them because they come from strong profits, low CapEx and an unrelenting focus on working capital. Those 3 coincide to generate that. And this EUR 76 million compared with EUR 492 million last year, and it's fair to say it's at the top end of our expectations. Nevertheless, that cash more than offset clearly all funding costs, dividend and interest by nearly EUR 200 million. However, adverse movements in foreign exchange meant that our net debt did not fall down largely because of the impact of dollar, the Venezuelan currency and Brazilian real and the impact of our debt. So net-net, we have a very strong balance sheet, a very strong cash flow performance, and the quality is there to stay. 
And with that, Jean-Pierre, I hand back to you."

So maybe just to conclude, a word on sustainability indicators that you see on Slide 11. Just to confirm that, indeed, we are willing in the next 2 years, as we did during the Capital Market Day when we are sitting midterm objectives, we are willing to continue to follow what we do on various metrics. I already mentioned the intensity where we see indeed a meaningful reduction in '16 due to portfolio movement, but also the continuity to optimize energy consumption and CO2 emission. A meaningful increase in sustainable solutions, which we present today, 43% of our portfolio. Safety, a bit of a disappointment. We have a stable performance, at a good level, but stable. And as far as safety is concerned, you want to be stable, you want to be improving. And a slight improvement also in employee engagement. So again, you should count on us to continue to follow on these indicators.
Looking into 2017, and our priorities, we'll continue to upgrade the quality of the portfolio. Indeed, the work is not finished there, although we have accomplished some significant project during 2016. We are willing to deliver a volume growth on -- especially on our [indiscernible], it will be a bit of a different year than what we have seen in 2016. We expect the headwinds that we've seen in some segments like smart devices on North America, oil and gas turning. And we continued to expect significant growth coming from automotive, electronics of IO space. And in other businesses, just to mentioned one of them, peroxide, we will -- we expect our new capacity to actually start up during the first half of the year, and this will be another opportunity for us to generate volume growth.
Based on this, our current estimate is that we should be able to generate a mid-single digit EBITDA growth for the full year, mostly driven by Advanced Material and advanced formulation. Focus on cash will will continue to be a priority for us, as Karim mentioned. Our target and continuing operations will be to generate more than EUR 800 million of cash compared to EUR 736 million this year. And this again means that we'll continue to have a very disciplined approach to CapEx. This will provide us more opportunity to reduce our debt profile going forward. All of this very much in line with the strategic roadmap that we have announced during our Capital Market Day, and we feel very confident that until 2018, we have all the components in place to deliver on the various objectives that we have shared with you a few months ago.
Maybe just the final word to -- regarding dividend. Just to say that our board yesterday decided to recommend to a shareholder meeting in May a dividend increase of 4.5% to EUR 3.45 per share. This is both the results of our strong delivery in terms of EBITDA and cash in 2016, but also, our confidence that we will be able to continue growth and that we are confident in our ability to create more sustainable value for our shareholder.
With that, I will open the Q&A session."

And then -- and how -- that's the first question. The second question is around your outlook statement. So on your guidance, you were saying mid-single-digit EBITDA growth, which, broadly speaking, on the basis, just north of EUR 100 million. You guide to CapEx down of around EUR 100 million as well year-on-year. And so that gives me free cash flow increase, I think, of EUR 200 million, and yet you're guiding to free cash flow up only EUR 100 million. So I'm wondering if you can help me understand that dynamic and what I'm missing in that calculation."

On the -- on your first question, I mean well, it's not easy to follow a strategic quarter after quarter, but I think that where we are doing is rather simple. We want a portfolio made of 3 components, 2 strong growth engines, Advanced Materials and advanced formulation. There, I don't expect to see a much transformation, just a strengthening of our positions in the next year, probably a stronger delivery of topline synergies linked to the Cytec integration. We focus very much, and you will certainly understand why on cost synergies that we have delivered in a very quick and effective way, so the next challenge for us is to make sure that the synergies are coming. Then we have a third group of businesses where we want to have a long-term sustainable cash generators at sensible time that we several times that we that the soda ash antioxide are the 2 key strong long-term sustainable cash generators, then we still have some movement to do to deal with other situations. I mean, there are a number of strategic projects open, let's see how quickly we can conclude them."

That's my first question on EBITDA guidance. A second question on cash flow, just to come back to Thomas question. I get the lower CapEx benefit and the higher EBITDA benefit. Karim, I think you just mentioned there higher cash taxes. Would you expect the same cash tax rate, or is that also going up?

Our current view is that, indeed, the EBITDA growth next year will be coming from volume growth and mostly from the Advanced Materials and advanced formulation cluster. In terms of pricing power, after this very long sequence of positive pricing power, I would probably say that we expect a modest contribution, but I can tell you that we will continue to make sure that our teams focus on that. And in terms of fixed costs, some of the new units, I was mentioning, earning cost will start to impact our P&L, so we'll see some impact there. Cytec synergies will continue, but clearly, the big contribution was this year[ph]. And in term of foreign exchange, we are not very original or very creative. I mean we have used the 1 10 as the reference which was more or less the current rate when we launched our process project, so maybe a slight benefit in today's condition, but certainly not something we want to build on."

We are doing a lot of things regarding CapEx excellence within the group, which is really, one, making sure that we support the right project. Second, making sure that we make the most out of every euro that we are investing. And I have to say that we are starting also to give a special attention to the small project, which at the end of the day will present a significant part of the EUR 800 million envelopes, which are done at the -- decided at the business level, done at -- executed at plant level. We think that there are opportunities to do this a little bit better. But again, we have very well invested in past 3 years. We have seen a number of projects starting up, ramping up. Some of them were a little bit delayed like, which is unfortunate because it was kind of the largest CapEx project over the last few years. But again, the feeling that we have now enough runway to be able to operate with this EUR 800 million. And just to mention to projects that we are about to start and probably other right point of time, accelerated polymer plants in China, PDF, really clearly at the right point in time because this a product used for battery and the battery market in China is continuing to grow very significantly.

Still a number of issues, I don't want to comment. You can read the news, but we see our customers still having difficulties to bring the new platform up to the expected production level. But overall, improving. And the second element was a bit of a destocking within the supply chain. People being a little bit worried of because the production right, we are not of the expected levels, so we have suffered from the -- from the impact of both on production rate declining, but also supply chain squeezing a little bit inventories. We think that we are starting the year in better conditions. Run rates are more predictable, more stable. And the supply chain has done its safe routes regarding inventory. That's why are are more optimistic regarding the development. Although I still see a situation where we will see gradual improvement in composite along the year. Smart devices, you know that we are very dependent on one customer, which is good, but we are also dependent on their own product cycle. Yes, the situation has stabilized. We have seen less volatility last year. We are seeing opportunities in front of us with new products about to be launched, will be launched during 2017, so clearly, smart devices should be a segment bringing some growth opportunities for us."

And Secondly, can you tell us what the margin would have been in functional polymers if you'd strip out the contribution from RusVinyl, which obviously has an impact on the EBITDA, but not the revenue line? And whether that year-on-year improvement would have been same. And then, finally, can you remind us how your accounting into the plants in?

Second, I think what we have to take into account is the fact that we don't expect growth neither in Performance Chemicals nor in functional polymer. It's really where we've based. And if you do a high single-digit growth on the Advanced Material and advanced formulation cluster, you end up there's no growth rate of the portfolio, you end up with this 5%. So what you really have to keep in mind is that the contribution of the various segments will be very different next year in 2017 than it was last year. On Performance Chemicals, and it's linked to your question on soda ash, we are starting to see activities coming from new activities, I should say, coming from Turkey, so we -- the project is materializing. This being said, we expect a flat to slightly growing performance of the segment, which means that the -- what's happening in peroxide, with the start up of Sadara and the full impact of a Chinese -- the new Chinese capacity, should lead us to, again, a stable to slightly growing performance on the cluster. So European contract in soda ash, mostly done, a very small decrease in prices compensated by operational excellence, overall, I would say, a good situation to start.

We have finalized the -- on December 27 our exit from Indupa, a rough and complex ride due to some regulatory issues with antitrust authorities, which have delayed this project. And Vinythai, we -- it was a quick process. We've announced it in November, and as you've probably seen, we've closed this process, the divestiture, yesterday. So we are not anymore in PVC, with one exception, RusVinyl, our 50-50 JV with Sibur in Russia. Performing well today; we are in good cash cost position, and it's a business that we will continue to operate for the foreseeable future. We have also in terms of portfolio announced the agreement to sell Acetow business to Blackstone. We expect to close this transaction in the first half of 2017, leaving a good business, but with limited growth prospect, and which was not anymore in line with our core strategy.
On the acquisition side, 2016 was the year of the Cytec integration. Cytec is today fully integrated into Solvay, quickly and very effective as far as the synergy generation is concerned. We are significantly above our initial synergy target. We'll continue to work on the transformation of our portfolio. And what's important to keep in mind is that this transformation of the portfolio is also bringing a transformation in our customer, list [ph] customer profile. Our key customers today are dramatically different from those of 5 years ago. And we are, indeed, usually in a very unique position of being a sole supplier of large blue-chip companies on their most important development project.
Going to the results. 
Q4 was, indeed, a quarter where we've seen a return to volume growth, less pronounced seasonality than what we've seen at the end of 2015. Good growth across many diverse market, including agro, auto, consumer and health care, smart devices. And in oil and gas, although we still see a negative comparison with Q4 of 2015, sequentially, with the increase in the oil price and with the increase in exploration and production activities in North America, we see a sequential significant improvement year-on-year.
So full year EBITDA growth of 7.5%, in line with our initial guidance and our midterm strategic road map. Strong pricing power. We have 3 years of positive pricing power, overall, an impact of pricing power which is in excess of EUR 400 million during this full year, so -- and this illustrates the strength of our position, which allows us in inflationary or deflationary energy and home material environment to continue to expand our margin, leading us in 2016 with a record 21% EBITDA margin. That's a company record that's very good in comparison with our European and even North American peers, and this is again a consequence of the quality of our portfolio. Cytec synergies, I was mentioning it, EUR 70 million year-to-date, EUR 25 million in the last quarter, which means a run rate of EUR 100 million. Very strong. I'll remind you that when we first presented this project in July 2015, we were targeting EUR 100 million synergies in 2018. So we are significantly ahead of our expectation. 
Momentum continues in excellence program. We continued to deliver significantly in all these improvement programs, which cover, the group, both in terms of geographic businesses, but also functional activities, manufacturing, commercial supply chain. We're actually developing literally hundred of action plans, allowing us to bring in 2016 more than EUR 200 million of contribution to our EBITDA. On the last 3 years, we have a total of around EUR 1 billion of impact, which is again significantly ahead of our initial expectation.
This year was also a year of strong cash generation. Free cash flow at EUR 866 million (sic) [ EUR 876 million ]. This is clearly the consequence of a clear focus on cash generation, again, in line with what we have shared with you along the year and especially at our Capital Market Day in September. If we look at continuing operation, which means if we exclude Acetow and Vinythai, we have generated EUR 736 million of free cash flow.
Maybe just a word on nonfinancial performance. We are communicating not just on financial indicators, but also on some nonfinancial indicators. Probably, the headline there in 2016 is a 19% reduction in greenhouse gases emission intensity. That's the impact of our portfolio transformation, but also the impact of a strong focus on energy optimization, energy mix. We want, indeed, to continue to drive our CO2 intensity down, and this year was a benchmark or at least a milestone in terms of reducing CO2 intensity.
So a year in which we have continued to execute our strategy, and we were able to overcome a number of headwinds, especially in Advanced Materials with the smart device segment; Advanced Formulation with the North American oil and gas environment. And I think that these good results, despite this headwind, reflects the strength of our multi-specialty portfolio and our business model.
Karim, can you give us a bit more insight on our financial results? And I will then conclude with a few comments."

As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis, and I am going to refer to a few slides that are available on our website. 
Before I get into this, I just want to clarify for the avoidance of any doubt that the comparators we're using are those that are restated for the fact that Acetow and Vinythai are treated as discontinued operations.
Let's start with sales on Slide #13. 
The facts are quite [ph] -- sales are down 5% for the full year. Overall volumes are flat, with solid growth in important markets such as automotive, consumer goods, semiconductors, agro, home and personal care. And that helped to offset the headwinds that Jean-Pierre talked about in the oil and gas, smart devices and aerospace. Prices are down 2.3% in a deflationary environment, with lower raw material prices being partially passed through to customers, primarily in Polyamide. Plus, there's been some market pressure, which is totally understandable in oil and gas and on businesses in Latin America as well.
But let's talk about EBITDA on Page 14, Slide 14. 
Jean-Pierre did indicate the 7.5%, and the record margin of 21%. A few points I'd like to highlight in overall terms. There is strong momentum in terms of excellence and synergies, and that shows itself in 2 particular respects. On excellence programs, you see that's a contribution to the positive pricing power, but also on fixed costs. The fact that our fixed costs are down EUR 61 million despite inflationary cost increases of over EUR 8 [ph] million, is testament to the real focus on cost discipline and excellence. Clearly, as you know as well that we hedged the majority of our net transaction foreign exchange 9 months forward, and that contributed about EUR 110 million to our bottom line in 2016. 
Now if we turn to each of the key segments. 
Advanced Materials increased 3%. Margins expanded 2% to 26%. Specialty Polymers stands out with a very strong performance, with growth in automotive, batteries, consumer goods, health care, outpacing quite a marked slowdown, a lower demand in smart devices. Composites, as you know, was faced with declining build rates in wide-body platforms. There were inventory adjustments which put pressure on the segment. The market now seems to have stabilized. Special Chem delivered double-digit growth, with good momentum in automotive catalysts, semiconductors; whereas, growth in Silica was unfortunately masked by the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.
Advanced Formulations. Sales are down, EBITDA is down 7%, but margins were largely stable at 18%. That, to my mind, is worth noting in particular because that represents the variabilization of fixed costs in that segment as another example of this focus on the bottom line delivery. As we know, oil and gas was under pressure throughout most of the year, but we did see a sequential improvement in Q4 against Q3, indicating that our activity is starting to increase following the higher rig counts that we've been noticing for a while now. There was good growth in other Novecare markets: agro, coatings and other industrial stand out, and that helped to partially mitigate and offset the decline in oil and gas., Technology Solutions, a leading business in mining, remained resilient and finished the year quite neutral despite the significant headwinds facing the industry that it serves.
Performance Chemicals advanced by 11%. Its margins achieved a new record at 28%. What did we see? We saw soda ash really going from strength to strength, specifically in bicarbonate in 2016, which had double-digit growth, supported in part by the new Thailand plant. And there is good demand for soda ash, which was very much in line with the previous year as well. Peroxides performed well and it benefited from volume growth with the new plants in China as well.
Operational excellence really stands out as the key contributor to our performance, and that is something which really helps to preserve our leadership positions and at least in terms of the industry cost curves, very, very strong positions.
Looking forward, we do see limited impact from new capacities in 2017, although, clearly, one expects some margin pressures stemming not least from increasing energy costs. Functional Polymers was a very strong performer when you see a 57% increase in EBITDA, when you see a margin expansion from 9.5% to 15% in the space of 1 year. As you'd expect, Polyamide led that strength, led that growth, with volume growth particularly in automotive and industrial applications. But also, as you know, that growth was supplemented and really underpinned by a very, very strong focus and delivery in operational excellence.
Corporate costs, you won't be surprised to see that they were down 5%, and that simply is the fact that we're determined to maintain cost discipline and deliver those synergies. And that helped to, obviously, overcome inflation.
Now turning to net income on Slide 15. There's little to really highlight other than the fact that net income has progressed by 10%, aided by the fact that our effective tax rate is down from 32% to 28.5%. The other aspect is, clearly, as to why that improvement in tax is driven largely by the evolution in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings.
Cash. Jean-Pierre has given you the headlines of our cash generation. And on Slide 16, you'll see the bridge and the key components of that. I won't repeat what Jean-Pierre said, but I will highlight 2 or 3 things. One, the driver of the cash have high quality behind them because they come from strong profits, low CapEx and an unrelenting focus on working capital. Those 3 coincide to generate that. And the EUR 876 million compares with EUR 492 million last year, and it's fair to say it's at the top end of our expectations. Nevertheless, that cash more than offset clearly all funding costs, dividend and interest, by nearly EUR 200 million. However, adverse movements in foreign exchange meant that our net debt did not fall down largely because of the impact of dollar, the Venezuelan currency and Brazilian real and the impact of our debt. So net-net, we have a very strong balance sheet, a very strong cash flow performance, and the quality is there to stay. 
And with that, Jean-Pierre, I hand it back to you."

So maybe just to conclude, a word on our sustainability indicators that you see on Slide 11. Just to confirm that, indeed, we are willing in the next 2 years, as we did during the Capital Market Day when we were setting our midterm objectives, we are willing to continue to follow up with you on various metrics. I already mentioned greenhouse gases intensity, where we see indeed a meaningful reduction in '16 due to portfolio movement, but also the continuous effort to optimize energy consumption and CO2 emission. A meaningful increase in sustainable solutions, which represent today 43% of our portfolio. Safety, a bit of a disappointment. We have a stable performance, at a good level, but stable. And as far as safety is concerned, you don't want to be stable, you want to be improving. And there's slight improvement also in employee engagement. So again, you should count on us to continue to follow on these indicators.
Looking into 2017 and our priorities. We'll continue to upgrade the quality of the portfolio. Indeed, the work is not finished there, although we have accomplished some significant project during 2016. We are willing to deliver a volume growth on -- especially on our core [indiscernible], it will be a bit of a different year than what we've seen in 2016. We expect the headwinds that we've seen in some segments like smart devices on North American oil and gas turning. And we continue to expect significant growth coming from automotive, electronics of I/O space. And in other businesses, just to mention one of them, peroxide, we will -- we expect our new Sadara capacity to actually start up during the first half of the year, and this will be another opportunity for us to generate volume growth.
Based on this, our current estimate is that we should be able to generate a mid-single digit EBITDA growth for the full year, mostly driven by Advanced Material and Advanced Formulation. Focus on cash will continue to be a priority for us, as Karim mentioned. Our target on continuing operations will be to generate more than EUR 800 million of cash compared to EUR 736 million this year. And this, again, means that we continue to have a very disciplined approach to CapEx. This will provide us more opportunity to reduce our debt profile going forward. All of this very much in line with the strategic road map that we have announced during our Capital Market Day, and we feel very confident that until 2018, we have all the components in place to deliver on the various objectives that we have shared with you a few months ago.
Maybe just a final word to -- regarding dividend. Just to say that our board yesterday decided to recommend to the Shareholder Meeting in May a dividend increase of 4.5% to EUR 3.45 per share. This is both the results of our strong delivery in terms of EBITDA and cash in 2016, but also our confidence that we will be able to continue growth and that we are confident in our ability to create more sustainable value for our shareholder.
With that, I will open the Q&A session."

And how -- that's the first question. The second question is around your outlook statement. So on your guidance, you were saying mid-single-digit EBITDA growth, which, broadly speaking, on the basis just north of EUR 100 million. You guide to CapEx down of around EUR 100 million as well year-on-year. And so that gives me free cash flow increase, I think, of EUR 200 million, and yet you're guiding to free cash flow up only EUR 100 million. So I'm wondering if you can help me understand that dynamic and what I'm missing in that calculation."

On the -- on your first question, I mean -- well, it's not easy to follow our strategic progress quarter-after-quarter, but I think that where we are going is rather simple. We want a portfolio made of 3 components, 2 strong growth engines, Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulation. There, I don't expect to see much transformation, just a strengthening of our positions in the next year, probably a stronger delivery of top line synergies linked to the Cytec integration. We focus very much, and you will certainly understand why, on cost synergies that we have delivered in a very quick and effective way, so the next challenge for us is to make sure that the top line synergies are coming. Then we have a third group of businesses where we want to have a long-term sustainable cash generators. I've said several times that the soda ash and peroxide are the 2 key strong long-term sustainable cash generators. Then, we still have some movement to do to deal with other situations. I mean, there are a number of strategic questions open -- strategic projects. Let's see how quickly we can conclude them."

That's my first question on EBITDA guidance. A second question on cash flow, just to come back to Tom's question. I get the lower CapEx benefit and the higher EBITDA benefit. Karim, I think you just mentioned there higher cash taxes. Would you expect the same cash tax rate, or is that also going up? And in terms of the other changes in net debt of EUR 237 million from last year, is that all currency that disappears this year?

We've seen growth building up along the year. Our current view is that, indeed, the EBITDA growth next year will be coming from volume growth and mostly from the Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulations cluster. In terms of pricing power, after this very long sequence of positive pricing power, I would probably say that we expect a modest contribution, but I can tell you that we will continue to make sure that our teams focus on that. And in terms of fixed costs, some of the new units, I was mentioning Sadara. In Sadara earning costs will start to impact our P&L, so we'll see some impact there. Cytec synergies will continue, but clearly, the big contribution was this year [ph]. And in term of foreign exchange, we are not very original or very creative. I mean we have used the 1 10 as the reference which was more or less the current rate when we launched our budget process project, so maybe a slight benefit in today's condition, but certainly not something we want to build on."

So I'd say around 30% is still good, it still holds. And to the other question around, can you expect debt to go down if the cash comes through? That amount really depends on your view on foreign exchange rates at year-end. As you know, this is more of an accounting conversion impact and anything can impact the cash. I can't predict what's going to happen in 31 December '17. What I can say is given what we described, and if the exchange rate at the end of '17 other than we saw 16 that you do expect a deleveraging coming from operational cash flow.

We are doing a lot of things regarding CapEx excellence within the group, which is really, one, making sure that we support the right project. Second, making sure that we make the most out of every euro that we are investing. And I have to say that we are starting also to give a special attention to a small project, which at the end of the day will present a significant part of the EUR 800 million envelope, which are done at the -- decided at the business level, done at -- executed at plant level. We think that there are opportunities to do this a little bit better. But again, we have very well invested in past 3 years. We have seen a number of projects starting up, ramping up. Some of them were a little bit delayed like Sadara, which is unfortunate because it was kind of the largest CapEx project over the last few years. But again, the feeling that we have now enough runway to be able to operate with this EUR 800 million.

And so it is somewhat disappointing that it's still negative year-on-year. Just interested to know if that's worst than you thought over the summer. And secondly, can you tell us what the margin would have been in Functional Polymers if you had stripped out the contribution from RusVinyl, which obviously has an impact on the EBITDA but not the revenue line? And whether that year-on-year improvement would have been same. And then, finally, can you remind us how your accounting into the Hydrogen Peroxide plants in Sadara? You've got a mix, I think, of different accounting methodologies for your H2O2 plans. And any guidance you can give on both the earnings and the topline contribution depending on how it's accounted for will be very useful."

Second, I think what we have to take into account is the fact that we don't expect growth neither in Performance Chemicals nor in Functional Polymer. It's really where we've based. And if you do a high single-digit growth on the Advanced Material and Advanced Formulation cluster, you end up, if there's no growth rate of the portfolio, you end up with this 5%. So what you really have to keep in mind is that the contribution of the various segments will be very different next year in 2017 than it was last year. On Performance Chemicals, and it's linked to your question on soda ash, we are starting to see activities coming from new activities, I should say, coming from Turkey, so we -- the project is materializing. This being said, we expect a flat to slightly growing performance of the segment, which means that the -- what's happening in peroxide, with the start up of Sadara and the full impact of a Chinese -- the new Chinese capacity, should lead us to, again, a stable to slightly growing performance on the cluster. So European contract in soda ash, mostly done, a very small decrease in prices compensated by operational excellence, overall, I would say, a good situation to start.

So again, I think a strong year where we've, indeed, delivered on our priorities. Maybe, first, talk to the transformation. We have finalized our exit from PVC businesses. We started this project 3 years ago. It has been, in some cases, a long and complex project, but along the year, we have finalized our exit from INOVYN so we are not anymore in PVC Europe. We have finalized the -- on December 27 our exit from Indupa, a rough and complex ride due to some regulatory issues with antitrust authorities which have delayed this project. And Vinythai, we -- it was a quick process. We've announced it in November, and as you've probably seen, we've closed this process, the divestiture, yesterday. So we are not anymore in PVC, with one exception, RusVinyl, our 50-50 JV with Sibur in Russia. Performing well today; we are in a good cash cost position, and it's a business that we will continue to operate for the foreseeable future. We have also in terms of portfolio announced the agreement to sell Acetow business to Blackstone. We expect to close this transaction in the first half of 2017, leaving a good business but with limited growth prospect and which was not anymore in line with our core strategy.
On the acquisition side, 2016 was the year of the Cytec integration. Cytec is today fully integrated into Solvay, quickly and very effective as far as the synergy generation is concerned. We are significantly above our initial synergy target. We continue to work on the transformation of our portfolio. And what's important to keep in mind is that this transformation of the portfolio is also bringing a transformation in our customer list, customer profile. Our key customers today are dramatically different from those of 5 years ago. And we are, indeed, usually in a very unique position of being a sole supplier of large blue-chip companies on their most important development projects.
Going to the results. 
Q4 was, indeed, a quarter where we've seen a return to volume growth, less pronounced seasonality than what we've seen at the end of 2015. Good growth across many diverse market s, including agro, auto, consumer and health care, smart devices. And in oil and gas, although we still see a negative comparison with Q4 of 2015, sequentially, with the increase in the oil price and with the increase in exploration and production activities in North America, we see a sequential significant improvement year-on-year.
So full year EBITDA growth of 7.5%, in line with our initial guidance and our midterm strategic road map. Strong pricing power. We have 3 years of positive pricing power, overall, an impact of pricing power which is in excess of EUR 400 million during this full year, so -- and this illustrates the strength of our position, which allows us in inflationary or deflationary energy and home material environment to continue to expand our margin, leading us in 2016 with a record 21% EBITDA margin. That's a company record that's very good in comparison with our European and even North American peers, and this is again a consequence of the quality of our portfolio. Cytec synergies, I was mentioning it, EUR 70 million year-to-date, EUR 25 million in the last quarter, which means a run rate of EUR 100 million. Very strong. I'll remind you that when we first presented this project in July 2015, we were targeting EUR 100 million synergies in 2018. So we are significantly ahead of our expectation. 
Momentum continues in excellence program. We continued to deliver significantly in all these improvement programs, which cover the group both in terms of geographic businesses, but also functional activities, manufacturing, commercial supply chain. We're actually developing literally hundreds of action plans, allowing us to bring in 2016 more than EUR 200 million of contribution to our EBITDA. In the last 3 years, we have a total of around EUR 1 billion of impact, which is again significantly ahead of our initial expectation.
This year was also a year of strong cash generation. Free cash flow at EUR 866 million (sic -- EUR 876 million). This is clearly the consequence of a clear focus on cash generation, again, in line with what we have shared with you along the year and especially at our Capital Market Day in September. If we look at continuing operation, which means if we exclude Acetow and Vinythai, we have generated EUR 736 million of free cash flow.
Maybe just a word on nonfinancial performance. We are communicating not just on financial indicators, but also on some nonfinancial indicators. Probably the headline there in 2016 is a 19% reduction in greenhouse gases emission intensity. That's the impact of our portfolio transformation, but also the impact of a strong focus on energy optimization, energy mix. We want, indeed, to continue to drive our CO2 intensity down, and this year was a benchmark or at least a milestone in terms of reducing CO2 intensity.
So a year in which we have continued to execute our strategy, and we were able to overcome a number of headwinds, especially in Advanced Materials with the smart device segment; Advanced Formulation with the North American oil and gas environment. And I think that these good results, despite this headwind, reflects the strength of our multi-specialty portfolio and our business model.
Karim, can you give us a bit more insight on our financial results? And I will then conclude with a few comments."

Before I get into this, I just want to clarify for the avoidance of any",1062,"Of course. Thank you, Jean-Pierre. As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis, and I am going to refer to a few slides that are available on our website. 
Before I get into this, I just want to clarify for the avoidance of any doubt that the comparators we're using are those that are restated for the fact that Acetow and Vinythai are treated as discontinued operations.
Let's start with sales on Slide #13. 
The facts are quite [ph] -- sales are down 5% for the full year. Overall volumes are flat, with solid growth in important markets such as automotive, consumer goods, semiconductors, agro, home and personal care. And that helped to offset the headwinds that Jean-Pierre talked about in the oil and gas, smart devices and aerospace. Prices are down 2.3% in a deflationary environment, with lower raw material prices being partially passed through to customers, primarily in Polyamide. Plus, there's been some market pressure, which is totally understandable in oil and gas and on businesses in Latin America as well.
But let's talk about EBITDA on Page 14, Slide 14. 
Jean-Pierre did indicate the 7.5%, and the record margin of 21%. A few points I'd like to highlight in overall terms. There is strong momentum in terms of excellence and synergies, and that shows itself in 2 particular respects. On excellence programs, you see that's a contribution to the positive pricing power, but also on fixed costs. The fact that our fixed costs are down EUR 61 million despite inflationary cost increases of over EUR 8 million, is testament to the real focus on cost discipline and excellence. Clearly, as you know as well that we hedged the majority of our net transaction foreign exchange 9 months forward, and that contributed about EUR 110 million to our bottom line in 2016. 
Now if we turn to each of the key segments. 
Advanced Materials increased 3%. Margins expanded 2% to 26%. Specialty Polymers stands out with a very strong performance, with growth in automotive, batteries, consumer goods, health care outpacing quite a marked slowdown, a lower demand in smart devices. Composites, as you know, was faced with declining build rates in wide-body platforms. There were inventory adjustments which put pressure on the segment. The market now seems to have stabilized. Special Chem delivered double-digit growth, with good momentum in automotive catalysts, semiconductors; whereas growth in Silica was unfortunately marked by the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.
Advanced Formulations. Sales are down, EBITDA is down 7%, but margins were largely stable at 18%. That, to my mind, is worth noting in particular because that represents the variabilization of fixed costs in that segment as another example of this focus on the bottom line delivery. As we know, oil and gas was under pressure throughout most of the year, but we did see a sequential improvement in Q4 against Q3, indicating that our activity is starting to increase following the higher rig counts that we've been noticing for a while now. There was good growth in other Novecare markets -- agro, coatings and other industrials stand out, and that helped to partially mitigate and offset the decline in oil and gas., Technology Solutions, a leading business in mining, remained resilient and finished the year quite neutral despite the significant headwinds facing the industry that it serves.
Performance Chemicals advanced by 11%. Its margins achieved a new record at 28%. What did we see? We saw soda ash really going from strength to strength, specifically in bicarbonate in 2016, which had double-digit growth supported in part by the new Thailand plant. And there is good demand for soda ash, which was very much in line with the previous year as well. Peroxides performed well and it benefited from volume growth with the new plants in China as well.
Operational excellence really stands out as the key contributor to our performance, and that is something which really helps to preserve our leadership positions and at least in terms of the industry cost curves, very, very strong positions.
Looking forward, we do see limited impact from new capacities in 2017, although clearly one expects some margin pressures stemming not least from increasing energy costs. Functional Polymers was a very strong performer, when you see a 57% increase in EBITDA, when you see a margin expansion from 9.5% to 15% in the space of 1 year. As you'd expect, Polyamide led that strength, led that growth, with volume growth particularly in automotive and industrial applications. But also, as you know, that growth was supplemented and really underpinned by a very, very strong focus and delivery in operational excellence.
Corporate costs, you won't be surprised to see that they were down 5%, and that simply is the fact that we're determined to maintain cost discipline and deliver those synergies. And that helps to, obviously, overcome inflation.
Now turning to net income on Slide 15. There's little to really highlight other than the fact that net income has progressed by 10%, aided by the fact that our effective tax rate is down from 32% to 28.5%. The other aspect is, clearly, as to why that improvement in tax is driven largely by the evolution in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings.
Cash. Jean-Pierre has given you the headlines of our cash generation. And on Slide 16, you'll see the bridge and the key components of that. I won't repeat what Jean-Pierre said, but I will highlight 2 or 3 things. One, the driver of the cash has high quality behind them because they come from strong profits, low CapEx and an unrelenting focus on working capital. Those 3 coincide to generate that. And the EUR 876 million compares with EUR 492 million last year, and it's fair to say it's at the top end of our expectations. Nevertheless, that cash more than offset clearly all funding costs, dividend and interest, by nearly EUR 200 million. However, adverse movements in foreign exchange meant that our net debt did not fall down largely because of the impact of the dollar, the Venezuelan currency and Brazilian real and the impact of our debt. So net-net, we have a very strong balance sheet, a very strong cash flow performance, and the quality is there to stay. 
And with that, Jean-Pierre, I hand it back to you."

So maybe just to conclude, a word on our sustainability indicators that you see on Slide 11. Just to confirm that, indeed, we are willing in the next 2 years, as we did during the Capital Market Day when we were setting our midterm objectives, we are willing to continue to follow up with you on various metrics. I already mentioned greenhouse gases intensity, where we see indeed a meaningful reduction in '16 due to portfolio movement but also the continuous effort to optimize energy consumption and CO2 emission. A meaningful increase in sustainable solutions, which represent today 43% of our portfolio. Safety, a bit of a disappointment. We have a stable performance, at a good level, but stable. And as far as safety is concerned, you don't want to be stable, you want to be improving. And a slight improvement also in employee engagement. So again, you should count on us to continue to follow on these indicators.
Looking into 2017 and our priorities. We'll continue to upgrade the quality of the portfolio. Indeed, the work is not finished there, although we have accomplished some significant projects during 2016. We are willing to deliver a volume growth on -- especially on our core functions. It will be a bit of a different year than what we've seen in 2016. We expect the headwinds that we've seen in some segments like smart devices on North American oil and gas turning. And we continue to expect significant growth coming from automotive, electronics of I/O space. And in other businesses, just to mention one of them, peroxide, we will -- we expect our new Sadara capacity to actually start up during the first half of the year, and this will be another opportunity for us to generate volume growth.
Based on this, our current estimate is that we should be able to generate a mid-single digit EBITDA growth for the full year, mostly driven by Advanced Material and Advanced Formulation. Focus on cash will continue to be a priority for us, as Karim mentioned. Our target on continuing operations will be to generate more than EUR 800 million of cash compared to EUR 736 million this year. And this, again, means that we continue to have a very disciplined approach to CapEx. This will provide us more opportunity to reduce our debt profile going forward. All of this very much in line with the strategic road map that we have announced during our Capital Market Day, and we feel very confident that until 2018, we have all the components in place to deliver on the various objectives that we have shared with you a few months ago.
Maybe just a final word to -- regarding dividend. Just to say that our board yesterday decided to recommend to the Shareholder Meeting in May a dividend increase of 4.5% to EUR 3.45 per share. This is both the results of our strong delivery in terms of EBITDA and cash in 2016, but also our confidence that we will be able to continue growth and that we are confident in our ability to create more sustainable value for our shareholder.
With that, I will open the Q&A session."

So on your guidance, you were saying mid-single-digit EBITDA growth, which, broadly speaking, on the basis just north of EUR 100 million. You guide to CapEx down of around EUR 100 million as well year-on-year. And so that gives me free cash flow increase, I think, of EUR 200 million, and yet you're guiding to free cash flow up only EUR 100 million. So I'm wondering if you can help me understand that dynamic and what I'm missing in that calculation."

On the -- on your first question, I mean -- well, it's not easy to follow our strategic progress quarter-after-quarter, but I think that where we are going is rather simple. We want a portfolio made of 3 components -- 2 strong growth engines, Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulation. There, I don't expect to see much transformation, just a strengthening of our positions in the next year, probably stronger delivery of top line synergies linked to the Cytec integration. We focus very much, and you will certainly understand why, on cost synergies that we have delivered in a very quick and effective way, so the next challenge for us is to make sure that the top line synergies are coming. Then we have a third group of businesses where we want to have a long-term sustainable cash generators. I've said several times that the soda ash and peroxide are the 2 key strong long-term sustainable cash generators. Then, we still have some movement to do to deal with other situations. I mean, there are a number of strategic questions open -- strategic projects. Let's see how quickly we can conclude them."

That's my first question on EBITDA guidance. A second question on cash flow, I just to come back to Tom's question. I get the lower CapEx benefit and the higher EBITDA benefit. Karim, I think you just mentioned there higher cash taxes. Would you expect the same cash tax rate, or is that also going up? And in terms of the other changes in net debt of EUR 237 million from last year, is that all currency that disappears this year?

We've seen growth building up along the year. Our current view is that, indeed, the EBITDA growth next year will be coming from volume growth and mostly from the Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulations cluster. In terms of pricing power, after this very long sequence of positive pricing power, I would probably say that we expect a modest contribution, but I can tell you that we will continue to make sure that our teams focus on that. And in terms of fixed costs, some of the new units, I was mentioning Sadara. I mean, Sadara earning costs will start to impact our P&L, so we'll see some impact there. Cytec synergies will continue, but clearly, the big contribution was this year. And in term of foreign exchange, we are not very original or very creative. I mean we have used the 1 10 as the reference which was more or less the current rate when we launched our budget process project, so maybe a slight benefit in today's condition, but certainly not something we want to build on."

That one really depends on your view on foreign exchange rates at year-end. As you know, this is more of an accounting conversion impact and anything can impact the cash. I can't predict what's going to happen on 31 December '17. What I can say is given what we described -- and if the exchange rate at the end of '17 is what we saw in '16 then you do expect a deleveraging coming from operational cash flow.

We are doing a lot of things regarding CapEx excellence within the group, which is really, one, making sure that we support the right project. Second, making sure that we make the most out of every euro that we are investing. And I have to say that we are starting also to give a special attention to a small project, which at the end of the day will present a significant part of the EUR 800 million envelope, which are done at the -- decided at the business level, done at -- executed at plant level. We think that there are opportunities to do this a little bit better. But again, we have very well invested in past 3 years. We have seen a number of projects starting up, ramping up. Some of them were a little bit delayed like Sadara, which is unfortunate because it was kind of the largest CapEx project over the last few years. But again, the feeling that we have now enough runway to be able to operate with this EUR 800 million.

And if you do a high single-digit growth on the Advanced Material and Advanced Formulation cluster you end up -- if there's no growth from the right [ph] of the portfolio, you end up with this 5%. So what you really have to keep in mind is that the contribution of the various segments will be very different next year -- in 2017 than it was last year. On Performance Chemicals, and it's linked to your question on soda ash, we are starting to see activities coming from -- new activities, I should say, coming from Turkey, so we -- the project is materializing. This being said, we expect a flat to slightly growing performance of the segment, which means that the -- what's happening in peroxide, with the start up of Sadara and the full impact of the Chinese -- the new Chinese capacity should lead us to, again, a stable to slightly growing performance on the cluster. So European contract in soda ash, mostly done, a very small decrease in prices compensated by operational excellence, so overall, I would say a good situation to start what will be a challenging year in -- for soda ash, what's in our view a challenging year, where we've taken all the measures that we can to protect our positions."

And I will try to give you, with Karim, in as short a time as possible to leave enough time for question and try to give you the headlines on these results. 
So again, I think a strong year where we've, indeed, delivered on our priorities. Maybe, first, talk to the transformation. We have finalized our exit from PVC businesses. We started this project 3 years ago. It has been, in some cases, a long and complex project, but along the year, we have finalized our exit from INOVYN so we are not anymore in PVC Europe. We have finalized the -- on December 27 our exit from Indupa, a rough and complex ride due to some regulatory issues with antitrust authorities which have delayed this project. And Vinythai, we -- it was a quick process. We've announced it in November, and as you've probably seen, we've closed this process, the divestiture, yesterday. So we are not anymore in PVC, with one exception, RusVinyl, our 50-50 JV with Sibur in Russia. Performing well today; we are in a good cash cost position, and it's a business that we will continue to operate for the foreseeable future. We have also in terms of portfolio announced the agreement to sell Acetow business to Blackstone. We expect to close this transaction in the first half of 2017, leaving a good business but with limited growth prospect and which was not anymore in line with our core strategy.
On the acquisition side, 2016 was the year of the Cytec integration. Cytec is today fully integrated into Solvay, quickly and very effective as far as the synergy generation is concerned. We are significantly above our initial synergy target. We continue to work on the transformation of our portfolio. And what's important to keep in mind is that this transformation of the portfolio is also bringing a transformation in our customer list, customer profile. Our key customers today are dramatically different from those of 5 years ago. And we are, indeed, usually in a very unique position of being a sole supplier of large blue-chip companies on their most important development projects.
Going to the results. 
Q4 was, indeed, a quarter where we've seen a return to volume growth, less pronounced seasonality than what we've seen at the end of 2015. Good growth across many diverse markets, including agro, auto, consumer and health care, smart devices. And in oil and gas, although we still see a negative comparison with Q4 of 2015, sequentially, with the increase in the oil price and with the increase in exploration and production activities in North America, we see a sequential significant improvement year-on-year.
So full year EBITDA growth of 7.5%, in line with our initial guidance and our midterm strategic road map. Strong pricing power. We have 3 years of positive pricing power, overall, an impact of pricing power which is in excess of EUR 400 million during this full year, so -- and this illustrates the strength of our position, which allows us in inflationary or deflationary energy and home material environment to continue to expand our margin, leading us in 2016 with a record 21% EBITDA margin. That's a company record that's very good in comparison with our European and even North American peers, and this is again a consequence of the quality of our portfolio. Cytec synergies, I was mentioning it, EUR 70 million year-to-date, EUR 25 million in the last quarter, which means a run rate of EUR 100 million. Very strong. I'll remind you that when we first presented this project in July 2015, we were targeting EUR 100 million synergies in 2018. So we are significantly ahead of our expectation. 
Momentum continues in excellence program. We continued to deliver significantly in all these improvement programs, which cover the group both in terms of geographic businesses, but also functional activities, manufacturing, commercial supply chain. We're actually developing literally hundreds of action plans, allowing us to bring in 2016 more than EUR 200 million of contribution to our EBITDA. In the last 3 years, we have a total of around EUR 1 billion of impact, which is again significantly ahead of our initial expectation.
This year was also a year of strong cash generation. Free cash flow at EUR 866 million (sic0 [EUR 876 million]. This is clearly the consequence of a clear focus on cash generation, again, in line with what we have shared with you along the year and especially at our Capital Market Day in September. If we look at continuing operation, which means if we exclude Acetow and Vinythai, we have generated EUR 736 million of free cash flow.
Maybe just a word on nonfinancial performance. We are communicating not just on financial indicators, but also on some nonfinancial indicators. Probably the headline there in 2016 is a 19% reduction in greenhouse gases emission intensity. That's the impact of our portfolio transformation, but also the impact of a strong focus on energy optimization, energy mix. We want, indeed, to continue to drive our CO2 intensity down, and this year was a benchmark or at least a milestone in terms of reducing CO2 intensity.
So a year in which we have continued to execute our strategy, and we were able to overcome a number of headwinds, especially in Advanced Materials with the smart device segment; Advanced Formulation with the North American oil and gas environment. And I think that these good results, despite this headwind, reflects the strength of our multi-specialty portfolio and our business model.
Karim, can you give us a bit more insight on our financial results? And I will then conclude with a few comments."

Before I get into this, I just want to clarify for the avoidance of any",1062,"Of course. Thank you, Jean-Pierre. As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis, and I am going to refer to a few slides that are available on our website. 
Before I get into this, I just want to clarify for the avoidance of any doubt that the comparators we're using are those that are restated for the fact that Acetow and Vinythai are treated as discontinued operations.
Let's start with sales on Slide #13. 
The facts are quite [ph] -- sales are down 5% for the full year. Overall volumes are flat, with solid growth in important markets such as automotive, consumer goods, semiconductors, agro, home and personal care. And that helped to offset the headwinds that Jean-Pierre talked about in the oil and gas, smart devices and aerospace. Prices are down 2.3% in a deflationary environment, with lower raw material prices being partially passed through to customers, primarily in Polyamide. Plus, there's been some market pressure, which is totally understandable in oil and gas and on businesses in Latin America as well.
But let's talk about EBITDA on Page 14, Slide 14. 
Jean-Pierre did indicate the 7.5%, and the record margin of 21%. A few points I'd like to highlight in overall terms. There is strong momentum in terms of excellence and synergies, and that shows itself in 2 particular respects. On excellence programs, you see that's a contribution to the positive pricing power, but also on fixed costs. The fact that our fixed costs are down EUR 61 million despite inflationary cost increases of over EUR 8 million, is testament to the real focus on cost discipline and excellence. Clearly, as you know as well that we hedged the majority of our net transaction foreign exchange 9 months forward, and that contributed about EUR 110 million to our bottom line in 2016. 
Now if we turn to each of the key segments. 
Advanced Materials increased 3%. Margins expanded 2% to 26%. Specialty Polymers stands out with a very strong performance, with growth in automotive, batteries, consumer goods, health care outpacing quite a marked slowdown, a lower demand in smart devices. Composites, as you know, was faced with declining build rates in wide-body platforms. There were inventory adjustments which put pressure on the segment. The market now seems to have stabilized. Special Chem delivered double-digit growth, with good momentum in automotive catalysts, semiconductors; whereas growth in Silica was unfortunately marked by the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.
Advanced Formulations. Sales are down, EBITDA is down 7%, but margins were largely stable at 18%. That, to my mind, is worth noting in particular because that represents the variabilization of fixed costs in that segment as another example of this focus on the bottom line delivery. As we know, oil and gas was under pressure throughout most of the year, but we did see a sequential improvement in Q4 against Q3, indicating that our activity is starting to increase following the higher rig counts that we've been noticing for a while now. There was good growth in other Novecare markets -- agro, coatings and other industrials stand out, and that helped to partially mitigate and offset the decline in oil and gas., Technology Solutions, a leading business in mining, remained resilient and finished the year quite neutral despite the significant headwinds facing the industry that it serves.
Performance Chemicals advanced by 11%. Its margins achieved a new record at 28%. What did we see? We saw soda ash really going from strength to strength, specifically in bicarbonate in 2016, which had double-digit growth supported in part by the new Thailand plant. And there is good demand for soda ash, which was very much in line with the previous year as well. Peroxides performed well and it benefited from volume growth with the new plants in China as well.
Operational excellence really stands out as the key contributor to our performance, and that is something which really helps to preserve our leadership positions and at least in terms of the industry cost curves, very, very strong positions.
Looking forward, we do see limited impact from new capacities in 2017, although clearly one expects some margin pressures stemming not least from increasing energy costs. Functional Polymers was a very strong performer, when you see a 57% increase in EBITDA, when you see a margin expansion from 9.5% to 15% in the space of 1 year. As you'd expect, Polyamide led that strength, led that growth, with volume growth particularly in automotive and industrial applications. But also, as you know, that growth was supplemented and really underpinned by a very, very strong focus and delivery in operational excellence.
Corporate costs, you won't be surprised to see that they were down 5%, and that simply is the fact that we're determined to maintain cost discipline and deliver those synergies. And that helps to, obviously, overcome inflation.
Now turning to net income on Slide 15. There's little to really highlight other than the fact that net income has progressed by 10%, aided by the fact that our effective tax rate is down from 32% to 28.5%. The other aspect is, clearly, as to why that improvement in tax is driven largely by the evolution in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings.
Cash. Jean-Pierre has given you the headlines of our cash generation. And on Slide 16, you'll see the bridge and the key components of that. I won't repeat what Jean-Pierre said, but I will highlight 2 or 3 things. One, the driver of the cash has high quality behind them because they come from strong profits, low CapEx and an unrelenting focus on working capital. Those 3 coincide to generate that. And the EUR 876 million compares with EUR 492 million last year, and it's fair to say it's at the top end of our expectations. Nevertheless, that cash more than offset clearly all funding costs, dividend and interest, by nearly EUR 200 million. However, adverse movements in foreign exchange meant that our net debt did not fall down largely because of the impact of the dollar, the Venezuelan currency and Brazilian real and the impact of our debt. So net-net, we have a very strong balance sheet, a very strong cash flow performance, and the quality is there to stay. 
And with that, Jean-Pierre, I hand it back to you."

So maybe just to conclude, a word on our sustainability indicators that you see on Slide 11. Just to confirm that, indeed, we are willing in the next 2 years, as we did during the Capital Market Day when we were setting our midterm objectives, we are willing to continue to follow up with you on various metrics. I already mentioned greenhouse gases intensity, where we see indeed a meaningful reduction in '16 due to portfolio movement but also the continuous effort to optimize energy consumption and CO2 emission. A meaningful increase in sustainable solutions, which represent today 43% of our portfolio. Safety, a bit of a disappointment. We have a stable performance, at a good level, but stable. And as far as safety is concerned, you don't want to be stable, you want to be improving. And a slight improvement also in employee engagement. So again, you should count on us to continue to follow on these indicators.
Looking into 2017 and our priorities. We'll continue to upgrade the quality of the portfolio. Indeed, the work is not finished there, although we have accomplished some significant projects during 2016. We are willing to deliver a volume growth on -- especially on our core functions. It will be a bit of a different year than what we've seen in 2016. We expect the headwinds that we've seen in some segments like smart devices on North American oil and gas turning. And we continue to expect significant growth coming from automotive, electronics of I/O space. And in other businesses, just to mention one of them, peroxide, we will -- we expect our new Sadara capacity to actually start up during the first half of the year, and this will be another opportunity for us to generate volume growth.
Based on this, our current estimate is that we should be able to generate a mid-single digit EBITDA growth for the full year, mostly driven by Advanced Material and Advanced Formulation. Focus on cash will continue to be a priority for us, as Karim mentioned. Our target on continuing operations will be to generate more than EUR 800 million of cash compared to EUR 736 million this year. And this, again, means that we continue to have a very disciplined approach to CapEx. This will provide us more opportunity to reduce our debt profile going forward. All of this very much in line with the strategic road map that we have announced during our Capital Market Day, and we feel very confident that until 2018, we have all the components in place to deliver on the various objectives that we have shared with you a few months ago.
Maybe just a final word to -- regarding dividend. Just to say that our board yesterday decided to recommend to the Shareholder Meeting in May a dividend increase of 4.5% to EUR 3.45 per share. This is both the results of our strong delivery in terms of EBITDA and cash in 2016, but also our confidence that we will be able to continue growth and that we are confident in our ability to create more sustainable value for our shareholder.
With that, I will open the Q&A session."

So on your guidance, you were saying mid-single-digit EBITDA growth, which, broadly speaking, on the basis just north of EUR 100 million. You guide to CapEx down of around EUR 100 million as well year-on-year. And so that gives me free cash flow increase, I think, of EUR 200 million, and yet you're guiding to free cash flow up only EUR 100 million. So I'm wondering if you can help me understand that dynamic and what I'm missing in that calculation."

On the -- on your first question, I mean -- well, it's not easy to follow our strategic progress quarter-after-quarter, but I think that where we are going is rather simple. We want a portfolio made of 3 components -- 2 strong growth engines, Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulation. There, I don't expect to see much transformation, just a strengthening of our positions in the next year, probably stronger delivery of top line synergies linked to the Cytec integration. We focus very much, and you will certainly understand why, on cost synergies that we have delivered in a very quick and effective way, so the next challenge for us is to make sure that the top line synergies are coming. Then we have a third group of businesses where we want to have a long-term sustainable cash generators. I've said several times that the soda ash and peroxide are the 2 key strong long-term sustainable cash generators. Then, we still have some movement to do to deal with other situations. I mean, there are a number of strategic questions open -- strategic projects. Let's see how quickly we can conclude them."

That's my first question on EBITDA guidance. A second question on cash flow, I just to come back to Tom's question. I get the lower CapEx benefit and the higher EBITDA benefit. Karim, I think you just mentioned there higher cash taxes. Would you expect the same cash tax rate, or is that also going up?

We've seen growth building up along the year. Our current view is that, indeed, the EBITDA growth next year will be coming from volume growth and mostly from the Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulations cluster. In terms of pricing power, after this very long sequence of positive pricing power, I would probably say that we expect a modest contribution, but I can tell you that we will continue to make sure that our teams focus on that. And in terms of fixed costs, some of the new units, I was mentioning Sadara. I mean, Sadara earning costs will start to impact our P&L, so we'll see some impact there. Cytec synergies will continue, but clearly, the big contribution was this year. And in term of foreign exchange, we are not very original or very creative. I mean we have used the 1 10 as the reference which was more or less the current rate when we launched our budget process project, so maybe a slight benefit in today's condition, but certainly not something we want to build on."

So I'd say around 30% is still good, it still holds. And turn other question around, can you expect debt to go down if the cash comes through? That one really depends on your view on foreign exchange rates at year-end. As you know, this is more of an accounting conversion impact and anything can impact the cash. I can't predict what's going to happen on 31 December '17. What I can say is given what we described -- and if the exchange rate at the end of '17 is what we saw in '16 then you do expect a deleveraging coming from operational cash flow.

We are doing a lot of things regarding CapEx excellence within the group, which is really, one, making sure that we support the right project. Second, making sure that we make the most out of every euro that we are investing. And I have to say that we are starting also to give a special attention to a small project, which at the end of the day will present a significant part of the EUR 800 million envelope, which are done at the -- decided at the business level, done at -- executed at plant level. We think that there are opportunities to do this a little bit better. But again, we have very well invested in past 3 years. We have seen a number of projects starting up, ramping up. Some of them were a little bit delayed like Sadara, which is unfortunate because it was kind of the largest CapEx project over the last few years. But again, the feeling that we have now enough runway to be able to operate with this EUR 800 million.

And if you do a high single-digit growth on the Advanced Material and Advanced Formulation cluster you end up -- if there's no growth from the right [ph] of the portfolio, you end up with this 5%. So what you really have to keep in mind is that the contribution of the various segments will be very different next year -- in 2017 than it was last year. On Performance Chemicals, and it's linked to your question on soda ash, we are starting to see activities coming from -- new activities, I should say, coming from Turkey, so we -- the project is materializing. This being said, we expect a flat to slightly growing performance of the segment, which means that the -- what's happening in peroxide, with the start up of Sadara and the full impact of the Chinese -- the new Chinese capacity should lead us to, again, a stable to slightly growing performance on the cluster.

I'm here with Karim, our CFO, and Kimberly in charge of IR. I will just make a brief introduction, and then turn to Karim for a deeper insight on our Q1 results. 
But clearly, the headline for me is that this is a good start to 2017. We've been able, indeed, to generate significant amount of EBITDA growth, driven by volumes, and this is exactly what we are planning to do, but we've seen a supportive news or behaviors coming from the market we serve. So this allow us to generate a 12% EBITDA growth, a personal excellence measures offset most of the higher input costs, and this allow us to sustain record operating margin of 21%. Something which for me which is very important when I look at these results is our ability to generate a record free cash flow of EUR 160 million for continuing businesses. For the past couple of years, we've made sure that the focus of the whole teams was on cash generation, and we wanted to have a much more stable cash generation along the years. And indeed, this record level for Q1 demonstrate our ability to control much better than we did in the past our free cash flow generation. 
Supportive market environment, I was mentioning it, and this is true for the overall economy. I think in most regions where we operate, with probably the exception of Latin America, we see supportive market environment. But specifically, we've seen some of the headwinds that we have suffered from in the past couple of years turning. Indeed, the oil and gas in North America is in a very different simulation than what it was in the past quarters, so we are now starting to see a very significant amount of activities in this area. And something which is very specific to us, smart devices, we are also seeing a very good start of the year, and indeed, the opportunities which will develop along the course of 2017.
Before turning to Karim, let me just a word on a different subjects regarding our annual report. We've made a big changes in the annual report this year, focusing on producing what we call an integrated annual report. I really strongly encourage you to spend a bit of time on our website to look at this report. I think it gives a bit of a different picture, and once again, a much more integrated pictures putting together both financial and non-financial indicators and performance at Solvay. 
With that, Karim, I turn to you for additional insight in our key financial results."

And as you will see in a moment, to that growth came -- was very broad-based, and particularly I'd say automotive, grow an easing of headwinds in oil and gas, smart devices contributed to that dynamic.
EBITDA is key, clearly, and you know the headlines, so if you turn to Slide #10, there are 3 full points I'd like to highlight in general terms. One, volumes, as you'd expect, contributed significantly to the growth. And this was associated by what you'd expect in terms of the associated fixed cost increases. Pricing power was modestly negative this quarter, as our excellence programs couldn't fully integrate the rapid rise in raw material input costs. Foreign exchange contributed favorably this quarter, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real. Taking all of this together, our margins, our EBITDA margins expanded 0.4% from 20.4% last year to 20.8% in this quarter, so a strong record.
As we turn to our segments, a look at Advanced Materials, and there, what you can see is our EBITDA increased 9%. Our margins expanded more than 1% to 26%.
Two key things to highlight. Specialty Polymers continued to go from strength to strength, strong growth momentum. Very broad-based, several markets. I talked about automotive. Electric vehicle battery market stood out as well as strong drivers of growth. The composite business showed modest sequential improvement compared to the fourth quarter of last year, as we're now beginning to see good growth in singular aircraft, military related to the joint strike fighter program, helping to partially offset declines in wide-body civil aircraft, rotary and business jets. I just want to be patient to see that inflation comes through, and we expect that growth dynamic to be more evident towards the second half of this year and into next year. We also saw the strength in automotive markets show through to the bottom line and our special cam business and Silica businesses as well.
Turning to Advanced Formulations, what do we see? Clearly, we recognize and welcome the 4% EBITDA growth. But we did see some margin pressures, as Jean-Pierre highlighted. As we explained last quarter, we have begun to see activity levels improved in oil and gas markets. Clearly, the rig counts are low and are double what they were this time last year. And the modest sequential improvement continues, although we note that you cannot extrapolate that because of the different mix of products. So for example, strong friction reducers, less, so the mix is changing. Nevertheless, the momentum is very positive.
Novecare also demonstrated and delivered growth in a number of other markets,  agro, proteins and other industrials. In our technology solutions business, we had some customer specific issues in mining, which offset the strike and reaction, and that offset the new business development that helped to maintain the profitability at a decent level.
Performance Chemicals had another strong quarter. EBITDA up 12%. Margins, a record 28%. Soda ash is performing very well, with volumes up mainly in the market. Bicarbonate continued double-digit growth, supported by the fruits of the investment in our new Thailand plant that we made last year. Peroxides benefited from the kicking in of a contract for a new HPPO plant in Saudi Arabia, which is now beginning to take effect, and we are entering the mechanical start-up phase of that project. Our 28% margin also reflects the maturity and the strength of our excellence programs in that segment.
Functional Polymers delivered a 34% increase in EBITDA. And there, we saw strong volume growth in polymers and intermediates, primarily for automotive applications, both in Europe and Asia. Here also, excellence programs strongly underpinned the performance, and we were able to successfully pass along increases in raw materials.
Turning to Slide 11. 
Our net income improved by 33%, EUR 70 million up on last year. And that reflects both the improvement in EBITDA growth, as well as the reduction in the underlying tax rate from 31% to 25% last year. And that's largely driven by the evolution and the geographic mix of our pretax earnings in the quarter. We are not changing our guidance of around 30% at this stage, but clearly welcome the performance at this stage.
As Jean-Pierre mentioned, cash is really a feature that we are particularly pleased with. And you see on Page 12, our cash flow was very strong. In fact, as you mentioned, it's a record. The previous high was EUR 52 million, and you have to go back to Q1 2012, and as you can see, we're more than a 3x what we did previously there. It's not an accident. It comes from high profits, real attention to CapEx and working capital management, very, very strict, very diligent in delivering that performance. And we are still targeting an annual spend of about EUR 800 million on CapEx for the full year. And this is approaching parity with depreciation, entirely consistent with what we set out in our strategic roadmap when we spoke in September last year.
So all in all, a strong start to the year, both in terms of profits and cash. 
And with that, I turn you back to Jean-Pierre."

So just a few comments before opening to Q&A. 
Regarding our priorities for 2017, no significant changes, very much in line with what we've shared you in the past similar calls, focused on portfolio optimization. We know that there are still a few things we need to do to continue on the track of upgrading our portfolio of activities. And we are indeed very focused to make sure that we can deliver on this.
Regarding the outlook. As I've mentioned at the beginning, and I think Karim has developed it, we see a strong start of a year, which is good. We are pleased to see that, indeed, volume growth is a key driver for the improvement of our performance, very much in line with our expectation. That is good to see that materializing. Cargo are indeed doing well. And all of this gives us confidence that we should be able not only to deliver, but probably to exceed on the EBITDA and cash outlook that we've provided some weeks ago. More importantly, probably, we are at the midpoint of the strategic guidance that we gave last year during our Capital Market Day. And I'm pleased to confirm that at this stage, we are very much on track in every respect in relation to our midterm objectives.
And with that, I think it's time to take your questions."

I just wanted to check that, that does include the energy costs. And also, I wonder if you could give us a little bit of a flavor by division, please. It looked like the greatest pressures were in Advanced Formulations. I just want to confirm that. And secondly, on Advanced Formulations, the margin was pretty disappointing, I think, in the first quarter. It's interesting you are talking about seeing some genuine pickup in oil and gas now. We've obviously seen some downtrading in oil and gas areas. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about mix across the whole of the formulations activities, please. And then 2 hopefully smaller questions. In Specialty Polymers, can you give us some idea of the size of your EV battery exposure now, perhaps in proportion of specialty polymer revenues or something like that to give us an idea of the impact of growth in the EV market? And finally, on the Sadara HPPO project. You talked about mechanical startup. The sort of revenue step-up that we saw in the quarter, is that effectively the full contracted revenue that we should be expecting going forward, or is there still more to go?"

But when we look at the mix of raw material and energy purchase that we do, we end up with what you see in our numbers. So don't underestimate the fact that for the portfolio transformation, we are less and less dependent on energy, which means that we buy less and less energy in various forms, so our sensitivity or exposure to energy has changed quite significantly in the past couple of years. Regarding Advanced Formulation, what I see today is more a bit of a mismatch on the timing between what's happening in the input cost and what's happening on the selling prices. I have a feeling that things will improve over the year. It will improve because we have just renegotiated some contract for our significant -- for some of our significant raw materials, mostly in the oil and chemical area, which will bring significant improvement in terms of competitiveness. And we are starting also to see some impact coming from selling price adjustment, which we are doing probably a little bit late in comparison with input costs. So for me, no reason to revert, but just a bit of a mismatch, which is quite obvious when we look at this quarter margin. On specialty polymer, I mean battery represent only a few percentage point of our total exposure, but it's a market which is growing very significantly. So yes, indeed, we are quite pleased with the development that we've seen for large batteries, mostly electric vehicle, but also stationary batteries. I'll remind you that we have a new facility which will start up in China in the next months, probably doing the summer. We've just finalized the mechanical completion on this plant. And this will give us a much more firepower to follow up on some opportunities that we see in the year linked to electric vehicle development in China, so a good niche to continue to grow our position in specialty polymer. So Sadara, the situation is rather simple. Two elements. From the practical standpoint, we have produced the first batches in the past few days, so the unit is operating not yet at full capacity, but it's operating, which is good news. I remind you that we are part of a very large and complex industrial set-up. So we need to make sure that in the next few weeks, the whole HPPO chain will be indeed up and running and moving up to reach full capacity. And the second element which took place is that we started the contractual arrangement, which is basically a take or pay contract, so it takes pay and we -- the starting point was December 2016, so it explain why we see actual contribution from Sadara during our Q1 results. Don't expect big changes over the next quarter regarding Sadara. Our view regarding the plant will operate give us a feeling that we should continue to see similar levels of contribution for the Sadara project over the next few quarters. And I think with that, I probably covered all of your question."

We also had a modest impact from -- a favorable impact of less than EUR 10 million on foreign exchange that came and now helped this quarter into the variable costs. So I hope it helps you understand the key drivers that helped to produce the strength of the results in that perspective. When it comes to the others, the other contribution that you saw, fundamentally, what we have is this. In last year, we had were some minor restructuring costs and pre-commissioning pre-ramp up costs, which was more negative last year. This year, we had the favorable impact with some modest asset sales. We're talking less than EUR 10 million at time, no?

It shows also the fact that we are more and more moving into businesses where, indeed, the input costs are less important component than they used to be in some of the commodity businesses that we have divested. As I've mentioned, the segment where we've seen some impact is clearly Advanced Formulation. We expect the situation to improve over the year, over the next quarters. I will be cautious and probably I'm not ready to make a forecast on what will be the overall yearly pricing power impact. But I don't have any sign, but it should be degrading in the next quarter or 2, to try to help you get a feeling on where we are. So probably for the full year, something close to neutral would be a reasonable hypothesis made today. I mean we'll see how things will develop. By the way, something I've not mentioned when I was answering your previous question on input cost, is the fact as far as synergy is concerned, probably the area where we had the most pressure was coal for our soda ash business.

On functional polymer, dynamic is pretty positive. There is some inventory effect, and Karim will quantify that, but not major. What we see is a level of demand which is good linked to the automotive industry. And the fact that, as usual, some of our competitors are adding some production issues here and there.

I already mentioned the PDDF facility and China that will start up during the summer. We have also our peak facility in Augustine in the U.S. which is currently starting up.

Second phenomenon, mix, as I've mentioned, are doing very well. In the past months, we've seen a very few formulation using for cost reasons. Expectation is that this could change, at least in terms of trends in the next quarters, because we see operators gaining confidence and willing to make a high-quality fracking.

Do you think -- because I know that was a pretty high margin business. So if you could get the outlook on the strikes on the copper mining business will be good. That's the first question. The second question, I was coming back to, again, Cytec, sorry. Good performance and minus 3 if I put some effects on it, it would be minus, I don't know, 4 or 5 maybe be in terms of volumes. Again, could you comment a bit on the order backlog or the order book? Overall, it seems to have picked up from the Capital Markets Day, especially on the narrowbody planes, if you could comment on that. And how you see your confidence into H2 going back to positive growth? How the S-35 seems to be helping that. That's, I think -- and the last one, a very quick for Karim.

Advanced Formulation, yes, technology solution was impacted by what we strikes and some. It stays a very good business in terms of margins, they're significantly above the group average and very significantly above the cluster average, but we've lost a few percentage point in this situation. Frankly speaking, in our view, no reason to worry. We are very optimistic on the ability of this business to generate very, very solid margins for the remaining part of the year. And if I add once again to name one segment where we've suffered a bit which explained this pressure on margin, it's probably the home and personal care segment of Novecare, a little bit also on the Aroma Performance. well, the situation is relatively clear, if I may say so. Narrowbody, our single aisle planes, order books are filled for both for Boeing and Airbus. I mean Airbus, they are not able to deliver on any new -- they are not able to take orders for delivery before 2022. Boeing is in a similar situation, so the challenge is really production. There, we are seeing a very steep increase in the number of planes produced. And indeed, they are both Boeing had some production issues. I mean some of them who have made the headline, so I don't -- there's no need to comment which are slowing down production, actual productions. We are seeing the situation improving, but our understanding is that we are not yet at the level of production, that heights that these OEMs would expect. So there are still opportunities in front of us. A little bit differently from our competitor XL. We tend to think that the inventories in the supply chain has been taken care of, so we set up from that last year some adjustment along those, in some cases, complex supply chain. We think that this is a 2016 phenomena. On wide-body, it's where the market is a bit soft, waiting for new planes coming online, the 777X is a good -- from Boeing is a good example. So there, we are seeing a little bit of reduced activities, compensated by a good development on the military side and the S-45 ramp up rate, which is improving. But clearly, the area where we suffered still in Q1 is the non-aerospace segments, which is a number of very different markets, from wind energy to automotive. And there, we continued to work to make sure that we can improve the performance of these non-aerospace segment within our composite material. But overall, very optimistic about the development of composite overall for the year, but we are still in a period where our supply chains are just seeing and people are planning to understand how they can increase their rates, which will mean more business in front of us, but challenges short-term."

First one on just a clarification on what you just said, Jean-Pierre. Have you seen any destocking impact on top of what you were expecting in terms of lower production rates in wide-body on the aerospace side, which clearly was mentioned by one of your peers? Or is it just what you were -- or what we've seen, the decline we've seen is just what you were, I guess, forecasting or expecting internally? Second question is on silica pricing, which is still down quite a bit. And can you talk about the competitive pressure there? Obviously, we've seen more capacity additions from you and your competitors. But I'm just wondering if there is -- if there should be even more pressure as the cycle starts to turn or whether you think that we've seen the worse in terms of pricing. And the third question is a more general one. On the auto side given that you're somewhat exposed to other different parts of the auto value chains. It looks like your volumes in autos have been broadly up 10% or 11%. Obviously, car sales in Q1 were up only 3%. Are you not worried about an inventory stocking cycle which will bite us in the rest of the year?"

And as we entered into 2017, we think that inventories in the supply chain that we serve are at a very normal level. So we don't expect any more impact linked to inventory. Silica pricing, it's a business where we have some -- in most of our contracts, some price inflators which are linked to energy costs, so there is a bit of a delay in the -- as far as the impact of this price inflators or deflators, inflator in this case, so we are suffering from this delay, but we expect the situation to improve in terms of pricing in Q2. We are indeed start seeing some changes in this market, but in the segment where we focus ourselves, which are really the technology, the more technology advanced silica formulation, we continue to enjoy a very strong position, very good relationship with key customers, and we have the ability that we can continue to enjoy a very solid opportunities in these segments. Auto, we are reasonably confident. I mean what we understand is that there has been a bit of another production or a bit of another stocking, mostly in China, by the way, linked to the expectation that some new government incentives will be put in place, but we think that the growth in automotive industry is solid. And I remind you that the difference between the overall automotive industry growth and what we see at Solvay is linked to the fact that we are gaining market shares and continue to gain market share. New cars have more polymer than the older ones, and this explain why. We continue indeed to enjoy the growth in this segment."

I'm here with Karim, our CFO; and Kimberly, in charge of IR. I will just make a brief introduction and then turn to Karim for deeper insights in our Q1 results.
But clearly, the headline for me is that this is a good start to 2017. We've been able, indeed, to generate significant amount of EBITDA growth, driven by volumes. And this is exactly what we are planning to do, but we've seen supportive news or behaviors coming from the market we serve. So this allow us to generate a 12% EBITDA growth, a personal excellence measures, offset most of the higher input costs, and this allow us to sustain record operating margin of 21%. Something which for me is very important when I look at these results is our ability to generate a record free cash flow of EUR 160 million for continuing businesses. For the past couple of years, we've made sure that the focus of the whole teams was on cash generation, and we wanted to have a much more stable cash generation along the years. And indeed, this record level for Q1 demonstrate our ability to control much better than we did in the past our free cash flow generation.
Supportive market environment, I was mentioning it, and this is true for the overall economy. I think in most regions where we operate, with probably the exception of Latin America, we see supportive market environment. But specifically, we've seen some of the headwinds that we have suffered from in the past couple of years, turning. Indeed, oil and gas in North America is in a very different situation than what it was in the past quarters, so we are now starting to see a very significant amount of activities in this area. And something which is very specific to us, smart devices, we are also seeing a very good start of the year, and indeed, opportunities, which will develop along the course of 2017.
Before turning to Karim, maybe just a word on a different subject regarding our annual report. We've made big changes in the annual report this year, focusing on producing, what we call, an integrated annual report. I really strongly encourage you to spend a bit of time on our website to look at this report. I think it gives a bit of a different picture, and once again, a much more integrated pictures putting together both financial and nonfinancial indicators and the performance at Solvay.
With that, Karim, I turn to you for additional insight in our key financial results."

Good afternoon, good morning.As usual, the numbers I'm going to highlight are on an underlying basis, and I will refer to certain slides that are available to you on our website.And I'd like to start with the top line, with our",967,"Thank you, Jean-Pierre. Good afternoon, good morning.
As usual, the numbers I'm going to highlight are on an underlying basis, and I will refer to certain slides that are available to you on our website.
And I'd like to start with the top line, with our sales. And as you see on Slide 9, the fact that our sales were up almost 10%, and that is the second consecutive quarter where we've seen sales growth. You recall that Q4 last year showed a 4% improvement in volume-driven sales. This quarter, volumes are up 7.5%. And as you will see, in a moment or two, that growth came -- was very broad-based, and particularly I'd say automotive, agro, an easing of headwinds in oil and gas, smart devices, contributed to that dynamic.
EBITDA is key, clearly, and you know the headlines, so if you turn to Slide #10, there are 3 full points I'd like to highlight, in general terms. One, volumes, as you'd expect, contributed significantly to the growth. And this was associated by what you'd expect in terms of the associated fixed cost increases. Pricing power was modestly negative this quarter as our excellence programs couldn't fully mitigate the rapid rise in material input costs. Foreign exchange contributed favorably this quarter, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real. Taking all of these together, our margins, our EBITDA margins, expanded 0.4% from 20.4% last year to 20.8% in this quarter, so a strong record.
As we turn to our segments, I'll look at Advanced Materials and there what you can see is that our EBITDA increased 9%. Our margins expanded more than 1% to 26%.
2, 3 things to highlight: Specialty Polymers continued to go from strength to strength, strong growth momentum. Very broad-based, several markets. I talked about automotive. Electric vehicle battery market stood out as well as strong drivers of growth. The composite business showed modest sequential improvement compared to the fourth quarter of last year. As we're now beginning to see good growth in singular aircraft, military related to the Joint Strike Fighter program, helping to partially offset declines in wide-body civil aircraft, rotary and business jets. I don't want to have to be patient to see that inflection come through, and we expect that growth dynamic to be more evident towards the second half of this year and into next year. We also saw the strength in automotive markets show through to the bottom line in our Special Chem business and Silica businesses as well.
Turning to Advanced Formulations, what do we see? Clearly, we recognize and welcome the 4% EBITDA growth. But we did see some margin pressures, as Jean-Pierre highlighted. As we explained last quarter, we have begun to see activity levels improved in oil and gas markets. Clearly, the rig counts are low and are double what they were this time last year. And the modest sequential improvement continues although we note that you cannot extrapolate that because of the different mix of products. So for example, strong friction reducers, less [indiscernible]. So the mix is changing. Nevertheless, the momentum is very positive.
Novecare also demonstrated and delivered growth in a number of other markets, agro, proteins and other industrials. In our Technology Solutions business, we had some customer-specific issues in mining, which offset and to less strike an industry action, and that offset the new business developments that helped to maintain the profitability at a decent level.
Performance Chemicals had another strong quarter. EBITDA up 12%. Margins, a record 28%. Soda ash is performing very well, with volumes up, mainly sea-borne market. Bicarbonate continued double-digit growth, supported by the fruits of the investment in our new Thailand plant that we made last year. Peroxides benefited from the kicking in of the contract for our new HPPO plant in Saudi Arabia, which is now beginning to take effect, and we are entering the mechanical start-up phase of that project. Our 28% margin also reflects the maturity and the strength of our excellence programs in that segment.
Functional Polymers delivered a 34% increase in EBITDA. And there, we saw strong volume growth in polymers and intermediates, primarily for automotive applications, both in Europe and Asia. Here also, excellence programs strongly underpinned the performance, and we were able to successfully pass along increases in raw materials.
Turning to Slide 11. Our net income improved by 33%, EUR 70 million up on last year. And that reflects both the improvement in EBITDA growth as well as the reduction in the underlying tax rate from 31% to 25% last year. And that's largely driven by the evolution and the geographic mix of our pretax earnings in the quarter. We're not changing our guidance of around 30% at this stage but clearly welcome the performance at this stage.
As Jean-Pierre mentioned, cash is really a feature that we're particularly pleased with. And as you see on Page 12, our cash flow was very strong. In fact, as we mentioned, it's a record. The previous high was EUR 52 million, and you have to go back to Q1 2012. And so you can see, we're more than a 3x what we did previously there. It's not an accident, it comes from high profits, real attention to CapEx and working capital management, very, very strict, very diligent in delivering that performance. And we are still targeting an annual spend of about EUR 800 million on CapEx for the full year. And this is approaching parity with depreciation, entirely consistent with what we set out in our strategic roadmap when we spoke in September last year.
So all in all, a strong start to the year, both in terms of profits and cash. 
And with that, I turn you back to Jean-Pierre."

Regarding our priorities for 2017, no significant changes, very much in line with what we've shared you in the past similar calls, focused on portfolio optimization. We know that there are still a few things we need to do to continue on the track of upgrading our portfolio of activities. And we are indeed very focused to make sure that we can deliver on this.
Regarding the outlook. As I've mentioned at the beginning, and I think Karim has developed it, we see a strong start of a year, which is good. We are pleased to see that, indeed, volume growth is a key driver for the improvement of our performance, very much in line with our expectation. But it's good to see that materializing. Cargo [indiscernible] are indeed doing well. And all of this gives us confidence that we should be able not only to deliver but probably to exceed on the EBITDA and cash outlook that we've provided some weeks ago. More importantly, probably, we are at the midpoint of the strategic guidance that we gave last year during our Capital Market Day. And I'm pleased to confirm but at this stage, we are very much on track in every respect in relation to our midterm objectives.
And with that, I think it's time to take your questions. Operator, please, start the Q&A session, please."

I just wanted to check that, that does include the energy costs. And also, I wonder if you could give us a little bit of a flavor by division, please. It looked like the greatest pressures were in Advanced Formulations. I just want to confirm that. And secondly, on Advanced Formulations, the margin was pretty disappointing, I think, in the first quarter. It's interesting, you're talking about seeing some genuine pickup in oil and gas now. We've obviously seen some down trading in oil and gas areas. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about mix across the whole of the formulations activities, please. And then two, hopefully, smaller questions. In Specialty Polymers, can you give us some idea of the size of your EV battery exposure now, perhaps, in proportion of specialty polymer revenues or something like that to give us an idea of the impact of growth in the EV market? And finally, on the Sadara HPPO project. The -- you talked about mechanical startup. The sort of revenue step-up that we saw in the quarter, is that effectively the full contracted revenue that we should be expecting going forward? Or is there still more to go?"

So yes, indeed, input costs includes energy, obviously. But when we look at the -- of the mix of raw material and energy purchase that we do, we end up with what you see in our numbers. So don't underestimate the fact",533,"Okay. So a lot of pointed questions. So yes, indeed, input costs includes energy, obviously. But when we look at the -- of the mix of raw material and energy purchase that we do, we end up with what you see in our numbers. So don't underestimate the fact that for the portfolio transformation, we are less and less dependent on energy, which means that we buy less and less energy in various forms. So our sensitivity or exposure to energy has changed quite significantly in the past couple of years. Regarding Advanced Formulation, what I see today is more a bit of a mismatch in terms of timing between what's happening on the input cost and what's happening on the selling prices. I have a feeling that things will improve over the year. It will improve because we have just renegotiated some contract for our significant -- for some of our significant raw materials, mostly in the oil and chemical area, which will bring significant improvement in terms of competitiveness. And we are starting to see some impact coming from selling price adjustment, which we are doing probably a little bit late in comparison with input costs. So for me, no reason to revert, just a bit of a mismatch, which is quite obvious when we look at this quarter margin. On Specialty Polymers, I mean, battery represents only a few percentage point of our total exposure, but it's a market which is growing very significantly. So yes, indeed, we are quite pleased with the development that we've seen for large batteries, mostly electric vehicle, but also stationary batteries. I'll remind you that we have a new PVDF facility, which will start up in China in the next months, probably doing the summer. We've just finalized the mechanical completion on this plant. And this will give us a much more firepower to follow up on some opportunities that we see in the year linked to electric vehicle development in China. So a good niche to continue to grow our position in Specialty Polymers. So Sadara, the situation is rather simple. 2 elements. From a practical standpoint, we have produced the first batches in the past few days, so the unit is operating not yet at full capacity, but it's operating, which is good news. I remind you that we are part of a very large and complex industrial set-up. So we need to make sure that in the next few weeks the whole HPPO chain will be, indeed, up and running and moving up to reach full capacity. And the second element, which took place, is that we started the contractual arrangement, which is basically a take or pay contract, so it takes pay and we -- the starting point was December 2016, so it explains why we see actual contribution from Sadara during our Q1 results. Don't expect big changes over the next quarter regarding Sadara. Our view regarding the -- of the plant will operate gives us a feeling that we should continue to see similar levels of contribution for the Sadara project over the next few quarters. And I think with that, I probably covered all of your question."

On the variable cost, I don't want to give too much, let's say, [indiscernible] information in detail. What I can say to you is, excellence and synergies combined deliver more than EUR 50 million in this quarter, predominantly on variable costs but also impacting fixed costs. So the momentum that we saw last year that helped to build the strong performance last year is continuing. We also had a modest impact from -- favorable impact of less than EUR 10 million on foreign exchange that came and helped this quarter into the variable costs. So I hope that it helps you understand the key drivers that helped to produce the strength of the results in that perspective. When it comes to the others, the other contribution that you saw, fundamentally what we have is this: in last year, we had some minor restructuring costs and precommissioning, preramp-up costs, which was more negative last year. This year, we had the favorable impact with some modest asset sales. We're talking less than EUR 10 million at time, no?

Our synergies are concerned, and we are continuing to make progress with something which is going well. Pricing power, it's good that you're surprised, but I think it shows the liquidity of our portfolio. It shows also the fact that we are more and more moving into businesses where, indeed, the input costs are less important component than they used to be in some of the commodity businesses that we have divested. As I've mentioned, the segment where we've seen some impact is, clearly, Advanced Formulations. We expect the situation to improve over the year, over the next quarters. I will be cautious and probably I'm not ready to make a forecast on what will be the overall yearly pricing power impact, but I don't have any sign. But it should be degrading in the next quarter or 2, to try to help you get a feeling on where we are. So probably for the full year, something close to neutral would be a reasonable hypothesis made today. I mean we'll see how things will develop. By the way, something I've not mentioned when I was answering your previous question on input cost, is the fact as far as synergy is concerned, probably the area where we had the most pressure was coal for our soda ash business. It's clearly an area where we've suffered a bit from some unexpected spike in the price of coal. But overall, again, a situation where we've been, but we've been able to manage for pricing.

But some, yes. We are seeing today some slight improvement of the trends. Let me put that in a different way. The trends are positive, as far as mix is concerned, which means that we are seeing people interested in -- people getting more and more interested in a higher cost formulation. We are starting to see interest again around [indiscernible] based formulation. But it's more a trend than an actual fact. So trends positive, but I won't quantify our visual present. But what's clear is that since Q4, we've seen very positive trends regarding volume, negative mix effect. Expectation would be to see this negative mix effect slowing down in the next quarters."

But once again, we've probably, as well prepared as you can for the situation. And what we've seen in the beginning of the year gives us a good feeling regarding the development. On functional polymer, dynamic is pretty positive. There is some inventory effect, and Karim will quantify that, but not major. What we see is a level of demand, which is good, linked to the automotive industry. And the fact that, as usual, some of our competitors are adding some production issues here and there. And as our plant turns to operate in a very reliable and efficient way, we have the ability to benefit from that. But again, a reasonably good development expected in front of us. I remind you that for this business, especially, Polyamide, raw material and energy inflation usually turns to create a positive environment for us.

Advanced Formulation, yes, Technology Solutions was impacted by what mentioned, strikes and some [indiscernible]. It stays a very good business in terms of margins and significantly above the group average and very significantly above the cluster average. But we've lost a few percentage point in this situation. Frankly speaking, in our view, no reason to worry. We are very optimistic on the ability of this business to generate very, very solid margins for the remaining part of the year. And if I add once again to name 1 segment where we've suffered a bit, which explained this pressure on margin, it's probably the home and personal care segment of Novecare, a little bit also on the Aroma Performance. I would state, while the situation is relatively clear, if I may say so. Narrow-body, our single-aisle planes, order books are filled for both for Boeing and Airbus. I mean, Airbus, they are not able to deliver on any new -- they are not able to take orders for delivery before 2022. Boeing is in a similar situation, so the challenge is really production. There we are seeing a very steep increase in the number of planes produced. And indeed, they are both and Boeing had some production issues. I mean some of them were made the headlines, so I don't -- there's no need to comment which are slowing down production, actual productions. We are seeing the situation improving, but our understanding is that we are not yet at the level of production, heights that these OEMs would expect. So there are still opportunities in front of us. A little bit differently from our competitor Excel. We tend to think that the inventories in the supply chain has been taken care of, so we set up from that last year, some adjustment along those, in some cases, complex supply chain. We think that this is a 2016 phenomena. On wide-body, it's where the market is a bit soft. Waiting for new planes coming online, the 777X is a good -- from Boeing is a good example. So there we are seeing a little bit of reduced activities compensated by a good development on the military side and the F45 ramp up rate, which is improving. But clearly, the area where we suffered still in Q1 is the nonaerospace segments, which is a number of very different markets, from wind energy to automotive. And there, we continued to work to make sure that we can improve the performance of these nonaerospace segment within our composite material. But overall, very optimistic about the development of composite overall for the year, but we are still in an area -- we are still in a period where supply chains are adjusting and people are planning to understand how they can increase their rates, which will mean more business in front of us, but challenges short term."

Or is it just what you were -- or what we've seen, the decline we've seen is just what you were, I guess, forecasting or expecting internally? Second question is on Silica pricing, which is still down, quite a bit. Can you talk about the competitive pressure there? Obviously, we've seen more capacity additions from you and your competitors. But I'm just wondering if there is -- if there should be even more pressure as the cycle starts to turn or whether you think that we've seen the worse in terms of pricing. And the third question is a more general one on the auto side, given that you're somewhat exposed to other different parts of the auto value chains. It looks like your volumes in autos have been broadly up 10% or 11%. Obviously, car sales in Q1 were up only 3%. Are you not worried about an inventory stocking cycle which will bite us in the rest of the year?"

We are indeed start seeing some changes in this market, but in the segment where we focus ourselves, which are really the technology, the more technology advanced Silica formulation, we continue to enjoy a very strong position, very good relationship with key customers, and we have the ability that we can continue to enjoy a very solid opportunities in these segments. Auto, we are reasonably confident. I mean, what we understand is that there has been a bit of another production or a bit of another stocking, mostly in China, by the way, linked to the expectation that some new government incentives will be put in place, but we think that the growth in automotive industry is solid. And I remind you that the difference between the overall automotive industry growth and what we see at Solvay is linked to the fact that we are gaining market shares and continue to gain market share.

I'm here with Karim, our CFO; and Kimberly, in charge of IR. I will just make a brief introduction and then turn to Karim for deeper insights in our Q1 results.
But clearly, the headline for me is that this is a good start to 2017. We've been able, indeed, to generate significant amount of EBITDA growth, driven by volumes. And this is exactly what we are planning to do, but we've seen supportive news or behaviors coming from the market we serve. So this allow us to generate a 12% EBITDA growth. Our personal excellence measures offset most of the higher input costs, and this allow us to sustain record operating margin of 21%. Something which for me is very important when I look at these results is our ability to generate a record free cash flow of EUR 160 million for continuing businesses. For the past couple of years, we've made sure that the focus of the whole teams was on cash generation, and we wanted to have a much more stable cash generation along the years. And indeed, this record level for Q1 demonstrate our ability to control much better than we did in the past our free cash flow generation.
Supportive market environment, I was mentioning it, and this is true for the overall economy. I think in most regions where we operate, with probably the exception of Latin America, we see supportive market environment. But specifically, we've seen some of the headwinds that we have suffered from in the past couple of years, turning. Indeed, oil and gas in North America is in a very different situation than what it was in the past quarters, so we are now starting to see a very significant amount of activities in this area. And something which is very specific to us, smart devices, we are also seeing a very good start of the year, and indeed, opportunities, which will develop along the course of 2017.
Before turning to Karim, maybe just a word on a different subject regarding our annual report. We've made big changes in the annual report this year, focusing on producing, what we call, an integrated annual report. I really strongly encourage you to spend a bit of time on our website to look at this report. I think it gives a bit of a different picture, and once again, a much more integrated pictures putting together both financial and nonfinancial indicators and the performance at Solvay.
With that, Karim, I turn to you for additional insight in our key financial results."

Good afternoon, good morning.As usual, the numbers I'm going to highlight are on an underlying basis, and I will refer to certain slides that are available to you on our website.And I'd like to start with the top line, with our",963,"Thank you, Jean-Pierre. Good afternoon, good morning.
As usual, the numbers I'm going to highlight are on an underlying basis, and I will refer to certain slides that are available to you on our website.
And I'd like to start with the top line, with our sales. And as you see on Slide 9, the fact that our sales were up almost 10%, and that is the second consecutive quarter where we've seen sales growth. You recall that Q4 last year showed a 4% improvement in volume-driven sales. This quarter, volumes are up 7.5%. And as you will see, in a moment or two, that growth came -- was very broad-based, and particularly I'd say automotive, agro, an easing of headwinds in oil and gas, smart devices, contributed to that dynamic.
EBITDA is key, clearly, and you know the headlines, so if you turn to Slide #10, there are 3 full points I'd like to highlight, in general terms. One, volumes, as you'd expect, contributed significantly to the growth. And this was associated by what you'd expect in terms of the associated fixed cost increases. Pricing power was modestly negative this quarter as our excellence programs couldn't fully mitigate the rapid rise in material input costs. Foreign exchange contributed favorably this quarter, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real. Taking all of these together, our margins, our EBITDA margins, expanded 0.4% from 20.4% last year to 20.8% in this quarter, so a strong record.
As we turn to our segments, I'll look at Advanced Materials and there what you can see is that our EBITDA increased 9%. Our margins expanded more than 1% to 26%.
2, 3 things to highlight: Specialty Polymers continued to go from strength to strength, strong growth momentum. Very broad-based, several markets. I talked about automotive. Electric vehicle battery market stood out as well as strong drivers of growth. The composite business showed modest sequential improvement compared to the fourth quarter of last year. As we're now beginning to see good growth in singular aircraft, military related to the Joint Strike Fighter program, helping to partially offset declines in wide-body civil aircraft, rotary and business jets. Everyone has to be patient to see that inflection come through, and we expect that growth dynamic to be more evident towards the second half of this year and into next year. We also saw the strength in automotive markets show through to the bottom line in our Special Chem business and Silica businesses as well.
Turning to Advanced Formulations, what do we see? Clearly, we recognize and welcome the 4% EBITDA growth. But we did see some margin pressures, as Jean-Pierre highlighted. As we explained last quarter, we have begun to see activity levels improved in oil and gas markets. Clearly, the rig counts alone are double what they were this time last year. And the modest sequential improvement continues although we note that you cannot extrapolate that because of the different mix of products. So for example, strong friction reducers, less guar. So the mix is changing. Nevertheless, the momentum is very positive.
Novecare also demonstrated and delivered growth in a number of other markets, agro, proteins and other industrials. In our Technology Solutions business, we had some customer-specific issues in mining, which offset -- I'm talking about strikes and industry action, and that offset the new business developments that helped to maintain the profitability at a decent level.
Performance Chemicals had another strong quarter. EBITDA up 12%. Margins, a record 28%. Soda ash is performing very well, with volumes up, mainly sea-borne market. Bicarbonate continued double-digit growth, supported by the fruits of the investment in our new Thailand plant that we made last year. Peroxides benefited from the kicking in of the contract for our new HPPO plant in Saudi Arabia, which is now beginning to take effect, and we are entering the mechanical start-up phase of that project. Our 28% margin also reflects the maturity and the strength of our excellence programs in that segment.
Functional Polymers delivered a 34% increase in EBITDA. And there, we saw strong volume growth in polymers and intermediates, primarily for automotive applications, both in Europe and Asia. Here also, excellence programs strongly underpinned the performance, and we were able to successfully pass along increases in raw materials.
Turning to Slide 11. Our net income improved by 33%, EUR 70 million up on last year. And that reflects both the improvement in EBITDA growth as well as the reduction in the underlying tax rate from 31% to 25% last year. And that's largely driven by the evolution and the geographic mix of our pretax earnings in the quarter. We're not changing our guidance of around 30% at this stage but clearly welcome the performance at this stage.
As Jean-Pierre mentioned, cash is really a feature that we're particularly pleased with. And as you see on Page 12, our cash flow was very strong. In fact, as we mentioned, it's a record. The previous high was EUR 52 million, and you have to go back to Q1 2012. And so you can see, we're more than a 3x what we did previously there. It's not an accident, it comes from high profits, real attention to CapEx and working capital management, very, very strict, very diligent in delivering that performance. And we are still targeting an annual spend of about EUR 800 million on CapEx for the full year. And this is approaching parity with depreciation, entirely consistent with what we set out in our strategic roadmap when we spoke in September last year.
So all in all, a strong start to the year, both in terms of profits and cash. 
And with that, I turn you back to Jean-Pierre."

Regarding our priorities for 2017, no significant changes, very much in line with what we've shared you in the past similar calls, focused on portfolio optimization. We know that there are still a few things we need to do to continue on the track of upgrading our portfolio of activities. And we are indeed very focused to make sure that we can deliver on this.
Regarding the outlook. As I've mentioned at the beginning, and I think Karim has developed it, we see a strong start of a year, which is good. We are pleased to see that, indeed, volume growth is a key driver for the improvement of our performance, very much in line with our expectation. But it's good to see that materializing. Cargo functions are indeed doing well. And all of this gives us confidence that we should be able not only to deliver but probably to exceed on the EBITDA and cash outlook that we've provided some weeks ago. More importantly, probably, we are at the midpoint of the strategic guidance that we gave last year during our Capital Market Day. And I'm pleased to confirm but at this stage, we are very much on track in every respect in relation to our midterm objectives.

I just wanted to check that, that does include the energy costs. And also, I wonder if you could give us a little bit of a flavor by division, please. It looked like the greatest pressures were in Advanced Formulations. I just want to confirm that. And secondly, on Advanced Formulations, the margin was pretty disappointing, I think, in the first quarter. It's interesting, you're talking about seeing some genuine pickup in oil and gas now. We've obviously seen some down trading in oil and gas areas. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about mix across the whole of the formulations activities, please. And then two, hopefully, smaller questions. In Specialty Polymers, can you give us some idea of the size of your EV battery exposure now, perhaps, in proportion of specialty polymer revenues or something like that to give us an idea of the impact of growth in the EV market? And finally, on the Sadara HPPO project. The -- you talked about mechanical startup. The sort of revenue step-up that we saw in the quarter, is that effectively the full contracted revenue that we should be expecting going forward? Or is there still more to go?"

So yes, indeed, input costs includes energy, obviously. But when we look at the -- of the mix of raw material and energy purchase that we do, we end up with what you see in our numbers.

But when we look at the -- of the mix of raw material and energy purchase that we do, we end up with what you see in our numbers. So don't underestimate the fact that for the portfolio transformation, we are less and less dependent on energy, which means that we buy less and less energy in various forms. So our sensitivity or exposure to energy has changed quite significantly in the past couple of years. Regarding Advanced Formulation, what I see today is more a bit of a mismatch in terms of timing between what's happening on the input cost and what's happening on the selling prices. I have a feeling that things will improve over the year. It will improve because we have just renegotiated some contract for our significant -- for some of our significant raw materials, mostly in the oil and chemical area, which will bring significant improvement in terms of competitiveness. And we are starting to see some impact coming from selling price adjustment, which we are doing probably a little bit late in comparison with input costs. So for me, no reason to worry there, just a bit of a mismatch, which is quite obvious when we look at this quarter margin. On Specialty Polymers, I mean, battery represents only a few percentage point of our total exposure, but it's a market which is growing very significantly. So yes, indeed, we are quite pleased with the development that we've seen for large batteries, mostly electric vehicle, but also stationary batteries. I'll remind you that we have a new PVDF facility, which will start up in China in the next months, probably during the summer. We've just finalized the mechanical completion on this plant. And this will give us a much more firepower to follow up on some opportunities that we see in the year linked to electric vehicle development in China. So a good niche to continue to grow our position in Specialty Polymers. So Sadara, the situation is rather simple. 2 elements. From a practical standpoint, we have produced the first batches in the past few days, so the unit is operating not yet at full capacity, but it's operating, which is good news. I remind you that we are part of a very large and complex industrial set-up. So we need to make sure that in the next few weeks the whole HPPO chain will be, indeed, up and running and moving up to reach full capacity. And the second element, which took place, is that we started the contractual arrangement, which is basically a take or pay contract, so it takes pay and we -- the starting point was December 2016, so it explains why we see actual contribution from Sadara during our Q1 results. Don't expect big changes over the next quarter regarding Sadara. Our view regarding the -- of the plant will operate gives us a feeling that we should continue to see similar levels of contribution for the Sadara project over the next few quarters. And I think with that, I probably covered all of your question."

What I can say to you is, excellence and synergies combined deliver more than EUR 50 million in this quarter, predominantly on variable costs but also impacting fixed costs.

So I hope that it helps you understand the key drivers that helped to produce the strength of the results in that perspective. When it comes to the others, the other contribution that you saw, fundamentally what we have is this: in last year we had some minor restructuring costs and precommissioning, preramp-up costs, which was more negative last year.

Or should we rather wait until H2 to have a view on how it's evolving? And the second one is on pricing power. I was expecting it in the first quarter to be a little bit more negative, actually. So I am wondering what you anticipate for the full year. When you look at today's raw materials evolution, the fact that you've been a little bit lagging in terms of price increase in some segments, can we expect that number to be positive by end of the year or rather flat?"

Our synergies are concerned, and we are continuing to make progress with something which is going well. Pricing power, it's good that you're surprised, but I think it shows the liquidity of our portfolio. It shows also the fact that we are more and more moving into businesses where, indeed, the input costs are less important component than they used to be in some of the commodity businesses that we have divested. As I've mentioned, the segment where we've seen some impact is, clearly, Advanced Formulations. We expect the situation to improve over the year, over the next quarters. I will be cautious and probably I'm not ready to make a forecast on what will be the overall yearly pricing power impact, but I don't have any sign. But it should be degrading in the next quarter or 2, to try to help you get a feeling on where we are. So probably for the full year, something close to neutral would be a reasonable hypothesis made today. I mean we'll see how things will develop. By the way, something I've not mentioned when I was answering your previous question on input cost, is the fact as far as synergy is concerned, probably the area where we had the most pressure was coal for our soda ash business. It's clearly an area where we've suffered a bit from some unexpected spike in the price of coal. But overall, again, a situation where we've been, but we've been able to manage for pricing.

But once again, we've probably, as well prepared as you can for the situation. And what we've seen in the beginning of the year gives us a good feeling regarding the development. On functional polymer, dynamic is pretty positive. There is some inventory effect, and Karim will quantify that, but not major. What we see is a level of demand, which is good, linked to the automotive industry. And the fact that, as usual, some of our competitors are adding some production issues here and there. And as our plant tends to operate in a very reliable and efficient way, we have the ability to benefit from that. But again, a reasonably good development expected in front of us.

Was it -- can you quantify the impact on margins from that lead -- the problems in mining? Was that significant? And most importantly, how it looks over the next few quarters? Do you think -- because I know that was a pretty high margin business. So if you could get the outlook on the strikes, on the copper mining business would be good. That's the first question. The second question, I was coming back to, again, Cytec, sorry. Good performance and minus 3 if I put some effects on it, it would be minus, I don't know, 4 or 5 maybe be in terms of volumes.

Advanced Formulation, yes, Technology Solutions was impacted by what mentioned, strikes in some copper mine. It stays a very good business in terms of margins and significantly above the group average and very significantly above the cluster average. But we've lost a few percentage point in the R&D situation. Frankly speaking, in our view, no reason to worry. We are very optimistic on the ability of this business to generate very, very solid margins for the remaining part of the year. And if I add once again to name 1 segment where we've suffered a bit, which explained this pressure on margin, it's probably the home and personal care segment of Novecare, a little bit also on the Aroma Performance. I would state, while the situation is relatively clear, if I may say so. Narrow-body, our single-aisle planes, order books are filled for both for Boeing and Airbus. I mean, Airbus, they are not able to deliver on any new -- they are not able to take orders for delivery before 2022. Boeing is in a similar situation, so the challenge is really production. There we are seeing a very steep increase in the number of planes produced. And indeed, they Airbus and Boeing had some production issues. I mean some of them were made the headlines, so I don't -- there's no need to comment which are slowing down production, actual productions. We are seeing the situation improving, but our understanding is that we are not yet at the level of production, heights that these OEMs would expect. So there are several opportunities in front of us. A little bit differently from our competitor Excel. We tend to think that the inventories in the supply chain has been taken care of, so we suffered from that last year, some adjustment along those, in some cases, complex supply chain. We think that this is a 2016 phenomena. On wide-body, it's where the market is a bit soft. Waiting for new planes coming online, the 777X is a good -- from Boeing is a good example. So there we are seeing a little bit of reduced activities compensated by a good development on the military side and the F45 ramp up rate, which is improving. But clearly, the area where we suffered still in Q1 is the nonaerospace segments, which is a number of very different markets, from wind energy to automotive. And there, we continued to work to make sure that we can improve the performance of these nonaerospace segment within our composite material. But overall, very optimistic about the development of composite overall for the year, but we are still in an area -- we are still in a period where supply chains are adjusting and people are planning to understand how they can increase their rates, which will mean more business in front of us, but challenges short term."

But I'm just wondering if there is -- if there should be even more pressure as the cycle starts to turn or whether you think that we've seen the worse in terms of pricing. And the third question is a more general one on the auto side, given that you're somewhat exposed to other different parts of the auto value chains. It looks like your volumes in autos have been broadly up 10% or 11%. Obviously, car sales in Q1 were up only 3%.

Auto, we are reasonably confident. I mean, what we understand is that there has been a bit of another production or a bit of another stocking, mostly in China, by the way, linked to the expectation that some new government incentives will be put in place, but we think that the growth in automotive industry is solid.

I'm here with Karim, our CFO; and Kimberly, in charge of IR. I will just make a brief introduction and then turn to Karim for deeper insights in our Q1 results.
But clearly, the headline for me is that this is a good start to 2017. We've been able, indeed, to generate significant amount of EBITDA growth, driven by volumes. And this is exactly what we are planning to do, but we've seen supportive news or behaviors coming from the market we serve. So this allow us to generate a 12% EBITDA growth. Our personal excellence measures offset most of the higher input costs, and this allow us to sustain record operating margin of 21%. Something which for me is very important when I look at these results is our ability to generate a record free cash flow of EUR 160 million for continuing businesses. For the past couple of years, we've made sure that the focus of the whole teams was on cash generation, and we wanted to have a much more stable cash generation along the years. And indeed, this record level for Q1 demonstrate our ability to control much better than we did in the past our free cash flow generation.
Supportive market environment, I was mentioning it, and this is true for the overall economy. I think in most regions where we operate, with probably the exception of Latin America, we see supportive market environment. But specifically, we've seen some of the headwinds that we have suffered from in the past couple of years, turning. Indeed, oil and gas in North America is in a very different situation than what it was in the past quarters, so we are now starting to see a very significant amount of activities in this area. And something which is very specific to us, smart devices, we are also seeing a very good start of the year, and indeed, opportunities, which will develop along the course of 2017.
Before turning to Karim, maybe just a word on a different subject regarding our annual report. We've made big changes in the annual report this year, focusing on producing, what we call, an integrated annual report. I really strongly encourage you to spend a bit of time on our website to look at this report. I think it gives a bit of a different picture, and once again, a much more integrated pictures putting together both financial and nonfinancial indicators and the performance at Solvay.
With that, Karim, I turn to you for additional insight in our key financial results."

Good afternoon, good morning.As usual, the numbers I'm going to highlight are on an underlying basis, and I will refer to certain slides that are available to you on our website.And I'd like to start with the top line, with our",963,"Thank you, Jean-Pierre. Good afternoon, good morning.
As usual, the numbers I'm going to highlight are on an underlying basis, and I will refer to certain slides that are available to you on our website.
And I'd like to start with the top line, with our sales. And as you see on Slide 9, the fact that our sales were up almost 10%, and that is the second consecutive quarter where we've seen sales growth. You recall that Q4 last year showed a 4% improvement in volume-driven sales. This quarter, volumes are up 7.5%. And as you will see, in a moment or two, that growth came -- was very broad-based, and particularly I'd say automotive, agro, an easing of headwinds in oil and gas, smart devices, contributed to that dynamic.
EBITDA is key, clearly, and you know the headlines, so if you turn to Slide #10, there are 3 full points I'd like to highlight, in general terms. One, volumes, as you'd expect, contributed significantly to the growth. And this was associated by what you'd expect in terms of the associated fixed cost increases. Pricing power was modestly negative this quarter as our excellence programs couldn't fully mitigate the rapid rise in material input costs. Foreign exchange contributed favorably this quarter, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real. Taking all of these together, our margins, our EBITDA margins, expanded 0.4% from 20.4% last year to 20.8% in this quarter, so a strong record.
As we turn to our segments, I'll look at Advanced Materials and there what you can see is that our EBITDA increased 9%. Our margins expanded more than 1% to 26%.
2, 3 things to highlight: Specialty Polymers continued to go from strength to strength, strong growth momentum. Very broad-based, several markets. I talked about automotive. Electric vehicle battery market stood out as well as strong drivers of growth. The composite business showed modest sequential improvement compared to the fourth quarter of last year. As we're now beginning to see good growth in singular aircraft, military related to the Joint Strike Fighter program, helping to partially offset declines in wide-body civil aircraft, rotary and business jets. Everyone has to be patient to see that inflection come through, and we expect that growth dynamic to be more evident towards the second half of this year and into next year. We also saw the strength in automotive markets show through to the bottom line in our Special Chem business and Silica businesses as well.
Turning to Advanced Formulations, what do we see? Clearly, we recognize and welcome the 4% EBITDA growth. But we did see some margin pressures, as Jean-Pierre highlighted. As we explained last quarter, we have begun to see activity levels improved in oil and gas markets. Clearly, the rig counts alone are double what they were this time last year. And the modest sequential improvement continues although we note that you cannot extrapolate that because of the different mix of products. So for example, strong friction reducers, less guar. So the mix is changing. Nevertheless, the momentum is very positive.
Novecare also demonstrated and delivered growth in a number of other markets, agro, proteins and other industrials. In our Technology Solutions business, we had some customer-specific issues in mining, which offset -- I'm talking about strikes and industry action, and that offset the new business developments that helped to maintain the profitability at a decent level.
Performance Chemicals had another strong quarter. EBITDA up 12%. Margins, a record 28%. Soda ash is performing very well, with volumes up, mainly sea-borne market. Bicarbonate continued double-digit growth, supported by the fruits of the investment in our new Thailand plant that we made last year. Peroxides benefited from the kicking in of the contract for our new HPPO plant in Saudi Arabia, which is now beginning to take effect, and we are entering the mechanical start-up phase of that project. Our 28% margin also reflects the maturity and the strength of our excellence programs in that segment.
Functional Polymers delivered a 34% increase in EBITDA. And there, we saw strong volume growth in polymers and intermediates, primarily for automotive applications, both in Europe and Asia. Here also, excellence programs strongly underpinned the performance, and we were able to successfully pass along increases in raw materials.
Turning to Slide 11. Our net income improved by 33%, EUR 70 million up on last year. And that reflects both the improvement in EBITDA growth as well as the reduction in the underlying tax rate from 31% to 25% last year. And that's largely driven by the evolution and the geographic mix of our pretax earnings in the quarter. We're not changing our guidance of around 30% at this stage but clearly welcome the performance at this stage.
As Jean-Pierre mentioned, cash is really a feature that we're particularly pleased with. And as you see on Page 12, our cash flow was very strong. In fact, as we mentioned, it's a record. The previous high was EUR 52 million, and you have to go back to Q1 2012. And so you can see, we're more than a 3x what we did previously there. It's not an accident, it comes from high profits, real attention to CapEx and working capital management, very, very strict, very diligent in delivering that performance. And we are still targeting an annual spend of about EUR 800 million on CapEx for the full year. And this is approaching parity with depreciation, entirely consistent with what we set out in our strategic roadmap when we spoke in September last year.
So all in all, a strong start to the year, both in terms of profits and cash. 
And with that, I turn you back to Jean-Pierre."

Regarding our priorities for 2017, no significant changes, very much in line with what we've shared you in the past similar calls, focused on portfolio optimization. We know that there are still a few things we need to do to continue on the track of upgrading our portfolio of activities. And we are indeed very focused to make sure that we can deliver on this.
Regarding the outlook. As I've mentioned at the beginning, and I think Karim has developed it, we see a strong start of a year, which is good. We are pleased to see that, indeed, volume growth is a key driver for the improvement of our performance, very much in line with our expectation. But it's good to see that materializing. Cargo functions are indeed doing well. And all of this gives us confidence that we should be able not only to deliver but probably to exceed on the EBITDA and cash outlook that we've provided some weeks ago. More importantly, probably, we are at the midpoint of the strategic guidance that we gave last year during our Capital Market Day.

I just wanted to check that, that does include the energy costs. And also, I wonder if you could give us a little bit of a flavor by division, please. It looked like the greatest pressures were in Advanced Formulations. I just want to confirm that. And secondly, on Advanced Formulations, the margin was pretty disappointing, I think, in the first quarter. It's interesting, you're talking about seeing some genuine pickup in oil and gas now. We've obviously seen some down trading in oil and gas areas. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about mix across the whole of the formulations activities, please. And then two, hopefully, smaller questions. In Specialty Polymers, can you give us some idea of the size of your EV battery exposure now, perhaps, in proportion of specialty polymer revenues or something like that to give us an idea of the impact of growth in the EV market? And finally, on the Sadara HPPO project. The -- you talked about mechanical startup. The sort of revenue step-up that we saw in the quarter, is that effectively the full contracted revenue that we should be expecting going forward? Or is there still more to go?"

So yes, indeed, input costs includes energy, obviously. But when we look at the -- of the mix of raw material and energy purchase that we do, we end up with what you see in our numbers. So don't underestimate the fact",534,"Okay. So a lot of pointed questions. So yes, indeed, input costs includes energy, obviously. But when we look at the -- of the mix of raw material and energy purchase that we do, we end up with what you see in our numbers. So don't underestimate the fact that for the portfolio transformation, we are less and less dependent on energy, which means that we buy less and less energy in various forms. So our sensitivity or exposure to energy has changed quite significantly in the past couple of years. Regarding Advanced Formulation, what I see today is more a bit of a mismatch in terms of timing between what's happening on the input cost and what's happening on the selling prices. I have a feeling that things will improve over the year. It will improve because we have just renegotiated some contract for our significant -- for some of our significant raw materials, mostly in the oil and chemical area, which will bring significant improvement in terms of competitiveness. And we are starting to see some impact coming from selling price adjustment, which we are doing probably a little bit late in comparison with input costs. So for me, no reason to worry there, just a bit of a mismatch, which is quite obvious when we look at this quarter margin. On Specialty Polymers, I mean, battery represents only a few percentage point of our total exposure, but it's a market which is growing very significantly. So yes, indeed, we are quite pleased with the development that we've seen for large batteries, mostly electric vehicle, but also stationary batteries. I'll remind you that we have a new PVDF facility, which will start up in China in the next months, probably during the summer. We've just finalized the mechanical completion on this plant. And this will give us a much more firepower to follow up on some opportunities that we see in the year linked to electric vehicle development in China. So a good niche to continue to grow our position in Specialty Polymers. So Sadara, the situation is rather simple. 2 elements. From a practical standpoint, we have produced the first batches in the past few days, so the unit is operating not yet at full capacity, but it's operating, which is good news. I remind you that we are part of a very large and complex industrial set-up. So we need to make sure that in the next few weeks the whole HPPO chain will be, indeed, up and running and moving up to reach full capacity. And the second element, which took place, is that we started the contractual arrangement, which is basically a take or pay contract, so it takes pay and we -- the starting point was December 2016, so it explains why we see actual contribution from Sadara during our Q1 results. Don't expect big changes over the next quarter regarding Sadara. Our view regarding the -- of the plant will operate gives us a feeling that we should continue to see similar levels of contribution for the Sadara project over the next few quarters. And I think with that, I probably covered all of your question."

If you took out the operational excellence, what would have been the variable cost inflation in the year? And the second question, just in terms of the fixed costs performance, which is, obviously -- how much of the Cytec synergies are in that -- are part of the negative 35 that's in your EBITDA bridge there? And lastly, on the others line, you mentioned several associated companies and a sale of small surplus assets, could you just elaborate a little bit on what happened in that component?

On the variable cost, I don't want to give too much, let's say, inordinate information or detail. What I can say to you is, excellence and synergies combined deliver more than EUR 50 million in this quarter, predominantly on variable costs but also impacting fixed costs. So the momentum that we saw last year that helped to build the strong performance last year is continuing. We also had a modest impact from -- favorable impact of less than EUR 10 million on foreign exchange that came and helped this quarter into the variable costs. So I hope that it helps you understand the key drivers that helped to produce the strength of the results in that perspective. When it comes to the others, the other contribution that you saw, fundamentally what we have is this: in last year we had some minor restructuring costs and precommissioning, preramp-up costs, which was more negative last year. This year, we had the favorable impact with some modest asset sales. We're talking less than EUR 10 million at time, no? And an increase in joint venture equity earnings, and that has quality which was a little bit [indiscernible] others. So the recovery, the positive dynamic we see on main businesses, we're seeing in our smaller equity JVs as well, and that's a contributor to the result.  Does that help, Thomas?"

Our synergies are concerned, and we are continuing to make progress with something which is going well. Pricing power, it's good that you're surprised, but I think it shows the liquidity of our portfolio. It shows also the fact that we are more and more moving into businesses where, indeed, the input costs are less important component than they used to be in some of the commodity businesses that we have divested. As I've mentioned, the segment where we've seen some impact is, clearly, Advanced Formulations. We expect the situation to improve over the year, over the next quarters. I will be cautious and probably I'm not ready to make a forecast on what will be the overall yearly pricing power impact, but I don't have any sign. But it should be degrading in the next quarter or 2, to try to help you get a feeling on where we are. So probably for the full year, something close to neutral would be a reasonable hypothesis made today. I mean we'll see how things will develop. By the way, something I've not mentioned when I was answering your previous question on input cost, is the fact as far as synergy is concerned, probably the area where we had the most pressure was coal for our soda ash business. It's clearly an area where we've suffered a bit from some unexpected spike in the price of coal. But overall, again, a situation where we've been, but we've been able to manage for pricing.

But once again, we've probably, as well prepared as you can for the situation. And what we've seen in the beginning of the year gives us a good feeling regarding the development. On functional polymer, dynamic is pretty positive. There is some inventory effect, and Karim will quantify that, but not major. What we see is a level of demand, which is good, linked to the automotive industry. And the fact that, as usual, some of our competitors are adding some production issues here and there. And as our plant tends to operate in a very reliable and efficient way, we have the ability to benefit from that. But again, a reasonably good development expected in front of us.

Advanced Formulation, yes, Technology Solutions was impacted by what mentioned, strikes in some copper mine. It stays a very good business in terms of margins and significantly above the group average and very significantly above the cluster average. But we've lost a few percentage point in the R&D situation. Frankly speaking, in our view, no reason to worry. We are very optimistic on the ability of this business to generate very, very solid margins for the remaining part of the year. And if I add once again to name 1 segment where we've suffered a bit, which explained this pressure on margin, it's probably the home and personal care segment of Novecare, a little bit also on the Aroma Performance. I would state, while the situation is relatively clear, if I may say so. Narrow-body, our single-aisle planes, order books are filled for both for Boeing and Airbus. I mean, Airbus, they are not able to deliver on any new -- they are not able to take orders for delivery before 2022. Boeing is in a similar situation, so the challenge is really production. There we are seeing a very steep increase in the number of planes produced. And indeed, they Airbus and Boeing had some production issues. I mean some of them were made the headlines, so I don't -- there's no need to comment which are slowing down production, actual productions. We are seeing the situation improving, but our understanding is that we are not yet at the level of production, heights that these OEMs would expect. So there are several opportunities in front of us. A little bit differently from our competitor Excel. We tend to think that the inventories in the supply chain has been taken care of, so we suffered from that last year, some adjustment along those, in some cases, complex supply chain. We think that this is a 2016 phenomena. On wide-body, it's where the market is a bit soft. Waiting for new planes coming online, the 777X is a good -- from Boeing is a good example. So there we are seeing a little bit of reduced activities compensated by a good development on the military side and the F45 ramp up rate, which is improving. But clearly, the area where we suffered still in Q1 is the nonaerospace segments, which is a number of very different markets, from wind energy to automotive. And there, we continued to work to make sure that we can improve the performance of these nonaerospace segment within our composite material. But overall, very optimistic about the development of composite overall for the year, but we are still in an area -- we are still in a period where supply chains are adjusting and people are planning to understand how they can increase their rates, which will mean more business in front of us, but challenges short term."

And the third question is a more general one on the auto side, given that you're somewhat exposed to other different parts of the auto value chains. It looks like your volumes in autos have been broadly up 10% or 11%. Obviously, car sales in Q1 were up only 3%. Are you not worried about an inventory stocking cycle which will bite us in the rest of the year?"

And as we entered into 2017, we think that inventories in the supply chain that we serve are at a very normal level. So we don't expect any more impact linked to inventory. Silica pricing, it's a business where we have some -- in most of our contracts, some price inflators which are linked to energy costs, so there is a bit of a delay in the -- as far as the impact of this price inflators or deflators, inflator in this case, so we are suffering from this delay, but we expect the situation to improve in terms of pricing in Q2. We are indeed start seeing some changes in this market, but in the segment where we focus ourselves, which are really the technology, the more technology advanced Silica formulation, we continue to enjoy a very strong position, very good relationship with key customers, and we have the ability that we can continue to enjoy a very solid opportunities in these segments. Auto, we are reasonably confident. I mean, what we understand is that there has been a bit of another production or a bit of another stocking, mostly in China, by the way, linked to the expectation that some new government incentives will be put in place, but we think that the growth in automotive industry is solid. And I remind you that the difference between the overall automotive industry growth and what we see at Solvay is linked to the fact that we are gaining market shares and continue to gain market share. New cars have more polymers than the older ones, and this explain why we continue indeed to enjoy the solid growth in this segment."

And we are very pleased to have this opportunity to share with you the highlights of our second quarter results. We'll use the usual structure. I will make an introduction. Karim will come with a bit more detail. We'll try to keep it relatively short, so that we can have as much time as necessary for the Q&A session.
Clearly, a strong momentum continuing into Q2. Volume growth is indeed a record driver for our EBITDA growth. And we are very pleased to see that all 4 segments contributing to sales and profit growth in the quarter. 
Sales increased, as you've seen, by 11%. And again, the key driver is volume growth, which is what we were expecting, but we are pleased to see that this is indeed materializing, and that's something which demonstrate that, indeed, our strategy is paying off.
18% EBITDA growth. We have a one-time event which is linked to Cytec integration synergies. We underline the benefit of the Cytec teams to the policy of Solvay. This generated a EUR 38 million one-off impact, a positive impact on our EBITDA, and we'll see the consequences materializing in cash over the next few years. Once again, the key driver was higher volume. And this took place in businesses which have been growing for quite some number of quarters, but we've seen also the situation of a couple of businesses, which shut off last year, turning that is the case for oil and gas in North America, and this was also the case for our smart device position. 
Our costs grew with our capacity expansion, but of course, through our excellence measures that we have put in place helped offset the inflation. Overall, new record operating margin at 23%, which puts us probably in the leading seat within the European headquarter diversified chemical companies. 
And as you've seen in our presentation, we wanted to present on financial, but there are also extract financial metrics, and [indiscernible] CapEx reduction is probably the one which is the most important for us, and you see that we continue also to improve on this metric, and we are very much in line with the strategic commitments that we have shared with you when we had our Capital Market Day in London almost a year ago.
Maybe just a word on Cytec, Karim will comment the various clusters. But on Cytec, cost synergies are now at a run rate, which is approximately EUR 115 million, which is really at the top end of the expectations that we've shared with you. The focus now is on generating revenue synergies, and we have several project underway, and we are already seeing some actual impact on some market. The fact that we are becoming, I would say, more global in this business, Cytec tend to be a little bit U.S. focused, and now we are really -- our ambition is really to be a global player in this market, which is already bringing some new revenues. And we have some technology development, the most promising one being around the thermoplastic composite.
Talking of composite, we are starting to see a turnaround in composite for aerospace. We've seen some growth this quarter. June was the strongest sales month since we have owned the business. And this is very much linked to one of the improvement in production of singular aircraft, both at Boeing and at Airbus. These very large players have experienced over the past year a number of difficulties in their manufacturing operations, so they are improving, as you might have seen, and we are benefiting from that. In the context where we don't see much inventory movement in the supply chain, there was some inventory reduction last year that have impacted us, but now we've seen the supply chain is quite lean in terms of inventory, and we are benefiting directly from what's happening in the beginning of a chain. And on top of that, a couple of very successful program, the F-45 and relief engine, which are in a -- which are at a very aggressive stroke in terms of increasing in production rate, and we are benefiting from that.
I guess I'm very pleased, and I have to admit it, with our performance in the first half. I think the strategy that we've put in place over the past years is indeed delivering. And the fact that we see a strong growth as being a strong volume growth as being the driver of our EBITDA growth is something which gives us assurance that we've built indeed a strong and solid growth engines within Solvay's portfolio. 
With that, I would like to turn to Karim to go into a bit more detail insights on our financial performance."

As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis, and I will refer to a few slides that are available on our website.

As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis, and I will refer to a few slides that are available on our website. 
I'll start with our top line growth, our systems growth development percent, and I'm on page -- on Slide 10, you will see the facts and the figures there. 
Maybe just highlight the fact that this is the third consecutive quarter where we've now seen sales growth. And that dynamic is very, very encouraging as far as we're concerned. Volumes, as Jean-Pierre alluded to, contributes the vast majority of that with 8% of that growth, but it's also good to know the contribution that pricing has contributed as well in terms of the 2.8%, mainly in the Polyamide business. 
 
But it's EBITDA where I'd like to focus the most of our time today, and perhaps invite you to turn to Slide #11. 
And beyond the facts of EBITDA being up 11%, we like to highlight is the volumes I referred to contributed to EUR 96 million to the growth in EBITDA, and that was partially offset by fixed cost increases. Now clearly, as we drive volume growth, we have also been investing in new capacity. So for example, if I look at the 3 most notable capacity increases in in the peak plant in Georgia in the states, which actually serves our smart devices market, the carbon fiber expansion within South Carolina, all of that comes at a cost, and that's why you see a cost increase there as well.
Pricing did contribute a positive impact of 5%. Again, that has helped not the least by our excellence programs, as well as successful price increase initiatives. 
I do want to draw your attention to one item on the profit bridge, which is the EUR 27 million positive Other. And that includes the EUR 38 million of one-time synergies in the U.S. whereas in Q2 last year, you may recall that we had a one-time gain of EUR 11 million, resulting from the sale of surplus assets in soda ash. 
That's the overall picture. 
If I turn to the individual segments. 
Advanced Materials. EBITDA up 22%, a record EBITDA margin, 31%. So where does that come from? Specialty Polymers has sustained its broad-based growth in a number of markets, again, led by a strong demand in the automotive sector, but we also saw some acceleration of growth in smart devices. Remembering, however, that the first half of last year was somewhat subdued, not least because of the destocking impacts that you will no doubt recall. 
Jean-Pierre has already mentioned the positive momentum in the composite business. And he is explained to you how the production increases we're seeing in singular leap and the joint strike fighter are really beginning to show themselves and to our bottom line.
But there's more. Advance formulations grew 5.2%, and EBITDA margin was sequentially flat at 17%. As we explained last quarter, the activity levels in the oil and gas markets are improving. And this is positively impacting our Novecare business, driving sales up 24% in the quarter. We also benefited from increased demand in the agricultural market.
Turning to technology solutions. 
Customer specific issues in mining were offset with new business developments in that business. Performance Chemicals had a decent quarter, with 1% EBITDA growth, whilst sustaining a very strong margin of 29%. Where is it coming from? Peroxides was a significant contributor in the quarter with the startup of the operation for HPPO in Saudi. Soda ash remains steady, and in fact, we saw slight volume increases, mainly in the seaborne market, whereas bicarbonate continues to grow supported by the investment that we made in the new Thailand plant. Also, you remember that soda ash benefited this time last year from that one-time gain on the sale of surplus assets of EUR 11 million. Functional Polymers, very superb result in this quarter, driven by -- well, it had a 57% EBITDA increase, driven by 2 factors: strong demand in auto and price increases that passed through the cost increases that we experienced earlier in the year.
But there is more to our delivery this quarter than just EBITDA. If you turn to Page 12, Slide 12, you notice that our net income is up 38%. Now not that does reflect the EBITDA increase, but also 2 other things: one, a drop in financial charges; and 2, a reduction in our underlying tax rate from 30% last year to 26% this year. And this is driven largely by the evolution in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings.
Cash. On Page 12, you will see the picture on debt and cash. And there's a few things I'd like to highlight here. One is the fact that our free cash flow in the first half of this year from our continuing businesses doubled from EUR 123 million to EUR 245 million. It's coming from a number of factors: higher profit clearly, but also, a very strong discipline on working capital. Our working capital intensity is remaining flat compared to last year, despite an 11% increase in revenues. Now that takes some doing, and so we're really pleased with that continuing discipline. Clearly, we also have the reduction in capital expenditures, but that shouldn't be a surprise, that's exactly where we thought we would be at this stage. 
So all in all, we're very pleased with the operational and cash flow performance of the quarter. 
Debt is down materially. At [ this half year ] You may recall that the seasonal nature, the profile of our cash generation is very much back ended. And we see a much stronger profile in this first half, but M&A has contributed just under EUR 1 billion of net proceeds, that obviously helps to reduce our debt by EUR 800 million when compared to 31 of December 2016.
Now finally, and before I forget, I just want to highlight the fact that you may have picked up already that in May, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BBB flat from BBB-. I really welcome this as an independent indication and validation of the portfolio progress, and fundamentally, of the real improvement, and the strength of our cash generation and our resilience of the balance sheet. 
And with that, I hand the floor back over to Jean-Pierre."

So just a couple of comments before opening the Q&A. 
First one, on project priorities, and I think that it, indeed, besides what we've presented in terms of numbers for our Q2 results, we are continuing to make progress, which are worth noting. We are at the midpoint of our 2016-2018 strategic roadmap, the one we have commented in our last Capital Market Day at this point. So we are on track to deliver on our midterm objective, and I feel confident that the company will indeed be able to achieve or exceed the objectives that we shared with you almost a year ago. 
I would really like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees, and I appreciate the fact that our customer indeed are putting us. We are more and more focused on a large program, which are absolutely key to the success of our customers, being smart devices, being airplanes, being automotives, and the ability to deliver new solutions to our customer is key, and we can do that only if they trust us, and this is the case.
Regarding portfolio upgrade, we have taken some significant actions, and you've seen that we've been very focused on closing the transactions that we have announced at the end of last year or early this year. We remain focused on remaining opportunities, that makes it all, but the portfolio movement expected in '17 would be more in the direction of divestitures, so we are looking at opportunities. We are not yet at the point of time where we can share with you any actual news, but be confident that we are indeed continuing to work on these opportunities.
2017 outlook, how do we see the rest of the year? Well, we continue to -- expect to continue to see a sequential improvement which will be linked to volume growth, especially from core growth engines in Advanced Material and advanced formulation. We have to be aware of what was the profile for 2017 -- 2016, sorry. 2016 is a  year in which we had adverse slow first half and a more dynamic second half, so the comparison will be a little bit different in the first and the second half. Taking our performance and expectations into account, we have decided to raise our full year EBITDA estimate to grow by high single-digit [indiscernible] taking into account the current situation in various core parameters, including exchange rates.

First, in the advanced formulations business, if we strip out the Cytec pension gain, you did see some margin pressure there. We've seen that a number of your peers in sort of in the surfactants formulations area. Can you talk about what you're doing and the confidence you have in regaining lost margin from input costs, please? And perhaps, give us some point as to on the mining side, when you think tech solutions is going to start to recover. That's still lagging, I think, some of your longer-term growth expectations. Secondly, in Performance Chemicals, obviously, a very focused on what's going on in soda ash. Accepting that the annual contract situation, you're still enjoying a pretty strong volumes on the market and spot markets. Are you seeing that the initial Turkish volumes, the expansion at soda, are you seeing any evidence of those volumes in the spot markets? And are you feeling any or seeing any signs of pre-marketing from the signer capacity, please? And then perhaps just a final question on the guidance. You indicated that the first quarter stage that you hope -- you expected to meet or exceed your mid-single-digit guidance. So you're already pointing towards a high-single digit. You've just got the -- this EUR 38 million one-off, which adds close to 2 percentage points. I mean Is it a simple case of, in your mind, adding that EUR 38 million? Or are you more confident in the underlying performance as well?"

Let's start with your last question, because the answer is already, in fact, we knew that the EUR 38 million would take place this year. We didn't know at which quarter because there were some accounting complexity there. So for us, it's not something new. It's new for you, but it's not for us. So indeed, the increase, a sequential increase in guidance for mid-single to over mid-single and now to high single is really -- demonstrate our the fact that we've gained confidence in the volume growth. And yes, today, we feel very confident to share our this high single digit guidance with you. On the advanced Formulation business, we've seen a bit of margin pressure. There is 2 element, one which is linked to Novecare, and this is very much the [Audio Gap] price situations, so we've suffered, as we said in the Q1 call, we suffered from chemical, not only increase, but volatility, the chemical prices which put pressure on margin, delayed, in some cases, our customer orders. What we've done, and it's something that we started, in fact, a year ago. We have renegotiated 2 very large contract for chemical access, which will give us extra competitiveness, so we feel reasonably confident that, indeed, over the course of the second half, we'll see margin increasing. On mining, we have also -- on technology solution, I should say, we have seen also a bit of a pressure on margin, which was mostly linked, in fact, to some difficulties, operational difficulties that our customers were facing strikes or various technical difficulties and which impacted our ability to deliver, and that's an impact on margin. are normalizing fair, so yes, I would expect the Advanced Formulation, first of all, to improve its margin over the course of the next couple of quarter. Regarding soda ash, to try to be specific as possible, you might know that our Turkish competitors are working on 2 different project. There was a first extension of 0.5 million [ turn a year ] which is done and in the markets, so it was in the market already for Q1. And then there is a second project which will come online in the remaining part of '17 and mostly in 2018. This project has been expected for quite some time. And for the last 3 or 4 years, we've been discussing about this. We have prepared ourselves as much as we could. And indeed, I think other good delivery of soda ash, I can probably take the rather, a good delivery of soda ash for the first half of the year, sure, that we are, indeed, well prepared and able to do the most out of the current market condition, taking into account a bit more competitive pressure. So very much what we've said. There will be an impact when all these Turkish capacity will go in the market, but we think that we'll be able to weather this impact with some pressure on our margins, but not for such a long period of time. And again, our confidence on our ability to manage this situation is probably a bit better today than it was 6 months ago."

Karim, I know that you flagged that, actually, working capital was more or less flattish in the first half of the year, but it tended to spike from what I see in Q2.

So does the payment terms change when a supplier like that, I would like to understand this a bit. And then the second one, well, actually perhaps I have 3, I'm sorry. The second one would be on automotive. We see a lot of players was somewhere in the supply chain actually being a bit more cautious on the second part of the year. So what is your stand on that one? And what does that mean for your businesses in both Specialty Polymers and Polyamide? And then a third one, perhaps, you'll start to feel that I'm obsessed with that, but it's oil and gas. We have seen the rig counts, well, actually increasing since May last year, but it seems to be slowing down as from June, somewhere like that. And I was wondering how you feel for the second half for oil and gas. And should we expect that, well, less support, I would say, is not to say a negative price mix to persist in the second part of the year?"

Receivables, 1.7 against 1.7. Payables, 1.323 this year compared to 1.25 last year. So these are the facts. If you look at working capital intensity, so taking total working capital to sales, we're about 3%, in fact, 2.9% better than last year. Last year, I did flag the fact that we had an exceptional receivable in respect of INOVYN and our accelerated exit. So on a like-for-like basis, it's very, very similar. If I look at the internal metrics, and we look at this every month. I look at day sales outstanding, I look at overdues. This time last year, I did say, too, that we'd set a new record. You know what? I wish I hadn't said it because I'm going to say that this year is a new record. So all the key operational KPIs and indicators are flashing green in that respect. And finally, to give you an order of magnitude. If you look at our working capital and add up all the gross sums, you're talking EUR 4.7 billion of gross working capital. To try and predict the manage driven, 1% of accuracy is EUR 15 million-ish. So I look at this performance, I look at it not just in a monthly basis, on a quarterly basis, but at the real strength.

Automotive, we have to realize that a little bit like Solvay results, the overall performance of the automotive sector last year was a little bit back ended. I mean the second half was stronger than the first half. And then the comparison will become a little bit more challenging. This being said, we continued to see a strength in this business. And we are not expecting any meaningful change in this time for the second half. It was probably a bit of stocking in the very beginning of the year in China. We've seeing that this is now -- when these starts now went to the market. So overall, a good level of confidence, knowing again that the comparable will be a bit more difficult so if you look at the quarter -- in the same quarter of 2 consecutive years difference, it will be probably a bit less pronounced in the year in the second half. So oil and gas, it's clearly to market. I have to be cautious on the comment I made. But the situation on the ground looks good. Yes, it is a little busy, the increase in rig count as the speed of increase in rig count has diminished, and it has been, I think, a bit flattish on the last few weeks. This being said, there was a number of wells which we have drilled during the first half, for which there was no fracturing done, so we think that this simulation job will come. We've seen the oil and gas supply chain in the U.S. working very, very hard to improve its overall competitiveness. And our view today is that, in the current oil price condition, activity will continue at quite a sustained rate. I was commenting in the past 2 quarterly call that we've seen some negative mix effect. I mean people moving out of the expensive graph, formulation to friction reducers. We continued to be very successful in friction reducers, but we start to see inquiries, interest in [indiscernible] solutions. So we think that the opportunity will continue to be significant on the ground for our oil and gas position in North America at the current oil price. We are continuing to work on diversification. China, Argentina, Russia offers interesting opportunity. We have some businesses there. But China, just to make sure that we can grow with the operations that are developing in the different parts of the world. But overall, the feeling that oil and gas will continue to be a core driver for the second half of the year."

So yes, indeed, we're seeing that this very good level of performance will continue for Functional Polymer. On composite it, I don't want to quantify the impact that we expect on aerospace. But we will see a -- we will continue to see strong ramp up in F-35, strong ramp up in leap engine. If I listen to our customers, Airbus and Boeing will continue to see the [indiscernible] production developing very well in the context where there is almost no inventory movement in the supply chain, and we'll continue to have a negative impact on the large body aircraft, mostly the A380 and the 777, waiting for the new version, the 777X, which will be a plus for us. So overall, we expect to continue to see growth in composite for aerospace during the second half of the year, and obviously, into 2018.

So Sadara, I mean if I'm a little bit , I would say, we are not so much interested in the operational performance because we have a take or pay contract which secures our profitability. This being said, since the end of April, we've seen the chain operating reasonably well for circular new complex. There was a few hiccups here and there. But overall, a good performance. And again, we are in a situation where we are protected by a take or pay contract, which started, in fact, in December 2016. Specialty polymer, I don't want to comment too much on the smart device market. We tend to be exposed to one customer, and I don't want to share information, but this specific customer. I would just say that this product life cycle plays very much in our favor for the next quarters, because we expect to see new models being launched, and this is always a period which creates opportunities for us in terms of ramp up of new production. But yes, since the end of 2016, we've seen this market turning, and this is a contributor to the growth of the group, and it will continue to be a contributor. And by the way, we are all focused customers at least on new product, but we are going in a situation where there will probably be a broader range of product, with existing product being continuing and new product coming, and we have also a strong position on existing product which will continue to be produced in the next quarters. CapEx, no, you should not expect to see a rebound in CapEx. We still have a number of plants which are not, in fact, that they are beginning to produce. Just to name a few which are important for us. Our peak facility in the U.S., we are still in a ramp-up mode, which means that we have capacity available in front of us, so yes, we will be pleased to fill it up quickly, but not to a point where we would be willing to add new capacity soon. Same comment on the facility that we are starting up in China, as we speak. It will come online at the right amount of time because the battery market in China is boiling because of the fast development of electric vehicles, so this facility will ramp up pretty quickly, but not to a point where we're building at new extension. I can continue to comments on for aerospace, new facility in the U.K. is starting. It's starting to produce the qualification batches, which will be needed to have the facility approved, so it will take probably another year before its operational in the sense of generating commercial sales. But as we see, I think we have a quite a nice cause in front of us, where we [ treated hours ] to continue to grow with the existing asset. If I -- I mean, I could continue the example, but growth in terms of carbon fiber, we have now a capacity available in North America. Our facility will be there to support the growth Of F-35, Leap engine and the new 777X. So overall, no need for new CapEx, for I would say, an increase in our CapEx budget for the next 2, 3 years. On the contrary, we probably expect to be able to continue to slightly diminish our CapEx. We've said all the time that our objective was to align CapEx on depreciation. We are still a little bit higher. But clearly, with a lot of capacity available to supply the increase in volumes that we see coming from our customers."

So first question, frankly speaking, I don't see Boeing becoming a chemical company. So my understanding, although I have not seen the specific announcement you're referring to is that we had a few difficulties in the 787 production linked to the fact that we have had a very complex supply-chain with a lot of partners, so they might be referring to the fact that they want to in-source some elements of the supply chain. For composite, we will need to -- they will need to continue to work with their existing supplier because there is no other particular options. So I would probably welcome directionally the fact that they have the most simple supply chain. Regarding M&A, just to be clear, I mean I've said that significant M&A could be only take the form of divestment in 2017. If you look at acquisition, we are always interested in looking at add-on acquisition which could allow us to increase our position in Advanced Material or Advanced Formulation, either by bringing a new technology or bringing a specific market access. But this would lead to a small transaction, I mean, a couple of hundreds of millions. But even after having said that, I don't have currently on my desk any file of this size. So don't expect us to be very active on the acquisition side of the equation in the next 12 to 18 months. I think the focus is very much, when finalizing the portfolio transformation, full divestment if the opportunity arise. And second, very much focusing on internal improvement. I think there is a lot we can do to generate topline synergies in Advanced Materials.

When I see us in the first half at 26%. It's fair to say that for this year at least coming in under 30% is a plausible outcome. But let's be clear, it doesn't take much to create 1% of variability. 1% is less than EUR 50 million.

But our view is that we have currently a portfolio which fits very well with our expectation. I think we've been to very strong growth engine in Advanced Material. We have a very good position in chemistry/advanced formulation. The real challenge for us is to make sure that we work, one, on generating growth. We have a number of innovation project or top line synergy project that we want to bring to fruition, and we need the resources to do that, one. Second, I think that there is a need for Solvay at this point of time to look at all the business support part of the organization and look at how we can align them very well with the current portfolio, the current business model and the current set of customers. This also is taking a bit of time and resources, starting with, and it's the reason why I'm telling you, don't expect big movement in terms of acquisition. I think the priority is really to increase or improve our position in the 2 growth engines that we have today. I could see very specific opportunities to bring in new technologies. I don't know a new polymer, for example, or buying a company which gives us specific access to some difficult to access market. But this would be a rather small opportunities.

But there will be some slight impact due to inventory devaluation, in this case, I mentioned that we had some inventory revaluation during Q2. But again, broadly speaking, the business will continue to perform well because the fundamental are strong. But on composite, I would refrain from giving you a number in terms of expected profile. Actually, the inventory movement that we've seen last year are behind us. Now what we see are the real impact of accepting the programs. I think the equation conceptually is rather simple. Strong growth in F-35, strong growth in LEAP, a significant growth in A320neo and the Boeing 737Max, and some moderation in A380 and Boeing 777 until the 777H is launched. And then still some work to do, a part on the industrial material composite business, within aerospace where we had a bit of a, I would say, mediocre performance for the first half of the year. And it's an area where we need to fixing, I mean either by improving the commercial performance or by adjusting our cost base. So we are working on that.

I'm here in Brussels with Karim Hajjar and Kimberly. And we are very pleased to have this opportunity to share with you the highlights of our second quarter results.

And we are very pleased to have this opportunity to share with you the highlights of our second quarter results. We'll use the usual structure. I will make an introduction, Karim will come with a bit more detail. We'll try to keep it relatively short so that we can have as much time as necessary for the Q&A session.
Clearly, a strong momentum continuing into Q2. Volume growth is indeed the key driver for our EBITDA growth. And we are very pleased to see that all 4 segments contributing to sales and profit growth in the quarter. Sales increased, as you've seen, by 11%. And again, the key driver is volume growth, which is what we were expecting, but we are pleased to see that this is indeed materializing. And that's something which demonstrates that indeed our strategy is paying off.
18% EBITDA growth. With a one-time event, which is linked to Cytec integration synergies, we underline the benefit of the Cytec teams to the policy of Solvay. This generated a EUR 38 million one-off impact, a positive impact on our EBITDA. And we'll see the consequences materializing in cash over the next few years. Once again, the key driver was higher volume. And this took place in businesses which have been growing for quite some number of quarters. 
But we've seen also the situation of a couple of businesses, which shut off last year, turning. And this is the case for oil and gas in North America. And this was also the case for our smart device position. Our costs grew with our capacity expansion. But operational excellence measures that we have put in place helped offset the inflation. Overall, new record operating margin at 23%, which puts us probably in the leading seat within the European-headquartered diversified chemical companies. 
And as you've seen in our presentation, we wanted to present not only financial but also extra financial metrics. And greenhouse gases reduction is probably the one which is the most important for us. And you see that we continue also to improve on this metric, and we are very much in line with the strategic commitments that we have shared with you when we had our Capital Market Day in London almost a year ago.
Maybe just a word on Cytec. Karim will comment the various clusters. But on Cytec, cost synergies are now at a run rate which is approximately EUR 115 million, which is really at the top end of the expectations that we've shared with you. The focus now is on generating revenue synergies. And we have several projects underway. And we are already seeing some actual impact on some markets. The fact that we are becoming, I would say, more global in this business, Cytec tends to be a little bit U.S.-focused. And now we are really -- our ambition is really to be a global player in this market, which is already bringing some new revenues. And we have some technology development, the most promising one being around the thermoplastic composite.
Talking of composite, we are starting to see a turnaround in composite for aerospace. We've seen some growth this quarter. June was the strongest sales month since we have owned the business. And this is very much linked to one of the improvement in production of single-aisle aircraft both at Boeing and Airbus. These very large players have experienced over the past year a number of difficulties in their manufacturing operations. So they are improving, as you might have seen, and we are benefiting from that. 
In the context where we don't see much inventory movement in the supply chain, there were some inventory reduction last year that have impacted us. But now we've seen the supply chain is quite lean in terms of inventory. And we are benefiting directly from what's happening in the beginning of a chain. And on top of that, a couple of very successful programs, the F-35 and the LEAP engine, which are in a -- which are at a very aggressive slope in terms of increasing in production rate. And we are benefiting from that.
I guess I'm very pleased, and I have to admit it, with our performance in the first half. I think the strategy that we've put in place over the past few years is indeed delivering. And the fact that we see a strong growth as being -- the strong volume growth as being the driver of our EBITDA growth is something which gives us assurance that we have built indeed strong and solid growth engines within Solvay's portfolio. 
With that, I would like to turn to Karim to go into a bit more detailed insights on our financial performance."
377837,532067638,1260711,"Solvay SA, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2017",2017-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thank you, Jean-Pierre. As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis. And I will refer to a few slides that are available on our website. I'll start with our top line growth, our sales growth of 11%. And on page -- on Slide 10,",1064,"Thank you, Jean-Pierre. As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis. And I will refer to a few slides that are available on our website. 
I'll start with our top line growth, our sales growth of 11%. And on page -- on Slide 10, you will see the facts and the figures there. Maybe just highlight the fact that this is the third consecutive quarter where we've now seen sales growth. And that dynamic is very, very encouraging so far as we are concerned. Volumes, as Jean-Pierre alluded to, contributes the vast majority of that with 8% of that growth. But it's also good to know the contribution that pricing has contributed as well in terms of the 2.8%, mainly in the Polyamide business. 
 
But it's EBITDA where I'd like to focus most of our time today and perhaps invite you to turn to Slide #11. And beyond the facts of EBITDA being up 11%, what I'd like to highlight is the volumes referred to contributed to EUR 96 million to the growth in EBITDA. And that was partially offset by fixed cost increases. Now clearly, as we drive volume growth, we have also been investing in new capacity. So for example, if I look at the 3 most notable capacity increases in Sadara; in the PEEK plants in Georgia and the States, which has to service smart devices market; the carbon fiber expansion within South Carolina, all of that comes at a cost. And that's why you see cost increase there as well.
Pricing did contribute a positive impact of 5%. Again, that has helped not the least by our excellence programs as well as successful price increase initiatives. I do want to draw your attention to one item on the profit bridge, which is the EUR 27 million positive other. And that includes the EUR 38 million of one-time synergies in the U.S. whereas in Q2 last year, you may recall that we had a one-time gain of EUR 11 million resulting from the sale of surplus assets in soda ash. That's the overall picture. 
If I turn to the individual segments, Advanced Materials. EBITDA up 22%, a record EBITDA margin, 31%. So where does that come from? Specialty Polymers has sustained its broad-based growth in a number of markets, again led by strong demand in the automotive sector. But we also saw some acceleration of growth in smart devices. Remembering, however, that the first half of last year was somewhat subdued, not least because of the destocking impacts that you will no doubt recall. Jean-Pierre has already mentioned the positive momentum in the composite business and has explained to you how the production increases we're seeing in single aisle, in LEAP, in the Joint Strike Fighter are really beginning to show themselves down to our bottom line.
But there's more. Advanced Formulations grew 5.2% and EBITDA margin was sequentially flat at 17%. As we explained last quarter, the activity levels in the oil and gas markets are improving. And this is positively impacting our Novecare business, driving sales up 24% in the quarter. We also benefited from increased demand in the agricultural market. Turning to Technology Solutions, customer-specific issues in mining were offset with new business developments in that business. 
Performance Chemicals had a decent quarter with 1% EBITDA growth while sustaining a very strong margin of 29%. Where is it coming from? Peroxides was a significant contributor in the quarter with the startup of the Sadara operation for HPPO in Saudi. Soda ash remained steady. And in fact, we saw slight volume increases, mainly in the seaborne market whereas bicarbonate continues to grow, supported by the investment that we made in the new Thailand plant. Also you remember that soda ash benefited this time last year from that one-time gain from the sale of surplus assets of EUR 11 million. Functional Polymers, very superb result in this quarter, driven by -- well, it had a 57% EBITDA increase, driven by 2 factors: strong demand in auto and price increases that passed through the cost increases that we experienced earlier in the year.
But there is more to our delivery this quarter than just EBITDA. If you turn to Page 12, Slide 12, you'll notice that our net income is up 38%. Now not only does that reflect the EBITDA increase, but also 2 other things: one, a drop in financial charges; and two, a reduction in our underlying tax rate from 30% last year to 26% this year. And this is driven largely by the evolution in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings.
Cash. On Page 12, you will see the picture on debt and cash. And there's a few things that I'd like to highlight here. One is the fact that our free cash flow in the first half of this year from our continuing businesses doubled from EUR 123 million to EUR 245 million. It's coming from a number of factors, higher profits clearly but also very strong discipline on working capital. Our working capital intensity is remaining flat compared to last year despite an 11% increase in revenues. Now that takes some doing. And so we're really pleased with that continuing discipline. Clearly, we also have the reduction in capital expenditures. But that shouldn't be a surprise, that's exactly where we thought we would be at this stage. So all in all, we're very pleased with the operational cash flow performance of the quarter. 
Debt is down materially. At the [ half year ], you may recall that the seasonal nature, the profile of our cash generation is very much back-ended. And we see a much stronger profile in this first half. But M&A has contributed just under EUR 1 billion of net proceeds. That obviously helps to reduce our debt by EUR 800 million when I compare it to 31st of December 2016.
Now finally, and before I forget, I just want to highlight the fact that you may have picked up already that in May, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BBB flat from BBB-. I really welcome this as an independent indication and validation of the portfolio progress and fundamentally of the real improvement in the strength of our cash generation and the resilience of our balance sheet. 
And with that, I hand the floor back to Jean-Pierre."

We are not yet at a point of time where we can share with you any actual news. But be confident that we are indeed continuing to work on these opportunities.
2017 outlook. How do we see the rest of the year? Well, we continue to -- expect to continue to see sequential improvement, which will be linked to volume growth, especially from our core growth engines in Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulations. We have to be aware of what was the profile of 2017 -- 2016. 2016 is a  year in which we had a very slow first half and a more dynamic second half. So the comparison will be a little bit different in the first and second half. Taking our performance and expectations into account, we have decided to raise our full year EBITDA estimate to grow by high single-digit, taking into account the current situation in various macro parameters, including exchange rates.
And with that, we are ready, Karim and myself, to take your questions. Thank you very much."

First, in the Advanced Formulations business, if we strip out the Cytec pension gain, you did see some margin pressure there. We've seen that at a number of your peers in sort of in the surfactant formulations area. Can you talk about what you're doing and the confidence you have in regaining lost margin from input costs, please? And perhaps give us some pointers, too, the mining side, when you think tech solutions is going to start to recover. That's still lagging, I think, some of your longer-term growth expectations. Secondly, in Performance Chemicals, obviously very focused on what's going on in soda ash. Accepting the annual contract situation, you're still enjoying pretty strong volumes on the seaborne market and spot markets. Are you seeing that the initial Turkish volumes, the expansion at Eti Soda, are you seeing any evidence of those volumes in the spot markets? And are you feeling any or seeing any signs of premarketing from the Ciner capacity, please? And then perhaps just a final question on the guidance, you indicated at the first quarter stage that you hope -- you expected to meet or exceed your mid-single-digit guidance. So you're already pointing towards high single digits. You've just got this EUR 38 million one-off, which adds close to 2 percentage points. I mean, is it a simple case of, in your mind, adding that EUR 38 million? Or are you more confident in the underlying performance as well?"

In fact, we knew that the EUR 38 million would take place this year. We didn't know at which quarter because there were some accounting complexity there. So for us, it's not something new. It's new for you, but it's not for us. So indeed, the increase, the sequential increase in guidance for mid-single to over mid-single and now to high single is really -- demonstrate the fact that we've gained confidence in the volume growth. And yes, today, we feel very confident to share this high single-digit guidance with you. On the Advanced Formulations business, we've seen a bit of margin pressure. There's 2 elements, one which is linked to Novecare. And this is very much the raw material price situation. So we've suffered -- as we said in the Q1 call, we suffered from oleochemical, not only increase but volatility, oleochemical prices, which put pressure on margin, delayed, in some cases, our customer orders. What we've done, and it's something that we started, in fact, a year ago, we have renegotiated 2 very large contracts for oleochemical access, which will give us extra competitiveness. So we feel reasonably confident that indeed over the course of the second half, we'll see margin increasing. On mining, we have also -- on Technology Solutions, I should say, we have seen also a bit of a pressure on margin, which was mostly linked, in fact, to some difficulties, operational difficulties that our customers were facing, strikes or various technical difficulties, and which impacted our ability to deliver. And that's an impact on margin. Things are normalizing there. So on the whole, yes, I would expect the Advanced Formulations cluster to improve its margin over the course of the next couple of quarters. Regarding soda ash, to try to be as specific as possible, you might know that our Turkish competitors are working on 2 different projects. There was a first extension of 0.5 million tonne a year, which is done and in the market. So it was in the market already for Q1. And then there is a second project, which will come online in the remaining part of '17 and mostly in 2018. This project has been expected for quite some time. And for the last 3 or 4 years, we've been discussing about this. We have prepared ourselves as much as we could. And indeed, I think a rather good delivery of soda ash, I can probably take the rather -- of a good delivery of soda ash for the first half of the year, sure, that we are indeed well prepared and able to do the most out of the current market condition, taking into account a bit more competitive pressure. So very much what we said, there will be an impact when all this Turkish capacity will be on the market. But we think that we'll be able to weather this impact with some pressure on our margins but not for such a long period of time. And again, our confidence on our ability to manage this situation is probably a bit better today than it was 6 months ago."

Karim, I know that you flagged that actually working capital was more or less flattish in the first half of the year. But it tended to spike from what I see in Q2. So can you elaborate a bit what it was driven by? Because I do not have the impression when I look at your balance sheet that it was driven by an inventory buildup. So did the payment terms change with your supplier or something like that? I would like to understand this a bit. And then the second one -- well, actually perhaps I have 3, I'm sorry. The second one would be on automotive. We see a lot of players who are somewhere in the supply chain actually being a bit more cautious on the second part of the year. So what is your stand from that one? And what does that mean for your businesses in both Specialty Polymers and Polyamide? And then the third one, perhaps you'll start to feel that I am obsessed with that, but that's on oil and gas. We have seen the rig counts, well, actually increasing since May last year. But it seems to be slowing down as from June, somewhere like that. And I was wondering how you feel for the second half for oil and gas. And should we expect that, well, less support, I would say is, not to say a negative price mix to persist in the second part of the year?"

If you look at working capital intensity, so taking total working capital to sales, we're about 3%, in fact 2.9% better than last year. Last year, I did flag the fact that we had an exceptional receivable in respect of INOVYN and our accelerated exit. So on a like-for-like basis, it's very, very similar. If I look at the internal metrics, and we look at this every month, I look at day sales outstanding, I look at overdues. This time last year, I did say, too, that we'd set a new record. You know what? I wish I hadn't said it because I'm going to say that this year is a new record. So all the key operational KPIs and indicators are flashing green in that respect. And finally, to give you an order of magnitude. If you look at our working capital and add up all the gross sums, you're talking EUR 4.7 billion of gross working capital. To try and predict and manage to even 1% of accuracy is EUR 50 million-ish. So I look at this performance, I look at it not just on a monthly basis, on a quarterly basis, but I see real strength.

So automotive and oil and gas, automotive, we have to realize that a little bit like Solvay results, the overall performance of the automotive sector last year was a little bit back-ended. I mean, the second half was stronger than the first half. And then the comparison will become a little bit more challenging. This being said, we continue to see strength in this business. And we are not expecting any meaningful change in this time for the second half. It was probably a bit of stocking in the very beginning of the year in China. We've seeing that this is now -- when this starts now into the market. So overall, a good level of confidence, knowing again that the comparable will be a bit more difficult. So if you look at quarter -- in the same quarter of 2 consecutive years' difference, it will be probably a bit less pronounced in the year in the second half. So oil and gas, it's clearly a volatile market. I have to be cautious on the comment I've made. But the situation on the ground looks good. Yes, there is little -- the increase in rig count as -- the speed of increase in rig count has diminished. And it has been, I think, a bit flattish on the last few weeks. This being said, there was a number of wells which we have drilled during the first half for which there was no fracturing done. So we think that this simulation job will come. We've seen the oil and gas supply chain in the U.S. working very, very hard to improve its overall competitiveness. And our view today is that in the current oil price condition, activity will continue at quite a sustained rate. I was commenting in the past 2 quarterly calls that we've seen some negative mix effect, I mean, people moving out of the expensive guar-derivatized formulation to friction reducers. We continue to be very successful in friction reducers. But we start to see inquiries, interest into these guar-derivatized solutions. So we think that the opportunity will continue to be significant on the ground for our oil and gas position in North America at the current oil price. We are continuing to work on diversification. China, Argentina, Russia offers interesting opportunities. We have some businesses there. The challenge is to make sure that we can grow with the operations that are developing in these different parts of the world. But overall, the feeling that oil and gas will continue to be a core driver for the second half of the year."

So yes, indeed we are seeing that this very good level of performance will continue for Functional Polymer. On composite, I don't want to quantify the impact that we expect on aerospace. But we will see a -- we will continue to see strong ramp-up in F-35, strong ramp-up in LEAP engine. If I listen to our customers, Airbus and Boeing will continue to see the single-aisle production developing very well in the context where there's almost no inventory movement in the supply chain and will continue to have a negative impact on the large body aircraft, mostly the A380 and the 777, waiting for the new version, the 777X, which will be a plus for us. So overall, we expect to continue to see growth in composite for aerospace during the second half of the year and obviously into 2018.

So Sadara, I mean, if I'm a little bit a provocateur, I would say we are not so much interested in the operational performance because we have a take-or-pay contract which secures our profitability. This being said, since the end of April, we've seen the chain operating reasonably well for such a large and new complex. There was a few hiccups here and there but overall, a good performance. And again, we are in a situation where we are protected by a take-or-pay contract, which started, in fact, in December 2016. Specialty Polymers, I don't want to comment too much on the smart device market. We tend to be exposed to one customer. And I don't want to share information about this specific customer. I would just say that this product lifecycle plays very much in our favor for the next quarters because we expect to see new models being launched. And this is always a period which creates opportunities for us in terms of a ramp-up of new production. But yes, since the end of 2016, we've seen this market turning. And this is a contributor to the growth of the group and it will continue to be a contributor. And by the way, we are all focused on or some of us at least on new product. But we are going in a situation where there will probably be a broader range of products with existing products being continuing and new products coming. And we have also a strong position on existing products, which will continue to be produced in the next quarters. CapEx, no, you should not expect to see a rebound in CapEx. We still have a number of plants which are not filled up, in fact, that they are beginning to produce. Just to name a few which are important for us. Our PEEK facility in the U.S., we are still in a ramp-up mode, which means that we have capacity available in front of us. So yes, we will be pleased to fill it up quickly but not to a point where we would be willing to add new capacity soon. Same comment on the PVDF facility that we are starting up in China as we speak. It will come online at the right amount of time because the battery market in China is boiling because of the fast development of electric vehicles. So this facility will ramp up pretty quickly but not to a point where we're building at new extension. I can continue the comments on [indiscernible] for aerospace, our new facility in the U.K. is starting. It's starting to produce the qualification batches, which will be needed to have the facility approved. So it will take probably another year before it's operational in the sense of generating commercial sales. But as you see, I think we have quite a nice cause in front of us, which will allow us to continue to grow with existing assets. If I -- I mean, I could continue the example. The growth in terms of carbon fiber, we have now capacity available in North America. Our Östringen facility will be there to support the growth of F-35, LEAP engine and the new 777X. So overall, no need for new CapEx or I would say an increase in our CapEx budget for the next 2, 3 years. On the contrary, we probably expect to be able to continue to slightly diminish our CapEx. We've said several times that our objective was to align CapEx and depreciation. We are still a little bit higher but clearly with a lot of capacity available to supply the increase in volumes that we see coming from our customers."

So first question, frankly speaking, I don't see Boeing becoming a chemical company. So my understanding, although I have not seen the specific announcement you're referring to, is that they had a few difficulties in the 787 production linked to the fact that we have had a very complex supply chain with a lot of partners. So they might be referring to the fact that they want to in-source some elements of this supply chain. For composite, they will need to continue to work with their existing supplier because there is no other particular options. So I would probably welcome directionally the fact that they have the most simple supply chain. Regarding M&A, just to be clear, I mean, I've said that significant M&A could only take the form of divestments in 2017. If you look at acquisition, we are always interested in looking at add-on acquisitions, which could allow us to increase our position in Advanced Materials or Advanced Formulations, either by bringing a new technology or bringing a specific market access. But this would lead to a small transaction, I mean, a couple of hundreds of millions. But even after having said that, I don't have currently on my desk any file of this size. So don't expect us to be very active on the acquisition side of the equation in the next 12 to 18 months. I think the focus is very much when finalizing the portfolio transformation, full divestment if the opportunity arise, and second, very much focusing on internal improvement. I think there's a lot we can do to generate top line synergies in Advanced Materials. There's a lot we can do to simplify the overall organization of the company.

Clearly, as we generate the kind of cash levels we have and we retire debt, yes, you can expect over time a reduction in our financial targets. On tax rates, our strategic guidance is around 30%. We're not going to change it just opportunistically. But it's fair to say that when I see last year at 28%, when I see us in the first half at 26%, it's fair to say that for this year, at least coming in under 30% is a plausible outcome. But let's be clear, it doesn't take much to create 1% of variability. 1% is less than EUR 50 million. So it's like a relatively small change in our geographic pool of taxable profits consuming it. But I do feel that coming in under 30% is a realistic expectation at this stage for this year."

On M&A, I think if I understood well your question, in fact, there was a bit of static on the line when you talked, but our view is that we have currently a portfolio which fits very well with our expectation. I think we have built a very strong growth engine in Advanced Materials. We have a very good position in surface chemistry/Advanced Formulations. The real challenge for us is to make sure that we work, one, on generating growth. We have a number of innovation project or top line synergy project that we want to bring to fruition. And we need resources to do that, one. Second, I think that there is a need for Solvay at this point of time to look at all the business support part of the organization and look at how we can align them very well with the current portfolio, the current business model and the current set of customers. This also is taking a bit of time and resources, starting with [indiscernible]. And it's the reason why I'm telling you don't expect big movement in terms of acquisition. I think the priority is really to increase or improve our position in the 2 growth engines that we have today.

In this case, I mentioned that we had some inventory revaluation during Q2. But again, broadly speaking, the business will continue to perform well because the fundamentals are strong. But on composite, I would refrain from giving you a number in terms of expected growth rate. I've seen the inventory movement that we've seen last year are behind us. Now what we see are the real impact of what's happening in the programs. I think the equation conceptually is rather simple, strong growth in F-35, strong growth in LEAP, significant growth in A320neo and the Boeing 737 MAX and some moderation in A380 and Boeing 777 until the 777X is launched. And then still some work to do, a part on the industrial material composite business with non-aerospace where we had a bit of a, I would say, mediocre performance for the first half of the year. And it's an area where we need to fixing, I mean, either by improving the commercial performance or by adjusting our cost base. So we are working on that. So I will ask you probably to be a bit patient before we give you a bit more visibility on what it means in terms of growth rate. But clearly, we are going out of a difficult zone in which we were a year ago. When I say difficult, I don't want to overemphasize that, but I would say the challenging situation where inventory reduction was playing against us. We think that this is behind us now and we are back to growth rate which are close to what we were expecting when we've made this acquisition."

And we are very pleased to have this opportunity to share with you the highlights of our second quarter results. We'll use the usual structure. I will make an introduction, Karim will come with a bit more detail. We'll try to keep it relatively short so that we can have as much time as necessary for the Q&A session.
Clearly, a strong momentum continuing into Q2. Volume growth is indeed the key driver for our EBITDA growth. And we are very pleased to see that all 4 segments contributing to sales and profit growth in the quarter. Sales increased, as you've seen, by 11%. And again, the key driver is volume growth, which is what we were expecting, but we are pleased to see that this is indeed materializing. And that's something which demonstrates that indeed our strategy is paying off.
18% EBITDA growth. We have a one-time event, which is linked to Cytec integration synergies, we underline the benefit of the Cytec teams to the policy of Solvay. This generated a EUR 38 million one-off impact, a positive impact on our EBITDA. And we'll see the consequences materializing in cash over the next few years. Once again, the key driver was higher volume. And this took place in businesses which have been growing for quite some number of quarters. 
But we've seen also the situation of a couple of businesses, which shut off last year turning. This is the case for oil and gas in North America. And this was also the case for our smart device position. Our costs grew with our capacity expansion. But operational excellence measures that we have put in place helped offset the inflation. Overall, new record operating margin at 23%, which puts us probably in the leading seat within the European-headquartered diversified chemical companies. 
And as you've seen in our presentation, we wanted to present not only financial but also extra financial metrics. And greenhouse gases reduction is probably the one which is the most important for us. And you see that we continue also to improve on this metric, and we are very much in line with the strategic commitments that we have shared with you when we had our Capital Market Day in London almost a year ago.
Maybe just a word on Cytec. Karim will comment the various clusters. But on Cytec, cost synergies are now at a run rate which is approximately EUR 115 million, which is really at the top end of the expectations that we've shared with you. The focus now is on generating revenue synergies. And we have several projects underway. And we are already seeing some actual impact on some markets. The fact that we are becoming, I would say, more global in this business, Cytec tends to be a little bit U.S.-focused. And now we are really -- our ambition is really to be a global player in this market, which is already bringing some new revenues. And we have some technology development, the most promising one being around the thermoplastic composite.
Talking of composite, we are starting to see a turnaround in composite for aerospace. We've seen some growth this quarter. June was the strongest sales month since we have owned the business. And this is very much linked to one of the improvement in production of single-aisle aircraft both at Boeing and Airbus. These very large players have experienced over the past year a number of difficulties in their manufacturing operations. So they are improving, as you might have seen, and we are benefiting from that. 
In the context where we don't see much inventory movement in the supply chain, there were some inventory reduction last year that have impacted us. But now we've seen the supply chain is quite lean in terms of inventory. And we are benefiting directly from what's happening in the beginning of a chain. And on top of that, a couple of very successful programs, the F-35 and the LEAP engine, which are in a -- which are at a very aggressive slope in terms of increasing in production rate. And we are benefiting from that.
I guess I'm very pleased, and I have to admit it, with our performance in the first half. I think the strategy that we've put in place over the past few years is indeed delivering. And the fact that we see a strong growth as being -- the strong volume growth as being the driver of our EBITDA growth is something which gives us assurance that we have built indeed strong and solid growth engines within Solvay's portfolio. 
With that, I would like to turn to Karim to go into a bit more detailed insights on our financial performance."
377837,532067638,1261126,"Solvay SA, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2017",2017-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thank you, Jean-Pierre. As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis. And I will refer to a few slides that are available on our website. I'll start with our top line growth, our sales growth of 11%. And on page -- on Slide 10,",1063,"Thank you, Jean-Pierre. As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis. And I will refer to a few slides that are available on our website. 
I'll start with our top line growth, our sales growth of 11%. And on page -- on Slide 10, you will see the facts and the figures there. Maybe just highlight the fact that this is the third consecutive quarter where we've now seen sales growth. And that dynamic is very, very encouraging so far as we are concerned. Volumes, as Jean-Pierre alluded to, contributes the vast majority of that with 8% of that growth. But it's also good to know the contribution that pricing has contributed as well in terms of the 2.8%, mainly in the Polyamide business. 
 
But it's EBITDA where I'd like to focus most of our time today and perhaps invite you to turn to Slide #11. And beyond the facts of EBITDA being up 11%, what I'd like to highlight is the volumes referred to contributed to EUR 96 million to the growth in EBITDA. And that was partially offset by fixed cost increases. Now clearly, as we drive volume growth, we have also been investing in new capacity. So for example, if I look at the 3 most notable capacity increases in Sadara; in the PEEK plants in Georgia in the States, which actually serve the smart devices market; the carbon fiber expansion within South Carolina, all of that comes at a cost. And that's why you see cost increase there as well.
Pricing did contribute a positive impact of 5%. Again, that is helped not the least by our excellence programs as well as successful price increase initiatives. I do want to draw your attention to one item on the profit bridge, which is the EUR 27 million positive other. And that includes the EUR 38 million of one-time synergies in the U.S. whereas in Q2 last year, you may recall that we had a one-time gain of EUR 11 million resulting from the sale of surplus assets in soda ash. That's the overall picture. 
If I turn to the individual segments, Advanced Materials. EBITDA up 22%, a record EBITDA margin, 31%. So where does that come from? Specialty Polymers has sustained its broad-based growth in a number of markets, again led by strong demand in the automotive sector. But we also saw some acceleration of growth in smart devices. Remembering, however, that the first half of last year was somewhat subdued, not the least because of the destocking impacts that you will no doubt recall. Jean-Pierre has already mentioned the positive momentum in the composite business and has explained to you how the production increases we're seeing in single aisle, in LEAP, in the Joint Strike Fighter are really beginning to show themselves down to our bottom line.
But there's more. Advanced Formulations grew 5.2% and EBITDA margin was sequentially flat at 17%. As we explained last quarter, the activity levels in the oil and gas markets are improving. And this is positively impacting our Novecare business, driving sales up 24% in the quarter. We also benefited from increased demand in the agricultural market. Turning to Technology Solutions, customer-specific issues in mining were offset with new business developments in that business. 
Performance Chemicals had a decent quarter with 1% EBITDA growth while sustaining a very strong margin of 29%. Where is it coming from? Peroxides was a significant contributor in the quarter with the startup of the Sadara operation for HPPO in Saudi. Soda ash remained steady. And in fact, we saw slight volume increases, mainly in the seaborne market whereas bicarbonate continues to grow, supported by the investment that we made in the new Thailand plant. Also you remember that soda ash benefited this time last year from that one-time gain from the sale of surplus assets of EUR 11 million. Functional Polymers, very superb result in this quarter, driven by -- well, it had a 57% EBITDA increase, driven by 2 factors: strong demand in auto and price increases that passed through the cost increases that we experienced earlier in the year.
But there is more to our delivery this quarter than just EBITDA. If you turn to Page 12, Slide 12, you'll notice that our net income is up 38%. Now not only does that reflect the EBITDA increase, but also 2 other things: one, a drop in financial charges; and two, a reduction in our underlying tax rate from 30% last year to 26% this year. And this is driven largely by the evolution in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings.
Cash. On Page 12, you will see the picture on debt and cash. And there's a few things that I'd like to highlight here. One is the fact that our free cash flow in the first half of this year from our continuing businesses doubled from EUR 123 million to EUR 245 million. It's coming from a number of factors, higher profits clearly but also very strong discipline on working capital. Our working capital intensity is remaining flat compared to last year despite an 11% increase in revenues. Now that takes some doing. And so we're really pleased with that continuing discipline. Clearly, we also have the reduction in capital expenditures. But that shouldn't be a surprise, that's exactly where we thought we would be at this stage. So all in all, we're very pleased with the operational cash flow performance over the quarter. 
Debt is down materially. At the last year, you may recall that the seasonal nature, the profile of our cash generation is very much back-ended. And we see a much stronger profile in this first half. But M&A has contributed just under EUR 1 billion of net proceeds. That obviously helps to reduce our debt by EUR 800 million when I compare it to 31st of December 2016.
Now finally, and before I forget, I just want to highlight the fact that you may have picked up already that in May, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BBB flat from BBB-. I really welcome this as an independent indication and validation of the portfolio progress and fundamentally of the real improvement in the strength of our cash generation and the resilience of our balance sheet. 
And with that, I hand the floor back to Jean-Pierre."

We remain focused on remaining opportunities, a mix of [ all come in ]. But the portfolio movement expected in '17 would be more in the direction of divestitures, so we are looking at opportunities. We are not yet at a point of time where we can share with you any actual news. But be confident that we are indeed continuing to work on these opportunities.
2017 outlook. How do we see the rest of the year? Well, we continue to -- expect to continue to see sequential improvement, which will be linked to volume growth, especially from our core growth engines in Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulations. We have to be aware of what was the profile of 2017 -- 2016. 2016 is a  year in which we had a very slow first half and a more dynamic second half. So the comparison will be a little bit different in the first and second half. Taking our performance and expectations into account, we have decided to raise our full year EBITDA estimate to grow by high single-digit, taking into account the current situation in various macro parameters, including exchange rates.
And with that, we are ready, Karim and myself, to take your questions. Thank you very much."

First, in the Advanced Formulations business, if we strip out the Cytec pension gain, you did see some margin pressure there. We've seen that at a number of your peers in sort of in the surfactant formulations area. Can you talk about what you're doing and the confidence you have in regaining lost margin from input costs, please? And perhaps give us some pointers, too, the mining side, when you think tech solutions is going to start to recover. That's still lagging, I think, some of your longer-term growth expectations. Secondly, in Performance Chemicals, obviously everybody's very focused on what's going on in soda ash. Excepting the annual contract situation, you're still enjoying pretty strong volumes on the seaborne market and spot markets. Are you seeing that the initial Turkish volumes, the expansion at Eti Soda, are you seeing any evidence of those volumes in the spot markets? And are you feeling any or seeing any signs of premarketing from the Ciner capacity, please? And then perhaps just a final question on the guidance, you indicated at the first quarter stage that you hope -- you expected to meet or exceed your mid-single-digit guidance. So you're already pointing towards high single digits. You've just got this EUR 38 million one-off, which adds close to 2 percentage points. I mean, is it a simple case of, in your mind, adding that EUR 38 million? Or are you more confident in the underlying performance as well?"

In fact, we knew that the EUR 38 million would take place this year. We didn't know at which quarter because there were some accounting complexity there. So for us, it's not something new. It's new for you, but it's not for us. So indeed, the increase, the sequential increase in guidance for mid-single to over mid-single and now to high single is really -- demonstrate our -- the fact that we've gained confidence in the volume growth. And yes, today we feel very confident to share this high single-digit guidance with you. On the Advanced Formulations business, we've seen a bit of margin pressure. There's 2 elements, one which is linked to Novecare. And this is very much the raw material price situation. So we've suffered -- as we said in the Q1 call, we suffered from oleochemical, not only increase but volatility, oleochemical prices, which put pressure on margin, delayed, in some cases, our customer orders. What we've done, and it's something that we started, in fact, a year ago, we have renegotiated 2 very large contracts for oleochemical access, which will give us extra competitiveness. So we feel reasonably confident that indeed over the course of the second half, we'll see margin increasing. On mining, we have also -- on Technology Solutions, I should say, we have seen also a bit of a pressure on margin, which was mostly linked, in fact, to some difficulties, operational difficulties that our customers were facing, strikes or various technical difficulties, and which impacted our ability to deliver. And that's an impact on margin. Things are normalizing there. So overall, yes, I would expect the Advanced Formulations cluster to improve its margin over the course of the next couple of quarters. Regarding soda ash, to be -- try to be as specific as possible, you might know that our Turkish competitors are working on 2 different projects. There was a first extension of 0.5 million tonne a year, which is done and in the market. So it was in the market already for Q1. And then there is a second project, which will come online in the remaining part of '17 and mostly in 2018. This project has been expected for quite some time. And for the last 3 or 4 years, we've been discussing about this. We have prepared ourselves as much as we could. And indeed, I think the rather good delivery of soda ash, I can probably take the rather -- a good delivery of soda ash for the first half of the year show that we are indeed well prepared and able to do the most out of the current market condition, taking into account a bit more competitive pressure. So very much what we said, there will be an impact when all this Turkish capacity will be on the market. But we think that we'll be able to weather this impact with some pressure on our margins but not for such a long period of time. And again, our confidence on our ability to manage this situation is probably a bit better today than it was 6 months ago."

Karim, I know that you flagged that actually working capital was more or less flattish in the first half of the year. But it tended to spike from what I see in Q2. So can you elaborate a bit what it was driven by? Because I do not have the impression when I look at your balance sheet that it was driven by an inventory buildup. So did the payment terms change with your supplier or something like that? I would like to understand this a bit. And then the second one -- well, actually perhaps I have 3, I'm sorry. The second one would be on automotive. We see a lot of players who are somewhere in the supply chain actually being a bit more cautious on the second part of the year. So what is your stance on that one? And what does that mean for your businesses in both Specialty Polymers and Polyamide? And then the third one, perhaps you'll start to feel that I am obsessed with that, but it's on oil and gas. We have seen the rig counts, well, actually increasing since May last year. But it seems to be slowing down as from June, somewhere like that. And I was wondering how you feel for the second half for oil and gas. And should we expect that, well, less support, I would say, not to say a negative price mix, to persist in the second part of the year?"

If you look at working capital intensity, so taking total working capital to sales, we're about 3%, in fact 2.9% better than last year. Last year, I did flag the fact that we had an exceptional receivable in respect of INOVYN and our accelerated exit. So on a like-for-like basis, it's very, very similar. If I look at the internal metrics, and we look at this every month, I look at day sales outstanding, I look at overdues. This time last year, I did say, too, that we'd set a new record. You know what? I wish I hadn't said it because I'm going to say that this year is a new record. So all the key operational KPIs and indicators are flashing green in that respect. And finally, to give you an order of magnitude. If you look at our working capital and add up all the gross sums, you're talking EUR 4.7 billion of gross working capital. To try and predict and manage to even 1% of accuracy is EUR 50 million-ish. So I look at this performance, I look at it not just on a monthly basis, on a quarterly basis, but I see real strength.

So automotive and oil and gas, automotive, we have to realize that a little bit like Solvay results, the overall performance of the automotive sector last year was a little bit back-ended. I mean, the second half was stronger than the first half. And then the comparison will become a little bit more challenging. This being said, we continue to see strength in this business. And we are not expecting any meaningful change in this time for the second half. It was probably a bit of stocking in the very beginning of the year in China. We think that this is now when this stock now enter the market. So overall, a good level of confidence, knowing again that the comparable will be a bit more difficult. So if you look at quarter -- in the same quarter of 2 consecutive years' difference, it will be probably a bit less pronounced in the year -- in the second half. So oil and gas, it's clearly a volatile market. So I have to be cautious on the comment I've made. But the situation on the ground looks good. Yes, there is little -- the increase in rig count has -- the speed of increase in rig count has diminished. And it has been, I think, a bit flattish on the last few weeks. This being said, there was a number of wells which we have drilled during the first half for which there was no fracturing done. So we think that this stimulation job will come. We've seen the oil and gas supply chain in the U.S. working very, very hard to improve its overall competitiveness. And our view today is that in the current oil price condition, activity will continue at quite a sustained rate. I was commenting in the past 2 quarterly call that we've seen some negative mix effect, I mean, people are moving out of the expensive guar-derivatized formulation to friction reducers. We continue to be very successful in friction reducers. But we start to see inquiries, interest into these guar-derivatized solutions. So we think that the opportunities will continue to be significant on the ground for our oil and gas position in North America at the current oil price. We are continuing to work on diversification. China, Argentina, Russia offers interesting opportunities. We have some businesses there. The challenge is to make sure that we can grow with the operations that are developing in these different parts of the world. But overall, the feeling that oil and gas will continue to be a core driver for the second half of the year."

So yes, indeed we are -- we think that this very good level of performance will continue for Functional Polymer. On composite, I don't want to quantify the impact that we expect on aerospace. But we will see a -- we will continue to see strong ramp-up in F-35, strong ramp-up in LEAP engine. If I listen to our customers, Airbus and Boeing will continue to see the single-aisle production developing very well in the context where there's almost no inventory movement in the supply chain and will continue to have a negative impact on the large body aircraft, mostly the A380 and the 777, waiting for the new version, the 777X, which will be a plus for us. So overall, we expect to continue to see growth in composite for aerospace during the second half of the year and obviously into 2018.

So Sadara, I mean, if I'm a little bit a provocateur, I would say we are not so much interested in the operational performance because we have a take-or-pay contract which secures our profitability. This being said, since the end of April, we've seen the chain operating reasonably well for such a large and new complex. There was a few hiccups here and there but overall, a good performance. And again, we are in a situation where we are protected by a take-or-pay contract, which started, in fact, in December 2016. Specialty Polymers, I don't want to comment too much on the smart device market. We tend to be exposed to one customer. And I don't want to share information about this specific customer. I would just say that this product lifecycle plays very much in our favor for the next quarters because we expect to see new models being launched. And this is always a period which creates opportunities for us in terms of a ramp-up of new production. But yes, since the end of 2016, we've seen this market turning. And this is a contributor to the growth of the group and it will continue to be a contributor. And by the way, we are all focused on or some of us at least on new product. But we are going in a situation where there will probably be a broader range of products with existing products being continuing and new products coming. And we have also a strong position on existing products, which will continue to be produced in the next quarters. CapEx, no, you should not expect to see a rebound in CapEx. We still have a number of plants which are not filled up, in fact, that they are beginning to produce. Just to name a few which are important for us. Our PEEK facility in the U.S., we are still in a ramp-up mode, which means that we have capacity available in front of us. So yes, we will be pleased to fill it up quickly but not to a point where we would be willing to add new capacity soon. Same comment on the PVDF facility that we are starting up in China as we speak. It will come online at the right amount of time because the battery market in China is boiling because of the fast development of electric vehicles. So this facility will be -- ramp up pretty quickly but not to a point where we'd be looking at new extension. I can continue the comments on [indiscernible] for aerospace, our new facility in the U.K. is starting. It's starting to produce the qualification batches, which will be needed to have the facility approved. So it will take probably another year before it's operational in the sense of generating commercial sales. But as you see, I think we have quite a nice course in front of us, which will allow us to continue to grow with existing assets. If I -- I mean, I could continue the example. The growth in terms of carbon fiber, we have now capacity available in North America. Our Östringen facility will be there to support the growth of F-35, LEAP engine and the new 777X. So overall, no need for new CapEx, for -- I would say an increase in our CapEx budget for the next 2, 3 years. On the contrary, we probably expect to be able to continue to slightly diminish our CapEx. We've said several times that our objective was to align CapEx and depreciation. We are still a little bit higher but clearly we've a lot of capacity available to supply the increase in volumes that we see coming from our customers."

So first question, frankly speaking, I don't see Boeing becoming a chemical company. So my understanding, although I have not seen the specific announcement you're referring to, is that they had a few difficulties in the 787 production linked to the fact that they had a very complex supply chain with a lot of partners. So they might be referring to the fact that they want to in-source some elements of this supply chain. For composite, they will need to continue to work with their existing supplier because there is no other particular options. So I would probably welcome directionally the fact that they have the more simple supply chain. Regarding M&A, just to be clear, I mean, I've said that significant M&A could only take the form of divestments in 2017. If you look at acquisition, we are always interested in looking at add-on acquisitions, which could allow us to increase our position in Advanced Materials or Advanced Formulations, either by bringing a new technology or bringing a specific market access. But this would lead to a small transaction, I mean, a couple of hundreds of millions. But even after having said that, I don't have currently on my desk any file of this size. So don't expect us to be very active on the acquisition side of the equation in the next 12 to 18 months. I think the focus is very much when finalizing the portfolio transformation, full divestment if the opportunity arise, and second, very much focusing on internal improvement. I think there's a lot we can do to generate top line synergies in Advanced Materials. There's a lot we can do to simplify the overall organization of the company.

Clearly, as we generate the kind of cash levels we have and we retire debt, yes, you can expect over time a reduction in our financial charges. On tax rates, our strategic guidance is around 30%. We're not going to change it just opportunistically. But it's fair to say that when I see last year at 28%, when I see us in the first half at 26%, it's fair to say that for this year, at least coming in under 30% is a plausible outcome. But let's be clear, it doesn't take much to create 1% of variability. 1% is less than EUR 50 million. So it's like a relatively small change in our geographic pool of taxable profits consuming it. But I do feel that coming in under 30% is a realistic expectation at this stage for this year."

On M&A, I think if I understood well your question, in fact, there was a bit of static on the line when you talked, but our view is that we have currently a portfolio which fits very well with our expectation. I think we have built a very strong growth engine in Advanced Materials. We have a very good position in surface chemistry/Advanced Formulations. The real challenge for us is to make sure that we work, one, on generating growth. We have a number of innovation project or top line synergy project that we want to bring to fruition. And we need the resources to do that, one. Second, I think that there is a need for Solvay at this point of time to look at all the business support part of the organization and look at how we can align them very well with the current portfolio, the current business model and the current set of customers. This also is taking a bit of time and resources, starting with [ COMAC ]. And it's the reason why I'm telling you don't expect big movement in terms of acquisition. I think the priority is really to increase or improve our position in the 2 growth engines that we have today. I could see very specific opportunities to bring in new technologies, I don't know, a new polymer, for example, or buying a company which gives us specific access to some difficult-to-access market. But this would be rather small opportunities. And yes, I think we need to get ready for maybe the next stage. But the next stage is, as I've said, a little bit distant in terms of timing."

In this case, I mentioned that we had some inventory revaluation during Q2. But again, broadly speaking, the business will continue to perform well because the fundamentals are strong. But on composite, I would refrain from giving you a number in terms of expected growth rate. I think the inventory movement that we've seen last year are behind us. Now what we see are the real impact of what's happening in the programs. I think the equation conceptually is rather simple, strong growth in F-35, strong growth in LEAP, significant growth in A320neo and the Boeing 737 MAX and some moderation in A380 and Boeing 777 until the 777X is launched. And then still some work to do, a part on the industrial material composite business with non-aerospace where we had a bit of a, I would say, mediocre performance for the first half of the year. And it's an area where we need to fix things, I mean, either by improving the commercial performance or by adjusting our cost base. So we are working on that. So I will ask you probably to be a bit patient before we give you a bit more visibility on what it means in terms of growth rate. But clearly, we are going out of the difficult zone in which we were a year ago. When I say difficult, I don't want to overemphasize that, but I would say the challenging situation where inventory reduction was playing against us. We think that this is behind us now and we are back to growth rate which are close to what we were expecting when we've made this acquisition."

And we are very pleased to have this opportunity to share with you the highlights of our second quarter results. We'll use the usual structure. I will make an introduction, Karim will come with a bit more detail. We'll try to keep it relatively short so that we can have as much time as necessary for the Q&A session.
Clearly, a strong momentum continuing into Q2. Volume growth is indeed the key driver for our EBITDA growth. And we are very pleased to see that all 4 segments contributing to sales and profit growth in the quarter. Sales increased, as you've seen, by 11%. And again, the key driver is volume growth, which is what we were expecting, but we are pleased to see that this is indeed materializing. And that's something which demonstrates that indeed our strategy is paying off.
18% EBITDA growth. We have a one-time event, which is linked to Cytec integration synergies, we underline the benefit of the Cytec teams to the policy of Solvay. This generated a EUR 38 million one-off impact, a positive impact on our EBITDA. And we'll see the consequences materializing in cash over the next few years. Once again, the key driver was higher volume. And this took place in businesses which have been growing for quite some number of quarters. 
But we've seen also the situation of a couple of businesses, which shut off last year turning. This is the case for oil and gas in North America. And this was also the case for our smart device position. Our costs grew with our capacity expansion. But operational excellence measures that we have put in place helped offset the inflation. Overall, new record operating margin at 23%, which puts us probably in the leading seat within the European-headquartered diversified chemical companies. 
And as you've seen in our presentation, we wanted to present not only financial but also extra financial metrics. And greenhouse gases reduction is probably the one which is the most important for us. And you see that we continue also to improve on this metric, and we are very much in line with the strategic commitments that we have shared with you when we had our Capital Market Day in London almost a year ago.
Maybe just a word on Cytec. Karim will comment the various clusters. But on Cytec, cost synergies are now at a run rate which is approximately EUR 115 million, which is really at the top end of the expectations that we've shared with you. The focus now is on generating revenue synergies. And we have several projects underway. And we are already seeing some actual impact on some markets. The fact that we are becoming, I would say, more global in this business, Cytec tends to be a little bit U.S.-focused. And now we are really -- our ambition is really to be a global player in this market, which is already bringing some new revenues. And we have some technology development, the most promising one being around the thermoplastic composite.
Talking of composite, we are starting to see a turnaround in composite for aerospace. We've seen some growth this quarter. June was the strongest sales month since we have owned the business. And this is very much linked to one of the improvement in production of single-aisle aircraft both at Boeing and Airbus. These very large players have experienced over the past year a number of difficulties in their manufacturing operations. So they are improving, as you might have seen, and we are benefiting from that. 
In the context where we don't see much inventory movement in the supply chain, there were some inventory reduction last year that have impacted us. But now we've seen the supply chain is quite lean in terms of inventory. And we are benefiting directly from what's happening in the beginning of a chain. And on top of that, a couple of very successful programs, the F-35 and the LEAP engine, which are in a -- which are at a very aggressive slope in terms of increasing in production rate. And we are benefiting from that.
I guess I'm very pleased, and I have to admit it, with our performance in the first half. I think the strategy that we've put in place over the past few years is indeed delivering. And the fact that we see a strong growth as being -- the strong volume growth as being the driver of our EBITDA growth is something which gives us assurance that we have built indeed strong and solid growth engines within Solvay's portfolio. 
With that, I would like to turn to Karim to go into a bit more detailed insights on our financial performance."
377837,532067638,1262654,"Solvay SA, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2017",2017-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thank you, Jean-Pierre. As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis. And I will refer to a few slides that are available on our website. I'll start with our top line growth, our sales growth of 11%. And on page -- on Slide 10,",1063,"Thank you, Jean-Pierre. As usual, the numbers I'm going to discuss are on an underlying basis. And I will refer to a few slides that are available on our website. 
I'll start with our top line growth, our sales growth of 11%. And on page -- on Slide 10, you will see the facts and the figures there. Maybe just highlight the fact that this is the third consecutive quarter where we've now seen sales growth. And that dynamic is very, very encouraging so far as we are concerned. Volumes, as Jean-Pierre alluded to, contributes the vast majority of that with 8% of that growth. But it's also good to know the contribution that pricing has contributed as well in terms of the 2.8%, mainly in the Polyamide business. 
 
But it's EBITDA where I'd like to focus most of our time today and perhaps invite you to turn to Slide #11. And beyond the facts of EBITDA being up 11%, what I'd like to highlight is the volumes referred to contributed to EUR 96 million to the growth in EBITDA. And that was partially offset by fixed cost increases. Now clearly, as we drive volume growth, we have also been investing in new capacity. So for example, if I look at the 3 most notable capacity increases in Sadara; in the PEEK plants in Georgia in the States, which actually serve the smart devices market; the carbon fiber expansion within South Carolina, all of that comes at a cost. And that's why you see cost increase there as well.
Pricing did contribute a positive impact of 5%. Again, that is helped not the least by our excellence programs as well as successful price increase initiatives. I do want to draw your attention to one item on the profit bridge, which is the EUR 27 million positive other. And that includes the EUR 38 million of one-time synergies in the U.S. whereas in Q2 last year, you may recall that we had a one-time gain of EUR 11 million resulting from the sale of surplus assets in soda ash. That's the overall picture. 
If I turn to the individual segments, Advanced Materials. EBITDA up 22%, a record EBITDA margin, 31%. So where does that come from? Specialty Polymers has sustained its broad-based growth in a number of markets, again led by strong demand in the automotive sector. But we also saw some acceleration of growth in smart devices. Remembering, however, that the first half of last year was somewhat subdued, not the least because of the destocking impacts that you will no doubt recall. Jean-Pierre has already mentioned the positive momentum in the composite business and has explained to you how the production increases we're seeing in single aisle, in LEAP, in the Joint Strike Fighter are really beginning to show themselves down to our bottom line.
But there's more. Advanced Formulations grew 5.2% and EBITDA margin was sequentially flat at 17%. As we explained last quarter, the activity levels in the oil and gas markets are improving. And this is positively impacting our Novecare business, driving sales up 24% in the quarter. We also benefited from increased demand in the agricultural market. Turning to Technology Solutions, customer-specific issues in mining were offset with new business developments in that business. 
Performance Chemicals had a decent quarter with 1% EBITDA growth while sustaining a very strong margin of 29%. Where is it coming from? Peroxides was a significant contributor in the quarter with the startup of the Sadara operation for HPPO in Saudi. Soda ash remained steady. And in fact, we saw slight volume increases, mainly in the seaborne market whereas bicarbonate continues to grow, supported by the investment that we made in the new Thailand plant. Also you remember that soda ash benefited this time last year from that one-time gain from the sale of surplus assets of EUR 11 million. Functional Polymers, very superb result in this quarter, driven by -- well, it had a 57% EBITDA increase, driven by 2 factors: strong demand in auto and price increases that passed through the cost increases that we experienced earlier in the year.
But there is more to our delivery this quarter than just EBITDA. If you turn to Page 12, Slide 12, you'll notice that our net income is up 38%. Now not only does that reflect the EBITDA increase, but also 2 other things: one, a drop in financial charges; and two, a reduction in our underlying tax rate from 30% last year to 26% this year. And this is driven largely by the evolution in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings.
Cash. On Page 12, you will see the picture on debt and cash. And there's a few things that I'd like to highlight here. One is the fact that our free cash flow in the first half of this year from our continuing businesses doubled from EUR 123 million to EUR 245 million. It's coming from a number of factors, higher profits clearly but also very strong discipline on working capital. Our working capital intensity is remaining flat compared to last year despite an 11% increase in revenues. Now that takes some doing. And so we're really pleased with that continuing discipline. Clearly, we also have the reduction in capital expenditures. But that shouldn't be a surprise, that's exactly where we thought we would be at this stage. So all in all, we're very pleased with the operational cash flow performance over the quarter. 
Debt is down materially. At the last year, you may recall that the seasonal nature, the profile of our cash generation is very much back-ended. And we see a much stronger profile in this first half. But M&A has contributed just under EUR 1 billion of net proceeds. That obviously helps to reduce our debt by EUR 800 million when I compare it to 31st of December 2016.
Now finally, and before I forget, I just want to highlight the fact that you may have picked up already that in May, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BBB flat from BBB-. I really welcome this as an independent indication and validation of the portfolio progress and fundamentally of the real improvement in the strength of our cash generation and the resilience of our balance sheet. 
And with that, I hand the floor back to Jean-Pierre."

We remain focused on remaining opportunities, a mix of [ all come in ]. But the portfolio movement expected in '17 would be more in the direction of divestitures, so we are looking at opportunities. We are not yet at a point of time where we can share with you any actual news. But be confident that we are indeed continuing to work on these opportunities.
2017 outlook. How do we see the rest of the year? Well, we continue to -- expect to continue to see sequential improvement, which will be linked to volume growth, especially from our core growth engines in Advanced Materials and Advanced Formulations. We have to be aware of what was the profile of 2017 -- 2016. 2016 is a  year in which we had a very slow first half and a more dynamic second half. So the comparison will be a little bit different in the first and second half. Taking our performance and expectations into account, we have decided to raise our full year EBITDA estimate to grow by high single-digit, taking into account the current situation in various macro parameters, including exchange rates.
And with that, we are ready, Karim and myself, to take your questions. Thank you very much."

First, in the Advanced Formulations business, if we strip out the Cytec pension gain, you did see some margin pressure there. We've seen that at a number of your peers in sort of in the surfactant formulations area. Can you talk about what you're doing and the confidence you have in regaining lost margin from input costs, please? And perhaps give us some pointers, too, the mining side, when you think tech solutions is going to start to recover. That's still lagging, I think, some of your longer-term growth expectations. Secondly, in Performance Chemicals, obviously everybody's very focused on what's going on in soda ash. Excepting the annual contract situation, you're still enjoying pretty strong volumes on the seaborne market and spot markets. Are you seeing that the initial Turkish volumes, the expansion at Eti Soda, are you seeing any evidence of those volumes in the spot markets? And are you feeling any or seeing any signs of premarketing from the Ciner capacity, please? And then perhaps just a final question on the guidance, you indicated at the first quarter stage that you hope -- you expected to meet or exceed your mid-single-digit guidance. So you're already pointing towards high single digits. You've just got this EUR 38 million one-off, which adds close to 2 percentage points. I mean, is it a simple case of, in your mind, adding that EUR 38 million? Or are you more confident in the underlying performance as well?"

In fact, we knew that the EUR 38 million would take place this year. We didn't know at which quarter because there were some accounting complexity there. So for us, it's not something new. It's new for you, but it's not for us. So indeed, the increase, the sequential increase in guidance for mid-single to over mid-single and now to high single is really -- demonstrate our -- the fact that we've gained confidence in the volume growth. And yes, today we feel very confident to share this high single-digit guidance with you. On the Advanced Formulations business, we've seen a bit of margin pressure. There's 2 elements, one which is linked to Novecare. And this is very much the raw material price situation. So we've suffered -- as we said in the Q1 call, we suffered from oleochemical, not only increase but volatility, oleochemical prices, which put pressure on margin, delayed, in some cases, our customer orders. What we've done, and it's something that we started, in fact, a year ago, we have renegotiated 2 very large contracts for oleochemical access, which will give us extra competitiveness. So we feel reasonably confident that indeed over the course of the second half, we'll see margin increasing. On mining, we have also -- on Technology Solutions, I should say, we have seen also a bit of a pressure on margin, which was mostly linked, in fact, to some difficulties, operational difficulties that our customers were facing, strikes or various technical difficulties, and which impacted our ability to deliver. And that's an impact on margin. Things are normalizing there. So overall, yes, I would expect the Advanced Formulations cluster to improve its margin over the course of the next couple of quarters. Regarding soda ash, to be -- try to be as specific as possible, you might know that our Turkish competitors are working on 2 different projects. There was a first extension of 0.5 million tonne a year, which is done and in the market. So it was in the market already for Q1. And then there is a second project, which will come online in the remaining part of '17 and mostly in 2018. This project has been expected for quite some time. And for the last 3 or 4 years, we've been discussing about this. We have prepared ourselves as much as we could. And indeed, I think the rather good delivery of soda ash, I can probably take the rather -- a good delivery of soda ash for the first half of the year show that we are indeed well prepared and able to do the most out of the current market condition, taking into account a bit more competitive pressure. So very much what we said, there will be an impact when all this Turkish capacity will be on the market. But we think that we'll be able to weather this impact with some pressure on our margins but not for such a long period of time. And again, our confidence on our ability to manage this situation is probably a bit better today than it was 6 months ago."

Karim, I know that you flagged that actually working capital was more or less flattish in the first half of the year. But it tended to spike from what I see in Q2. So can you elaborate a bit what it was driven by? Because I do not have the impression when I look at your balance sheet that it was driven by an inventory buildup. So did the payment terms change with your supplier or something like that? I would like to understand this a bit. And then the second one -- well, actually perhaps I have 3, I'm sorry. The second one would be on automotive. We see a lot of players who are somewhere in the supply chain actually being a bit more cautious on the second part of the year. So what is your stance on that one? And what does that mean for your businesses in both Specialty Polymers and Polyamide? And then the third one, perhaps you'll start to feel that I am obsessed with that, but it's on oil and gas. We have seen the rig counts, well, actually increasing since May last year. But it seems to be slowing down as from June, somewhere like that. And I was wondering how you feel for the second half for oil and gas. And should we expect that, well, less support, I would say, not to say a negative price mix, to persist in the second part of the year?"

If you look at working capital intensity, so taking total working capital to sales, we're about 3%, in fact 2.9% better than last year. Last year, I did flag the fact that we had an exceptional receivable in respect of INOVYN and our accelerated exit. So on a like-for-like basis, it's very, very similar. If I look at the internal metrics, and we look at this every month, I look at day sales outstanding, I look at overdues. This time last year, I did say, too, that we'd set a new record. You know what? I wish I hadn't said it because I'm going to say that this year is a new record. So all the key operational KPIs and indicators are flashing green in that respect. And finally, to give you an order of magnitude. If you look at our working capital and add up all the gross sums, you're talking EUR 4.7 billion of gross working capital. To try and predict and manage to even 1% of accuracy is EUR 50 million-ish. So I look at this performance, I look at it not just on a monthly basis, on a quarterly basis, but I see real strength.

So automotive and oil and gas, automotive, we have to realize that a little bit like Solvay results, the overall performance of the automotive sector last year was a little bit back-ended. I mean, the second half was stronger than the first half. And then the comparison will become a little bit more challenging. This being said, we continue to see strength in this business. And we are not expecting any meaningful change in this time for the second half. It was probably a bit of stocking in the very beginning of the year in China. We think that this is now when this stock now enter the market. So overall, a good level of confidence, knowing again that the comparable will be a bit more difficult. So if you look at quarter -- in the same quarter of 2 consecutive years' difference, it will be probably a bit less pronounced in the year -- in the second half. So oil and gas, it's clearly a volatile market. So I have to be cautious on the comment I've made. But the situation on the ground looks good. Yes, there is little -- the increase in rig count has -- the speed of increase in rig count has diminished. And it has been, I think, a bit flattish on the last few weeks. This being said, there was a number of wells which we have drilled during the first half for which there was no fracturing done. So we think that this stimulation job will come. We've seen the oil and gas supply chain in the U.S. working very, very hard to improve its overall competitiveness. And our view today is that in the current oil price condition, activity will continue at quite a sustained rate. I was commenting in the past 2 quarterly call that we've seen some negative mix effect, I mean, people are moving out of the expensive guar-derivatized formulation to friction reducers. We continue to be very successful in friction reducers. But we start to see inquiries, interest into these guar-derivatized solutions. So we think that the opportunities will continue to be significant on the ground for our oil and gas position in North America at the current oil price. We are continuing to work on diversification. China, Argentina, Russia offers interesting opportunities. We have some businesses there. The challenge is to make sure that we can grow with the operations that are developing in these different parts of the world. But overall, the feeling that oil and gas will continue to be a core driver for the second half of the year."

So yes, indeed we are -- we think that this very good level of performance will continue for Functional Polymer. On composite, I don't want to quantify the impact that we expect on aerospace. But we will see a -- we will continue to see strong ramp-up in F-35, strong ramp-up in LEAP engine. If I listen to our customers, Airbus and Boeing will continue to see the single-aisle production developing very well in the context where there's almost no inventory movement in the supply chain and will continue to have a negative impact on the large body aircraft, mostly the A380 and the 777, waiting for the new version, the 777X, which will be a plus for us. So overall, we expect to continue to see growth in composite for aerospace during the second half of the year and obviously into 2018.

So Sadara, I mean, if I'm a little bit a provocateur, I would say we are not so much interested in the operational performance because we have a take-or-pay contract which secures our profitability. This being said, since the end of April, we've seen the chain operating reasonably well for such a large and new complex. There was a few hiccups here and there but overall, a good performance. And again, we are in a situation where we are protected by a take-or-pay contract, which started, in fact, in December 2016. Specialty Polymers, I don't want to comment too much on the smart device market. We tend to be exposed to one customer. And I don't want to share information about this specific customer. I would just say that this product lifecycle plays very much in our favor for the next quarters because we expect to see new models being launched. And this is always a period which creates opportunities for us in terms of a ramp-up of new production. But yes, since the end of 2016, we've seen this market turning. And this is a contributor to the growth of the group and it will continue to be a contributor. And by the way, we are all focused on or some of us at least on new product. But we are going in a situation where there will probably be a broader range of products with existing products being continuing and new products coming. And we have also a strong position on existing products, which will continue to be produced in the next quarters. CapEx, no, you should not expect to see a rebound in CapEx. We still have a number of plants which are not filled up, in fact, that they are beginning to produce. Just to name a few which are important for us. Our PEEK facility in the U.S., we are still in a ramp-up mode, which means that we have capacity available in front of us. So yes, we will be pleased to fill it up quickly but not to a point where we would be willing to add new capacity soon. Same comment on the PVDF facility that we are starting up in China as we speak. It will come online at the right amount of time because the battery market in China is boiling because of the fast development of electric vehicles. So this facility will be -- ramp up pretty quickly but not to a point where we'd be looking at new extension. I can continue the comments on [indiscernible] for aerospace, our new facility in the U.K. is starting. It's starting to produce the qualification batches, which will be needed to have the facility approved. So it will take probably another year before it's operational in the sense of generating commercial sales. But as you see, I think we have quite a nice course in front of us, which will allow us to continue to grow with existing assets. If I -- I mean, I could continue the example. The growth in terms of carbon fiber, we have now capacity available in North America. Our Östringen facility will be there to support the growth of F-35, LEAP engine and the new 777X. So overall, no need for new CapEx, for -- I would say an increase in our CapEx budget for the next 2, 3 years. On the contrary, we probably expect to be able to continue to slightly diminish our CapEx. We've said several times that our objective was to align CapEx and depreciation. We are still a little bit higher but clearly we've a lot of capacity available to supply the increase in volumes that we see coming from our customers."

So first question, frankly speaking, I don't see Boeing becoming a chemical company. So my understanding, although I have not seen the specific announcement you're referring to, is that they had a few difficulties in the 787 production linked to the fact that they had a very complex supply chain with a lot of partners. So they might be referring to the fact that they want to in-source some elements of this supply chain. For composite, they will need to continue to work with their existing supplier because there is no other particular options. So I would probably welcome directionally the fact that they have the more simple supply chain. Regarding M&A, just to be clear, I mean, I've said that significant M&A could only take the form of divestments in 2017. If you look at acquisition, we are always interested in looking at add-on acquisitions, which could allow us to increase our position in Advanced Materials or Advanced Formulations, either by bringing a new technology or bringing a specific market access. But this would lead to a small transaction, I mean, a couple of hundreds of millions. But even after having said that, I don't have currently on my desk any file of this size. So don't expect us to be very active on the acquisition side of the equation in the next 12 to 18 months. I think the focus is very much when finalizing the portfolio transformation, full divestment if the opportunity arise, and second, very much focusing on internal improvement. I think there's a lot we can do to generate top line synergies in Advanced Materials. There's a lot we can do to simplify the overall organization of the company.

Clearly, as we generate the kind of cash levels we have and we retire debt, yes, you can expect over time a reduction in our financial charges. On tax rates, our strategic guidance is around 30%. We're not going to change it just opportunistically. But it's fair to say that when I see last year at 28%, when I see us in the first half at 26%, it's fair to say that for this year, at least coming in under 30% is a plausible outcome. But let's be clear, it doesn't take much to create 1% of variability. 1% is less than EUR 50 million. So it's like a relatively small change in our geographic pool of taxable profits consuming it. But I do feel that coming in under 30% is a realistic expectation at this stage for this year."

I think we have built a very strong growth engine in Advanced Materials. We have a very good position in surface chemistry/Advanced Formulations. The real challenge for us is to make sure that we work, one, on generating growth. We have a number of innovation project or top line synergy project that we want to bring to fruition. And we need the resources to do that, one. Second, I think that there is a need for Solvay at this point of time to look at all the business support part of the organization and look at how we can align them very well with the current portfolio, the current business model and the current set of customers. This also is taking a bit of time and resources, starting with [ COMAC ]. And it's the reason why I'm telling you don't expect big movement in terms of acquisition. I think the priority is really to increase or improve our position in the 2 growth engines that we have today. I could see very specific opportunities to bring in new technologies, I don't know, a new polymer, for example, or buying a company which gives us specific access to some difficult-to-access market.

In this case, I mentioned that we had some inventory revaluation during Q2. But again, broadly speaking, the business will continue to perform well because the fundamentals are strong. But on composite, I would refrain from giving you a number in terms of expected growth rate. I think the inventory movement that we've seen last year are behind us. Now what we see are the real impact of what's happening in the programs. I think the equation conceptually is rather simple, strong growth in F-35, strong growth in LEAP, significant growth in A320neo and the Boeing 737 MAX and some moderation in A380 and Boeing 777 until the 777X is launched. And then still some work to do, a part on the industrial material composite business with non-aerospace where we had a bit of a, I would say, mediocre performance for the first half of the year. And it's an area where we need to fix things, I mean, either by improving the commercial performance or by adjusting our cost base. So we are working on that. So I will ask you probably to be a bit patient before we give you a bit more visibility on what it means in terms of growth rate. But clearly, we are going out of the difficult zone in which we were a year ago. When I say difficult, I don't want to overemphasize that, but I would say the challenging situation where inventory reduction was playing against us. We think that this is behind us now and we are back to growth rate which are close to what we were expecting when we've made this acquisition."

Thanks, everyone, for -- and thank you for joining our call today. As usual, I'm here with Karim Hajjar, our CFO; and Kimberly. And together, we'll try to provide another view of our Q3 results, before going into your questions. No significant surprises in these results, so we should be able to move relatively quickly in the introduction and leave enough time for your question. 
It is before going to for Q3 performance, just a word on the announced sale of Polyamide. I think this is a very important transaction. It's clearly, in my view, the last major milestone in the portfolio transformation that we started 4 years ago. This transformation has indeed strengthened our business model and allow us to increase our ability to generate long-term growth and value for our shareholder.
Our portfolio looks very different from what it was 4 years ago. Today, we are a company which is both Advanced Material and chemical. 50% of our business indeed today is in Advanced Material. And when I say Advanced Material, it's really the top of the pyramid of the most sophisticated nonmetallic materials. 25% in what we should probably call chemistries with enough technology solution, our positions on surfactants, polymers, phosphorus and industry -- which gives us the ability to serve our customers, and the remaining 25% being businesses where we have long-term sustainable positions like soda ash and peroxide.
This allow us -- this is reflected in our EBITDA margin, which has been constantly above 20% since 2016, well above our additional peer group. 50% of our portfolio today are for sustainable solutions for our customers, so very much in line with our sustainability policy. And we've seen over the years, as I have commented several time, a dramatic shift in the quality of our customer base to one that provides major global blue-chip companies with unique solutions that are critical to their own programs. Overall, I think our strategy to turn into a multispecialty company, material and chemical, is indeed bearing fruits.
Looking at our Q3 results. I think the highlight of the period would be: first, a 9% volume growth, clearly significant, driven by the increase across our 3 segments, EBITDA of EUR 553 million, up only 1%, despite a strong organic growth of 5.5%, but most of this was offset by foreign exchange, particularly the dollar, euro and . EBITDA margins remain robust at 22%. Cash flow generation for the first 9 months demonstrate indeed our ability to focus and generate cash. 
And with that, I will turn to Karim to provide more specific insights into our financial performance, and I'll come back with some concluding comments."

As usual, I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website. And I will be talking about figures on an underlying basis, because that is more helpful and comparable with our past, remembering as well, that the P&L figures that I'll be referring to are those that reflect the discontinuation of the divestments the Polyamide activities.
And I'll start with sales. On Slide #8, you will see the factors that our net sales increased by 4%, but that doesn't tell the full story because, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, volumes are up very significantly 9% across, all of our operating segments, in fact. 
So I'll start with Advanced Materials. They were up 5%, mainly in automotive and smart devices. You will take note as well of the fact that composite sales in aeronautics were stable, as we see, the production ramp up of the F 35 program continuation of the growth of the LEAP engine compensate for the continuing decline in widebodied platforms, particularly older Generation ones, such as the A380 and the 777. And thus for composites, sales did decrease, mainly because of the end of a supercar program, the Ferrari F-150, that was anticipated, but we did see some softness across a couple of industrial markets, such as wind and rail.
Turning to Advanced Formulations, and seeing volume growth of 15%, with a strong recovery in oil and gas. This is something that we see also helped by improving in mix, which is visible in the improved EBITDA margins as compared to the second quarter of this year. 
Technology Solutions did increase its volumes as well, especially in non-mining activities. And so far as mining is concerned, we remain very well-positioned for anticipated new mines that will come on stream in the foreseeable future, next year and beyond.
Performance Chemicals. Volumes up 7%. Strong volumes in soda ash continued, particularly in the seaborne market, but also in the specialty bicarbonate applications, and of course, as you would expect, the contribution from the new HPPO peroxide plants in Saudi Arabia. These are all contributing to the growth and obviously helped to offset the foreign exchange headwinds, which, as you'd expect, the appreciation of the euro, particularly against the dollar, but also the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, which together gave us a 3% -- negative 3% conversion effects.
But there is more to it than sales clearly. If we turn to Slide #9 and look at EBITDA, you will see the fact is that our headline growth of 1% has essentially moved forward off a very strong comp last year if you remember. So that 1% also [ below ] the fact that we've overcome some headwinds on foreign exchange and a modest impact on scope. 
Now on an organic basis, excluding foreign exchange and scope, EBITDA grew by 5%. The key points I'd like to highlight is: one, the full impact of the volume growth helped to overcome higher energy costs, particularly coal and soda ash, but also an increase in our fixed costs, that results from 2 main factors, additional capacity at good costs, in many ways, but also the variable remuneration as we recognize and reward our teams for delivering on strong objectives.
It's also important to note that what you don't see is the weather-related disruptions in the U.S. such as hurricane Harvey that haven't impacted as much at all in Q3, but we do anticipate a modest adverse supply chain logistical impact of up to EUR 10 million in Q4 as well. We've obviously taken that into account in our forecast that Jean-Pierre will talk to you in a moment.
Moving beyond EBITDA, and turning to other important financial elements on Page 11 -- Slide 11, you'll see 2 points in particular. Financial charges are lower, as we maintain our focus on cash generation, as we deleverage our balance sheet. That has an impact on reducing our financial charges. The other element is our underlying tax rate is down from 28% to 27%. Again, it's a good improvement that does create value and will be sustainable at this stage as we see it.
Cash is a very positive indicator, and we had to look at it beyond one quarter. 
If we turn to Page 12, you will see that the free cash flow from our continuing businesses was EUR 195 million. But on a cumulative basis, 9 months, to try and take out some of those modest seasonality impacts, we are 33% higher than last year for the first 9 months. That's EUR 111 million better than last year. And that comes from 2 main factors: continued attention to CapEx, no surprise there, and hopefully, no surprise from the continued discipline in working capital, where we're very attentive to our day sales outstanding. This is really part of the regime that we have in place here.
Now for those who are particularly attentive to our debt levels, pretty high, let's say 18, 24 month ago, you will have taken note of the reduction in those debt levels. Our leverage ratio currency of 2.3x is down from 2.6x at the beginning of the year. And you will take note of the fact that the polyamide investment -- divestment will further improve that to around 2x on a pro forma basis.
The fact that the cash is there, the profit growth is there. It's clearly acknowledged independently by S&P, and we're pleased to see that acknowledgment in the upgrade to our credit rating to BBB+  in early August.
And with that, I  hand you back to Jean-Pierre."

This brings me to the outlook for the remaining months of the year. 
As we've said in our press release, we remain well on track to deliver a strong financial performance. Our underlying EBITDA growth is estimated between 6% and 8% for the full year, based on the strong year-to-date growth of 9%. This imply, as you can easily figure, for Q4, an EBITDA largely in line with last year, with taking into account all the elements that Karim has mentioned, foreign exchange and some of the disruption coming from -- in our supply chain coming from harvey and other weather-related events in the U.S. 
On the free cash flow side, EUR 484 million delivered in the first 9 months. This puts us in a very good position to deliver more than the EUR 800 million that we have mentioned at the beginning of this year. And indeed, the fact that we have a much more regular cash flow profile year-over-year is something that we are aiming at, and I think it's a very good achievement from our team. We have confirmed an interim dividend payment of EUR 138 per share.
Looking at our priority today. As I've said, leaving aside the completion of the Polyamide divestiture, which is, indeed, a very important project, I think the focus now is very much to make sure that we will continue to drive in delivering on our midterm financial objectives. We want also to make good progress, and I think we are indeed making good progress on extra financial objectives, including our commitment to sustainable development. We will continue to drive organic growth with innovation being at the center of our plans. We have a unique portfolio to be able to support a very demanding customers, but customers which certainly has a need for the solution that Solvay is in the position to deliver.
We are now -- as we have finalized our portfolio transformation, we are now in the process of reviewing our corporate and functional structure to simplify and better align the structure with our new group profile, and we are planning to share more of this with you at the beginning of 2018.

And secondly, obviously, there is a significant ramp up in Turkish material due literally now in the coming months. Do you -- is your sense that these materials already been priced by the market, i.e. it's already been signed off? This is just a function of delivering it. What do you think the negative price impact is yet to come for the soda ash market?"

On composite, maybe if you comment on the business and Karim can complement with the slight impact on this. But what we are seeing in composite is a continuation of the challenges we signaled in the non-aerospace markets, and we benefited in past quarters from the support of some sugar programs, they will come back, but we have a few quarters where we don't have these type of activities, so it's really something that we need to work on to make sure that the non-aerospace part of the business is indeed delivering on the more regular pace. On aerospace, we have some short-term smoothening of volumes. But in my view, nothing serious. I mean the balance between the very significant, we are expecting and seeing, in fact, both our leap engine in F-35, A320neo, Boeing 737 Max, probably, by the way, good news on the Bombardier C series because the fact that Airbus is taking the responsibility for this program, we'll probably increase the likelihood of seeing more planes being built. So all of this are very good news for the short and medium-term. And at the same time, we are seeing reduction in build rates on the large twin -- on the large platform like the A380 and Boeing 777. So all of that gives us the feeling that the opportunities in front of us are quite significant because our position and our share in these various programs is something which is set. So we are just waiting to see the build rate indeed increasing. Maybe you want to comment on ForEx, on the composite, Karim?"

I'm wondering what you've been doing on the commercial side of things, for instance, to try and improve that. And the related question I guess is, do you think you got the right cost base now given the size of this business, which has been shrinking quite a bit since you acquired Cytec? The second question is on silica and silica pricing. It looks like the pressure has accelerated into the third quarter despite higher energy costs where I think you have the passthrough and also higher silicon metal prices, I'm really puzzled as to the price cut there when I would have thought that your raw material prices would push up, there's been a big squeeze on profit.

On Silica, pass-through, as you say, the immediate passthrough, I mean to be able to take into account evolution in raw material energy, we need to have the numbers available, and there's always a mechanism which create some delays in the way the passthrough is applied, so yes, we are seeing a bit of pressure, but for me, it's temporary pressure. And I think silica will continue to be a strong business in terms of profitability. On composite, on the non-aerospace, we call it industrial material, I would probably think non-aerospace is probably something which is nondescriptive. We've been very much focused on very special program, the supercars program, the F1 and a few others. We've never been a big participant in wind. I don't think that we have lost any market share. Its market share is the right terminology, and I'm not sure it really means something in a business which is very, very granular. What we've seen is that we are today serving customers who have program which comes on and off, which are relatively short-term programs compared to the traditional automotive programs. And we are seeing this impact. The short term, I think there are still some adjustment needed in our cost base in this part of the business. Near term, the challenge is really to be able to develop a meaningful business in, what I would call, a rail automotive, not the supercars, but the traditional OEM. We are working very hard on this.

So to my mind, while I don't necessarily can quantify specifically the FX impact on our free cash, it's not modest and the impact on our EBITDA. But nevertheless, no matter what it is, we will deliver more than the EUR 800 million. That's one. Perhaps, on pricing, secular question as well. It's predominantly energy costs, predominantly coal. And we see that mainly in soda ash Performance Chemicals to be broadly. That's really the one that is worth highlighting. The rest is very much affect -- we see the continuation of our excellence program having to preserve our margins, which means very strong. On corporate and business services, I'd say the soda energy services business does have a process stream, but it's not a linear, predictable level of profitability can extrapolate. We don't necessarily give guidance at that degree of precision. What I can share with you is the following. Our corporate costs are running at the rate of EUR 250 million, EUR 260 million a year. They are occasionally facing differences from one quarter to another, but the discipline, the attention to costs, the continues. So yes, there will be occasional swings and roundabouts on energy services, but nothing material from a group point of view."

I think Airbus has not yet or Pratt & Whitney has not yet solved the issues linked to the engines. There are supposed to be because it has an impact on the A320neo line. We see there are still production issues here in the supply chain. We see people working very hard to solve them.

But frankly speaking, the fundamentals are -- medium and long-term are exactly the same as in Q2. The only nuance, and directionally, it's a positive one is clearly the C-Series of Bombardier. It's a plane which seems to have a significant potential. Probably, Bombardier alone was not in the best possible position to make it a great commercial success. By the way, the duty imposed by the U.S. government would probably have a significant leeway on the project. The fact that Airbus is coming and will be now a partner in the development is changing completely the picture.

One is delivering the profits, converting into cash by being very, very disciplined in our working capital, Now almost mechanically, as you have lower activity in the final couple of months, you are able to convert a lot more of the receivables into cash. We've that every year, and we'll continue to deliver that. [indiscernible] one is CapEx. We're not expecting a big ramp up in CapEx. So nothing particularly unusual.

We've done a lot of work to make sure that we manage this much better and in a much more regular way. And I'm pretty pleased with the cash flow performance, both the number we expect to generate for the full year, but also our ability to generate it much more regularly. On your comments regarding Q3, be careful. I mean, we are more and more working on long-term multi-year programs. We're making a on one quarter and trying to develop a view on what would be the leverage between sales and EBITDA, something which is probably becoming a bit difficult, and in some cases, irrelevant. There's a number of specific element that Karim has mentioned during Q3, going from provision for variable compensation to ramp up cost in various plants, which explain what you've seen in terms of transformation of volume growth into EBITDA. I think it makes a bit more sense to look at the last 9 months or at the full year results when there will be available. And indeed, I have a feeling that we have the ability to transform our volume growth, which, by the way, was lacking last year, but we have the ability to transform our volume growth into a profitability and cash, and this is very much our focus. I understand why you need to try to get the most out of the quarterly results, but sometimes, there's a limit to what you can extract. If I go back to the comments on composite, [ 1 and 35 ] moved on quarter to the next as a meaningful impact. And it was cheaper also in the smartphone program could have also an impact on the quarter, which will be compensated the next quarter also. Be a bit more careful on the conclusion in the whole."

On aerospace, I think we are -- where are we and I might repeat myself, but we see program like F 35 or the leap engine, which are just at the beginning of the actual ramp up. And yes, indeed, we have a very significant expectation regarding this for the next year and the following one. And on these 2 programs, we don't see much difficulties today. And by the way, the expectation regarding being peak rate has significantly for both program, both the F-35 and the veep engine, seen today as very successful programs. On the A320, I think the challenge is still probably with the engines and the -- not the LEAP engine, but the patent engine. I don't have much more clarity than you have. And on the large  -- the reduction of the rate in the large platform, this has been announced today by Boeing, by Airbus and then -- mostly by Boeing and Airbus. So the impact will be in the next couple of quarters, let's say. So yes, overall, I think that this situation -- the situation where we are and the situation where we'll see probably in the course of next year, the positive elements taking over the negatives one that I was mentioning. So yes, I expect to see a change. Now it will always be a business where from one quarter to the next, you could see some variation, but just because the production chain don't run as Swiss clocks, and you have -- we have to get used to this. But clearly, the fundamental of the business are very solid. And if even if I was looking longer-term, we are seeing a number of activities which will lead to a situation where the vast, vast majority of the commercial airline platforms will be made using composites. I remind you the announcement of Boeing on the what we call the market airplane, the works that Airbus is doing on the wings of, which is a number of opportunities showing that, indeed, composites is the way to go, and this will create very significant long-term growth opportunity. Don't worry, we focus on long-term, but also, on short-term. And there, I think the situation will look better and better as this production difficulties will go behind us."

Internal and external, it's a uncontrollable, to state the obvious. It is the significant shift in exchange rate or a significant shift in energy costs, our capacity to respond and mitigate otherwise is obviously restricted in the short time scale. So that is one factor, probably no surprise there. There are all of the controllable aspects except our costs, et cetera, and I feel very, very confident that we are running a very tight regime, so we expect to land very much more in control of that. Now clearly, Harvey has had an impact. Nobody will have predicted that a couple of months ago. The other aspect perhaps it's slightly difficult to respond to, and that is about visibility of our order book and our volume. It's quite short. We don't necessarily see clearly everywhere clea on that till the end of the year. So I'll give you a small example. Oil price today is what? $57 WTI, $63 on the brent. Despite that, I understand that the rig counts are falling right now and a see good progress on pressure reduces and more. But who's to say it can traverse pretty quickly? That market momentum can change quite quickly. I think given that we're quite a diversified group, typically, small bumps on one side can be overcome elsewhere, and we think that's strength. With that portfolio gives us the composites no, no, volumes, top line, costs, profit, cash will be delivered, and that's really what underpins it. But external factors clearly can conspire or help, and we'll see what that brings."

Now I would really let Lockheed Martin commence on the detail. And what it means that for us, what we see in terms of demand is very much in line with the public information available regarding the increase in ramp up. And again, it's a program where the big production rate has increased significantly. However, for diesel, I don't see anything specific. I mean we know that diesel regulations are becoming more stringent when creating the need for a much more sophisticated and costly catalyst. So that's good. We know at the same time that the share of diesel is going down very significantly. On top of that, some recall activities here and there, creating the need for new catalyst, so the picture is pretty complex. Gasoline engine, also some evolution of regulation, which calls for a more sophisticated formulation. So overall, I would say, a good opportunity in front of us in this catalyst business. On the soda ash, yes, I mean export market are a limited part of our activities, but it's an element of a global supply and demand balance, a very important element in this export market, especially Southeast Asia, are the quantities coming from China. What we've seen is a very significant reduction of these quantities linked to the new [indiscernible] but stronger enforcement of existing relation in China. The fact that the number of outdated capacities are being phased out, so that's structural, that's good news. It has to impact. We see increases in prices in the export market, that's good. And it helps rebalance the global market at a time when capacities are variable. So overall, this is going in the right direction. And by the way, if your question implied a doubt on whether or gasoline engine catalyst to, so it's yes, I mean gasoline engine catalyst since the beginning this technology contained and continue to contain made of , so it's -- I would, probably a bit more in diesel today than in gasoline. But at the same time, as technology evolves, the need for more sophisticated coat appears in both types of technology."

Don't forget that, today, the significant part of Solvay business is linked to specific programs. You can think of smartphone. You can think of specific aerospace programs, even some specific automotive program, which are not linked to the pattern of global demand. Yes, if the economy goes better or it has an impact on aerospace, but not so much on actual production rate for a given year. So there is a bit of a disconnect between these 2 elements in our -- in the meaningful part of our portfolio. A second comment. We see people in the various supply chains where we operate very cautious about building inventories. Even in markets like smartphones, after what happened a couple of years ago, we see people being very careful in making sure that they produce -- try to align production rate and demand and make sure that they are not building useless inventories. So it's -- I don't have the feeling that we are seeing people building inventories today. I think people are trying to make sure that when they are able to meet demand, which is good because when the opportunities, we want to be there. Second, making sure that they could react quickly, the demand was going in other direction. So this being said, looking at both the forecasts we have on specific programs, in some cases, pretty high-quality forecasts, in other cases, probably not so high-quality forecasts, and looking at the general prospect of the world economy for the businesses where we are more exposed to this type of metric, I'm pretty confident regarding volume growth in 2018. I think the year has been good in terms of volume growth for Solvay, 2017, I mean. And I tend to see a situation which from a volumes standpoint will probably continue to look pretty good into '18.
So with that, I suggest that we close this call. Thank you very much. Once again, significant news during this quarter on the portfolio side was the divestiture of Polyamide. We are now working hard to close this transaction. This is the end of a long string of portfolio movement. I think today, we have a portfolio that we want. We might have opportunities to make add-on acquisition here and there, but this is clearly the end of a large transaction. We are delivering, if I look at the first 9 months of the year, in terms of the EBITDA line, free cash flow generation, I think we are coming with a solid number. We've confirmed our guidance for the full year. And focus is very much for us to make the best out of a portfolio we have, in terms of innovation, in terms of customer focus, but also in terms of simplification of our organization.

Thanks, everyone, for -- and thank you for joining our call today. As usual, I'm here with Karim Hajjar, our CFO; and Kimberly. And together, we'll try to provide another view of our Q3 results, before going into your questions and to thing that they ask. No significant surprises in these results, so we should be able to move relatively quickly in the introduction and leave enough time for your question. 
Indeed, before going into the Q3 performance, just a word on the announced sale of Polyamide. I think this is a very important transaction. It's clearly, in my view, the last major milestone in the portfolio transformation that we started 4 years ago. This transformation has indeed strengthened our business model and allow us to increase our ability to generate long-term growth and value for our shareholder.
Our portfolio looks very different from what it was 4 years ago. Today, we are a company which is both Advanced Material and chemical. 50% of our business indeed today is in Advanced Material. And when I say Advanced Material, it's really the top of the pyramid of the most sophisticated nonmetallic materials. 25% in what we should probably call surface chemistries with Novecare technology solution, our positions on surfactants, polymers, phosphorus and industry [indiscernible] which gives us the ability to serve our customers. And the remaining 25% being businesses where we have long-term sustainable positions like soda ash and peroxide.
This allow us -- this is reflected in our EBITDA margin, which has been constantly above 20% since 2016, well above our traditional peer group. 50% of our portfolio today are for sustainable solutions for our customers, so very much in line with our sustainability policy. And we've seen over the years, as I have commented several time, a dramatic shift in the quality of our customer base to one that provides major global blue-chip companies with unique solutions that are critical to their own programs. Overall, I think our strategy to turn into a multispecialty company, material and chemical, is indeed bearing fruits.
Looking at our Q3 results. I think the highlight of the period would be: first, a 9% volume growth, clearly significant, driven by volume increase across our 3 segments, EBITDA of EUR 553 million, up only 1%, despite a strong organic growth of 5%, but most of this was offset by foreign exchange, particularly the dollar, euro and [indiscernible] . EBITDA margins remain robust at 22%. Cash flow generation for the first 9 months demonstrate indeed our ability to focus and generate cash. 
And with that, I will turn to Karim to provide more specific insights into our financial performance, and I'll come back with some concluding comments."

As usual, I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website. And I will be talking about figures on an underlying basis, because that is more helpful and comparable with our past, remembering as",948,"Thank you, Jean-Pierre. Good afternoon. 
As usual, I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website. And I will be talking about figures on an underlying basis, because that is more helpful and comparable with our past, remembering as well that the P&L figures that I'll be referring to are those that reflect the discontinuation of the divestments of our Polyamide activities.
And I'll start with sales. On Slide #8, you will see the fact is that our net sales increased by 4%, but that doesn't tell the full story because, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, volumes are up very significantly 9% across all of our operating segments, in fact. 
So I'll start with Advanced Materials. They were up 5%, mainly in automotive and smart devices. You will take note as well of the fact that composite sales in aeronautics were stable, as we see the production ramp up of the F-35 program, continuation of the growth of the LEAP engine compensate for the continuing decline in wide-bodied platforms, particularly older Generation ones, such as the A380 and the 777. And thus for composites, sales did decrease, mainly because of the end of a supercar program, the Ferrari F-150, that was anticipated, but we did see some softness across a couple of industrial markets, such as wind and rail.
Turning to Advanced Formulations, and seeing volume growth of 15%, with a strong recovery in oil and gas. This is something that we see also helped by improving in mix, which is visible in the improved EBITDA margins as compared to the second quarter of this year. 
Technology Solutions did increase its volumes as well, especially in non-mining activities. And so far as mining is concerned, we remain very well positioned for anticipated new mines that will come on stream in the foreseeable future, next year and beyond.
Performance Chemicals. Volumes up 7%. Strong volumes in soda ash continued, particularly in the seaborne market, but also in the specialty bicarbonate applications, and of course, as you would expect, the contribution from the new HPPO peroxide plants in Saudi Arabia. These are all contributing to the growth and obviously helped to offset the foreign exchange headwinds, which, as you'd expect, the appreciation of the euro, particularly against the dollar, but also the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, which together gave us a 3% -- negative 3% conversion effects.
But there is more to it than sales clearly. If we turn to Slide #9 and look at EBITDA, you will see the fact is that our headline growth of 1% has essentially moved forward off a very strong comp last year, that I am sure you'll remember. So that 1% also belies the fact that we've overcome some headwinds on foreign exchange and a modest impact on scope. 
Now on an organic basis, excluding foreign exchange and scope, EBITDA grew by 5%. The key points I'd like to highlight is: one, the full impact of the volume growth helped to overcome higher energy costs, particularly coal and soda ash, but also an increase in our fixed costs that results from 2 main factors, additional capacity [ at good cost ] in many ways, but also the variable remuneration, as we recognize and reward our teams for delivering on strong objectives.
It's also important to note that what you don't see is the weather-related disruptions in the U.S., such as hurricane Harvey that haven't impacted as much at all in Q3, but we do anticipate a modest adverse supply chain logistical impact of up to EUR 10 million in Q4 as well. We've obviously taken that into account in our forecast that Jean-Pierre will talk to in a moment.
Moving beyond EBITDA, and turning to other important financial elements on Page 11 -- Slide 11, you'll see 2 points in particular. Financial charges are lower, as we maintain our focus on cash generation, as we deleverage our balance sheet. That has an impact in reducing our financial charges. The other element is our underlying tax rate is down from 28% to 27%. Again, it's a good improvement that does create value and will be sustainable at this stage as we see it.
Cash is a very positive indicator, and we have to look at it beyond one quarter. 
If we turn to Page 12, you will see that the free cash flow from our continuing businesses was EUR 195 million. But on accumulative basis, 9 months, to try and take out some of those modest seasonality impacts, we are 33% higher than last year for the first 9 months, that's EUR 111 million better than last year. And that comes from 2 main factors: continued attention to CapEx, no surprise there, and hopefully, no surprise from the continued discipline in working capital, where we're very attentive to our day sales outstanding that are overdue. This is really part of the regime that we have in place here.
Now for those who are particularly attentive to our debt levels, we were pretty high, let's say, 18, 24 month ago, you would have taken note of the reduction in those debt levels. Our leverage ratio currently of 2.3x is down from 2.6x at the beginning of the year. And you will take note of the fact that the Polyamide investment -- divestment will further improve that to around 2x on a pro forma basis.
The fact that the cash is there, the profit growth is there, it's clearly also acknowledged independently by S&P, and we're pleased to see that acknowledgment in the upgrade to our credit rating to BBB+  in early August.
And with that, I hand you back to Jean-Pierre."

This brings me to the outlook for the remaining months of the year. 
As we've said in our press release, we remain well on track to deliver a strong financial performance. Our underlying EBITDA growth is estimated between 6% and 8% for the full year, based on the strong year-to-date growth of 9%. This imply, as you can easily figure, for Q4, an EBITDA largely in line with last year, with taking into account all the elements that Karim has mentioned, foreign exchange and some of the disruption coming from -- in our supply chain coming from the Harvey and other weather-related events in the U.S. 
On the free cash flow side, EUR 484 million delivered in the first 9 months. This puts us in a very good position to deliver more than the EUR 800 million that we have mentioned at the beginning of this year. And indeed, the fact that we have a much more regular cash flow profile year-over-year is something that we are aiming at, and I think it's a very good achievement from our team. We have confirmed an interim dividend payment of EUR 138 (sic) [ EUR 1.38 ] per share.
Looking at our priority today. As I've said, leaving aside the completion of the Polyamide divestiture, which is indeed a very important project, I think the focus now is very much to make sure that we will continue to drive in delivering on our midterm financial objectives. We want also to make good progress, and I think we are indeed making good progress on extra-financial objectives, including our commitment to sustainable development. We will continue to drive organic growth with innovation being at the center of our plans. We have a unique portfolio to be able to support very demanding customers, but customers which certainly have need for the solution that Solvay is in the position to deliver.
We are now -- as we have finalized our portfolio transformation, we are now in the process of reviewing our corporate and functional structure to simplify and better align the structure with our new group profile, and we are planning to share more of this with you at the beginning of 2018.
With that, Karim and myself are ready to take your questions."

Could you unpack that a little bit for us and talk about how much of that explicitly in composites was FX, the LEAP engine positive versus the kind of the slowdown factors? That would be very interesting. And my second and third questions are focused on Performance Chemicals and in particular, in soda ash. Is this 26% EBITDA margin now the kind of the new run rate for soda ash, noting that you're absorbing these heavy -- these higher energy costs? And secondly, obviously, there is a significant ramp up in Turkish material due literally now in the coming months. Is your sense for this material has already been priced by the market, i.e. it's already been signed off? There is just the function of delivering it. What do you think the negative price impact is yet to come for the soda ash market?"

On Composite, maybe a few comment on the business and Karim can complement with the ForEx impact on this. But what we are seeing in composite is a continuation of the challenges we signaled in the non-aerospace markets, and we benefited in past quarters from the support of some supercar programs, they will come back, but we have a few quarters where we don't have these type of activities. So it's really something that we need to work on to make sure that the non-aerospace part of the business is indeed delivering on a more regular pace. On aerospace, we have some short-term smoothening of volumes. But in my view, nothing serious. I mean the balance between the very significant ramp-up we are expecting and seeing, in fact, both our LEAP engine F-35, A320neo, Boeing 737 Max, probably, by the way, good news also on the Bombardier C Series, because the fact that Airbus is taking the responsibility for this program will probably increase the likelihood of seeing more planes being built. So all of these are very good news for the short and medium-term. And at the same time, we are seeing reductions in build rates on the large twin -- on the large platform like the A380 and Boeing 777. So all of that gives us the feeling that the opportunities in front of us are quite significant, because our position and our share in these various programs is something which is set. So we are just waiting to see the build rate indeed increasing. Maybe you want to comment on ForEx, on the Composite, Karim?"

I'd say the FX is the main driver to note for the Composites evolution.

We have a lot of moving parts as far as soda ash is concerned. An important element, especially in the export market, is the fact that Chinese capacities are being phased out, mostly for regulatory and environmental reasons, so this is good, and this opened up opportunities for us in the export market. We are very concerned that we've prepared very well for this new capacity coming from Turkey. But again, let's wait a bit to see what will be the actual impact in 2018. But in my view, nothing catastrophic, as I've said several time, but an impact which will be visible."

It looks like, versus expectations from 2 or 3 years ago, there's been a lot of loss of business between wind, supercars, et cetera. I was wondering, what do you think has been the main constraint to losing -- sorry, to winning new business? It looks like the win loss ratio has really been not so favorable. I'm wondering what you've been doing on the commercial side of things, for instance, to try and improve that. And the related question I guess is, do you think you've got the right cost base now given the size of this business, which has been shrinking quite a bit since you acquired Cytec? The second question is on Silica and silica pricing. It looks like the pressure has accelerated into the third quarter despite higher energy costs, where I think you have the passthrough and also higher silicon metal prices, I'm really puzzled as to the price cut there, when I would have thought that your raw material pressure would push prices up, so I've seen there's been a big squeeze on profits. Can you talk about what's happening in silica?"

So yes, indeed, we are seeing a bit of pressure, but for me, it's temporary pressure. And I think Silica is -- will continue to be a strong business in terms of profitability. On Composite, on the non-aerospace, we call it industrial material, I would probably think non-aerospace is probably something which is more descriptive. We've been very much focused on very special programs, the supercars program, the F1 and few others. We've never been a big participant in wind. I don't think that we have lost any market share, if market share is the right terminology, and I'm not sure it really means something in a business which is very, very granular. What we've seen is that we are today serving customers who have program which comes on and off, which are relatively short-term programs compared to the traditional automotive programs. And we are seeing this impact. The short term, I think there are still some adjustment needed in our cost base in this part of the business. Mid term, the challenge is really to be able to develop a meaningful business in, what I would call, real automotive, not the supercars, but the traditional OEM. We are working very hard on this. We've signaled since the Cytec acquisition that it will take several years to have a meaningful development, but this is exactly the direction where we want to go."

This is based on the portfolio that we had at the beginning of the year, so it's basically excluding Acetow and Vinythai, but included Polyamide. And we've reconfirmed our expectation it will deliver in excess of the EUR 800 million. And that is after -- to make that clear, that's after the evolution of exchanges rates that we've seen. So to my mind, whilst I don't necessarily can quantify specifically the FX impact on our free cash, it's more modest in the impact on our EBITDA. But nevertheless, no matter what it is, we will deliver more than EUR 800 million. That's one. Perhaps, on pricing, taking that question as well. It's predominantly energy costs, predominantly coal. And we see that mainly in soda ash Performance Chemicals to be broadly. That really is the one that's probably worth highlighting. The rest is very much affect -- we see the continuation of our excellence program helping to preserve our margins, which remain very strong. On Corporate & Business Services, I'd say the Solvay Energy Services business does have a profit stream, but it's not a linear, predictable level of profitability you can extrapolate. We don't necessarily give guidance at that degree of precision. What I can share with you is the following. Our corporate costs are running at the rate of EUR 250 million, EUR 260 million a year. There are occasionally phasing differences from one quarter to another, but the discipline, the attention to costs, the rigor, let's say, continues.

And yes, it's very good for us to have a new facility available now in China, because we are constrained by -- we are constrained on volumes. Before, we have this new facility up and running, but we should expect probably and over, I would probably say, 4 to 8 months before we are indeed able to sell because we are qualifying these new products, so we don't yet see the impact of our sales to the battery market. But this market is very, very -- is growing very fast, both in China and in other parts of the world. And we think that we have a global footprint. Taking into account this new Chinese unit, we are indeed well positioned.

The business has a very small contribution to group. It's large in term of number of employees, but small in EBITDA contribution, so probably not an important element in the modeling. But someone we'll continue to work on. On oil and gas, in fact, the reality is that with friction reducers, we're really doing very, very well. We've seen a significant switch over the years and over this crisis from a pretty complex, a very efficient fracking solutions to ones -- to solutions which are probably more cost effective, and friction reducer is great and we have -- which came up with a number of innovation which help us strengthen our position. We have a very strong position in friction reducers. This is coming from the Chemlogics acquisition. The guar is, I would say, the next expected event. Last year, there was a -- last 12 months, there was a very little guar sold, but we've started to see people interested in looking again on how we can use guar in our formulation. And yes, I would expect possible development in guar during the next quarters. But up until now, the growth in oil and gas has been mostly friction reducers. 
And Nathalie, I can add something to Nathalie's answer -- to Nathalie's question. I answer just on the PVDF unit, but don't forget that as far as the Specialty Polymer is concerned, we have also a new PEEK unit operating. This is good news because we have a lot of developments, interesting business development regarding PEEKs. We are capacity constraint, in fact, we had to source PEEK from one of our competitor. The fact that we have now a capacity up and running, being qualified or about to be qualified depending on the customer, will give us also some more freedom, and clearly, significant more business opportunities to continue to develop this polymer, which is a very interesting one."

Yes, aerospace looks good. I will come back on why it doesn't look so good when you look at our number, but looks very good because we see a strong -- we are really in the middle of a transition towards platform using a much, much larger amount of composite, and we are well positioned there. Non-aerospace issues that we have discussed several time, but again, the comments were exactly the same, maybe we gave a bit more color on mentioning Ferrari and the F-150, but this is exactly what we knew 3 months ago. No. On aerospace, what we see is just some difficulties in production. And I mean, you can listen to the calls made by Airbus and Boeing, and you'll hear about that, even Lockheed Martin and F-35, there have some slight changes in the production lines, slight adjustment which are linked to technical difficulties. I think Airbus has not yet or Pratt & Whitney has not yet solved the issues linked to the engines, I suppose, as a result, to Airbus, it has an impact on the A320neo line. We see there are still production issues here in the supply chain. We see people working very hard to solve them. By the way, in some cases, we have also some -- we have had also some quality issues which had delayed some shipment. But frankly speaking, the fundamentals, medium and long-term, are exactly the same as in Q2. The only new event, and directionally, it's a positive one, is clearly the C Series of Bombardier. It's a plane which seems to have a significant potential. Probably, Bombardier alone was not in the best possible position to make it a great commercial success. By the way, the duty imposed by the U.S. government would probably have a significant delays on the project. The fact that Airbus is coming and will be now a partner in the development is changing completely the picture. And for us, it's certainly for the better, and we expect to see some opportunities coming. Don't ask me for that in Q4. I mean it takes a bit of time to develop these opportunities in this market, but we are very confident, once again, in composite for aerospace, mid and long-term."

And secondly, just looking at the leverage of the business as a whole. If you strip out the FX, the EBITDA grew by roughly 4%, but that's obviously well below the organic growth level of 9%. Just wondering -- obviously, I appreciate there is ramp up effects and one-off costs, but it looks like the leverage is sort of 1, I'm just wondering whether you see that improving going forward."

One is delivering the profits, converting into cash by being very, very disciplined in our working capital, now almost mechanically, as you have lower activity in the final couple of months, you are able to convert a lot more of the receivables into cash. We've seen that every year, and we'll continue to deliver that. That's the main one. And one is CapEx. We're not going to be -- we're not expecting a big ramp up in CapEx.

We've done a lot of work to make sure that we manage this much better and in a much more regular way. And I'm pretty pleased with the cash flow performance, both the number we expect to generate for the full year but also our ability to generate it much more regularly. On your comments regarding Q3, be careful. I mean, we are more and more working on long-term multi-year programs. We're making a cut on one quarter and trying to develop a view on what would be the leverage between sales and EBITDA, something which is probably becoming a bit difficult and, in some cases, irrelevant. There's a number of specific element that Karim has mentioned during Q3, going from provision for variable compensation to ramp up cost in various plants, which explain what you've seen in terms of transformation of volume growth into EBITDA. I think it makes a bit more sense to look at the last 9 months or at the full year results when they will be available. And indeed, I have a feeling that we have the ability to transform our volume growth, which, by the way, was lacking last year, but we have the ability to transform our volume growth into a profitability and cash, and this is very much our focus. I understand why you need to try to get the most out of the quarterly results, but sometimes, there's a limit to what you can extract. If I go back to the comments on Composite, 1 F-35 moved 1 quarter to the next has a meaningful impact. And a bit of a cheaper or slower ramp up in the smartphone program could have also an impact on the quarter, which will be compensated the next quarter also. Be a bit careful on the conclusion you draw."

No. Ferrari, I don't want to be too specific on one customer, but let's say it's a few million of sales, which in these programs represent a few million euros of sales. On aerospace, I think we are -- where are we and I might repeat myself, but we see program like F-35 or the LEAP engine, which are just at the beginning of the actual ramp up. And yes, indeed, we have a very significant expectation regarding this ramp up for the next year and the following ones. And on these 2 programs, we don't see much difficulties today. And by the way, the expectation regarding being PEEK rate has increased significantly for both program, both the F-35 and the LEAP engine. They are seen today as very successful programs. On the A320, I think the challenge is still probably with the engines and the -- not the LEAP engine, but the Pratt & Whitney engine. I don't have much more clarity than you have. And on the large  -- the reduction of the rate in the large platform, this has been announced today by Boeing, by Airbus and then -- mostly by Boeing and Airbus. So the impact will be in the next couple of quarters, let's say. So yes, overall, I think that this situation -- the situation where we are and the situation where we'll see, probably in the course of next year, the positive elements taking over the negatives one that I was mentioning. So yes, I expect to see a change. Now it will always be a business where from one quarter to the next, you could see some variation, but just because the production chain don't run as Swiss clocks, and you have -- we have to get used to this. But clearly, the fundamental of the business are very solid. And even if I was looking longer-term, we are seeing a number of activities which will lead to a situation where the vast, vast majority of the commercial airline platforms will be made using composites. I remind you the announcement of Boeing on the, what they call, middle-of-the-market airplane, the works that Airbus is doing on the wings of tomorrow, we see a number of activities showing that, indeed, composites is the way to go. And this will create very significant long-term growth opportunity. Don't worry, we focus on long-term, but also, on short-term. And there, I think the situation will look better and better as these production difficulties will go behind us."

Internal and external, let's say noncontrollable, to state the obvious. It is the significant shift in exchange rate or a significant shift in energy costs, our capacity to respond and mitigate or otherwise is obviously restricted in a short time scale. So that is one factor, probably no surprise there. There are all of the controllable aspects except our costs, et cetera. Now I think we are very, very confident that we're running a very tight regime, so we expect to land very much more in control of that. Now clearly, Harvey has had an impact. Nobody would have predicted that a couple of months ago. The other aspect perhaps is slightly difficult to respond to, and that is about visibility of our order book and our volumes. It's quite short. We don't necessarily see clearly everywhere, clearer on that till the end of the year. So I'll give you a small example. Oil price today is what $57 WTI, $63 on the Brent. Despite that, I understand that the rig counts are falling right now, and we'll see good progress on friction reducers and guar. But who's to say it can't reverse pretty quickly. But market momentum can change quite quickly. I think given that we're quite a diversified group, typically, small bumps on one side can be overcome elsewhere, and we think that's strength. Well, that portfolio gives us the confidence to say no, no, volumes, top line, costs, profit, cash will be delivered, and that's really what underpins it. But external factors clearly can conspire or help, and we'll see what that brings."

Now I would really let Lockheed Martin comment on the detail, and what it means. But for us, what we see in terms of demand is very much in line with the public information available regarding the increase in ramp up. And again, it's a program where the PEEK production, all right, has increased significantly. However, for diesel, I don't see anything specific. I mean we know that diesel regulations are becoming more stringent when creating the need for a much more sophisticated and costly catalyst. So that's good. We know, at the same time, that the share of diesel is going down very significantly. On top of that, some recall activities here and there, creating the need for new catalyst, so the picture is pretty complex. Gasoline engine, also some evolution of regulation, which calls for a more sophisticated formulation. So overall, I would say, a good opportunity in front of us in this catalyst business. On the soda ash, yes, I mean export market are a limited part of our activities, but it's an element of a global supply and demand balance, a very important element in this export market, especially Southeast Asia, or the quantities coming from China. What we've seen is a very significant reduction of these quantities linked to the new -- not regulation but stronger enforcement of existing regulation in China. The fact that a number of outdated capacities are being phased out, so that's structural, that's good news. It has to impact. We see increases in prices in the export market, that's good. And it helps rebalance the global market at a time when capacity is available. So overall, this is going in the right direction. And by the way, if your question implied a doubt on whether our gasoline engine catalyst to contain [indiscernible] , the answer is yes, I mean gasoline engine catalyst, since the beginning of this technology, contained and continue to contain washcoat made of [indiscernible] , so it's -- I would -- probably a bit more in diesel today than in gasoline.

Don't forget that, today, a significant part of Solvay business is linked to specific programs. You can think of smartphone. You can think of specific aerospace programs, even some specific automotive program, which are not linked to the pattern of global demand. Yes, if the economy goes better or it has an impact on aerospace, but not so much on actual production rate for a given year. So there is a bit of a disconnect between these 2 elements in our -- in the meaningful part of our portfolio. A second comment. We see people in the various supply chains where we operate very cautious about building inventories. Even in markets like smartphones, after what happened a couple of years ago, we see people being very careful in making sure that they produce -- try to align production rate and demand and make sure that they are not building useless inventories. So it's -- I don't have the feeling that we are seeing people building inventories today. I think people are trying to make sure that when they are able to meet demand, which is good because when there are opportunities, we want to be there. Second, making sure that we could react quickly if the demand was going in another direction. So this being said, looking at both the forecast we have on specific programs, in some cases, pretty high-quality forecasts, in other cases, probably not so high-quality forecasts, and looking at the general prospect of the world economy for the businesses where we are more exposed to this type of metric, I'm pretty confident regarding volume growth in 2018. I think the year has been good in terms of volume growth for Solvay, 2017, I mean. And I tend to see a situation which from a volumes standpoint will probably continue to look pretty good into '18.
So with that, I suggest that we close this call. Thank you very much. Once again, significant news during this quarter on the portfolio side was the divestiture of Polyamide. We are now working hard to close this transaction. This is the end of a long string of portfolio movement. I think today, we have a portfolio that we want. We might have opportunities to make add-on acquisition here and there, but this is clearly the end of a large transaction. We have been delivering, if you look at the first 9 months of the year in terms of the growth at the EBITDA line, free cash flow generation, I think we are coming with a solid number. We've confirmed our guidance for the full year.

No significant surprises in these results, so we should be able to move relatively quickly in the introduction and leave enough time for your question. 
Indeed, before going into the Q3 performance, just a word on the announced sale of Polyamide. I think this is a very important transaction. It's clearly, in my view, the last major milestone in the portfolio transformation that we started 4 years ago. This transformation has indeed strengthened our business model and allow us to increase our ability to generate long-term growth and value for our shareholder.
Our portfolio looks very different from what it was 4 years ago. Today, we are a company which is both Advanced Material and chemical. 50% of our business indeed today is in Advanced Material. And when I say Advanced Material, it's really the top of a pyramid of the most sophisticated nonmetallic materials. 25% in, what we should probably call, surface chemistries with Novecare technology solution, our positions on surfactants, polymers, phosphorus and industry [indiscernible] which gives us the ability to serve our customers. And the remaining 25% being businesses where we have long-term sustainable positions like soda ash and peroxide.
This allow us -- this is reflected in our EBITDA margin, which has been constantly above 20% since 2016, well above our traditional peer group. 50% of our portfolio today are for sustainable solutions for our customers, so very much in line with our sustainability policy. And we've seen over the years, as I have commented several time, a dramatic shift in the quality of our customer base to ones that provides major global blue-chip companies with unique solutions that are critical to their own programs. Overall, I think our strategy to turn into a multispecialty chemical company -- multispecialty company, material and chemical, is indeed bearing fruit.
Looking at our Q3 results, I think the highlight of the period would be, first, the 9% volume growth, clearly significant, driven by volume increase across our 3 segments; EBITDA of EUR 553 million, up only 1%, despite a strong organic growth of 5%, but most of this was offset by foreign exchange, particularly the dollar, euro and [indiscernible] . EBITDA margins remain robust at 22%. Cash flow generation for the first 9 months demonstrate indeed our ability to focus and generate cash. 
And with that, I will turn to Karim to provide more specific insights into our financial performance, and I'll come back with some concluding comments."

As usual, I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website. And I will be talking about figures on an underlying basis, because that is more helpful and comparable with our past, remembering as",947,"Thank you, Jean-Pierre. Good afternoon. 
As usual, I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website. And I will be talking about figures on an underlying basis, because that is more helpful and comparable with our past, remembering as well that the P&L figures that I'll be referring to are those that reflect the discontinuation of the divestment of the Polyamide activities.
And I'll start with sales. On Slide #8, you will see the fact is that our net sales increased by 4%, but that doesn't tell the full story because, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, volumes are up very significantly, 9% across all of our operating segments, in fact. 
So I'll start with Advanced Materials. They were up 5%, mainly in automotive and smart devices. You will take note as well of the fact that composite sales in aeronautics were stable, as we see the production ramp up of the F-35 program, continuation of the growth of the LEAP engine compensate for the continuing decline in wide-bodied platforms, particularly older-generation ones, such as the A380 and the 777. And thus for composites, sales did decrease, mainly because of the end of a supercar program, the Ferrari F-150, that was anticipated.  But we did see some softness across a couple of industrial markets, such as wind and rail.
Turning to Advanced Formulations and seeing volume growth of 15%, with a strong recovery in oil and gas. This is something that we see also helped by improving in mix, which is visible in the improved EBITDA margins compared to the second quarter of this year. 
Technology Solutions did increase its volumes as well, especially in non-mining activities. And so far as mining is concerned, we remain very well positioned for anticipated new mines that will come on stream in the foreseeable future, next year and beyond.
Performance Chemicals. Volumes up 7%. Strong volumes in soda ash continued, particularly in the seaborne market, but also in the specialty bicarbonate applications, and of course, as you would expect, the contribution from the new HPPO peroxide plant in Saudi Arabia. These are all contributing to the growth and obviously helped to offset the foreign exchange headwinds, which, as you'd expect, the appreciation of the euro, particularly against the dollar, but also the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, which together gave us a 3% -- negative 3% conversion effect.
But there is more to it than sales clearly. If we turn to Slide #9 and look at EBITDA, you will see the fact is that our headline growth of 1% has essentially moved forward off a very strong comp last year.  That I'm sure you remember. So that 1% also belies the fact that we've overcome some headwinds on foreign exchange and a modest impact on scope. 
Now on an organic basis, excluding foreign exchange and scope, EBITDA grew by 5%. The key points I'd like to highlight is: one, the full impact of the volume growth helped to overcome higher energy costs, particularly coal and soda ash; but also an increase in our fixed costs that results from 2 main factors: additional capacity [ at good cost ] in many ways, but also the variable remuneration, as we recognize and reward our teams for delivering on strong objectives.
It's also important to note that what you don't see is the weather-related disruptions in the U.S., such as hurricane Harvey. They haven't impacted as much at all in Q3, but we do anticipate a modest adverse supply chain logistical impact of up to EUR 10 million in Q4 as well. We've obviously taken that into account in our forecast that Jean-Pierre will talk to in a moment.
Moving beyond EBITDA, and turning to other important financial elements.  On Page 11 -- Slide 11, you'll see 2 points in particular. Financial charges are lower as we maintain our focus on cash generation as we deleverage our balance sheet. That has an impact in reducing our financial charges. The other element is our underlying tax rate is down from 28% to 27%. Again, it's a good improvement that does create value and will be sustainable at this stage as we see it.
Cash is a very positive indicator, and we have to look at it beyond one quarter.  If we turn to Page 12, you will see that the free cash flow from our continuing businesses was EUR 195 million. But on accumulative basis, 9 months, to try and take out some of those modest seasonality impacts, we are 33% higher than last year for the first 9 months.  That's EUR 111 million better than last year. And that comes from 2 main factors: continued attention to CapEx, no surprise there; and hopefully, no surprise from the continued discipline in working capital, where we're very attentive to our day sales outstanding [ that ] are overdue. This is really part of the regime that we have in place here.
Now for those who are particularly attentive to our debt levels, we were pretty high, let's say, 18, 24 month ago, you would have taken note of the reduction in those debt levels. Our leverage ratio currently of 2.3x is down from 2.6x at the beginning of the year. And you will take note of the fact that the Polyamide investment -- divestment will further improve that to around 2x on a pro forma basis.
The fact that the cash is there, the profit growth is there, is clearly also acknowledged independently by S&P, and we're pleased to see that acknowledgment in the upgrade to our credit rating to BBB+  in early August.
And with that, I hand you back to Jean-Pierre."

As we've said in our press release, we remain well on track to deliver a strong financial performance. Our underlying EBITDA growth is estimated between 6% and 8% for the full year, based on the strong year-to-date growth of 9%. This imply, as you can easily figure, for Q4, an EBITDA largely in line with last year, with taking into account all the elements that Karim has mentioned, foreign exchange and some of the disruption coming from -- in our supply chain coming from the Harvey and other weather-related events in the U.S. 
On the free cash flow side, EUR 484 million delivered in the first 9 months. This puts us in a very good position to deliver more than the EUR 800 million that we have mentioned at the beginning of this year. And indeed, the fact that we have a much more regular cash flow profile year-over-year is something that we are aiming at, and I think it's a very good achievement from our team. We have confirmed an interim dividend payment of EUR 138 (sic) [ EUR 1.38 ] per share.
Looking at our priority today. As I've said, leaving aside the completion of the Polyamide divestiture, which is indeed a very important project, I think the focus now is very much to make sure that we will continue to drive in delivering on our midterm financial objectives. We want also to make good progress, and I think we are indeed making good progress on extra-financial objectives, including our commitment to sustainable development. We will continue to drive organic growth with innovation being at the center of our plans. We have a unique portfolio to be able to support very demanding customers, but customers which certainly have a need for the solution that Solvay is in a position to deliver.
We are now, as we have finalized our portfolio transformation, we are now in the process of figuring our corporate and functional structure to simplify and better align the structure with our new group profile, and we are planning to share more of this with you at the beginning of 2018.

The first one, Advanced Materials, just looking at the composite growth year-on-year. Could you unpack that a little bit for us and talk about how much of that explicitly in composites was FX, the LEAP engine positive versus the kind of the slowdown factors? That would be very interesting. And my second and third questions are focused on Performance Chemicals and in particular, in soda ash. Is this 26% EBITDA margin now the kind of the new run rate for soda ash, noting that you're absorbing these heavy -- these higher energy costs? And secondly, obviously there is a significant ramp up in Turkish material due literally now in the coming months. Is your sense for this material has already been priced by the market, i.e. it's already been signed off? There is just the function of delivering it. Or do you think the negative price impact is yet to come for the soda ash market?"

On Composite, maybe a few comments on the business and Karim can complement with the ForEx impact on this. But what we are seeing in composite is a continuation of the challenges we signaled in the non-aerospace markets, and we benefited in past quarters from the support of some supercar programs.  They will come back, but we have a few quarters where we don't have this type of activities. So it's really something that we need to work on to make sure that the non-aerospace part of the business is indeed delivering on a more regular pace. On aerospace, we have some short-term smoothening of volumes. But in my view, nothing serious. I mean, the balance between the very significant ramp-up we are expecting and seeing, in fact, both our LEAP engine F-35, A320neo, Boeing 737 Max, probably, by the way, good news also on the Bombardier C Series, because the fact that Airbus is taking responsibility for this program will probably increase the likelihood of seeing more planes being built. So all of these are very good news for the short and medium-term. And at the same time, we are seeing reductions in build rates on the large twin -- on the large platform like the A380 and Boeing 777. So all of that gives us the feeling that the opportunities in front of us are quite significant, because our position and our share in these various programs is something which is set. So we are just waiting to see the build rate indeed increasing. Maybe you want to comment on ForEx, on Composite, Karim?"

I'd say the FX is the main driver to note for the Composites evolution. There's a small element on auto as well, and that's to do, for example, the Ferrari F-150, but that's an industrial materials piece, but it's relatively modest. FX is the main impact there."

We have a lot of moving parts as far as soda ash is concerned. An important element, especially in the export market, is the fact that Chinese capacities are being phased out, mostly for regulatory and environmental reasons, so this is good, and this opened up opportunities for us in the export market. We are very concerned that we've prepared very well for this new capacity coming from Turkey. But again, let's wait a bit to see what will be the actual impact in 2018. But in my view, nothing catastrophic, as I've said several time, but an impact which will be visible."

I'm wondering what you've been doing on the commercial side of things, for instance, to try and improve that. And the related question, I guess, is, do you think you've got the right cost base now given the size of this business, which has been shrinking quite a bit since you acquired Cytec? The second question is on Silica and silica pricing. It looks like the pressure has accelerated into the third quarter despite higher energy costs, where I think you have the passthrough and also higher silicon metal prices. I'm really puzzled as to the price cut there, when I would have thought that your raw material pressure would push prices up, so I think there's been a big squeeze on profits. Can you talk about what's happening on Silica?"

On Silica, passthrough, as you say, is never an immediate passthrough. I mean, to be able to take into account evolution in raw material, energy, we need to have numbers available, and there's always a mechanism which creates some delays in the way the passthrough is applied. So yes, indeed, we are seeing a bit of pressure, but for me, it's temporary pressure. And I think Silica is -- will continue to be a strong business in terms of profitability. On Composite, the -- on the non-aerospace, we call it industrial material, I would probably think non-aerospace is probably something which is more descriptive. We've been very much focused on very special programs, the supercars program, the F1 and few others. We've never been a big participant in wind. I don't think that we have lost any market share, if market share is the right terminology, and I'm not sure it really means something in a business which is very, very granular. What we've seen is that we are today serving customers who have program which comes on and off, which are relatively short-term programs compared to the traditional automotive programs. And we are seeing this impact. The short term, I think there are still some adjustments needed in our cost base in this part of the business. Mid term, the challenge is really to be able to develop a meaningful business in, what I would call, real automotive, not the supercars, but the traditional OEM. We are working very hard on this. We've signaled, since the Cytec acquisition, that it will take several years to have meaningful development, but this is exactly the direction where we want to go."

So to my mind, whilst I don't necessarily can quantify specifically the FX impact on our free cash, it's more modest than the impact on our EBITDA. But nevertheless, no matter what it is, we will deliver more than EUR 800 million. That's one. On -- Perhaps on pricing, taking that question as well, it's predominantly energy costs, predominantly coal.  We see that mainly in soda ash Performance Chemicals to be broadly. That really is the one that's probably worth highlighting. The rest is very much effect -- we see the continuation of our excellence program helping to preserve our margins, which remain very strong. On Corporate & Business Services, I'd say, the Solvay Energy Services business does have a profit stream, but it's not a linear, predictable level of profitability you can extrapolate. We don't necessarily give guidance at that degree of precision. What I can share with you is the following: Our corporate costs are running at the rate of EUR 250 million, EUR 260 million a year. There are occasionally phasing differences from one quarter to another, but the discipline, the attention to costs, the rigor, let's say, continues.

It has -- it could not be part of a global deal,[indiscernible] . Frankly speaking, a little comment today on what will be the future of the business, it's more a regional business, and any solution is likely to be a regional one. The business has a very small contribution to group. It's large in term of number of employees, but small in EBITDA contribution, so probably not an important element in the modeling. But someone we'll continue to work on. On oil and gas, in fact, the reality is that with friction reducers, we're really doing very, very well. We've seen a significant switch over the years and over this crisis from a pretty complex, a very efficient fracking solutions to ones -- to solutions which are probably more cost effective, and friction reducer is great and we have -- we've came up with a number of innovation which help us strengthen our position. We have a very strong position in friction reducers. This is coming from the Chemlogics acquisition. The guar is, I would say, the next expected event. Last year, there was a -- last 12 months, there was a very little guar sold, but we've started to see people interested in looking again on how we can use guar in our formulation. And yes, I would expect possible development in guar during the next quarters. But up until now, the growth in oil and gas has been mostly friction reducers. 
And maybe I can add something to Nathalie's -- to answer the previous question. I answer just on the PVDF unit, but don't forget that as far as the Specialty Polymer is concerned, we have also a new PEEK unit operating. This is good news because we have a lot of developments, interesting business development regarding PEEKs. We were capacity constrained; in fact, we had to source PEEK from one of our competitor. The fact that we have now a capacity up and running, being qualified or about to be qualified depending on the customer, will give us also some more freedom, and clearly, significant more business opportunities to continue to develop this polymer, which is a very interesting one."

And obviously, with the impact of inflation, excellence, variable remuneration comes in the mix as well. So these are the other factors as well there. On cash, let me take that. There is nothing particularly significant. There's quite a lot of seasonality typically in that line.

Non-aerospace issues that we have discussed several time, but again, the comments were exactly the same, maybe we gave a bit more color on mentioning Ferrari and the F-150, but this is exactly what we knew 3 months ago. No. On aerospace, what we see is just some difficulties in production. And I mean, you can listen to the calls made by Airbus and Boeing, and you'll hear about that.  Even Lockheed Martin and the F-35, there have some slight changes in the production lines, slight adjustment which are linked to technical difficulties. I think Airbus has not yet or Pratt & Whitney has not yet solved the issues linked to the engines, are supposed to be [indiscernible] Airbus.  It has an impact on the A320neo line. We see there are still production issues here in the supply chain. We see people working very hard to solve them. By the way, in some cases, we have also some -- we have had also some quality issues which had delayed some shipment. But frankly speaking, the fundamentals, medium and long-term, are exactly the same as in Q2. The only new event, and directionally, it's a positive one, is clearly the C Series of Bombardier. It's a plane which seems to have a significant potential. Probably, Bombardier alone was not in the best possible position to make it a great commercial success. By the way, the duty imposed by the U.S. government would probably have significantly weighed on the project. The fact that Airbus is coming and will be now a partner in the development is changing completely the picture. And for us, it's certainly for the better, and we expect to see some opportunities coming. Don't ask me for that in Q4. I mean, it takes a bit of time to develop these opportunities in this market, but we are very confident, once again, in composite for aerospace, mid and long-term."

We've seen that every year, and we'll continue to deliver that. That's the main one. And one is CapEx. We're not going to be -- we're not expecting a big ramp-up in CapEx.

And I'm pretty pleased with the cash flow performance, both the number we expect to generate for the full year but also our ability to generate it much more regularly. On your comments regarding Q3, be careful. I mean, we are more and more working on long-term multi-year programs. We're making a cut on one quarter and trying to develop a view on what would be the leverage between sales and EBITDA, something which is probably becoming a bit difficult and, in some cases, irrelevant. There's a number of specific element that Karim has mentioned during Q3, going from provision for variable compensation to ramp-up cost in various plants, which explain what you've seen in terms of transformation of volume growth into EBITDA. I think it makes a bit more sense to look at the last 9 months or at the full year results when they will be available. And indeed, I have a feeling that we have the ability to transform our volume growth, which, by the way, was lacking last year, but we have the ability to transform our volume growth into profitability and cash, and this is very much our focus. I understand why you need to try to get the most out of the quarterly results, but sometimes, there's a limit to what you can extract. If I go back to the comments on Composite, 1 F-35 moved 1 quarter to the next has a meaningful impact. And a bit of a steeper or slower ramp-up in a smartphone program could have also an impact on the quarter, which will be compensated the next quarter also.

No. Ferrari, I don't want to be too specific on one customer, but let's say it's a few million of sales, which in these programs represent a few million euros of sales. On aerospace, I think we are -- where are we and I might repeat myself, but we see program like the F-35 or the LEAP engine, which are just at the beginning of the actual ramp-up. And yes, indeed, we have a very significant expectation regarding this ramp-up for the next year and the following one. And on these 2 programs, we don't see much difficulties today. And by the way, the expectation regarding being PEEK rate has increased significantly for both program, both the F-35 and the LEAP engine. They are seen today as very successful programs. On the A320, I think the challenge is still probably with the engines and the -- not the LEAP engine, but the Pratt & Whitney engine. I don't have much more clarity than you have. And on the large  platform -- the reduction of the rate in the large platform, this has been announced today by Boeing, by Airbus and then -- mostly by Boeing and Airbus. So the impact will be in the next couple of quarters, let's say. So yes, overall, I think that this situation -- the situation where we are and the situation where we'll see, probably in the course of next year, the positive elements taking over the negatives one that I was mentioning. So yes, I expect to see a change. Now it will always be a business where, from one quarter to the next, you could see some variation, but just because the production chain don't run as Swiss clocks, and you have -- we have to get used to this. But clearly, the fundamental of the business are very solid. And even if I was looking longer-term, we are seeing a number of activities which will lead to a situation where the vast, vast majority of the commercial airline platforms will be made using composites. I remind you the announcement of Boeing on the, what they call, middle-of-the-market airplane, the works that Airbus is doing on the wings of tomorrow. I mean, we see a number of activities showing that, indeed, composites is the way to go. And this will create very significant long-term growth opportunity. Don't worry, we focus on long-term, but also, on short-term. And there, I think the situation will look better and better as these production difficulties will go behind us."

Internal and external, let's say, noncontrollable, to state the obvious. It is there is a significant shift in exchange rate or a significant shift in energy costs, our capacity to respond and mitigate or otherwise is obviously restricted in a short time scale. So that is one factor, probably no surprise there. There are all of the controllable aspects, let's say, our costs, et cetera. No, I think we are very, very confident that we're running a very tight regime, so we expect to land very much more in control of that. Now clearly, Harvey has had an impact. Nobody would have predicted that a couple of months ago. The other aspect perhaps is slightly difficult to respond to, and that is about visibility of our order book and our volumes. It's quite short. We don't necessarily see clearly everywhere, clearer on that till the end of the year. So I'll give you a small example. Oil price today is what? $57 WTI, $63 on the Brent. Despite that, I understand that the rig counts are falling right now, now we've see good progress on friction reducers and guar.  Who's to say it can't reverse pretty quickly? That market momentum can change quite quickly. I think given that we're quite a diversified group, typically small bumps on one side can be overcome elsewhere, and we think that's strength or that portfolio gives us the confidence to say no, no, volumes, top line, costs, profit, cash will be delivered, and that's really what underpins it.

Now I would really let Lockheed Martin comments on the detail and what it means. But for us, what we see in terms of demand is very much in line with the public information available regarding the increase in ramp-up. And again, it's a program where the PEEK production rate has increased significantly. However, for diesel, I don't see anything specific. I mean, we know that diesel regulations are becoming more and more stringent when creating the need for a much more sophisticated and costly catalyst. So that's good. We know, at the same time, that the share of diesel is going down very significantly. On top of that, some recall activities here and there, creating the need for new catalyst, so the picture is pretty complex. Gasoline engine, also some evolution of regulation, which calls for a more sophisticated formulation. So overall, I would say, a good opportunity in front of us in this catalyst business. On soda ash, yes, I mean export market are a limited part of our activities, but it's an element of a global supply and demand balance, a very important element in this export market, especially Southeast Asia. Are the quantities coming from China? What we've seen is a very significant reduction of these quantities linked to the new -- not regulation but stronger enforcement of existing regulation in China. The fact that a number of outdated capacities are being phased out, so that's structural, that's good news. It has to impact. We see increases in prices in the export market, that's good. And it helps rebalance the global market at a time when no capacity is available. So overall, this is going in the right direction. And by the way, if your question implied a doubt on whether our gasoline engine catalyst contain rare earth, the answer is yes. I mean, gasoline engine catalyst, since the beginning of this technology, contained and continue to contain washcoat made of rare earth, so it's -- I would -- probably a bit more in diesel today than in gasoline. But at the same time, as technology evolves, the need for more sophisticated washcoat appears in both types of technology."

Don't forget that, today, a significant part of Solvay business is linked to specific programs. You can think of smartphone. You can think of specific aerospace programs, even some specific automotive program, which are not linked to the pattern of global demand. Yes, if the economy goes better, it has an impact on aerospace, but not so much on actual production rate for a given year. So there is a bit of a disconnect between these 2 elements in our -- in the meaningful part of our portfolio. A second comment. We see people in the various supply chains where we operate, very cautious about building inventories. Even in markets like smartphones, after what happened a couple of years ago, we see people being very careful in making sure that they produce -- try to align production rate and demand and make sure that they are not building useless inventories. So it's -- I don't have the feeling that we are seeing people building inventories today. I think people are trying to make sure that when they are able to meet demand, which is good because when there are opportunities, we want to be there. Second, making sure that we could react quickly if the demand was going in another direction. So this being said, looking at both the forecast we have on specific programs, in some cases, pretty high-quality forecasts, in other cases, probably not so high-quality forecasts, and looking at the general prospect of the world economy for the businesses where we are more exposed to this type of metric, I'm pretty confident regarding volume growth in 2018. I think the year has been good in terms of volume growth for Solvay -- 2017, I mean. And I tend to see a situation which, from a volumes standpoint, will probably continue to look pretty good into '18.
So with that, I suggest that we close this call. Thank you very much. Once again, significant news during this quarter on the portfolio side was the divestiture of Polyamide. We are now working hard to close this transaction. This is the end of a long string of portfolio movement. I think today, we have a portfolio that we want. We might have opportunities to make add-on acquisition here and there, but this is clearly the end of a large [ fast ] transaction. We have been delivering, if you look at the first 9 months of the year in terms of the growth at the EBITDA line, free cash flow generation, I think we are coming with a solid number. We've confirmed our guidance for the full year.

As usual, I'm here with Karim Hajjar, our CFO; and Kimberly. And together, we'll try to provide another view of our Q3 results before going into your questions and to thing that they ask. No significant surprises in these results, so we should be able to move relatively quickly in the introduction and leave enough time for your question. 
Indeed, before going into the Q3 performance, just a word on the announced sale of Polyamide. I think this is a very important transaction. It's clearly, in my view, the last major milestone in the portfolio transformation that we started 4 years ago. This transformation has indeed strengthened our business model and allow us to increase our ability to generate long-term growth and value for our shareholder.
Our portfolio looks very different from what it was 4 years ago. Today, we are a company which is both Advanced Material and chemical. 50% of our business indeed today is in Advanced Material. And when I say Advanced Material, it's really the top of a pyramid of the most sophisticated nonmetallic materials. 25% in, what we should probably call, surface chemistries with Novecare technology solution, our positions on surfactants, polymers, phosphorus and industry [indiscernible] which gives us the ability to serve our customers. And the remaining 25% being businesses where we have long-term sustainable positions like soda ash and peroxide.
This allow us -- this is reflected in our EBITDA margin, which has been constantly above 20% since 2016, well above our traditional peer group. 50% of our portfolio today are for sustainable solutions for our customers, so very much in line with our sustainability policy. And we've seen over the years, as I have commented several time, a dramatic shift in the quality of our customer base to ones that provides major global blue-chip companies with unique solutions that are critical to their own programs. Overall, I think our strategy to turn into a multispecialty chemical company -- multispecialty company, material and chemical, is indeed bearing fruit.
Looking at our Q3 results, I think the highlight of the period would be, first, the 9% volume growth, clearly significant, driven by volume increase across our 3 segments; EBITDA of EUR 553 million, up only 1%, despite a strong organic growth of 5%, but most of this was offset by foreign exchange, particularly the dollar, euro and [indiscernible] . EBITDA margins remain robust at 22%. Cash flow generation for the first 9 months demonstrate indeed our ability to focus and generate cash. 
And with that, I will turn to Karim to provide more specific insights into our financial performance, and I'll come back with some concluding comments."

As usual, I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website. And I will be talking about figures on an underlying basis, because that is more helpful and comparable with our past, remembering as",947,"Thank you, Jean-Pierre. Good afternoon. 
As usual, I'm going to refer to some slides that you can access on our website. And I will be talking about figures on an underlying basis, because that is more helpful and comparable with our past, remembering as well that the P&L figures that I'll be referring to are those that reflect the discontinuation of the divestment of the Polyamide activities.
And I'll start with sales. On Slide #8, you will see the fact is that our net sales increased by 4%, but that doesn't tell the full story because, as Jean-Pierre mentioned, volumes are up very significantly, 9% across all of our operating segments, in fact. 
So I'll start with Advanced Materials. They were up 5%, mainly in automotive and smart devices. You will take note as well of the fact that composite sales in aeronautics were stable, as we see the production ramp up of the F-35 program, continuation of the growth of the LEAP engine compensate for the continuing decline in wide-bodied platforms, particularly older-generation ones, such as the A380 and the 777. And thus for composites, sales did decrease, mainly because of the end of a supercar program, the Ferrari F-150, that was anticipated. But we did see some softness across a couple of industrial markets, such as wind and rail.
Turning to Advanced Formulations and seeing volume growth of 15%, with a strong recovery in oil and gas. This is something that we see also helped by improving in mix, which is visible in the improved EBITDA margins compared to the second quarter of this year. 
Technology Solutions did increase its volumes as well, especially in non-mining activities. And so far as mining is concerned, we remain very well positioned for anticipated new mines that will come on stream in the foreseeable future, next year and beyond.
Performance Chemicals. Volumes up 7%. Strong volumes in soda ash continued, particularly in the seaborne market, but also in the specialty bicarbonate applications, and of course, as you would expect, the contribution from the new HPPO peroxide plant in Saudi Arabia. These are all contributing to the growth and obviously helped to offset the foreign exchange headwinds, which, as you'd expect, the appreciation of the euro, particularly against the dollar, but also the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, which together gave us a 3% -- negative 3% conversion effect.
But there is more to it than sales clearly. If we turn to Slide #9 and look at EBITDA, you will see the fact is that our headline growth of 1% has essentially moved forward off a very strong comp last year. That I'm sure you remember. So that 1% also belies the fact that we've overcome some headwinds on foreign exchange and a modest impact on scope. 
Now on an organic basis, excluding foreign exchange and scope, EBITDA grew by 5%. The key points I'd like to highlight is: one, the full impact of the volume growth helped to overcome higher energy costs, particularly coal and soda ash; but also an increase in our fixed costs that results from 2 main factors: additional capacity [ at good cost ] in many ways, but also the variable remuneration, as we recognize and reward our teams for delivering on strong objectives.
It's also important to note that what you don't see is the weather-related disruptions in the U.S., such as hurricane Harvey. They haven't impacted as much at all in Q3, but we do anticipate a modest adverse supply chain logistical impact of up to EUR 10 million in Q4 as well. We've obviously taken that into account in our forecast that Jean-Pierre will talk to in a moment.
Moving beyond EBITDA, and turning to other important financial elements. On Page 11 -- Slide 11, you'll see 2 points in particular. Financial charges are lower as we maintain our focus on cash generation as we deleverage our balance sheet. That has an impact in reducing our financial charges. The other element is our underlying tax rate is down from 28% to 27%. Again, it's a good improvement that does create value and will be sustainable at this stage as we see it.
Cash is a very positive indicator, and we have to look at it beyond one quarter. If we turn to Page 12, you will see that the free cash flow from our continuing businesses was EUR 195 million. But on accumulative basis, 9 months, to try and take out some of those modest seasonality impacts, we are 33% higher than last year for the first 9 months. That's EUR 111 million better than last year. And that comes from 2 main factors: continued attention to CapEx, no surprise there; and hopefully, no surprise from the continued discipline in working capital, where we're very attentive to our day sales outstanding [ that ] are overdue. This is really part of the regime that we have in place here.
Now for those who are particularly attentive to our debt levels, we were pretty high, let's say, 18, 24 month ago, you would have taken note of the reduction in those debt levels. Our leverage ratio currently of 2.3x is down from 2.6x at the beginning of the year. And you will take note of the fact that the Polyamide investment -- divestment will further improve that to around 2x on a pro forma basis.
The fact that the cash is there, the profit growth is there, is clearly also acknowledged independently by S&P, and we're pleased to see that acknowledgment in the upgrade to our credit rating to BBB+ in early August.
And with that, I hand you back to Jean-Pierre."

As we've said in our press release, we remain well on track to deliver a strong financial performance. Our underlying EBITDA growth is estimated between 6% and 8% for the full year, based on the strong year-to-date growth of 9%. This imply, as you can easily figure, for Q4, an EBITDA largely in line with last year, with taking into account all the elements that Karim has mentioned, foreign exchange and some of the disruption coming from -- in our supply chain coming from the Harvey and other weather-related events in the U.S. 
On the free cash flow side, EUR 484 million delivered in the first 9 months. This puts us in a very good position to deliver more than the EUR 800 million that we have mentioned at the beginning of this year. And indeed, the fact that we have a much more regular cash flow profile year-over-year is something that we are aiming at, and I think it's a very good achievement from our team. We have confirmed an interim dividend payment of EUR 138 (sic) [ EUR 1.38 ] per share.
Looking at our priority today. As I've said, leaving aside the completion of the Polyamide divestiture, which is indeed a very important project, I think the focus now is very much to make sure that we will continue to drive in delivering on our midterm financial objectives. We want also to make good progress, and I think we are indeed making good progress on extra-financial objectives, including our commitment to sustainable development. We will continue to drive organic growth with innovation being at the center of our plans. We have a unique portfolio to be able to support very demanding customers, but customers which certainly have a need for the solution that Solvay is in a position to deliver.
We are now, as we have finalized our portfolio transformation, we are now in the process of figuring our corporate and functional structure to simplify and better align the structure with our new group profile, and we are planning to share more of this with you at the beginning of 2018.

Could you unpack that a little bit for us and talk about how much of that explicitly in composites was FX, the LEAP engine positive versus the kind of the slowdown factors? That would be very interesting. And my second and third questions are focused on Performance Chemicals and in particular, in soda ash. Is this 26% EBITDA margin now the kind of the new run rate for soda ash, noting that you're absorbing these heavy -- these higher energy costs? And secondly, obviously there is a significant ramp up in Turkish material due literally now in the coming months. Is your sense for this material has already been priced by the market, i.e. it's already been signed off? There is just the function of delivering it. Or do you think the negative price impact is yet to come for the soda ash market?"

On Composite, maybe a few comments on the business and Karim can complement with the ForEx impact on this. But what we are seeing in composite is a continuation of the challenges we signaled in the non-aerospace markets, and we benefited in past quarters from the support of some supercar programs. They will come back, but we have a few quarters where we don't have this type of activities. So it's really something that we need to work on to make sure that the non-aerospace part of the business is indeed delivering on a more regular pace. On aerospace, we have some short-term smoothening of volumes. But in my view, nothing serious. I mean, the balance between the very significant ramp-up we are expecting and seeing, in fact, both our LEAP engine F-35, A320neo, Boeing 737 Max, probably, by the way, good news also on the Bombardier C Series, because the fact that Airbus is taking responsibility for this program will probably increase the likelihood of seeing more planes being built. So all of these are very good news for the short and medium-term. And at the same time, we are seeing reductions in build rates on the large twin -- on the large platform like the A380 and Boeing 777. So all of that gives us the feeling that the opportunities in front of us are quite significant, because our position and our share in these various programs is something which is set. So we are just waiting to see the build rate indeed increasing. Maybe you want to comment on ForEx, on Composite, Karim?"

I'd say the FX is the main driver to note for the Composites evolution. There's a small element on auto as well, and that's to do, for example, the Ferrari F-150, but that's an industrial materials piece, but it's relatively modest. FX is the main impact there."

We have a lot of moving parts as far as soda ash is concerned. An important element, especially in the export market, is the fact that Chinese capacities are being phased out, mostly for regulatory and environmental reasons, so this is good, and this opened up opportunities for us in the export market. We are very concerned that we've prepared very well for this new capacity coming from Turkey. But again, let's wait a bit to see what will be the actual impact in 2018. But in my view, nothing catastrophic, as I've said several time, but an impact which will be visible."

I'm wondering what you've been doing on the commercial side of things, for instance, to try and improve that. And the related question, I guess, is, do you think you've got the right cost base now given the size of this business, which has been shrinking quite a bit since you acquired Cytec? The second question is on Silica and silica pricing. It looks like the pressure has accelerated into the third quarter despite higher energy costs, where I think you have the pass-through and also higher silicon metal prices. I'm really puzzled as to the price cut there, when I would have thought that your raw material pressure would push prices up, so I think there's been a big squeeze on profits. Can you talk about what's happening on Silica?"

I mean, to be able to take into account evolution in raw material, energy, we need to have numbers available, and there's always a mechanism which creates some delays in the way the pass-through is applied. So yes, indeed, we are seeing a bit of pressure, but for me, it's temporary pressure. And I think Silica is -- will continue to be a strong business in terms of profitability. On Composite, the -- on the non-aerospace, we call it industrial material, I would probably think non-aerospace is probably something which is more descriptive. We've been very much focused on very special programs, the supercars program, the F1 and few others. We've never been a big participant in wind. I don't think that we have lost any market share, if market share is the right terminology, and I'm not sure it really means something in a business which is very, very granular. What we've seen is that we are today serving customers who have program which comes on and off, which are relatively short-term programs compared to the traditional automotive programs. And we are seeing this impact. The short term, I think there are still some adjustments needed in our cost base in this part of the business. Midterm, the challenge is really to be able to develop a meaningful business in, what I would call, real automotive, not the supercars, but the traditional OEM. We are working very hard on this. We've signaled, since the Cytec acquisition, that it will take several years to have meaningful development, but this is exactly the direction where we want to go."

But nevertheless, no matter what it is, we will deliver more than EUR 800 million. That's one. On -- Perhaps on pricing, taking that question as well, it's predominantly energy costs, predominantly coal. We see that mainly in soda ash Performance Chemicals to be broadly. That really is the one that's probably worth highlighting. The rest is very much effect -- we see the continuation of our excellence program helping to preserve our margins, which remain very strong. On Corporate & Business Services, I'd say, the Solvay Energy Services business does have a profit stream, but it's not a linear, predictable level of profitability you can extrapolate. We don't necessarily give guidance at that degree of precision. What I can share with you is the following: Our corporate costs are running at the rate of EUR 250 million, EUR 260 million a year. There are occasionally phasing differences from one quarter to another, but the discipline, the attention to costs, the rigor, let's say, continues.

Yes, when there are situations like the one in Silica where we have to wait a quarter to see the impact of increase in raw material or energy -- in this case, it's energy. But frankly speaking, I'm very confident regarding our ability to manage prices and margin in our current portfolio. And by the way, the 22% EBITDA margin that we are generating in Q3 clearly demonstrate the fact that, indeed, Solvay has pricing power."

And what kind of qualifications timing would you have, or are you already qualified for that capacity? The idea is a bit to have a view on the ramp-up of the new facilities. That's the first question. And the second one would be actually in soda ash again, sorry to insist on that one. But I understood that in order to kind of secure your market positioning, you work a little bit more with long-term contracts. And I was wondering how this works. Is the price really fixed for a couple of years? Or do you still have some negotiation power to increase prices in response to higher, yes, cost base, i.e. energy costs or whatever other raw material or freight costs?"

And yes, it's very good for us to have a new facility available now in China, because we are constrained by -- we are constrained on volumes. Before, we have this new facility up and running, but we should expect probably another, I would probably say, 4 to 8 months before we are indeed able to sell because we are qualifying these new products. So we don't yet see the impact of our sales to the battery market. But this market is very, very -- is growing very fast, both in China and in other parts of the world. And we think that we have a global footprint. Taking into account this new Chinese unit, we are indeed well positioned. Well, the impact of the -- when we say long-term contract, there are obviously some -- they're obviously, in the pricing element of these contracts, some component which are linked to the external environment. I don't want to be too specific on this. But yes, we have some variability. Overall, it plays well because it's an element of stability in the market, which limits the potential fluctuation of market share from one player to the other.

Frankly speaking, a little comment today on what will be the future of the business, it's more a regional business, and any solution is likely to be a regional one. The business has a very small contribution to group. It's large in term of number of employees, but small in EBITDA contribution, so probably not an important element in the modeling. But someone we'll continue to work on. On oil and gas, in fact, the reality is that with friction reducers, we're really doing very, very well. We've seen a significant switch over the years and over this crisis from a pretty complex, a very efficient fracking solutions to ones -- to solutions which are probably more cost effective, and friction reducer is great and we have -- we've came up with a number of innovation which help us strengthen our position. We have a very strong position in friction reducers. This is coming from the Chemlogics acquisition. The guar is, I would say, the next expected event. Last year, there was a -- last 12 months, there was a very little guar sold, but we've started to see people interested in looking again on how we can use guar in our formulation. And yes, I would expect possible development in guar during the next quarters. But up until now, the growth in oil and gas has been mostly friction reducers. And maybe I can add something to Nathalie's -- to answer the previous question. I answer just on the PVDF unit, but don't forget that as far as the Specialty Polymer is concerned, we have also a new PEEK unit operating. This is good news because we have a lot of developments, interesting business development regarding PEEKs. We were capacity constrained; in fact, we had to source PEEK from one of our competitor. The fact that we have now a capacity up and running, being qualified or about to be qualified depending on the customer, will give us also some more freedom, and clearly, significant more business opportunities to continue to develop this polymer, which is a very interesting one."

There is nothing particularly significant. There's quite a lot of seasonality typically in that line.

Non-aerospace issues that we have discussed several time, but again, the comments were exactly the same, maybe we gave a bit more color on mentioning Ferrari and the F-150, but this is exactly what we knew 3 months ago. No. On aerospace, what we see is just some difficulties in production. And I mean, you can listen to the calls made by Airbus and Boeing, and you'll hear about that. Even Lockheed Martin and the F-35, there have some slight changes in the production lines, slight adjustment which are linked to technical difficulties. I think Airbus has not yet or Pratt & Whitney has not yet solved the issues linked to the engines, are supposed to be [indiscernible] Airbus. It has an impact on the A320neo line. We see there are still production issues here in the supply chain. We see people working very hard to solve them. By the way, in some cases, we have also some -- we have had also some quality issues which had delayed some shipment. But frankly speaking, the fundamentals, medium and long-term, are exactly the same as in Q2. The only new event, and directionally, it's a positive one, is clearly the C Series of Bombardier. It's a plane which seems to have a significant potential. Probably, Bombardier alone was not in the best possible position to make it a great commercial success. By the way, the duty imposed by the U.S. government would probably have significantly weighed on the project. The fact that Airbus is coming and will be now a partner in the development is changing completely the picture. And for us, it's certainly for the better, and we expect to see some opportunities coming. Don't ask me for that in Q4. I mean, it takes a bit of time to develop these opportunities in this market, but we are very confident, once again, in composite for aerospace, mid and long-term."

And I'm pretty pleased with the cash flow performance, both the number we expect to generate for the full year but also our ability to generate it much more regularly. On your comments regarding Q3, be careful. I mean, we are more and more working on long-term multi-year programs. We're making a cut on one quarter and trying to develop a view on what would be the leverage between sales and EBITDA, something which is probably becoming a bit difficult and, in some cases, irrelevant. There's a number of specific element that Karim has mentioned during Q3, going from provision for variable compensation to ramp-up cost in various plants, which explain what you've seen in terms of transformation of volume growth into EBITDA. I think it makes a bit more sense to look at the last 9 months or at the full year results when they will be available. And indeed, I have a feeling that we have the ability to transform our volume growth, which, by the way, was lacking last year, but we have the ability to transform our volume growth into profitability and cash, and this is very much our focus. I understand why you need to try to get the most out of the quarterly results, but sometimes, there's a limit to what you can extract. If I go back to the comments on Composite, 1 F-35 moved 1 quarter to the next has a meaningful impact. And a bit of a steeper or slower ramp-up in a smartphone program could have also an impact on the quarter, which will be compensated the next quarter also. Be a bit careful on the conclusion you draw."

On aerospace, I think we are -- where are we and I might repeat myself, but we see program like the F-35 or the LEAP engine, which are just at the beginning of the actual ramp-up. And yes, indeed, we have a very significant expectation regarding this ramp-up for the next year and the following one. And on these 2 programs, we don't see much difficulties today. And by the way, the expectation regarding being PEEK rate has increased significantly for both program, both the F-35 and the LEAP engine. They are seen today as very successful programs. On the A320, I think the challenge is still probably with the engines and the -- not the LEAP engine, but the Pratt & Whitney engine. I don't have much more clarity than you have. And on the large platform -- the reduction of the rate in the large platform, this has been announced today by Boeing, by Airbus and then -- mostly by Boeing and Airbus. So the impact will be in the next couple of quarters, let's say. So yes, overall, I think that this situation -- the situation where we are and the situation where we'll see, probably in the course of next year, the positive elements taking over the negatives one that I was mentioning. So yes, I expect to see a change. Now it will always be a business where, from one quarter to the next, you could see some variation, but just because the production chain don't run as Swiss clocks, and you have -- we have to get used to this. But clearly, the fundamental of the business are very solid. And even if I was looking longer-term, we are seeing a number of activities which will lead to a situation where the vast, vast majority of the commercial airline platforms will be made using composites. I remind you the announcement of Boeing on the, what they call, middle-of-the-market airplane, the works that Airbus is doing on the wings of tomorrow. I mean, we see a number of activities showing that, indeed, composites is the way to go. And this will create very significant long-term growth opportunity. Don't worry, we focus on long-term, but also, on short-term. And there, I think the situation will look better and better as these production difficulties will go behind us."

Internal and external, let's say, noncontrollable, to state the obvious. It is there is a significant shift in exchange rate or a significant shift in energy costs, our capacity to respond and mitigate or otherwise is obviously restricted in a short time scale. So that is one factor, probably no surprise there. There are all of the controllable aspects, let's say, our costs, et cetera. No, I think we are very, very confident that we're running a very tight regime, so we expect to land very much more in control of that. Now clearly, Harvey has had an impact. Nobody would have predicted that a couple of months ago. The other aspect perhaps is slightly difficult to respond to, and that is about visibility of our order book and our volumes. It's quite short. We don't necessarily see clearly everywhere, clearer on that till the end of the year. So I'll give you a small example. Oil price today is what? $57 WTI, $63 on the Brent. Despite that, I understand that the rig counts are falling right now, now we've see good progress on friction reducers and guar. Who's to say it can't reverse pretty quickly? That market momentum can change quite quickly. I think given that we're quite a diversified group, typically small bumps on one side can be overcome elsewhere, and we think that's strength or that portfolio gives us the confidence to say no, no, volumes, top line, costs, profit, cash will be delivered, and that's really what underpins it.

And again, it's a program where the PEEK production rate has increased significantly. However, for diesel, I don't see anything specific. I mean, we know that diesel regulations are becoming more and more stringent when creating the need for a much more sophisticated and costly catalyst. So that's good. We know, at the same time, that the share of diesel is going down very significantly. On top of that, some recall activities here and there, creating the need for new catalyst, so the picture is pretty complex. Gasoline engine, also some evolution of regulation, which calls for a more sophisticated formulation. So overall, I would say, a good opportunity in front of us in this catalyst business. On soda ash, yes, I mean export market are a limited part of our activities, but it's an element of a global supply and demand balance, a very important element in this export market, especially Southeast Asia.

The fact that a number of outdated capacities are being phased out, so that's structural, that's good news. It has to impact. We see increases in prices in the export market, that's good. And it helps rebalance the global market at a time when no capacity is available. So overall, this is going in the right direction. And by the way, if your question implied a doubt on whether our gasoline engine catalyst contain rare earth, the answer is yes. I mean, gasoline engine catalyst, since the beginning of this technology, contained and continue to contain washcoat made of rare earth, so it's -- I would -- probably a bit more in diesel today than in gasoline. But at the same time, as technology evolves, the need for more sophisticated washcoat appears in both types of technology."

The volume and the demand that you've been seeing in your business, but also the industry has been seeing this year is, I think, I'd say, has surprised most people, by the function of polymers while they existed. For example, you did 7.5% in the first half, which is well above what you've done in the last couple of years. Could you let us know how much, in your opinion, is a rebasing of demand upwards from the revival in activity in Europe, in China? Or how much perhaps is a little bit of restocking relating to the rise in the oil price? Just a feel for how you see it as a business. And obviously, related to that, what you think about volumes going into 2018, in general. You obviously have some projects, specific businesses, but I'm talking about more generally in the chemical industry."

Don't forget that, today, a significant part of Solvay business is linked to specific programs. You can think of smartphone. You can think of specific aerospace programs, even some specific automotive program, which are not linked to the pattern of global demand. Yes, if the economy goes better, it has an impact on aerospace, but not so much on actual production rate for a given year. So there is a bit of a disconnect between these 2 elements in our -- in the meaningful part of our portfolio. A second comment. We see people in the various supply chains where we operate, very cautious about building inventories. Even in markets like smartphones, after what happened a couple of years ago, we see people being very careful in making sure that they produce -- try to align production rate and demand and make sure that they are not building useless inventories. So it's -- I don't have the feeling that we are seeing people building inventories today. I think people are trying to make sure that when they are able to meet demand, which is good because when there are opportunities, we want to be there. Second, making sure that we could react quickly if the demand was going in another direction. So this being said, looking at both the forecast we have on specific programs, in some cases, pretty high-quality forecasts, in other cases, probably not so high-quality forecasts, and looking at the general prospect of the world economy for the businesses where we are more exposed to this type of metric, I'm pretty confident regarding volume growth in 2018. I think the year has been good in terms of volume growth for Solvay -- 2017, I mean. And I tend to see a situation which, from a volumes standpoint, will probably continue to look pretty good into '18.
So with that, I suggest that we close this call. Thank you very much. Once again, significant news during this quarter on the portfolio side was the divestiture of Polyamide. We are now working hard to close this transaction. This is the end of a long string of portfolio movement. I think today, we have a portfolio that we want. We might have opportunities to make add-on acquisition here and there, but this is clearly the end of a large [ fast ] transaction. We have been delivering, if you look at the first 9 months of the year in terms of the growth at the EBITDA line, free cash flow generation, I think we are coming with a solid number. We've confirmed our guidance for the full year. And focus is very much for us to make the best out of a portfolio we have, in terms of innovation, in terms of customer focus, but also in terms of simplification of our organization. With that, thank you very much. We meet once again -- Kimberly, what date for the full year results?"
