As announced earlier today, Garmin finished 2016 on a strong note. Revenue for the quarter increased 10% over the prior year to $861 million. Outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation collectively increased 25% yea",1195,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin finished 2016 on a strong note. Revenue for the quarter increased 10% over the prior year to $861 million. Outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation collectively increased 25% year-over-year and contributed 74% of total revenues. Gross margin improved year-over-year to 54.7%. Operating margin was essentially flat at 18.6% while operating income increased 10%. These strong results generated GAAP EPS of $0.72 and pro forma EPS of $0.73 in the quarter.
Looking briefly at our full year performance. 2016 was a remarkable year as we delivered 4 consecutive quarters of revenue and profit growth. Revenue increased 7% over 2015 and exceeded $3 billion for the first time since 2008. Outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation increased 21% on a combined basis, contributing over $2.1 billion in revenue for the year or 71% of the total and generated 84% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins improved to 55.6% and 20.7%, respectively, while operating income grew 14%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $2.70 and pro forma EPS of $2.83, both representing strong increases over the prior year. Unit deliveries increased 4% to 16.8 million, which was the second highest in our industry and brought our total units shipped to over 173 million since Garmin's inception. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to highlight the 2016 performance and 2017 outlook for each of our 5 segments.
Okay, starting with Outdoor. Revenue increased 33% on strong demand for outdoor wearables, contributions from DeLorme and growth in all other product categories. Segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 62% and 34%, respectively, while operating income grew 32% over the prior year.
Looking back at 2016. Our fenix line of adventure watches continued to show strong momentum while high-end Chronos variations areopening new retail channels at watch stores and specialty retailers.
Our Connect IQ application platform has become an important differentiator for our smart wearables. Connect IQ now features over 2,500 apps, widgets and watch faces and has generated more than 24 million downloads since inception. To further promote the power and utility of Connect IQ, we will host our first-ever developer conference in mid-April, offering workshops and tools that developers can use to leverage the Garmin wearable ecosystem.
Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2017. We anticipate that wearables will continue to be strong, led by the new fenix 5 series. fenix 5 comes in 3 different sizes and features our new QuickFit band replacement system, allowing users to quickly change the style of their watch. We are also expanding our handheld device portfolio with inReach satellite communication technology, and we will introduce inReach devices into new geographic markets.
Looking next at fitness. We reported robust revenue growth of 24%, driven by strong demand for wearables with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology. In addition, v√≠vofit jr. was well received by retailers and customers during the holiday shopping season. Gross and operating margins were 53% and 20%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by product mix while operating margin was relatively flat to the prior year, resulting in operating income growth of 19%.
Much has been said recently about the momentum change in certain wearable categories, specifically basic activity trackers. However, demand for products with more advanced features, particularly those with GPS capability, was very strong in the holiday quarter. One possible explanation is that customers want more than just a basic activity tracker. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend with the broadest portfolio of activity trackers, many of which include GPS capability.
In 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the fitness segment with strength in cycling and advanced wearables offsetting anticipated softness in basic activity trackers.
Looking next at the marine segment. Revenue grew 16% ahead of the overall market pointing towards market share gains, driven primarily by strong demand for fishfinders and chartplotters. Gross margin was steady at 55% while operating margin improved to 16%, resulting in operating income growth of 82% over the prior year. Marine season is off to a great start, and we are ready to serve with a strong portfolio of products for every boating pursuit. For 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% for the marine segment.
Turning next to aviation. We reported solid revenue growth of 10% driven by ADS-B and retrofit upgrades as well as growth in our OEM categories. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 75% and 28%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 12% for the year. In recent developments, Textron Airland announced that the Scorpion light attack aircraft will be equipped with Garmin avionics, expanding the addressable market for our commercial off-the-shelf equipment into military and government applications. We're excited about our expanding partnership with Textron, and we look forward to serving on the Scorpion aircraft.
I also want to mention that for the 13th consecutive year, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionic support by Professional Pilot magazine and by Aviation International News. I want to congratulate our team on earning this award once again, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers.
In 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the aviation segment. While industry dynamics remain a factor, market share gains, new platforms and the ADS-B mandate provide opportunities for growth.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 17% for the full year, as expected, due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. However, our global market share remains very strong. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 12%, respectively. While the downward trend of the consumer PND market is well understood, we do see incremental growth opportunities in certain product categories including trucking, RV, cameras and in our OEM business. We are focused on maximizing profits in the segment while leveraging these opportunities.
Earlier today, we announced that BMW selected Garmin as a Tier 1 supplier of infotainment computing modules for future BMW models produced in China. This is a pivotal win for us and validates the investments we have been making in the OEM category.
Looking at 2017. We expect revenue to decline approximately 17% driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market. We remain focused on disciplined execution in order to bring pragmatic innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.
In summary, we see many opportunities ahead in each market we serve, and we are well positioned with a strong product lineup. With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $3.02 billion, flat year-over-year as growth in fitness, outdoor, aviation and marine is offset by anticipated declines in the auto segment. We are projecting steady gross margin of approximately 56% and operating margin of approximately 20%. We expect a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 22% for the year, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $2.65.
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $861 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 10% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 54.7%, a 180 basis point increase from the prior year driven by the shift toward segments with higher margin. Operating expense as a percent of sales was 36.1%, a 200 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $160 million, 10% increase from the prior year. Operating margin was 18.6%. Our GAAP EPS was $0.72. Our pro forma EPS was $0.73.
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of over $3 billion for the year, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 55.6%, a 100 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35%, consistent with prior year. Operating income was $624 million, a 14% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 20.7%, an increase of 120 basis points from the prior year driven by the gross margin increase. Our GAAP EPS was $2.70, a 13% increase from the prior year. Pro forma EPS was $2.83, a 14% increase from the prior year.
Let's discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.
Next, we look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. In the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by the outdoor segment with 46%. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 25% compared to prior year quarter. For the full year 2016, we achieved 7% consolidated growth, led by robust growth in our outdoor and fitness segments and solid double-digit growth in marine and aviation segments.
Looking next at the fourth quarter revenue charts. During the quarter, fitness grew to be our largest segment as it grew to 32% of revenue in the current period compared to 29% in the prior year. Outdoor grew from 16% to 20%. The auto segment represented 26% of our total fourth quarter 2016 revenue compared to 35% of fourth quarter 2015. So you can see the charts illustrate profit mix by segment. Outdoor, fitness, marine, aviation collectively delivered 80% of operating income fourth quarter 2016 compared to 74% fourth quarter 2015.
Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 27% to 36%. Total corporate operating margin was relatively flat year-over-year as gross margin improvement was offset by increased operating expenses.
Looking next to full year charts. For the full year, the non-auto segments made up 71% of total revenue compared to 62% in 2015. Similar shift occurred in operating income with 84% of our 2016 operating income collectively coming from the outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation segments compared to 75% in 2015.
Looking next at operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expense increased by $44 million or 16%. Research and development increased $23 million year-over-year, 140 basis points to 15% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine where we see long-term growth opportunities. Fourth quarter 2016 was also impacted by the additional week expense and the addition of DeLorme business. Our advertising expense increased $11 million from the prior quarter, representing 7.9% of sales, a 60 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on the outdoor, fitness segments to support growth in wearables.
SG&A was up $9 million compared to prior quarter but decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.3%. Increased spending in SG&A was driven primarily by the additional week expense in to addition to DeLorme business, partially offset by year-over-year decrease in litigation-related costs. 
A few highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially due to holiday quarter and decreased year-over-year to $527 million. Inventory balance decreased year-over-year to $485 million as we exit the seasonally strong fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $165 million, a $34 million increase the prior year quarter. Also, during the quarter, result [indiscernible] we paid 2 quarterly dividends of approximately $96 million for a total of $192 million. We purchased $28 million of company stock. We extended the expiration date for share repurchase program to December 2017. We have approximately $75 million remaining for purchase. We expect to repurchase as business to market conditions warrant. Assuming our dividend payments were normalized before dividends totaling $385 million, we returned $478 million of cash to our shareholders through dividend payments through the share repurchase in 2016. The effective tax rate was 19% in the current quarter compared to 13.2% in the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to full year impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit we recorded in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to being spread in all 4 quarters 2016. Our full year 2016 effective tax rate was 18.9%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year, primarily due to income mix by tax jurisdiction. We expect our full year 2017 pro forma tax rate to be approximately 22%. Switzerland is in the process of aligning corporate tax rules involving international initiatives. We elected at this time to align certain Switzerland tax position with these initiatives, resulting in year-over-year increase pro forma tax rate. The utilization of deferred tax asset will reduce our cash tax liability, so we do not expect to pay any additional cash taxes in Switzerland 2017. We announced that we plan to take shareholder approval for a dividend of $2.04 per share payable in 4 installments $0.51 per share per quarter in June 2017 calendar quarter. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Donovan, can you please open the line for Q&A.

So as a result of all that, we elect at this time to align our certain Switzerland tax positions with international tax initiatives. I also mentioned that we expect to pay additional cash taxes in Switzerland in 2017 since we have deferred tax to reduce our cash tax liability. As it relates to beyond, we anticipate this 22% -- or we anticipate this 300-or-so basis points increase to been there in the future.

As announced earlier today, Garmin finished 2016 on a strong note. Revenue for the quarter increased 10% over the prior year to $861 million. Outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation collectively increased 25% yea",1196,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin finished 2016 on a strong note. Revenue for the quarter increased 10% over the prior year to $861 million. Outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation collectively increased 25% year-over-year and contributed 74% of total revenues. Gross margin improved year-over-year to 54.7%. Operating margin was essentially flat at 18.6% while operating income increased 10%. These strong results generated GAAP EPS of $0.72 and pro forma EPS of $0.73 in the quarter.
Looking briefly at our full year performance. 2016 was a remarkable year as we delivered 4 consecutive quarters of revenue and profit growth. Revenue increased 7% over 2015 and exceeded $3 billion for the first time since 2008. Outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation increased 21% on a combined basis, contributing over $2.1 billion in revenue for the year or 71% of the total and generated 84% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins improved to 55.6% and 20.7%, respectively, while operating income grew 14%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $2.70 and pro forma EPS of $2.83, both representing strong increases over the prior year. Unit deliveries increased 4% to 16.8 million, which was the second highest in our industry and brought our total units shipped to over 173 million since Garmin's inception. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to highlight the 2016 performance and 2017 outlook for each of our 5 segments.
Okay, starting with Outdoor. Revenue increased 33% on strong demand for outdoor wearables, contributions from DeLorme and growth in all other product categories. Segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 62% and 34%, respectively, while operating income grew 32% over the prior year.
Looking back at 2016. Our fenix line of adventure watches continued to show strong momentum while high-end Chronos variations are opening new retail channels at watch stores and specialty retailers.
Our Connect IQ application platform has become an important differentiator for our smart wearables. Connect IQ now features over 2,500 apps, widgets and watch faces and has generated more than 24 million downloads since inception. To further promote the power and utility of Connect IQ, we will host our first-ever developer conference in mid-April, offering workshops and tools that developers can use to leverage the Garmin wearable ecosystem.
Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2017. We anticipate that wearables will continue to be strong, led by the new fenix 5 series. fenix 5 comes in 3 different sizes and features our new QuickFit band replacement system, allowing users to quickly change the style of their watch. We are also expanding our handheld device portfolio with inReach satellite communication technology, and we will introduce inReach devices into new geographic markets.
Looking next at fitness. We reported robust revenue growth of 24%, driven by strong demand for wearables with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology. In addition, v√≠vofit jr. was well received by retailers and customers during the holiday shopping season. Gross and operating margins were 53% and 20%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by product mix while operating margin was relatively flat to the prior year, resulting in operating income growth of 19%.
Much has been said recently about the momentum change in certain wearable categories, specifically basic activity trackers. However, demand for products with more advanced features, particularly those with GPS capability, was very strong in the holiday quarter. One possible explanation is that customers want more than just a basic activity tracker. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend with the broadest portfolio of activity trackers, many of which include GPS capability.
In 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the fitness segment with strength in cycling and advanced wearables offsetting anticipated softness in basic activity trackers.
Looking next at the marine segment. Revenue grew 16% ahead of the overall market pointing towards market share gains, driven primarily by strong demand for fishfinders and chartplotters. Gross margin was steady at 55% while operating margin improved to 16%, resulting in operating income growth of 82% over the prior year. Marine season is off to a great start, and we are ready to serve with a strong portfolio of products for every boating pursuit. For 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% for the marine segment.
Turning next to aviation. We reported solid revenue growth of 10% driven by ADS-B and retrofit upgrades as well as growth in our OEM categories. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 75% and 28%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 12% for the year. In recent developments, Textron Airland announced that the Scorpion light attack aircraft will be equipped with Garmin avionics, expanding the addressable market for our commercial off-the-shelf equipment into military and government applications. We're excited about our expanding partnership with Textron, and we look forward to serving on the Scorpion aircraft.
I also want to mention that for the 13th consecutive year, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionic support by Professional Pilot magazine and by Aviation International News. I want to congratulate our team on earning this award once again, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers.
In 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the aviation segment. While industry dynamics remain a factor, market share gains, new platforms and the ADS-B mandate provide opportunities for growth.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 17% for the full year, as expected, due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. However, our global market share remains very strong. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 12%, respectively. While the downward trend of the consumer PND market is well understood, we do see incremental growth opportunities in certain product categories including trucking, RV, cameras and in our OEM business. We are focused on maximizing profits in the segment while leveraging these opportunities.
Earlier today, we announced that BMW selected Garmin as a Tier 1 supplier of infotainment computing modules for future BMW models produced in China. This is a pivotal win for us and validates the investments we have been making in the OEM category.
Looking at 2017. We expect revenue to decline approximately 17% driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market. We remain focused on disciplined execution in order to bring pragmatic innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.
In summary, we see many opportunities ahead in each market we serve, and we are well positioned with a strong product lineup. With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $3.02 billion, flat year-over-year as growth in fitness, outdoor, aviation and marine is offset by anticipated declines in the auto segment. We are projecting steady gross margin of approximately 56% and operating margin of approximately 20%. We expect a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 22% for the year, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $2.65.
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $861 million for the fourth quarter, represent",985,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $861 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 10% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 54.7%, a 180 basis point increase from the prior year driven by the shift toward segments with higher margin. Operating expense as a percent of sales was 36.1%, a 200 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $160 million, 10% increase from the prior year. Operating margin was 18.6%. Our GAAP EPS was $0.72. Our pro forma EPS was $0.73.
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of over $3 billion for the year, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 55.6%, a 100 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35%, consistent with prior year. Operating income was $624 million, a 14% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 20.7%, an increase of 120 basis points from the prior year driven by the gross margin increase. Our GAAP EPS was $2.70, a 13% increase from the prior year. Pro forma EPS was $2.83, a 14% increase from the prior year.
Let's discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.
Next, we look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. In the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by the outdoor segment with 46%. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 25% compared to prior year quarter. For the full year 2016, we achieved 7% consolidated growth, led by robust growth in our outdoor and fitness segments and solid double-digit growth in marine and aviation segments.
Looking next at the fourth quarter revenue charts. During the quarter, fitness grew to be our largest segment as it grew to 32% of revenue in the current period compared to 29% in the prior year. Outdoor grew from 16% to 20%. The auto segment represented 26% of our total fourth quarter 2016 revenue compared to 35% of fourth quarter 2015. So you can see the charts illustrate profit mix by segment. Outdoor, fitness, marine, aviation collectively delivered 80% of operating income fourth quarter 2016 compared to 74% fourth quarter 2015.
Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 27% to 36%. Total corporate operating margin was relatively flat year-over-year as gross margin improvement was offset by increased operating expenses.
Looking next to full year charts. For the full year, the non-auto segments made up 71% of total revenue compared to 62% in 2015. Similar shift occurred in operating income with 84% of our 2016 operating income collectively coming from the outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation segments compared to 75% in 2015.
Looking next at operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expense increased by $44 million or 16%. Research and development increased $23 million year-over-year, 140 basis points to 15% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine where we see long-term growth opportunities. Fourth quarter 2016 was also impacted by the additional week expense and the addition of DeLorme business. Our advertising expense increased $11 million from the prior quarter, representing 7.9% of sales, a 60 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on the outdoor, fitness segments to support growth in wearables.
SG&A was up $9 million compared to prior quarter but decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.3%. Increased spending in SG&A was driven primarily by the additional week expense and the addition of DeLorme business, partially offset by year-over-year decrease in litigation-related costs.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially due to holiday quarter and decreased year-over-year to $527 million. Inventory balance decreased year-over-year to $485 million as we exit the seasonally strong fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $165 million, a $34 million increase from the prior year quarter.
Also during the quarter, as a result of the additional week, we paid 2 quarterly dividends of approximately $96 million for a total of $192 million. We purchased $28 million of company stock. We extend the expiration date of our share repurchase program to December 2017, have approximately $75 million remaining for purchase. We expect to repurchase as business and market conditions warrant. Assuming our dividend payments were normalized before dividends totaling $385 million, we returned $478 million of cash to our shareholders through dividend payments, through share repurchases in 2016.
The effective tax rate was 19% in the current quarter compared to 13.2% in the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to full year impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit we recorded in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to being spread over all 4 quarters in 2016. Our full year 2016 effective tax rate was 18.9%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year, primarily due to income mix by tax jurisdiction. We expect our full year 2017 pro forma tax rate to be approximately 22%.
Switzerland is in the process of aligning the corporate tax rules involving international tax  initiatives. We've elected at this time to align certain Switzerland tax position with these initiatives, resulting in year-over-year increase pro forma tax rate. The utilization of deferred tax asset will reduce our cash tax liability, so we do not expect to pay any additional cash taxes in Switzerland in 2017. We announced that we plan to seek shareholder approval for a dividend of $2.04 per share payable in 4 installments of $0.51 per share per quarter beginning in June 2017 calendar quarter.
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, please open the line for Q&A."

We see ongoing opportunities for fenix, as we mentioned in our remarks, as well as expansion of the DeLorme opportunity. Marine is off to a great start, and we do think that our product line is strong. We should be able to have strong year in marine. And then finally, aviation is an industry that has had ongoing challenges with the economic situation. That's not really changing in our view, but we do see these opportunities that we've been pursuing adding to the incremental growth. And then finally in auto, there's not much more to say there, except that the PND market decline continues, as you're well aware. And we are excited because we are to a point now in the business where the growth in the other segments are offsetting the declines in PND."

I think we talked about the secular trends, particularly in fitness, and we do anticipate that basic activity trackers are going to see a maturing cycle starting now and going forward into the future. But that said, on the outdoor side, we do see positive response to our fenix 5 announcement, and we anticipate starting deliveries of those soon. And we also do see increasing interest from retailers in the outdoor wearables. So for example, we're gaining additional shelf space in some of the key retailers, particularly in the U.S. and expanding our shelf space in the U.S. market. It is attracting a different kind of customer. There's certainly strong running bias in people that buy fenix product, but we're also seeing people that are just generally aspirational and love any kind of outdoor activity move up to the watch."

On the BMW announcement, is there any upfront cost either expense or capitalized heading into that 2019 launch? And should we think of this as kind of a scalable solution that BMW could use for a range of cars or kind of specifically for high end? And then secondly, on the wearable fitness. I wanted to get a sense of, I guess, the mix of the wearables business or, if you just want to talk about it in terms of fitness terms, of products that do not have GPS at this point. How small a portion is that of the mix?

So starting first on BMW, there's -- for this program, there's not any significant upfront investments for this particular program. We had already made investments in our factories in order to be able to accommodate this kind of win, and those are already costs that we've incurred for the solution. It's the media graphics unit, which actually is a common architecture piece across the entire BMW line, not only in China but around the world. So consequently, this is a production of that architecture for the China market that it's scalable elsewhere. In terms of fitness, in terms of the mix there, as I mentioned, we are seeing stronger interest in more advanced product on the wearable side. That includes what we would call our wellness line like v√≠vo as well as obviously Forerunners, which are all GPS products. We don't split those out by category, but I would say that GPS was the stronger performer and basic activity trackers were weaker."

Revenue for the quarter increased 10% over the prior year to $861 million. Outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation collectively increased 25% year-over-year and contributed 74% of total revenues. Gross margin improved year-over-year to 54.7%. Operating margin was essentially flat at 18.6% while operating income increased 10%. These strong results generated GAAP EPS of $0.72 and pro forma EPS of $0.73 in the quarter.
Looking briefly at our full year performance. 2016 was a remarkable year as we delivered 4 consecutive quarters of revenue and profit growth. Revenue increased 7% over 2015 and exceeded $3 billion for the first time since 2008. Outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation increased 21% on a combined basis, contributing over $2.1 billion in revenue for the year or 71% of the total and generated 84% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins improved to 55.6% and 20.7%, respectively, while operating income grew 14%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $2.70 and pro forma EPS of $2.83, both representing strong increases over the prior year. Unit deliveries increased 4% to 16.8 million, which was the second highest in our industry and brought our total units shipped to over 173 million since Garmin's inception. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to highlight the 2016 performance and 2017 outlook for each of our 5 segments.
Okay, starting with Outdoor. Revenue increased 33% on strong demand for outdoor wearables, contributions from DeLorme and growth in all other product categories. Segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 62% and 34%, respectively, while operating income grew 32% over the prior year.
Looking back at 2016. Our fenix line of adventure watches continued to show strong momentum while high-end Chronos variations are opening new retail channels at watch stores and specialty retailers.
Our Connect IQ application platform has become an important differentiator for our smart wearables. Connect IQ now features over 2,500 apps, widgets and watch faces and has generated more than 24 million downloads since inception. To further promote the power and utility of Connect IQ, we will host our first-ever developer conference in mid-April, offering workshops and tools that developers can use to leverage the Garmin wearable ecosystem.
Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2017. We anticipate that wearables will continue to be strong, led by the new fenix 5 series. fenix 5 comes in 3 different sizes and features our new QuickFit band replacement system, allowing users to quickly change the style of their watch. We are also expanding our handheld device portfolio with inReach satellite communication technology, and we will introduce inReach devices into new geographic markets.
Looking next at fitness. We reported robust revenue growth of 24%, driven by strong demand for wearables with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology. In addition, v√≠vofit jr. was well received by retailers and customers during the holiday shopping season. Gross and operating margins were 53% and 20%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by product mix while operating margin was relatively flat to the prior year, resulting in operating income growth of 19%.
Much has been said recently about the momentum change in certain wearable categories, specifically basic activity trackers. However, demand for products with more advanced features, particularly those with GPS capability, was very strong in the holiday quarter. One possible explanation is that customers want more than just a basic activity tracker. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend with the broadest portfolio of activity trackers, many of which include GPS capability.
In 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the fitness segment with strength in cycling and advanced wearables offsetting anticipated softness in basic activity trackers.
Looking next at the marine segment. Revenue grew 16% ahead of the overall market pointing towards market share gains, driven primarily by strong demand for fishfinders and chartplotters. Gross margin was steady at 55% while operating margin improved to 16%, resulting in operating income growth of 82% over the prior year. Marine season is off to a great start, and we are ready to serve with a strong portfolio of products for every boating pursuit. For 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% for the marine segment.
Turning next to aviation. We reported solid revenue growth of 10% driven by ADS-B and retrofit upgrades as well as growth in our OEM categories. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 75% and 28%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 12% for the year. In recent developments, Textron Airland announced that the Scorpion light attack aircraft will be equipped with Garmin avionics, expanding the addressable market for our commercial off-the-shelf equipment into military and government applications. We're excited about our expanding partnership with Textron and we look forward to serving on the Scorpion aircraft.
I also want to mention that for the 13th consecutive year, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionic support by Professional Pilot magazine and by Aviation International News. I want to congratulate our team on earning this award once again, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers.
In 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the aviation segment. While industry dynamics remain a factor, market share gains, new platforms and the ADS-B mandate provide opportunities for growth.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 17% for the full year, as expected, due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. However, our global market share remains very strong. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 12%, respectively. While the downward trend of the consumer PND market is well understood, we do see incremental growth opportunities in certain product categories including trucking, RV, cameras and in our OEM business. We are focused on maximizing profits in the segment while leveraging these opportunities.
Earlier today, we announced that BMW selected Garmin as a Tier 1 supplier of infotainment computing modules for future BMW models produced in China. This is a pivotal win for us and validates the investments we have been making in the OEM category.
Looking at 2017. We expect revenue to decline approximately 17% driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market. We remain focused on disciplined execution in order to bring pragmatic innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.
In summary, we see many opportunities ahead in each market we serve, and we are well positioned with a strong product lineup. With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $3.02 billion, flat year-over-year as growth in fitness, outdoor, aviation and marine is offset by anticipated declines in the auto segment. We are projecting steady gross margin of approximately 56% and operating margin of approximately 20%. We expect a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 22% for the year, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $2.65.
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $861 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 10% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 54.7%, an 180 basis point increase from the prior year driven by the shift toward segments with higher margin. Operating expense as a percent of sales was 36.1%, a 200 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $160 million, 10% increase from the prior year. Operating margin was 18.6%. Our GAAP EPS was $0.72. Our pro forma EPS was $0.73.
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of over $3 billion for the year, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 55.6%, a 100 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35%, consistent with prior year. Operating income was $624 million, a 14% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 20.7%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year driven by the gross margin increase. Our GAAP EPS was $2.70, a 13% increase from the prior year. Pro forma EPS was $2.83, a 14% increase from the prior year.
Let's discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.
Next, we look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. In the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by the outdoor segment with 46%. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 25% compared to prior year quarter. For the full year 2016, we achieved 7% consolidated growth, led by robust growth in our outdoor and fitness segments and solid double-digit growth in marine and aviation segments.
Looking next at the fourth quarter revenue charts. During the quarter, fitness grew to be our largest segment as it grew to 32% of revenue in the current period compared to 29% in the prior year. Outdoor grew from 16% to 20%. The auto segment represented 26% of our total fourth quarter 2016 revenue compared to 35% of fourth quarter 2015. So you can see the charts illustrate profit mix by segment. Outdoor, fitness, marine, aviation collectively delivered 80% of operating income fourth quarter 2016 compared to 74% fourth quarter 2015.
Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 27% to 36%. Total corporate operating margin was relatively flat year-over-year as gross margin improvement was offset by increased operating expenses.
Looking next to full year charts. For the full year, the non-auto segments made up 71% of total revenue compared to 62% in 2015. Similar shift occurred in operating income with 84% of our 2016 operating income collectively coming from the outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation segments compared to 75% in 2015.
Looking next at operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expense increased by $44 million or 16%. Research and development increased $23 million year-over-year, 140 basis points to 15% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine where we see long-term growth opportunities. Fourth quarter 2016 was also impacted by the additional week of expense and the addition of the DeLorme business. Our advertising expense increased $11 million from the prior quarter, representing 7.9% of sales, a 60 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on the outdoor, fitness segments to support growth in wearables.
SG&A was up $9 million compared to prior quarter but decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.3%. Increased spending in SG&A was driven primarily by the additional week of expense and the addition of the DeLorme business, partially offset by year-over-year decrease in litigation-related costs.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially due to holiday quarter and decreased year-over-year to $527 million. Inventory balance decreased year-over-year to $485 million as we exit the seasonally strong fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $165 million, a $34 million increase from the prior year quarter.
Also during the quarter, as a result of the additional week, we paid 2 quarterly dividends of approximately $96 million for a total of $192 million. We purchased $28 million of company stock. We extend the expiration date of our share repurchase program to December 2017, have approximately $75 million remaining for purchase. We expect to repurchase as business and market conditions warrant. Assuming our dividend payments were normalized, the 4 [ph] dividends totaling $385 million returned $478 million of cash to our shareholders through dividend payments, through share repurchases in 2016.
The effective tax rate was 19% in the current quarter compared to 13.2% in the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to full year impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit we recorded in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to being spread over all 4 quarters in 2016. Our full year 2016 effective tax rate was 18.9%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year, primarily due to income mix by tax jurisdiction. We expect our full year 2017 pro forma tax rate to be approximately 22%.
Switzerland is in the process of aligning the corporate tax rules involving international tax  initiatives. We've elected at this time to align certain Switzerland tax position with these initiatives, resulting in year-over-year increase pro forma tax rate. The utilization of deferred tax asset will reduce our cash tax liability, so we do not expect to pay any additional cash taxes in Switzerland in 2017.

In terms of Apple and the specific impact on our market by the Series 2, I would say that certainly, their initial results would appear like they're doing very well with Series 2, but we don't see the impact on our customers and our segment from that device. I think that it's a very competent device and it does a lot of things. But as we've said before in the past, we believe that it's attracting a slightly different customer base than what we speak to."

Revenue for the quarter increased 10% over the prior year to $861 million. Outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation collectively increased 25% year-over-year and contributed 74% of total revenues. Gross margin improved year-over-year to 54.7%. Operating margin was essentially flat at 18.6% while operating income increased 10%. These strong results generated GAAP EPS of $0.72 and pro forma EPS of $0.73 in the quarter.
Looking briefly at our full year performance. 2016 was a remarkable year as we delivered 4 consecutive quarters of revenue and profit growth. Revenue increased 7% over 2015 and exceeded $3 billion for the first time since 2008. Outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation increased 21% on a combined basis, contributing over $2.1 billion in revenue for the year or 71% of the total and generated 84% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins improved to 55.6% and 20.7%, respectively, while operating income grew 14%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $2.70 and pro forma EPS of $2.83, both representing strong increases over the prior year. Unit deliveries increased 4% to 16.8 million, which was the second highest in our industry and brought our total units shipped to over 173 million since Garmin's inception. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to highlight the 2016 performance and 2017 outlook for each of our 5 segments.
Okay, starting with Outdoor. Revenue increased 33% on strong demand for outdoor wearables, contributions from DeLorme and growth in all other product categories. Segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 62% and 34%, respectively, while operating income grew 32% over the prior year.
Looking back at 2016. Our fenix line of adventure watches continued to show strong momentum while high-end Chronos variations are opening new retail channels at watch stores and specialty retailers.
Our Connect IQ application platform has become an important differentiator for our smart wearables. Connect IQ now features over 2,500 apps, widgets and watch faces and has generated more than 24 million downloads since inception. To further promote the power and utility of Connect IQ, we will host our first-ever developer conference in mid-April, offering workshops and tools that developers can use to leverage the Garmin wearable ecosystem.
Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2017. We anticipate that wearables will continue to be strong, led by the new fenix 5 series. fenix 5 comes in 3 different sizes and features our new QuickFit band replacement system, allowing users to quickly change the style of their watch. We are also expanding our handheld device portfolio with inReach satellite communication technology, and we will introduce inReach devices into new geographic markets.
Looking next at fitness. We reported robust revenue growth of 24%, driven by strong demand for wearables with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology. In addition, v√≠vofit jr. was well received by retailers and customers during the holiday shopping season. Gross and operating margins were 53% and 20%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by product mix while operating margin was relatively flat to the prior year, resulting in operating income growth of 19%.
Much has been said recently about the momentum change in certain wearable categories, specifically basic activity trackers. However, demand for products with more advanced features, particularly those with GPS capability, was very strong in the holiday quarter. One possible explanation is that customers want more than just a basic activity tracker. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend with the broadest portfolio of activity trackers, many of which include GPS capability.
In 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the fitness segment with strength in cycling and advanced wearables offsetting anticipated softness in basic activity trackers.
Looking next at the marine segment. Revenue grew 16% ahead of the overall market pointing towards market share gains, driven primarily by strong demand for fishfinders and chartplotters. Gross margin was steady at 55% while operating margin improved to 16%, resulting in operating income growth of 82% over the prior year. Marine season is off to a great start, and we are ready to serve with a strong portfolio of products for every boating pursuit. For 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% for the marine segment.
Turning next to aviation. We reported solid revenue growth of 10% driven by ADS-B and retrofit upgrades as well as growth in our OEM categories. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 75% and 28%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 12% for the year. In recent developments, Textron Airland announced that the Scorpion light attack aircraft will be equipped with Garmin avionics, expanding the addressable market for our commercial off-the-shelf equipment into military and government applications. We're excited about our expanding partnership with Textron and we look forward to serving on the Scorpion aircraft.
I also want to mention that for the 13th consecutive year, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionic support by Professional Pilot magazine and by Aviation International News. I want to congratulate our team on earning this award once again, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers.
In 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the aviation segment. While industry dynamics remain a factor, market share gains, new platforms and the ADS-B mandate provide opportunities for growth.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 17% for the full year, as expected, due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. However, our global market share remains very strong. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 12%, respectively. While the downward trend of the consumer PND market is well understood, we do see incremental growth opportunities in certain product categories including trucking, RV, cameras and in our OEM business. We are focused on maximizing profits in the segment while leveraging these opportunities.
Earlier today, we announced that BMW selected Garmin as a Tier 1 supplier of infotainment computing modules for future BMW models produced in China. This is a pivotal win for us and validates the investments we have been making in the OEM category.
Looking at 2017. We expect revenue to decline approximately 17% driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market. We remain focused on disciplined execution in order to bring pragmatic innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.
In summary, we see many opportunities ahead in each market we serve, and we are well positioned with a strong product lineup. With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $3.02 billion, flat year-over-year as growth in fitness, outdoor, aviation and marine is offset by anticipated declines in the auto segment. We are projecting steady gross margin of approximately 56% and operating margin of approximately 20%. We expect a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 22% for the year, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $2.65.
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $861 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 10% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 54.7%, an 180 basis point increase from the prior year driven by the shift toward segments with higher margin. Operating expense as a percent of sales was 36.1%, a 200 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $160 million, 10% increase from the prior year. Operating margin was 18.6%. Our GAAP EPS was $0.72. Our pro forma EPS was $0.73.
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of over $3 billion for the year, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 55.6%, a 100 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35%, consistent with prior year. Operating income was $624 million, a 14% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 20.7%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year driven by the gross margin increase. Our GAAP EPS was $2.70, a 13% increase from the prior year. Pro forma EPS was $2.83, a 14% increase from the prior year.
Let's discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.
Next, we look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. In the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by the outdoor segment with 46%. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 25% compared to prior year quarter. For the full year 2016, we achieved 7% consolidated growth, led by robust growth in our outdoor and fitness segments and solid double-digit growth in marine and aviation segments.
Looking next at the fourth quarter revenue charts. During the quarter, fitness grew to be our largest segment as it grew to 32% of revenue in the current period compared to 29% in the prior year. Outdoor grew from 16% to 20%. The auto segment represented 26% of our total fourth quarter 2016 revenue compared to 35% of fourth quarter 2015. So you can see the charts illustrate profit mix by segment. Outdoor, fitness, marine, aviation collectively delivered 80% of operating income fourth quarter 2016 compared to 74% fourth quarter 2015.
Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 27% to 36%. Total corporate operating margin was relatively flat year-over-year as gross margin improvement was offset by increased operating expenses.
Looking next to full year charts. For the full year, the non-auto segments made up 71% of total revenue compared to 62% in 2015. Similar shift occurred in operating income with 84% of our 2016 operating income collectively coming from the outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation segments compared to 75% in 2015.
Looking next at operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expense increased by $44 million or 16%. Research and development increased $23 million year-over-year, 140 basis points to 15% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine where we see long-term growth opportunities. Fourth quarter 2016 was also impacted by the additional week of expense and the addition of the DeLorme business. Our advertising expense increased $11 million from the prior quarter, representing 7.9% of sales, a 60 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on the outdoor, fitness segments to support growth in wearables.
SG&A was up $9 million compared to prior quarter but decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.3%. Increased spending in SG&A was driven primarily by the additional week of expense and the addition of the DeLorme business, partially offset by year-over-year decrease in litigation-related costs.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially due to holiday quarter and decreased year-over-year to $527 million. Inventory balance decreased year-over-year to $485 million as we exit the seasonally strong fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $165 million, a $34 million increase from the prior year quarter.
Also during the quarter, as a result of the additional week, we paid 2 quarterly dividends of approximately $96 million for a total of $192 million. We purchased $28 million of company stock. We extend the expiration date of our share repurchase program to December 2017, have approximately $75 million remaining for purchase. We expect to repurchase as business and market conditions warrant. Assuming our dividend payments were normalized, the 4 [ph] dividends totaling $385 million returned $478 million of cash to our shareholders through dividend payments, through share repurchases in 2016.
The effective tax rate was 19% in the current quarter compared to 13.2% in the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to full year impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit we recorded in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to being spread over all 4 quarters in 2016. Our full year 2016 effective tax rate was 18.9%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year, primarily due to income mix by tax jurisdiction. We expect our full year 2017 pro forma tax rate to be approximately 22%.
Switzerland is in the process of aligning the corporate tax rules involving international tax initiatives. We've elected at this time to align certain Switzerland tax position with these initiatives, resulting in year-over-year increase pro forma tax rate. The utilization of deferred tax asset will reduce our cash tax liability, so we do not expect to pay any additional cash taxes in Switzerland in 2017. We announced that we plan to seek shareholder approval for a dividend of $2.04 per share payable in 4 installments of $0.51 per share per quarter beginning in June 2017 calendar quarter.
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, please open the line for Q&A."

As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded first quarter consolidated revenue of $639 million, up 2% over the prior year. Marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness collectively increased 12% year-over-year and contributed 75% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.3%, as both segment and product mix were favorable. As a result of our increased revenues and gross margins, our operating margin improved to 18.2%, while operating income increased 12%.
This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.26, which includes a significant income tax benefit recognized during the quarter. Pro forma EPS, which excludes this benefit, grew 7% to $0.52 in the quarter. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which delivered growth in revenue, profits and earnings. However, since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. 
Starting with marine. Revenue grew 26%, ahead of the overall market, resulting in market share gains. All major product categories performed well. Gross margin improved to 57% while operating margin improved to 17%, resulting in operating income growth of 76% over the prior year. Marine season is in full swing and we have seen strong demand for our latest product offerings. We started shipping our new GPSMap chartplotters early in the season and the feedback from customers has been very positive. Looking forward, we remain focused on gaining market share through innovations that will clearly differentiate us in the market. 
Looking next at outdoor. Revenue increased 20% on strong demand for outdoor wearables. The segment continued to generate strong gross margin and operating margin of 63% and 30%, respectively, while operating income grew 24% over the prior year. We began shipping the highly anticipated fenix 5 adventure watch series late in the quarter. Orders have been very strong, and we expect that it will take several weeks to catch up with demand. We also recently hosted our first Connect IQ Developers Summit, bringing together application developers and business partners to participate in hands-on workshops and breakout sessions with our product managers and engineers. At the event, we announced new capabilities for Connect IQ, including the ability for app developers to implement a revenue model. We also announced new integration partners, including Smart Things, which gives us a strong presence in the emerging home automation market. 
Turning next to aviation, we reported solid revenue growth of 16%, driven by growth in aftermarket products and led by strong growth related to our ADS-B offerings. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 74% and 31%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 27% over the prior year. During the quarter, we started shipments of the G1000 NXI, the next generation integrated flight deck featuring wireless connectivity and enhanced safety features. We received European certification for the GTX 345, expanding the addressable market for this popular ADS-B transponder. In addition, we continue to support our OEM partners in the development and certification of new aircraft and helicopter platforms. Much has been said about the challenging market conditions, which remain a factor. However, we continue to believe that market share gains and new platforms provide opportunities for long-term growth.
Looking next at fitness. Revenue declined 3%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers, especially those which lack GPS capability. Despite this challenge, we are very pleased with the performance of advanced wearables with GPS capability, which experienced robust growth during the quarter and nearly offset the steep decline of basic activity trackers. Gross margin increased to 56% as product mix shifted to the higher-margin devices. Operating margin increased to 13%, resulting in operating income growth of 11%. During the quarter, we launched the 40935, which is our most advanced multisport watch, with new running dynamics features and enhanced performance and recovery monitoring. We also introduced our latest v√≠vosmart 3, an ultraslim smart activity tracker with wrist-based heart rate and an elevated stress tracking feature. While we continue to see the market for basic activity trackers mature, we also see growth opportunities in advanced wearables with GPS, and we are confident in our product roadmap going forward. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 19% in the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market and partially offset by growth in our auto OEM product lines. Gross margin was 44%, which is consistent year-over-year, while operating margin declined to 4%. During the quarter, we began shipping our next-generation Drive family of PND devices, which has wireless connectivity and enhanced driver alerts. We also introduced the Dash Cam 45 and 55, offering high-quality recording in an ultracompact form factor. We remain focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment. 
Okay finally, before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to mention the recognition we recently received from Forbes Magazine, ranking us among the top 100 Most Reputable Companies in America. Our employees work very hard to make Garmin the best at everything we do and to operate the business with integrity. It's a special honor for all of us to be recognized in this way. So that concludes my remarks and next, Doug will walk you through additional details of our financial results."
598655,426438280,1187276,"Garmin Ltd., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by going through our first quarter financial results, and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $639 million for the first quarter, representing a 2%",636,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by going through our first quarter financial results, and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $639 million for the first quarter, representing a 2% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.3%, a 380 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by the shift toward segments with higher margin as well as product mix within certain segments. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 40.1%, a 230 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $116 million, a 12% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 18.2%, a 160 basis points increase from the prior year as the increase in gross margin more than offset increase in operating expenses. Our GAAP EPS was $1.26, which include a $169 million income tax benefit due to revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets and pro forma EPS was $0.52, a 7% increase from the prior year.
Next, we'll look at our first quarter revenue by segment. In the first quarter, we achieved 2% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. Collectively, marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness were up 12% compared to the prior-year quarter. 
Looking next at the first quarter revenue charts. Collectively, the marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness segments contributed 75% total revenue in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 69% in the prior quarter. Marine grew from 13% to 16%, while aviation grew from 17% to 19% and outdoor grew from 16% to 18%. You see the chart illustrates the profit mix by segment: Marine, outdoor, aviation, fitness segments collectively delivered 94% of operating income in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 82% first quarter of 2016. Marine, outdoor, aviation, fitness segments had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $20 million or 8%. Research and development increased $14 million year-over-year or 180 basis points to 19.1% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine where we see long-term growth opportunities. SG&A was up $6 million compared to prior-year quarter, an increase of 70 basis points as a percent of sales to 16%. Increased spending in SG&A is primarily driven by increased legal related expenses and information technology costs. Expense was relatively flat compared to prior-year quarter, representing 4.9% of sales. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable decreased as expected, both sequentially and year-over-year to $391 million. Our inventory balance increased over the prior year sequentially to $533 million as we prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter. In the first quarter of 2017, we generated free cash flow of $95 million, a $21 million decrease from the prior-year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million and purchased $28 million of company stock, with $47 million remaining to purchase in December 2017. 
During the first quarter of 2017, we reported income tax benefit of $150 million, which represents -- which includes a $160 million income tax benefit due to revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets. Excluding the $160 million income tax benefit, the first quarter 2017 pro forma effective tax rate was 21.3% compared to 18.1% in the prior-year quarter. The 320 basis point year-over-year increase in the pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland tax positions with international tax initiatives. We continue to expect our full your 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. This concludes our formal remarks. Christy, would you please open the line for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded first quarter consolidated revenue of $639 million, up 2% over the prior year. Marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness collectively increased 12% year-over-year and contributed 75% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.3% as both segment and product mix were favorable. As a result of our increased revenues and gross margins, our operating margin improved to 18.2%, while operating income increased 12%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.26, which includes a significant income tax benefit recognized during the quarter. Pro forma EPS, which excludes this benefit, grew 7% to $0.52 in the quarter. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results, which delivered growth in revenue, profits and earnings. However, since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. 
Starting with marine. Revenue grew 26%, ahead of the overall market, resulting in market share gains. All major product categories performed well. Gross margin improved to 57%, while operating margin improved to 17%, resulting in operating income growth of 76% over the prior year. Marine season is in full swing, and we have seen strong demand for our latest product offerings. We started shipping our new GPSMap chartplotters early in the season, and the feedback from customers has been very positive. Looking forward, we remain focused on gaining market share through innovations that will clearly differentiate us in the market. 
Looking next at outdoor. Revenue increased 20% on strong demand for outdoor wearables. The segment continued to generate strong gross margin and operating margin of 63% and 30%, respectively, while operating income grew 24% over the prior year. We began shipping the highly anticipated fenix 5 adventure watch series late in the quarter. Orders have been very strong, and we expect that it will take several weeks to catch up with demand. 
We also recently hosted our first Connect IQ Developer Summit, bringing together application developers and business partners to participate in hands-on workshops and breakout sessions with our product managers and engineers. At the event, we announced new capabilities for Connect IQ, including the ability for app developers to implement a revenue model. We also announced new integration partners, including SmartThings, which gives us a strong presence in the emerging home automation market. 
Turning next to aviation. We reported solid revenue growth of 16%, driven by growth in aftermarket products and led by strong growth related to our ADS-B offerings. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 74% and 31%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 27% over the prior year. During the quarter, we started shipments of the G1000 NXi, the next-generation integrated flight deck featuring wireless connectivity and enhanced safety features. We received European certification for the GTX 345, expanding the addressable market for this popular ADS-B transponder. 
In addition, we continue to support our OEM partners in the development and certification of new aircraft and helicopter platforms. Much has been said about the challenging market conditions, which remain a factor. However, we continue to believe that market share gains and new platforms provide opportunities for long-term growth.
Looking next at fitness. Revenue declined 3%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers, especially those which lack GPS capability. Despite this challenge, we are very pleased with the performance of advanced wearables with GPS capability, which experienced robust growth during the quarter and nearly offset the steep decline of basic activity trackers. Gross margin increased to 56% as product mix shifted to the higher-margin devices. Operating margin increased to 13%, resulting in operating income growth of 11%. During the quarter, we launched the Forerunner 935, which is our most advanced multisport watch with new running dynamics features and enhanced performance and recovery monitoring. We also introduced our latest v√≠vosmart 3, an ultra-slim smart activity tracker with wrist-based heart rate and an innovative stress tracking feature. While we continue to see the market for basic activity trackers mature, we also see growth opportunities in advanced wearables with GPS, and we are confident in our product roadmap going forward. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 19% in the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market and partially offset by growth in our auto OEM product lines. Gross margin was 44%, which is consistent year-over-year, while operating margin declined to 4%. During the quarter, we began shipping our next-generation Drive family of PND devices, which has wireless connectivity and enhanced driver alerts. We also introduced the Dash Cam 45 and 55, offering high-quality recording in an ultracompact form factor. We remain focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment. 
Okay. Finally, before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to mention the recognition we recently received from Forbes Magazine, ranking us among the top 100 most reputable companies in America. Our employees work very hard to make Garmin the best at everything we do and to operate the business with integrity. It's a special honor for all of us to be recognized in this way. 
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details of our financial results."
598655,426438280,1187437,"Garmin Ltd., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

Let me begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $639 million for the first quarter, representing a 2% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.3%, a 380 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by the shift towards segments with higher margin as well as product mix within certain segments. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 40.1%, a 230 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $116 million, a 12% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 18.2%, a 160 basis point increase from the prior year as the increase in gross margin more than offset the increase in operating expenses. Our GAAP EPS was $1.26, which includes a $169 million income tax benefit due to revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets. And pro forma EPS was $0.52, a 7% increase from the prior year.
Next, we'll look at our first quarter revenue by segment. In the first quarter, we achieved 2% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. Collectively, marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness were up 12% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Looking next at the first quarter revenue charts. Collectively, the marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness segments contributed 75% total revenue in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 69% in the prior quarter. Marine grew from 13% to 16%, while aviation grew from 17% to 19%, and outdoor grew from 16% to 18%. As you can see, the charts illustrate the profit mix by segment. Marine, outdoor, aviation, fitness segments collectively delivered 94% of operating income in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 82% first quarter of 2016. Marine, outdoor, aviation, fitness segments had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at our operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $20 million or 8%. Research and development increased $14 million year-over-year or 180 basis points to 19.1% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine, where we see long-term growth opportunities. SG&A was up $6 million compared to prior year quarter and increased 70 basis points as a percent of sales to 16%. Increased spending in SG&A is primarily driven by increased legal-related expenses and information technology costs. Advertising expense was relatively flat compared to prior year quarter, representing 4.9% of sales. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable decreased, as expected, both sequentially and year-over-year to $391 million. Our inventory balance increased over the prior year sequentially to $533 million as we prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter. In the first quarter of 2017, we generated free cash flow of $95 million, a $21 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million and purchased $28 million of company stock, with $47 million remaining to purchase through December 2017.
In the first quarter of 2017, we reported income tax benefit of $150 million, which includes a $160 million income tax benefit due to revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets. Excluding the $160 million income tax benefit, first quarter 2017 pro forma effective tax rate was 21.3% compared to 18.1% in the prior year quarter. The 320 basis point year-over-year increase in the pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland tax positions with international tax initiatives. We continue to expect our full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 22%.

As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded first quarter consolidated revenue of $639 million, up 2% over the prior year. Marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness collectively increased 12% year-over-year and contributed 75% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.3% as both segment and product mix were favorable. As a result of our increased revenues and gross margins, our operating margin improved to 18.2%, while operating income increased 12%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.26, which includes a significant income tax benefit recognized during the quarter. Pro forma EPS, which excludes this benefit, grew 7% to $0.52 in the quarter. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results, which delivered growth in revenue, profits and earnings. However, since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. 
Starting with marine. Revenue grew 26%, ahead of the overall market, resulting in market share gains. All major product categories performed well. Gross margin improved to 57%, while operating margin improved to 17%, resulting in operating income growth of 76% over the prior year. Marine season is in full swing, and we have seen strong demand for our latest product offerings. We started shipping our new GPSMap chartplotters early in the season, and the feedback from customers has been very positive. Looking forward, we remain focused on gaining market share through innovations that will clearly differentiate us in the market. 
Looking next at outdoor. Revenue increased 20% on strong demand for outdoor wearables. The segment continued to generate strong gross margin and operating margin of 63% and 30%, respectively, while operating income grew 24% over the prior year. We began shipping the highly anticipated fenix 5 adventure watch series late in the quarter. Orders have been very strong, and we expect that it will take several weeks to catch up with demand. 
We also recently hosted our first Connect IQ Developer Summit, bringing together application developers and business partners to participate in hands-on workshops and breakout sessions with our product managers and engineers. At the event, we announced new capabilities for Connect IQ, including the ability for app developers to implement a revenue model. We also announced new integration partners, including SmartThings, which gives us a strong presence in the emerging home automation market. 
Turning next to aviation. We reported solid revenue growth of 16%, driven by growth in aftermarket products and led by strong growth related to our ADS-B offerings. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 74% and 31%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 27% over the prior year. During the quarter, we started shipments of the G1000 NXi, the next-generation integrated flight deck featuring wireless connectivity and enhanced safety features. We received European certification for the GTX 345, expanding the addressable market for this popular ADS-B transponder. 
In addition, we continue to support our OEM partners in the development and certification of new aircraft and helicopter platforms. Much has been said about the challenging market conditions, which remain a factor. However, we continue to believe that market share gains and new platforms provide opportunities for long-term growth.
Looking next at fitness. Revenue declined 3%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers, especially those which lack GPS capability. Despite this challenge, we are very pleased with the performance of advanced wearables with GPS capability, which experienced robust growth during the quarter and nearly offset the steep decline of basic activity trackers. Gross margin increased to 56% as product mix shifted to the higher-margin devices. Operating margin increased to 13%, resulting in operating income growth of 11%. During the quarter, we launched the Forerunner 935, which is our most advanced multisport watch with new running dynamics features and enhanced performance and recovery monitoring. We also introduced our latest v√≠vosmart 3, an ultra-slim smart activity tracker with wrist-based heart rate and an innovative stress tracking feature. While we continue to see the market for basic activity trackers mature, we also see growth opportunities in advanced wearables with GPS, and we are confident in our product roadmap going forward. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 19% in the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market and partially offset by growth in our auto OEM product lines. Gross margin was 44%, which is consistent year-over-year, while operating margin declined to 4%. During the quarter, we began shipping our next-generation Drive family of PND devices, which adds wireless connectivity and enhanced driver alerts. We also introduced the Dash Cam 45 and 55, offering high-quality recording in an ultracompact form factor. We remain focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment. 
Okay. Finally, before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to mention the recognition we recently received from Forbes Magazine, ranking us among the top 100 most reputable companies in America. Our employees work very hard to make Garmin the best at everything we do and to operate the business with integrity. It's a special honor for all of us to be recognized in this way. 
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details of our financial results."
598655,426438280,1187598,"Garmin Ltd., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

Let me begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $639 million for the first quarter, representing a 2% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.3%, a 380 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by the shift towards segments with higher margin as well as product mix within certain segments. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 40.1%, a 230 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $116 million, a 12% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 18.2%, a 160 basis point increase from the prior year as the increase in gross margin more than offset the increase in operating expenses. Our GAAP EPS was $1.26, which includes a $169 million income tax benefit due to revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets. And pro forma EPS was $0.52, a 7% increase from the prior year.
Next, we'll look at our first quarter revenue by segment. In the first quarter, we achieved 2% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. Collectively, marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness were up 12% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Looking next at the first quarter revenue charts. Collectively, the marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness segments contributed 75% total revenue in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 69% in the prior quarter. Marine grew from 13% to 16%, while aviation grew from 17% to 19%, and outdoor grew from 16% to 18%. As you can see, the charts illustrate the profit mix by segment. Marine, outdoor, aviation, fitness segments collectively delivered 94% of operating income in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 82% first quarter of 2016. Marine, outdoor, aviation, fitness segments had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at our operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $20 million or 8%. Research and development increased $14 million year-over-year or 180 basis points to 19.1% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine, where we see long-term growth opportunities. SG&A was up $6 million compared to prior year quarter and increased 70 basis points as a percent of sales to 16%. Increased spending in SG&A was primarily driven by increased legal-related expenses and information technology costs. Advertising expense was relatively flat compared to prior year quarter, representing 4.9% of sales. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable decreased, as expected, both sequentially and year-over-year to $391 million. Our inventory balance increased over the prior year sequentially to $533 million as we prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter. In the first quarter of 2017, we generated free cash flow of $95 million, a $21 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million and purchased $28 million of company stock, with $47 million remaining to purchase through December 2017.
In the first quarter of 2017, we reported income tax benefit of $150 million, which includes a $160 million income tax benefit due to revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred taxed assets. Excluding the $160 million income tax benefit, first quarter 2017 pro forma effective tax rate was 21.3% compared to 18.1% in the prior year quarter. The 320 basis point year-over-year increase in the pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland tax positions with international tax initiatives. We continue to expect our full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Christy, would you please open the line for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded first quarter consolidated revenue of $639 million, up 2% over the prior year. Marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness collectively increased 12% year-over-year and contributed 75% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.3% as both segment and product mix were favorable. As a result of our increased revenues and gross margins, our operating margin improved to 18.2%, while operating income increased 12%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.26, which includes a significant income tax benefit recognized during the quarter. Pro forma EPS, which excludes this benefit, grew 7% to $0.52 in the quarter. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results, which delivered growth in revenue, profits and earnings. However, since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. 
Starting with marine. Revenue grew 26%, ahead of the overall market, resulting in market share gains. All major product categories performed well. Gross margin improved to 57%, while operating margin improved to 17%, resulting in operating income growth of 76% over the prior year. Marine season is in full swing, and we have seen strong demand for our latest product offerings. We started shipping our new GPSMap chartplotters early in the season, and the feedback from customers has been very positive. Looking forward, we remain focused on gaining market share through innovations that will clearly differentiate us in the market. 
Looking next at outdoor. Revenue increased 20% on strong demand for outdoor wearables. The segment continued to generate strong gross margin and operating margin of 63% and 30%, respectively, while operating income grew 24% over the prior year. We began shipping the highly anticipated fenix 5 adventure watch series late in the quarter. Orders have been very strong, and we expect that it will take several weeks to catch up with demand. 
We also recently hosted our first Connect IQ Developer Summit, bringing together application developers and business partners to participate in hands-on workshops and breakout sessions with our product managers and engineers. At the event, we announced new capabilities for Connect IQ, including the ability for app developers to implement a revenue model. We also announced new integration partners, including SmartThings, which gives us a strong presence in the emerging home automation market. 
Turning next to aviation. We reported solid revenue growth of 16%, driven by growth in aftermarket products and led by strong growth related to our ADS-B offerings. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 74% and 31%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 27% over the prior year. During the quarter, we started shipments of the G1000 NXi, the next-generation integrated flight deck featuring wireless connectivity and enhanced safety features. We received European certification for the GTX 345, expanding the addressable market for this popular ADS-B transponder. 
In addition, we continue to support our OEM partners in the development and certification of new aircraft and helicopter platforms. Much has been said about the challenging market conditions, which remain a factor. However, we continue to believe that market share gains and new platforms provide opportunities for long-term growth.
Looking next at fitness. Revenue declined 3%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers, especially those which lack GPS capability. Despite this challenge, we are very pleased with the performance of advanced wearables with GPS capability, which experienced robust growth during the quarter and nearly offset the steep decline of basic activity trackers. Gross margin increased to 56% as product mix shifted to the higher-margin devices. Operating margin increased to 13%, resulting in operating income growth of 11%. During the quarter, we launched the Forerunner 935, which is our most advanced multisport watch with new running dynamics features and enhanced performance and recovery monitoring. We also introduced our latest v√≠vosmart 3, an ultra-slim smart activity tracker with wrist-based heart rate and an innovative stress tracking feature. While we continue to see the market for basic activity trackers mature, we also see growth opportunities in advanced wearables with GPS, and we are confident in our product roadmap going forward. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 19% in the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market and partially offset by growth in our auto OEM product lines. Gross margin was 44%, which is consistent year-over-year, while operating margin declined to 4%. During the quarter, we began shipping our next-generation Drive family of PND devices, which adds wireless connectivity and enhanced driver alerts. We also introduced the Dash Cam 45 and 55, offering high-quality recording in an ultracompact form factor. We remain focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment. 
Okay. Finally, before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to mention the recognition we recently received from Forbes Magazine, ranking us among the top 100 most reputable companies in America. Our employees work very hard to make Garmin the best at everything we do and to operate the business with integrity. It's a special honor for all of us to be recognized in this way. 
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details of our financial results."
598655,426438280,1191861,"Garmin Ltd., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

Let me begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $639 million for the first quarter, representing a 2% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.3%, a 380 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by the shift towards segments with higher margin as well as product mix within certain segments. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 40.1%, a 230 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $116 million, a 12% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 18.2%, a 160 basis point increase from the prior year as the increase in gross margin more than offset the increase in operating expenses. Our GAAP EPS was $1.26, which includes a $169 million income tax benefit due to revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets. And pro forma EPS was $0.52, a 7% increase from the prior year.
Next, we'll look at our first quarter revenue by segment. In the first quarter, we achieved 2% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. Collectively, marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness were up 12% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Looking next at the first quarter revenue charts. Collectively, the marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness segments contributed 75% total revenue in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 69% in the prior quarter. Marine grew from 13% to 16%, while aviation grew from 17% to 19%, and outdoor grew from 16% to 18%. As you can see, the charts illustrate the profit mix by segment. Marine, outdoor, aviation, fitness segments collectively delivered 94% of operating income in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 82% first quarter of 2016. Marine, outdoor, aviation, fitness segments had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at our operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $20 million or 8%. Research and development increased $14 million year-over-year or 180 basis points to 19.1% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine, where we see long-term growth opportunities. SG&A was up $6 million compared to prior year quarter and increased 70 basis points as a percent of sales to 16%. Increased spending in SG&A was primarily driven by increased legal-related expenses and information technology costs. Advertising expense was relatively flat compared to prior year quarter, representing 4.9% of sales. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable decreased, as expected, both sequentially and year-over-year to $391 million. Our inventory balance increased over the prior year sequentially to $533 million as we prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter. In the first quarter of 2017, we generated free cash flow of $95 million, a $21 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million and purchased $28 million of company stock, with $47 million remaining to purchase through December 2017.
In the first quarter of 2017, we reported income tax benefit of $150 million, which includes a $160 million income tax benefit due to revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred taxed assets. Excluding the $160 million income tax benefit, first quarter 2017 pro forma effective tax rate was 21.3% compared to 18.1% in the prior year quarter. The 320 basis point year-over-year increase in the pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland tax positions with international tax initiatives. We continue to expect our full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Christy, would you please open the line for Q&A?"

Keep in mind, these are both very niche segments without a lot of dynamics in terms of the overall channel and the consumer. So consequently, I think obviously, there's some limit to what the potential growth trajectory looks like over the long term, but our goal is to be the market share leader and to continue to be able to grow with the market."

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported second quarter consolidated revenue of $817 million, up 1% over the prior year. Outdoor aviation, marine and fitness collectively increased 8% year-over-year and contributed 74% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.5% compared to the prior year due to favorable segment revenue mix. As a result of our increased revenues and gross margins, our operating margin improved to 24.9%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.91 and pro forma EPS of $0.88 in the quarter. 
Our results were positively impacted by growth in advance wearables. Our Connect IQ app stores are direct reflection of end-user engagement with our wearables. During the past 12 months, there've been over 17 million downloads of an app watch face for data field from our Connect IQ store, and the total downloads increased to over 30 million since inception. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. Beginning with the outdoor segment. Revenue grew 46% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong growth of our fenix line of smart watches. Gross and operating margins expanded to 66% and 38%, respectively, while operating income grew 53% over the prior year. We experienced strong demand for the fenix 5 watch series and anticipate it will continue to have a positive impact on our outdoor segment for the remainder of the year. In addition, we continued to see solid growth of our new inReach devices and subscription-based services. And finally, we launched the Approach S60, a premium watch for the golf enthusiast, and we recently announced the newest members of our Foretrex and Rino product lines. Looking forward, we are focused on opportunities in wearables and inReach. 
Turning next to aviation. We reported strong revenue growth of 15%, driven by growth in aftermarket products. We also experienced positive contributions from our OEM product categories. Growth and operating margin remained strong at 75% and 32%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 28% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we introduced our first head up display, which is designed specifically for aircraft with integrated flight decks. We are pleased that the Citation Longitude will be the launch platform for this new product category. We also received European approval for our G1000 NXi system, expanding the reach of this aftermarket offering for [indiscernible] 200, 300 and 350 aircraft models. Looking forward, we are focused on maximizing ADS-B mandate opportunities and gaining share in the OEM market. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue declined 3%. However, this segment is performing as expected on a year-to-date basis with 10% revenue growth. We believe that favorable weather earlier in the year accelerated buying, which impacted the results of the second quarter. Gross and operating margins were 57% and 22%, respectively. During the quarter, we consider the acquisition of Active Katzman, the developer of ground source content for voters. In addition, we launched our next-generation products wearable. Looking forward, we're focused on product innovations and gaining share in the inland fishing category. 
Looking next at fitness. Revenue declined 15%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers and the timing of new product introductions. Gross margin was steady at 56%, while operating margin decreased year-over-year to 21%. While the quarter has been challenging for fitness, we remain positive about the opportunities in the segment. We expect these trends to continue into Q3. However, we anticipate ending the year on a stronger note as our product refresh cycle is completed. Looking forward, we are focused on areas of opportunity, particularly in the advance wearable category. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 15% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in several niche categories such as fleets, cameras and RVs. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 45% and 13%, respectively. Our global market share position in PND category remains very strong. During the quarter, we launched the VIRB 360, a compact [indiscernible] immersive camera built through adventure. VIRB 360 is an amazing device to capture video up to 5K, 30 frames per second and makes it easier to share memories on-the-go. Looking forward, we're focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment. 
Turning finally to guidance. We're pleased with our consolidated performance in the first half of 2017 and believe we're well-positioned for the remainder of the year. As a result, we're raising our projected revenue for the year to $3.04 billion, up about 1% over 27 -- over 2016. We project gross margin to increase to approximately 57.5% due to segment mix, and we project operating margin of approximately 21% for the full year. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 22%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.80. 
Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment. We have increased our growth expectations for the outdoor segment to 25% and the aviation segment to 10%. Marine and auto are unchanged, while the outlook for fitness has been excised to down 5% due to the continued decline in activity tracker category. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $817 million for the second quarter, representing 1% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.5%, a 150 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by the shift towards segments with higher margin. Operating expense as a percentage of sales is 33.6%, 130 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $203 million, 1% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.9%, 20 basis point increase from the prior year. The increase in gross margin more than offset the increase in operating expenses. Our GAAP EPS was $0.01. Pro forma EPS was $0.88, 1% increase from the prior year. 
Next, we'll look at second quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 1% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in our outdoor and aviation segments. This growth was partially offset by decline of fitness segment, which resulted in significant decline activity tracker category and continued decline in auto, PND business. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness were up 8% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contributed 74% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 70% in the prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 17% to 24%, and aviation grew from 13% to 15%. As you can see from the chart illustrated our profit mix by segment, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments collectively delivered 86% of operating income in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 80% in the second quarter of 2016. The outdoor and aviation segments had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. The second quarter operating expenses increased by $12 million or 5%. Research and development increased $13 million year-over-year or 150 basis points to 15.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused on fitness, outdoor, marine, aviation segments where we see long-term growth opportunities. SG&A was up $1 million compared to prior year quarter, but relatively flat as a percent of sales. Our advertising expense was $2 million less than the prior year quarter. Traditional spending in outdoor segment was more than offset by decreases in the fitness and all the segments. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased [ph] sequentially year-over-year to $515 million. Our inventory balance decreased sequentially to $525 million as we exit the seasonally strong second quarter. During the second quarter of 2017, we generated free cash flow of $129 million, a $6 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million and repurchased $36 million of company stock, $11 million remaining for purchase through December 2017. 
In the second quarter of 2017, we reported an effective tax rate of 25%, which includes $7 million of income tax expense resulting from a new accounting standard related to the expiration of share-based awards. Excluding the $7 million of income tax expense, second quarter 2017 pro forma effective tax rate was 21.9% compared to 21% in the prior year quarter. The 90 basis point year-over-year increase of pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions with international tax initiatives, partially offset by income mix by tax jurisdictions. We continue to expect our full your 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 22%.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported second quarter consolidated revenue of $817 million, up 1% over the prior year. Outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness collectively increased 8% year-over-year and contributed 74% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.5% compared to the prior year due to favorable segment revenue mix. As a result of our increased [indiscernible] and gross margins, our operating margin improved to 24.9%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.91 and pro forma EPS of $0.88 in the quarter. 
Our results were positively impacted by growth in advanced wearables. Our Connect IQ app store is the direct reflection of end-user engagement with our wearables. During the past 12 months, there have been over 17 million downloads of an app, watch face or data field from our Connect IQ store, and the total downloads increased to over 30 million since inception. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. Beginning with the outdoor segment. Revenue grew 46% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong growth of our fenix line of smart watches. Gross and operating margins expanded to 66% and 38%, respectively, while operating income grew 53% over the prior year. We experienced strong demand for the fenix 5 watch series and anticipate it will continue to have a positive impact on our outdoor segment for the remainder of the year. In addition, we continue to see solid growth of our new inReach devices and subscription-based services. Finally, we launched the Approach S60, a premium watch for the golf enthusiasts, and we recently announced the newest members of our Foretrex and Rino product lines. Looking forward, we are focused on opportunities in wearables and inReach. 
Turning next to aviation. We reported strong revenue growth of 15%, driven by growth in aftermarket products. We also experienced positive contributions from our OEM product categories. Gross and operating margins remain strong at 75% and 32%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 28% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we introduced our first head-up display, which was designed specifically for aircraft with integrated flight decks. We are pleased that the Cessna Citation Longitude will be the launch platform for this new product category. We also received European approval for our G1000 NXi system, expanding the reach of this aftermarket offering for King Air 200, 300 and 350 aircraft models. Looking forward, we are focused on maximizing ADS-B mandate opportunities and gaining share in the OEM market. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue declined 3%. However, this segment is performing as expected on a year-to-date basis with 10% revenue growth. We believe that favorable weather earlier in the year accelerated buying, which impacted the results of the second quarter. Gross and operating margins were 57% and 22%, respectively. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Active Captain, the developer of crowd-sourced content for boaters. In addition, we launched our next-generation quatix wearable. Looking forward, we are focused on product innovations and gaining share in the inland fishing category. 
Looking next at fitness. Revenue declined 15%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers and the timing of new product introductions. Gross margin was steady at 56%, while operating margin decreased year-over-year to 21%. While the quarter has been challenging for fitness, we remain positive about the opportunities in this segment. We expect these trends to continue into Q3. However, we anticipate ending the year on a stronger note as our product refresh cycle is completed. Looking forward, we are focused on areas of opportunity, particularly in the advanced wearable category.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 15% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in several niche categories such as fleets, cameras and RVs. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 45% and 13%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. During the quarter, we launched the VIRB 360, a compact, full spherical, immersive camera built for adventure. VIRB 360 is an amazing device that captures video up to 5K/30 frames per second and makes it easy to share memories on the go. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.
Turning finally to guidance. We are pleased with our consolidated performance in the first half of 2017 and believe we are well positioned for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are raising our projected revenue for the year to $3.04 billion, up about 1% over 2016. We project gross margin to increase to approximately 57.5% due to segment mix, and we project operating margin of approximately 21% for the full year. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 22%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.80. 
Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment. We have increased our growth expectations for the outdoor segment to 25% and the aviation segment to 10%. Marine and auto are unchanged, while the outlook for fitness has been revised to down 5% due to the continued decline in activity tracker category. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $817 million for the second quarter, representing 1% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.5%, a 150 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by the shift towards segments with higher margin. Operating expense as a percentage of sales is 33.6%, a 130 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $203 million, a 1% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.9%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior year. The increase in gross margin more than offset the increase in operating expenses. Our GAAP EPS was $0.91. Pro forma EPS was $0.88, a 1% increase from the prior year. 
Next, we'll look at our second quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 1% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in our outdoor and aviation segments. This growth was partially offset by the decline in fitness segment, a result of the significant decline in activity tracker category and continued decline in the auto PND business. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness were up 8% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contributed 74% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 70% in prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 17% to 24%, and aviation grew from 13% to 15%. As you can see from the charts illustrating our profit mix by segment, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments collectively delivered 86% of operating income in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 80% in second quarter of 2016. The outdoor and aviation segments had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. The second quarter operating expenses increased by $12 million or 5%. Research and development increased $13 million year-over-year or 150 basis points to 15.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused on fitness, outdoor, marine, aviation, segments where we see long-term growth opportunities. SG&A was up $1 million compared to prior year quarter but relatively flat as a percent of sales. Our advertising expense was $2 million less than the prior year quarter. Traditional spend in outdoor segment was more than offset by decreases in the fitness and all the segments. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially year-over-year to $515 million. Our inventory balance decreased sequentially to $525 million as we exit the seasonally strong second quarter. During the second quarter of 2017, we generated free cash flow of $129 million, a $6 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million and purchased $36 million of company stock, $11 million remaining for purchase through December 2017. 
In the second quarter of 2017, we reported an effective tax rate of 25%, which includes $7 million of income tax expense resulting from a new accounting standard related to the expiration of share-based awards. Excluding the $7 million of income tax expense, second quarter 2017 pro forma effective tax rate was 21.9% compared to 21% in the prior year quarter. The 90 basis point year-over-year increase in pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions with international tax initiatives, partially offset by income mix by tax jurisdiction. We continue to expect our full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Tachia, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported second quarter consolidated revenue of $817 million, up 1% over the prior year. Outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness collectively increased 8% year-over-year and contributed 74% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.5% compared to the prior year due to favorable segment revenue mix. As a result of our increased [indiscernible] and gross margins, our operating margin improved to 24.9%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.91 and pro forma EPS of $0.88 in the quarter. 
Our results were positively impacted by growth in advanced wearables. Our Connect IQ app store is a direct reflection of end-user engagement with our wearables. During the past 12 months, there have been over 17 million downloads of an app, watch face or data field from our Connect IQ store, and the total downloads increased to over 30 million since inception. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. Beginning with the Outdoor segment. Revenue grew 46% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong growth of our fenix line of smart watches. Gross and operating margins expanded to 66% and 38%, respectively, while operating income grew 53% over the prior year. We experienced strong demand for the fenix 5 watch series and anticipate it will continue to have a positive impact on our outdoor segment for the remainder of the year. In addition, we continue to see solid growth of our new inReach devices and subscription-based services. Finally, we launched the Approach S60, a premium watch for the golf enthusiasts, and we recently announced the newest members of our Foretrex and Rino product lines. Looking forward, we are focused on opportunities in wearables and inReach. 
Turning next to aviation. We reported strong revenue growth of 15%, driven by growth in aftermarket products. We also experienced positive contributions from our OEM product categories. Gross and operating margins remain strong at 75% and 32%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 28% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we introduced our first head-up display, which was designed specifically for aircraft with integrated flight decks. We are pleased that the Cessna Citation Longitude will be the launch platform for this new product category. We also received European approval for our G1000 NXi system, expanding the reach of this aftermarket offering for King Air 200, 300 and 350 aircraft models. Looking forward, we are focused on maximizing ADS-B mandate opportunities and gaining share in the OEM market. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue declined 3%. However, the segment is performing as expected on a year-to-date basis with 10% revenue growth. We believe that favorable weather earlier in the year accelerated buying, which impacted the results of the second quarter. Gross and operating margins were 57% and 22%, respectively. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Active Captain, the developer of crowd-sourced content for boaters. In addition, we launched our next-generation quatix wearable. Looking forward, we are focused on product innovations and gaining share in the inland fishing category. 
Looking next at fitness. Revenue declined 15%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers and the timing of new product introductions. Gross margin was steady at 56%, while operating margin decreased year-over-year to 21%. While the quarter has been challenging for fitness, we remain positive about the opportunities in the segment. We expect these trends to continue into Q3. However, we anticipate ending the year on a stronger note as our product refresh cycle is completed. Looking forward, we are focused on areas of opportunity, particularly in the advanced wearable category.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 15% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in several niche categories such as fleets, cameras and RVs. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 45% and 13%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. During the quarter, we launched the VIRB 360, a compact, full spherical, immersive camera built for adventure. The VIRB 360 is an amazing device that captures video up to 5K/30 frames per second and makes it easy to share memories on the go. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.
Turning finally to guidance. We are pleased with our consolidated performance in the first half of 2017 and believe we are well positioned for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are raising our projected revenue for the year to $3.04 billion, up about 1% over 2016. We project gross margin to increase to approximately 57.5% due to segment mix, and we project operating margin of approximately 21% for the full year. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 22%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.80. 
Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment. We have increased our growth expectations for the outdoor segment to 25% and the aviation segment to 10%. Marine and auto are unchanged, while the outlook for fitness has been revised to down 5% due to the continued decline in activity tracker category. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $817 million for the second quarter, representing 1% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.5%, a 150 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by the shift towards segments with higher margin. Operating expense as a percentage of sales is 33.6%, a 130 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $203 million, a 1% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.9%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior year. The increase in gross margin more than offset the increase in operating expenses. Our GAAP EPS was $0.91. Pro forma EPS was $0.88, a 1% increase from the prior year. 
Next, we'll look at our second quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 1% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in our outdoor and aviation segments. This growth was partially offset by a decline in our fitness segment, which resulted in a significant decline in activity tracker category and continued decline in the auto PND business. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness were up 8% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contributed 74% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 70% the prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 17% to 24% and aviation grew from 13% to 15%. As you can see from the charts illustrating our profit mix by segment, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments collectively delivered 86% of operating income in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 80% the second quarter of 2016. The outdoor and aviation segments had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. The second quarter operating expenses increased by $12 million or 5%. Research and development increased $13 million year-over-year or 150 basis points to 15.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused on fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation segments, where we see long-term growth opportunities. SG&A was up $1 million compared to prior year quarter. It was relatively flat as a percent of sales. Our advertising expense was $2 million less than the prior year quarter, as additional spend in outdoor segment was more than offset by decreases in the fitness and all the segments. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially year-over-year to $515 million. Our inventory balance decreased sequentially to $525 million as we exit the seasonally strong second quarter. During the second quarter of 2017, we generated free cash flow of $129 million, a $6 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million and purchased $36 million of company stock, $11 million remaining for purchase through December 2017. 
In the second quarter of 2017, we reported an effective tax rate of 25%, which includes $7 million of income tax expense resulting from a new accounting standard related to the expiration of share-based awards. Excluding the $7 million of income tax expense, the second quarter 2017 pro forma effective tax rate was 21.9% compared to 21% in the prior year quarter. The 90 basis point year-over-year increase in pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions with international tax initiatives, partially offset by income mix by tax jurisdiction. We continue to expect our full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Tachia, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported second quarter consolidated revenue of $817 million, up 1% over the prior year. Outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness collectively increased 8% year-over-year and contributed 74% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.5% compared to the prior year due to favorable segment revenue mix. As a result of our increased [indiscernible] and gross margins, our operating margin improved to 24.9%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.91 and pro forma EPS of $0.88 in the quarter. 
Our results were positively impacted by growth in advanced wearables. Our Connect IQ app store is a direct reflection of end-user engagement with our wearables. During the past 12 months, there have been over 17 million downloads of an app, watch face or data field from our Connect IQ store, and the total downloads increased to over 30 million since inception. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. Beginning with the Outdoor segment. Revenue grew 46% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong growth of our fenix line of smart watches. Gross and operating margins expanded to 66% and 38%, respectively, while operating income grew 53% over the prior year. We experienced strong demand for the fenix 5 watch series and anticipate it will continue to have a positive impact on our outdoor segment for the remainder of the year. In addition, we continue to see solid growth of our new inReach devices and subscription-based services. Finally, we launched the Approach S60, a premium watch for the golf enthusiasts, and we recently announced the newest members of our Foretrex and Rino product lines. Looking forward, we are focused on opportunities in wearables and inReach. 
Turning next to aviation. We reported strong revenue growth of 15%, driven by growth in aftermarket products. We also experienced positive contributions from our OEM product categories. Gross and operating margins remain strong at 75% and 32%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 28% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we introduced our first head-up display, which was designed specifically for aircraft with integrated flight decks. We are pleased that the Cessna Citation Longitude will be the launch platform for this new product category. We also received European approval for our G1000 NXi system, expanding the reach of this aftermarket offering for King Air 200, 300 and 350 aircraft models. Looking forward, we are focused on maximizing ADS-B mandate opportunities and gaining share in the OEM market. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue declined 3%. However, the segment is performing as expected on a year-to-date basis with 10% revenue growth. We believe that favorable weather earlier in the year accelerated buying, which impacted the results of the second quarter. Gross and operating margins were 57% and 22%, respectively. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Active Captain, the developer of crowd-sourced content for boaters. In addition, we launched our next-generation quatix wearable. Looking forward, we are focused on product innovations and gaining share in the inland fishing category. 
Looking next at fitness. Revenue declined 15%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers and the timing of new product introductions. Gross margin was steady at 56%, while operating margin decreased year-over-year to 21%. While the quarter has been challenging for fitness, we remain positive about the opportunities in the segment. We expect these trends to continue into Q3. However, we anticipate ending the year on a stronger note as our product refresh cycle is completed. Looking forward, we are focused on areas of opportunity, particularly in the advanced wearable category.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 15% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in several niche categories such as fleets, cameras and RVs. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 45% and 13%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. During the quarter, we launched the VIRB 360, a compact, full spherical, immersive camera built for adventure. The VIRB 360 is an amazing device that captures video up to 5K/30 frames per second and makes it easy to share memories on the go. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.
Turning finally to guidance. We are pleased with our consolidated performance in the first half of 2017 and believe we are well positioned for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are raising our projected revenue for the year to $3.04 billion, up about 1% over 2016. We project gross margin to increase to approximately 57.5% due to segment mix, and we project operating margin of approximately 21% for the full year. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 22%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.80. 
Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment. We have increased our growth expectations for the outdoor segment to 25% and the aviation segment to 10%. Marine and auto are unchanged, while the outlook for fitness has been revised to down 5% due to the continued decline in activity tracker category. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $817 million for the second quarter, representing 1% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.5%, a 150 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by the shift towards segments with higher margin. Operating expense as a percentage of sales is 33.6%, a 130 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $203 million, a 1% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.9%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior year. The increase in gross margin more than offset the increase in operating expenses. Our GAAP EPS was $0.91. Pro forma EPS was $0.88, a 1% increase from the prior year. 
Next, we'll look at our second quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 1% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in our outdoor and aviation segments. This growth was partially offset by a decline in our fitness segment, which resulted in a significant decline in activity tracker category and continued decline in the auto PND business. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness were up 8% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contributed 74% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 70% the prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 17% to 24% and aviation grew from 13% to 15%. As you can see from the charts illustrating our profit mix by segment, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments collectively delivered 86% of operating income in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 80% the second quarter of 2016. The outdoor and aviation segments had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. The second quarter operating expenses increased by $12 million or 5%. Research and development increased $13 million year-over-year or 150 basis points to 15.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused on fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation segments, where we see long-term growth opportunities. SG&A was up $1 million compared to prior year quarter. It was relatively flat as a percent of sales. Our advertising expense was $2 million less than the prior year quarter, as additional spend in outdoor segment was more than offset by decreases in the fitness and all the segments. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially year-over-year to $515 million. Our inventory balance decreased sequentially to $525 million as we exit the seasonally strong second quarter. During the second quarter of 2017, we generated free cash flow of $129 million, a $6 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million and purchased $36 million of company stock, $11 million remaining for purchase through December 2017. 
In the second quarter of 2017, we reported an effective tax rate of 25%, which includes $7 million of income tax expense resulting from a new accounting standard related to the expiration of share-based awards. Excluding the $7 million of income tax expense, the second quarter 2017 pro forma effective tax rate was 21.9% compared to 21% in the prior year quarter. The 90 basis point year-over-year increase in pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions with international tax initiatives, partially offset by income mix by tax jurisdiction. We continue to expect our full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Tachia, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter consolidated revenue of $743 million, up 3% over the prior year. Outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness collectively increased 9% year-over-year and contributed 75% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.4%, and operating margin improved to 22.8%. GAAP EPS was $0.78, and pro forma EPS was $0.75 in the quarter. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to make a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. 
Beginning with the outdoor segment. Revenue grew 31% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong demand for wearables. Gross and operating margins expanded to 64% and 37%, respectively, while operating income grew 38% over the prior year. We experienced strong demand for the fenix 5 watch series and expect this trend to continue throughout the holiday quarter. In addition, we experienced solid growth with devices and subscription services. We recently announced our entry into 2 new product categories with the introduction of Descent, our first wearable for the dive market, and the Impact bat sensor, our first product for the baseball market. The Descent is a beautifully designed smart watch with integrated computer functions and electronic logs managed through Garmin Connect. The Impact bat sensor delivers instantaneous feedback on the device while coaches and players can see further details is in the Impact mobile app. Looking forward, we remain focused on the wearable opportunity and expanding into new product categories. 
Turning next to aviation. We reported strong revenue growth of 16%, driven by growth in both OEM and aftermarket categories. Gross and operating margins came in at 73% and 27%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 12% over the prior year. We recently announced the TXi series of test screenings flight displays that offer enhanced integration features and target a broad range of aftermarket aircraft from light signals -- singles to business jets. We also started shipping the GSC 600, our first aftermarket autopilot solution. These new products are welcome additions to our lineup and further expand the addressable market opportunities. Looking forward, we are focused on maximizing ADS-B mandate opportunities and gaining share in the OEM market. 
Looking next at the marine. Revenue increased to 10% year-over-year, driven by growth in multiple product lines and led by strong demand for our fish finders and [indiscernible] combos. Gross and operating margins were 58% and 24%, respectively. We recently completed the acquisition of Navionics, a leading worldwide provider of electronic marine content and mobile applications. Combining content from both Navionics and Garmin will result in best available breadth and depth of coverage for our marine customers. For the third consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of the Year. This award, along with 8 product of excellence awards, affirms our commitment to designing, manufacturing and selling industry-leading products for the marine market. Consistent with that commitment, we announced the 2018 lineup of marine electronics, which include updated echoMAP and STRIKER models with WiFi capability, enabling connected voting experiences. Looking forward, we are focused on product innovations and gaining share in the inland fishing category. 
Moving next to fitness. Revenue declined 12%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers and product introduction timing, partially offset by strong growth in our running product line. Gross margin improved to 58%, while operating margin decreased year-over-year to 20%. Our product lineup is very strong as we entered the holiday quarter. Recent product launches include the v√≠voactive 3 with risk-based payments, the v√≠vomove HR analog watch with risk heart rate and smart notifications and the ultraslim inter v√≠vosport activity tracker with built-in GPS and smart notifications. In addition, we launched our v√≠vofit jr. 2, featuring Disney, Star Wars and Marvel team bands and mobile app adventures. Looking forward, we're focused on areas of opportunity, particularly in the advanced wearable category. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue declined 12% due to the ongoing PND market contraction, partially offset by solid growth in OEM and niche product categories such as cameras, truck fleet and RV. Our global market share in the PND category remains very strong. Gross and operating margins decline year-over-year to 44% and 8%, respectively. 
We recently launched Garmin Speak with Amazon Alexa, which is the first digital assistant with integrated turn-by-turn navigation. We also started shipping that eLog device in time for the upcoming electronic data logging mandate for truck operators. Looking forward, we're focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to optimize profitability in the segment. 
Well, the 3 quarters of the year behind us, we're updating our projected revenue for the year to $3.07 billion, an increase of about 2% over 2016. Projected gross margin remains at approximately 57.5%, but we are raising our projected operating margin to approximately 21.5% for the full year. Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.90, assuming an updated pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 21.5%. 
Looking at guidance by segment. We've increased growth expectations for outdoor, aviation and auto by 200 to 300 basis points. Our outlook for marine is unchanged, while the outlook for fitness has been reduced slightly by 200 basis points. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details of our financial results. Doug?"

Next, we'll look at our third quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 3% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. For the third quarter 2017, outdoor grew 31%, while aviation grew 16%, marine grew 10%. This growth was partially offset by the continued climbed in the auto PND business and decline in our fitness segment, which was primarily due to significant decline in basic activity tracker category. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness were up 9% compared to prior year quarter.
Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contributed 75% of total revenue in the third quarter 2017 compared to 70% in the prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 19% to 25%, and aviation grew from 15% to 17%. As you can see from the charts illustrating our profit next by segment, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments collectively delivered 91% of operating income in the third quarter 2017, [indiscernible] 84% in third quarter 2016. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $18 million or 7%. Research and development increased to $130 million were 17.4% of sales, a 130 basis point increase year-over-year. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources on fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation segments where we see long-term growth opportunities. 
SG&A was up $5 million compared to prior year quarter, increased 30 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.7%. Our advertising expense was relatively flat to the prior quarter as additional spend in outdoor segment was offset by decreases in all the other segments. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $457 million, relatively flat year-over-year. Our inventory balance increased sequentially to $575 million to prepare for the fourth quarter most higher year-over-year due to several new product launches in the third quarter 2017. During the third quarter 2017, we generated free cash flow of $153 million. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million and purchased approximately $11 million of company stock, about $1 million remaining for repurchase through December 2017.
The effective tax rate was 20.8% at current-year quarter compared to 16.5% in the prior quarter. Increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions to international tax initiatives and income mix on tax jurisdictions, partially offset by the release of income tax reserves in the third quarter 2017. We expect our full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 21.5%.

Also, our inReach devices and subscription-based services have been doing very well. So that's the primary drivers behind increase in outdoor. In fitness, as we've been saying, the basic activity tracker market has been in steep decline, so that's been an impact on us throughout this year. And also, our product introduction timing came later this year versus what it did in 2016. And so those 2 factors impacted both the outdoor and fitness. I would mention that if you combine those 2 and look at the combined revenues and the growth on a year-to-date basis, we're up 7% in both outdoor and fitness combined, which reflects, I think, a better picture of the overall wearable category and where it's going."

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter consolidated revenue of $743 million, up 3% over the prior year. Outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness collectively increased 9% year-over-year and contributed 75% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.4%, and operating margin improved to 22.8%. GAAP EPS was $0.78, and pro forma EPS was $0.75 in the quarter. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to make a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. 
Beginning with the outdoor segment. Revenue grew 31% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong demand for wearables. Gross and operating margins expanded to 64% and 37%, respectively, while operating income grew 38% over the prior year. We experienced strong demand for the fenix 5 watch series and expect this trend to continue throughout the holiday quarter. 
In addition, we experienced solid growth of inReach devices and subscription services. We recently announced our entry into 2 new product categories with the introduction of Descent, our first wearable for the dive market, and the Impact bat sensor, our first product for the baseball market.
The Descent is a beautifully designed smart watch with integrated dive computer functions and electronic logs managed through Garmin Connect. The Impact bat sensor delivers instantaneous feedback on the device while coaches and players can see further details using the Impact mobile app. Looking forward, we remain focused on the wearable opportunity and expanding into new product categories. 
Turning next to aviation. We reported strong revenue growth of 16%, driven by growth in both OEM and aftermarket categories. Gross and operating margins came in at 73% and 27%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 12% over the prior year. We recently announced the TXi series of touchscreen flight displays that offer enhanced integration features and target a broad range of aftermarket aircraft from light signals -- singles to business jets. 
We also started shipping the GFC 600, our first aftermarket autopilot solution. These new products are welcome additions to our lineup and further expand addressable market opportunities. Looking forward, we are focused on maximizing ADS-B mandate opportunities and gaining share in the OEM market. 
Looking next at the marine. Revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by growth in multiple product lines and led by strong demand for our fishfinders and chartplotter combos. Gross and operating margins were 58% and 24%, respectively. We recently completed the acquisition of Navionics, a leading worldwide provider of electronic marine content and mobile applications. Combining content from both Navionics and Garmin will result in best available breadth and depth of coverage for our marine customers. 
For the third consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of the Year. This award, along with 8 product of excellence awards, affirms our commitment to designing, manufacturing and selling industry-leading products for the marine market. Consistent with that commitment, we announced the 2018 lineup of marine electronics, which include updated echoMAP and STRIKER models with WiFi capability, enabling connected boating experiences. Looking forward, we are focused on product innovations and gaining share in the inland fishing category. 
Moving next to fitness. Revenue declined 12%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers and product introduction timing, partially offset by strong growth in our running product line. Gross margin improved to 58%, while operating margin decreased year-over-year to 20%. Our product lineup is very strong as we entered the holiday quarter. 
Recent product launches include the v√≠voactive 3 with wrist-based payments, the v√≠vomove HR analog watch with wrist heart rate and smart notifications and the ultraslim v√≠vosport activity tracker with built-in GPS and smart notifications. In addition, we launched our v√≠vofit jr. 2, featuring Disney, Star Wars and Marvel team bands and mobile app adventures. Looking forward, we're focused on areas of opportunity, particularly in the advanced wearable category. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue declined 12% due to the ongoing PND market contraction, partially offset by solid growth in OEM and niche product categories such as cameras, truck fleet and RV. Our global market share in the PND category remains very strong. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 44% and 8%, respectively. 
We recently launched Garmin Speak with Amazon Alexa, which is the first digital assistant with integrated turn-by-turn navigation. We also started shipping the eLog device in time for the upcoming electronic data logging mandate for truck operators. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to optimize profitability in the segment. 
Well, with the 3 quarters of the year behind us, we're updating our projected revenue for the year to $3.07 billion, an increase of about 2% over 2016. Projected gross margin remains at approximately 57.5%, but we are raising our projected operating margin to approximately 21.5% for the full year. Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.90, assuming an updated pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 21.5%. 
Looking at guidance by segment. We've increased growth expectations for outdoor, aviation and auto by 200 to 300 basis points. Our outlook for marine is unchanged, while the outlook for fitness has been reduced slightly by 200 basis points. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details of our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $743 million for the third quarter, representing a 3% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.4%, 220 basis point increase from the prior year, driven primarily by segment and product mix. Operating expense as percentage of sales was 35.5%, a 140 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $170 million, a 6% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 22.8%, a 70 basis point increase from the prior year as the increase in gross margin more than offset the increase in operating expenses. Our GAAP EPS was $0.78. Our pro forma EPS was $0.75, consistent with the prior year.
Next, we'll look at our third quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 3% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. For the third quarter 2017, outdoor grew 31%, while aviation grew 16% and marine grew 10%. This growth was partially offset by the continued decline in the auto PND business and decline in our fitness segment, which was primarily due to significant decline in the basic activity tracker category. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness were up 9% compared to prior year quarter.
Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contributed 75% of total revenue in the third quarter 2017 compared to 70% in the prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 19% to 25%, and aviation grew from 15% to 17%. You can see from the charts, illustrating our profit mix by segment, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments collectively delivered 91% of operating income in the third quarter 2017 compared to 84% in the third quarter 2016. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $18 million or 7%. Research and development increased to $130 million or 17.4% of sales, a 130 basis point increase year-over-year. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused on our fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation segments where we see long-term growth opportunities. 
SG&A was up $5 million compared to prior year quarter, increased 30 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.7%. Our advertising expense was relatively flat to the prior year quarter as additional spend in outdoor segment was offset by decreases in all the other segments. 
Few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $457 million, relatively flat year-over-year. Inventory balance increased sequentially to $575 million to prepare for the fourth quarter and was higher year-over-year due to several new product launches in the third quarter 2017. 
During the third quarter 2017, we generated free cash flow of $153 million. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million and purchased approximately $11 million of company stock, about $1 million remaining for purchase through December 2017.
The effective tax rate was 20.8% at current-year quarter compared to 16.5% in the prior year quarter. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions with international tax initiatives and income mix by tax jurisdiction, partially offset by the release of income tax reserves in the third quarter 2017. We expect our full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 21.5%.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter consolidated revenue of $743 million, up 3% over the prior year. Outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness collectively increased 9% year-over-year and contributed 75% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.4%, and operating margin improved to 22.8%. GAAP EPS was $0.78, and pro forma EPS was $0.75 in the quarter. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to make a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. 
Beginning with the outdoor segment. Revenue grew 31% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong demand for wearables. Gross and operating margins expanded to 64% and 37%, respectively, while operating income grew 38% over the prior year. We experienced strong demand for the fenix 5 watch series and expect this trend to continue throughout the holiday quarter. 
In addition, we experienced solid growth of inReach devices and subscription services. We recently announced our entry into 2 new product categories with the introduction of Descent, our first wearable for the dive market, and the Impact bat sensor, our first product for the baseball market.
The Descent is a beautifully designed smart watch with integrated dive computer functions and electronic logs managed through Garmin Connect. The Impact bat sensor delivers instantaneous feedback on the device while coaches and players can see further details using the Impact mobile app. Looking forward, we remain focused on the wearable opportunity and expanding into new product categories. 
Turning next to aviation. We reported strong revenue growth of 16%, driven by growth in both OEM and aftermarket categories. Gross and operating margins came in at 73% and 27%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 12% over the prior year. We recently announced the TXi series of touchscreen flight displays that offer enhanced integration features and target a broad range of aftermarket aircraft from light signals -- singles to business jets. 
We also started shipping the GFC 600, our first aftermarket autopilot solution. These new products are welcome additions to our lineup and further expand addressable market opportunities. Looking forward, we are focused on maximizing ADS-B mandate opportunities and gaining share in the OEM market. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by growth in multiple product lines and led by strong demand for our fishfinders and chartplotter combos. Gross and operating margins were 58% and 24%, respectively. We recently completed the acquisition of Navionics, a leading worldwide provider of electronic marine content and mobile applications. Combining content from both Navionics and Garmin will result in best available breadth and depth of coverage for our marine customers. 
For the third consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of the Year. This award, along with 8 product of excellence awards, affirms our commitment to designing, manufacturing and selling industry-leading products for the marine market. Consistent with that commitment, we announced the 2018 lineup of marine electronics, which include updated echoMAP and STRIKER models with WiFi capability, enabling connected boating experiences. Looking forward, we are focused on product innovations and gaining share in the inland fishing category. 
Moving next to fitness. Revenue declined 12%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers and product introduction timing, partially offset by strong growth in our running product line. Gross margin improved to 58%, while operating margin decreased year-over-year to 20%. Our product lineup is very strong as we enter the holiday quarter. 
Recent product launches include the v√≠voactive 3 with wrist-based payments, the v√≠vomove HR analog watch with wrist heart rate and smart notifications and the ultraslim v√≠vosport activity tracker with built-in GPS and smart notifications. In addition, we launched our v√≠vofit jr. 2, featuring Disney, Star Wars and Marvel team bands and mobile app adventures. Looking forward, we're focused on areas of opportunity, particularly in the advanced wearable category. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue declined 12% due to the ongoing PND market contraction, partially offset by solid growth in OEM and niche product categories such as cameras, truck fleet and RV. Our global market share in the PND category remains very strong. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 44% and 8%, respectively. 
We recently launched Garmin Speak with Amazon Alexa, which is the first digital assistant with integrated turn-by-turn navigation. We also started shipping the eLog device in time for the upcoming electronic data logging mandate for truck operators. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to optimize profitability in the segment. 
Well, with 3 quarters of the year behind us, we're updating our projected revenue for the year to $3.07 billion, an increase of about 2% over 2016. Projected gross margin remains at approximately 57.5%, but we are raising our projected operating margin to approximately 21.5% for the full year. Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.90, assuming an updated pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 21.5%. 
Looking at guidance by segment. We've increased growth expectations for outdoor, aviation and auto by 200 to 300 basis points. Our outlook for marine is unchanged, while the outlook for fitness has been reduced slightly by 200 basis points. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details of our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $743 million for the third quarter, representing a 3% increase",603,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $743 million for the third quarter, representing a 3% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.4%, 220 basis point increase from the prior year, driven primarily by segment and product mix. Operating expense as percentage of sales was 35.5%, a 140 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $170 million, a 6% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 22.8%, a 70 basis point increase from the prior year as the increase in gross margin more than offset the increase in operating expenses. Our GAAP EPS was $0.78. Our pro forma EPS was $0.75, consistent with the prior year.
Next we'll look at our third quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 3% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. For the third quarter 2017, outdoor grew 31%, while aviation grew 16% and marine grew 10%. This growth was partially offset by the continued decline in the auto PND business and decline in our fitness segment, which was primarily due to significant decline in the basic activity tracker category. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness were up 9% compared to the prior year quarter.
Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contributed 75% of total revenue in the third quarter 2017 compared to 70% in the prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 19% to 25%, and aviation grew from 15% to 17%. You can see from the charts, illustrating our profit mix by segment, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments collectively delivered 91% of operating income in the third quarter 2017 compared to 84% in the third quarter 2016. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $18 million or 7%. Research and development increased to $130 million or 17.4% of sales, a 130 basis point increase year-over-year. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused on our fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation segments where we see long-term growth opportunities. 
SG&A was up $5 million compared to prior year quarter, increased 30 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.7%. Our advertising expense was relatively flat to the prior year quarter as additional spend in the outdoor segment was offset by decreases in all the other segments. 
Few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $457 million, relatively flat year-over-year. Inventory balance increased sequentially to $575 million to prepare for the fourth quarter and was higher year-over-year due to several new product launches at the end of third quarter 2017. 
During the third quarter 2017, we generated free cash flow of $153 million. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million and purchased approximately $11 million of company stock, about $1 million remaining for purchase through December 2017.
The effective tax rate was 20.8% at current-year quarter compared to 16.5% in the prior year quarter. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions with international tax initiatives and income mix by tax jurisdiction, partially offset by the release of income tax reserves in the third quarter 2017. We expect our full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 21.5%.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter consolidated revenue of $743 million, up 3% over the prior year. Outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness collectively increased 9% year-over-year and contributed 75% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.4%, and operating margin improved to 22.8%. GAAP EPS was $0.78, and pro forma EPS was $0.75 in the quarter. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to make a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. 
Beginning with the outdoor segment. Revenue grew 31% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong demand for wearables. Gross and operating margins expanded to 64% and 37%, respectively, while operating income grew 38% over the prior year. We experienced strong demand for the fenix 5 watch series and expect this trend to continue throughout the holiday quarter. 
In addition, we experienced solid growth of inReach devices and subscription services. We recently announced our entry into 2 new product categories with the introduction of Descent, our first wearable for the dive market, and the Impact bat sensor, our first product for the baseball market.
The Descent is a beautifully designed smart watch with integrated dive computer functions and electronic logs managed through Garmin Connect. The Impact bat sensor delivers instantaneous feedback on the device while coaches and players can see further details using the Impact mobile app. Looking forward, we remain focused on the wearable opportunity and expanding into new product categories. 
Turning next to aviation. We reported strong revenue growth of 16%, driven by growth in both OEM and aftermarket categories. Gross and operating margins came in at 73% and 27%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 12% over the prior year. We recently announced the TXi series of touchscreen flight displays that offer enhanced integration features and target a broad range of aftermarket aircraft from light signals -- singles to business jets. 
We also started shipping the GFC 600, our first aftermarket autopilot solution. These new products are welcome additions to our lineup and further expand addressable market opportunities. Looking forward, we are focused on maximizing ADS-B mandate opportunities and gaining share in the OEM market. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by growth in multiple product lines and led by strong demand for our fishfinders and chartplotter combos. Gross and operating margins were 58% and 24%, respectively. We recently completed the acquisition of Navionics, a leading worldwide provider of electronic marine content and mobile applications. Combining content from both Navionics and Garmin will result in best available breadth and depth of coverage for our marine customers. 
For the third consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of the Year. This award, along with 8 product of excellence awards, affirms our commitment to designing, manufacturing and selling industry-leading products for the marine market. Consistent with that commitment, we announced the 2018 lineup of marine electronics, which include updated echoMAP and STRIKER models with WiFi capability, enabling connected boating experiences. Looking forward, we are focused on product innovations and gaining share in the inland fishing category. 
Moving next to fitness. Revenue declined 12%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers and product introduction timing, partially offset by strong growth in our running product line. Gross margin improved to 58%, while operating margin decreased year-over-year to 20%. Our product lineup is very strong as we enter the holiday quarter. 
Recent product launches include the v√≠voactive 3 with wrist-based payments, the v√≠vomove HR analog watch with wrist heart rate and smart notifications and the ultraslim v√≠vosport activity tracker with built-in GPS and smart notifications. In addition, we launched our v√≠vofit jr. 2, featuring Disney, Star Wars and Marvel team bands and mobile app adventures. Looking forward, we're focused on areas of opportunity, particularly in the advanced wearable category. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue declined 12% due to the ongoing PND market contraction, partially offset by solid growth in OEM and niche product categories such as cameras, truck fleet and RV. Our global market share in the PND category remains very strong. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 44% and 8%, respectively. 
We recently launched Garmin Speak with Amazon Alexa, which is the first digital assistant with integrated turn-by-turn navigation. We also started shipping the eLog device in time for the upcoming electronic data logging mandate for truck operators. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to optimize profitability in the segment. 
Well, with 3 quarters of the year behind us, we're updating our projected revenue for the year to $3.07 billion, an increase of about 2% over 2016. Projected gross margin remains at approximately 57.5%, but we are raising our projected operating margin to approximately 21.5% for the full year. Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.90, assuming an updated pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 21.5%. 
Looking at guidance by segment. We've increased growth expectations for outdoor, aviation and auto by 200 to 300 basis points. Our outlook for marine is unchanged, while the outlook for fitness has been reduced slightly by 200 basis points. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details of our financial results. Doug?"
598655,539331059,1330176,"Garmin Ltd., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2017",2017-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $743 million for the third quarter, representing a 3% increase",603,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $743 million for the third quarter, representing a 3% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.4%, 220 basis point increase from the prior year, driven primarily by segment and product mix. Operating expense as percentage of sales was 35.5%, a 140 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $170 million, a 6% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 22.8%, a 70 basis point increase from the prior year as the increase in gross margin more than offset the increase in operating expenses. Our GAAP EPS was $0.78. Our pro forma EPS was $0.75, consistent with the prior year.
Next we'll look at our third quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 3% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. For the third quarter 2017, outdoor grew 31%, while aviation grew 16% and marine grew 10%. This growth was partially offset by the continued decline in the auto PND business and decline in our fitness segment, which was primarily due to significant decline in the basic activity tracker category. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness were up 9% compared to the prior year quarter.
Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contributed 75% of total revenue in the third quarter 2017 compared to 70% in the prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 19% to 25%, and aviation grew from 15% to 17%. You can see from the charts, illustrating our profit mix by segment, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments collectively delivered 91% of operating income in the third quarter 2017 compared to 84% in the third quarter 2016. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $18 million or 7%. Research and development increased to $130 million or 17.4% of sales, a 130 basis point increase year-over-year. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused on our fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation segments where we see long-term growth opportunities. 
SG&A was up $5 million compared to prior year quarter, increased 30 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.7%. Our advertising expense was relatively flat to the prior year quarter as additional spend in the outdoor segment was offset by decreases in all the other segments. 
Few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $457 million, relatively flat year-over-year. Inventory balance increased sequentially to $575 million to prepare for the fourth quarter and was higher year-over-year due to several new product launches at the end of third quarter 2017. 
During the third quarter 2017, we generated free cash flow of $153 million. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million and purchased approximately $11 million of company stock, about $1 million remaining for purchase through December 2017.
The effective tax rate was 20.8% at current-year quarter compared to 16.5% in the prior year quarter. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions with international tax initiatives and income mix by tax jurisdiction, partially offset by the release of income tax reserves in the third quarter 2017. We expect our full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 21.5%.
