Welcome to Humana's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. In a moment, Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Kane, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our first quarter 2017 results and our financial outlook for the full year. Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. Christopher Todoroff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, will be joining Bruce and Brian for the Q&A session. 
We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today. 
Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our first quarter 2017 earnings press release as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are also available on our Investor Relations site. 
Call participants should note that today's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. Management's explanation for the use of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release. 
Finally, any references to earnings per share, or EPS, made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share.

Also, thanks to many of you for participating in our Investor Day last week. In conjunction with that event, we preannounced our first quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $7.49 per diluted share or $2.75 on an adjusted basis and raised our expectations for the full year GAAP EPS to at least $16.91, with full year adjusted EPS projected to be at least $11.10. 
This morning, we reaffirmed that increased guidance and provided the full detail behind our first quarter 2017 results. While Brian will review the financials in more detail, I want to emphasize that these results reflect the commitment and effort of the entire Humana team to ensuring our integrated care delivery strategy is executed with focus and is flexible and adaptable to local market needs. 
At our recent Investor Day, we spoke of our principles of focus, integration and flexibility, which are not new to us. By consistently applying these principles in our business practices, we've been able to advance our strategy even during the extended period of uncertainty. 
I'll begin with focus. Our strategy is more focused than ever as we concentrate on those lines of business. Our integrated care delivery model adds the most value. Second, we are focusing on the most effective way to extend our touch points with our members, including health care experiences outside of the care of physicians and other institutions. Third, we are continuing to focus on strengthening our operating platform to optimize its productivity and dependability. 
Integration is another area of emphasis and includes integrating more deeply with our providers to evolve to a more holistic care model; integrating both the lifestyles and health care aspects of a member's health; and integrating technology and processes to remove friction points in the health care delivery system to improve the experience for our members and providers. 
Health care is a local experience, that's why our strategy and capabilities have been developed to be flexible and adaptable to local market conditions. This means adjusting the care platform based on specific market dynamics, related product offerings and the health conditions of our members. 
Our historical success and market differentiation are grounded in our ability to integrate our health plans and Healthcare Service businesses through leveraging our data analytics, clinical programs and consumer-focused platform to drive health engagement and incentivize managing health holistically. By helping our members manage their conditions and by assisting them in slowing disease progression, we are seeing measurable improvement in several of our communities of members experiencing more healthy days. We believe the combination of effective clinical programs, a productive platform and an engaging experience for members and providers leads to an affordable product, which ultimately drives profitable membership growth and growth in our Healthcare Services businesses. All of this, combined, help to improve the productivity of our platform and allow for a disciplined use of capital. 
In closing, we believe in the strength of our company going forward and its ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders over the long term. Our first quarter results strongly reinforce this strength. We believe that concentrating on what we do best, helping seniors with chronic conditions, solidly positions us to drive multiyear quality Medicare Advantage growth while leveraging our Healthcare Service businesses to reduce cost and improve the clinical outcomes of our Medicare Advantage members. Through integrating our health plans and Healthcare Service businesses more deeply and investing in clinical capabilities and physician partnerships, we've already made great progress improving outcomes, reducing costs and enhancing the member experience. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

My remarks today will also be relatively brief given our Investor Day last week, allowing more time for analysts' questions.

My remarks today will also be relatively brief given our Investor Day last week, allowing more time for analysts' questions. As Bruce mentioned, the first quarter of 2017 produced solid results, ahead of our prior expectations. And consequently, we raised our adjusted EPS guidance to at least $11.10 and our full year Retail pretax target by $50 million. 
We also expect our quarterly EPS progression to reflect just under 30% of the full year number in each of the second and third quarters, with the fourth quarter expected to reflect the usual cost increases associated with the open enrollment season. 
I will now provide more details about each of our segment's operating performance. Led by individual Medicare Advantage, our Retail segment outperformed our initial estimates, largely due to better-than-anticipated prior period development. Early indicators also suggest that medical cost utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running well relative to our pricing expectations. Initial indications of Medicare premium levels are also encouraging. 
Finally, we have lowered our expectations around 2017 individual MA membership growth to 15,000 to 25,000 from 30,000 to 40,000, while we are increasing group MA membership by 10,000 members to 80,000 to 90,000. We do not expect these changes to impact overall Medicare profitability. 
With regard to our Medicare Advantage bids for the 2018 plan year, our organization is working diligently on our bid submissions, which are due in early June. With the overhang associated with the terminated transaction now behind us, we believe we will be positioned for stronger growth next year while we maintain pricing discipline. 
We continue to receive a number of questions about the assumptions that will be reflected in our bids. For competitive reasons, we won't be specific on these, but I will reiterate 3 of the key points we shared at our Investor Day last week. 
First, we are incorporating our recent 2017 outperformance into our pricing and will reflect any new information as it becomes available in advance of the bid submissions. Second, we are assuming the nondeductible health insurance fee, also known as the HIF, resumes in 2018 as is scheduled under current law. This will result in a reduction of benefits and our increases in premiums for our members, which could create some member dislocation given the importance of stable premiums and benefits to member retention and new sales. And third, our bids will reflect the outcome of our ongoing Stars bonus efforts with CMS, and we will update The Street on our progress in this regard during our second quarter conference call. 
Turning to our other businesses. Our group and specialty segment is having another good year. Our performance is running in line with expectations, with the focus on smaller employers paying dividends as it gives the organization focus as well as the opportunity to add meaningful value for our customers. 
Our Healthcare Services segment also continues to deliver profits, steady cash flow to the parent, and importantly, clinical excellence in trend vendors for our insurance lines. You will note that we have taken down intersegment revenue guidance by approximately $1 billion for the year. 
Our Humana At Home optimization continues to pace and is proceeding a little faster than we had expected. We expect this optimization to continue into 2018. Additionally, we are seeing lower-than-expected pharmacy volumes, which reflect lower health plan drug utilization than we had previously anticipated. This, of course, is a positive development for overall Humana, though it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions. If these trends continue, we expect that the increase in health plan pretax income would more than offset any reduction in pharmacy profits. Though it's also important to note that any utilization reductions in the health plan would be meaningfully offset by lower member cost share and CMS reinsurance payments. 
I will now make some comments regarding our long-term EPS targets that we discussed during our Investor Day last week. There have been some questions as to how we define low to mid-teens EPS growth. To provide more clarity around -- regarding our intentions, our long-term annual EPS target is 11% to 15%, reflecting our conviction around our strategy and the results it can deliver. 
As we discussed last week, our annual results will vary, sometimes performing above this range as in 2016, other times falling within the range. And depending on the funding environment, competitive landscape and any prior year overperformance, there may be years in which EPS growth is below that range. Given our integrated model, we have multiple levers we can pull to achieve these long-term results, which will also vary year to year. These levers include among others: Membership and PMPM premium growth; MA margin changes, depending where the prior year finished in terms of our 4.5% to 5% individual MA pretax margin target; health care services pretax growth in excess of insurance membership growth to drive additional margin; and of course, capital return and M&A. 
Enhancing organizational productivity will also be a prime focus of the company to achieve these results while also increasing operational consistency. 
Finally, before opening the call for questions, I would like to share with you the news that Regina Nethery, our Vice President of Investor Relations, has decided to retire at the end of this month after nearly 22 years with Humana. It is impossible to overstate Regina's contributions to Humana over her career. She has not only been consistently recognized as the Investor Relations leader in our industry, but she has also been a critical partner to Bruce and me as well as to our predecessors, helping all of us navigate the tremendous change, both Humana and the industry, have undergone over her distinguished career. Her wise counsel and impeccable market judgment have guided us through both good times and bad, demonstrating exemplary leadership and representing the very best of Humana. We can't thank her enough for all that she has done for the company. Regina, you'll be greatly missed, and we wish you the very best. 
With Regina's retirement, Amy Smith will lead Investor Relations. Amy is a CPA who has been at Humana for nearly 14 years, serving most of that time in progressively expanding leadership roles on the financial reporting team, driving SEC reporting and development of external messaging on key financial measurements for our earnings releases. With this expertise, she joined the Investor Relations team in February 2017 and met many of you at our Investor Day last week. Bruce and I look forward to partnering with Amy in her new capacity, and she's very excited about the opportunity of working with all of you.

There's a very steep claims curve in the individual business as the year progresses given the benefit design of the product. And so the MER and the profitability in the first quarter is within our expectations. We do still expect to lose approximately $45 million overall for our ACA and our non-ACA combined individual products. If you compare versus last year, which you may be looking at, the losses were significantly higher than what we expect this year. And as you know, we exited all of our exchange products and meaningfully pared back our on-exchange products, particularly those areas where we were losing a great deal of money. And so that really explains the difference year-over-year. But the seasonality is real in this product, and that's what's explaining that low MER this quarter."

But that being said, there is a whole host of effort right now of deepening our relationships with the brokers. I mean, I noticed just in the last 6 weeks, we've had a number of both 1-on-1 meetings and group meetings with our distribution channels. And basically saying we're back in action and we have some great products and the Humana that you knew 2 years ago is even better than ever.

And it's really optimization of that, that has allowed us to get -- to leverage the great associates that we have in that area. And I would attribute that to both technology and just continuing to advance the care model. So in result, what that does is it allows us to do more with less and in result, lower the operating costs for Humana At One -- I'm sorry, it's Humana At Home. And that then allows us to pass those savings on to our Retail division that ultimately also helps in the ability to price the product in the marketplace.

At our Investor Day, we suggested working with other outside independent groups that call it 6%, plus or minus, growth rate year-over-year with something that we could expect. The variance I would agree that the HIF had probably a less of an impact this year than perhaps one would have thought on overall market growth, and that might suggest that next year, it also, by coming back, do not have as much of an impact on market growth. But it's too early to tell. I mean, the thing that worries us about the HIF a little bit is that it's a big number. And when you go the other way and reduce benefits, that could have an impact on that overall growth rate. But it's really, frankly, hard to tell and hard to model human behavior and how they respond to the reduction in benefits and increased premiums. There are also a number of demographics that vary year to year just in terms of the number of people who are aging into Medicare, and so that's going to vary. It's geographically based as well. And so again, it's very hard to say whether that 6% is going to hold next year and what the variance around that maybe. But that's broadly the number that we're thinking about."

There'll be years where we're below our long-term -- we'll be below our long-term individual MA range, and sometimes barely above that pretax range. And so that's where that lever comes in depending on where you are exiting the prior year. The second element relates to our Healthcare Services franchise. We believe that over time, and there are going to the again years where it's faster and years where it's slower. But there are opportunities to further engage with our members and drive pretax health care services growth faster than revenue growth. And that ultimately leads to more margin for the enterprise.

Welcome to Humana's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. In a moment, Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Kane, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our first quarter 2017 results and our financial outlook for the full year. Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. Christopher Todoroff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, will be joining Bruce and Brian for the Q&A session. 
We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today. 
Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our first quarter 2017 earnings press release as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are also available on our Investor Relations site. 
Call participants should note that today's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. Management's explanation for the use of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release.  Finally, any references to earnings per share, or EPS, made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share.

Also, thanks to many of you for participating in our Investor Day last week. In conjunction with that event, we preannounced our first quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $7.49 per diluted share or $2.75 on an adjusted basis and raised our expectations for the full year GAAP EPS to at least $16.91, with full year adjusted EPS projected to be at least $11.10. 
This morning, we reaffirmed that increased guidance and provided the full detail behind our first quarter 2017 results. While Brian will review the financials in more detail, I want to emphasize that these results reflect the commitment and effort of the entire Humana team to ensuring our integrated care delivery strategy is executed with focus and is flexible and adaptable to local market needs. 
At our recent Investor Day, we spoke of our principles of focus, integration and flexibility, which are not new to us. By consistently applying these principles in our business practices, we've been able to advance our strategy even during the extended period of uncertainty. 
I'll begin with focus. Our strategy is more focused than ever as we concentrate on those lines of business, where our integrated care delivery model adds the most value. Second, we are focusing on the most effective way to extend our touch points with our members, including health care experiences outside of the care of physicians and other institutions. Third, we are continuing to focus on strengthening our operating platform to optimize its productivity and dependability. 
Integration is another area of emphasis and includes: integrating more deeply with our providers to evolve to a more holistic care model; integrating both the lifestyles and health care aspects of a member's health; and integrating technology and processes to remove friction points in the health care delivery system to improve the experience for our members and providers. 
Health care is a local experience. That's why our strategy and capabilities have been developed to be flexible and adaptable to local market conditions. This means adjusting the care platform based on specific market dynamics, related product offerings and the health conditions of our members. 
Our historical success and market differentiation are grounded in our ability to integrate our health plans and Healthcare Service businesses through leveraging our data analytics, clinical programs and consumer-focused platform to drive health engagement and incentivize managing health holistically. By helping our members manage their conditions and by assisting them in slowing disease progression, we are seeing measurable improvement in several of our communities of members experiencing more healthy days. We believe the combination of effective clinical programs, a productive platform and an engaging experience for members and providers leads to an affordable product, which ultimately drives profitable membership growth and growth in our Healthcare Services businesses. All of this combined help to improve the productivity of our platform and allow for a disciplined use of capital. 
In closing, we believe in the strength of our company going forward and its ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders over the long term. Our first quarter results strongly reinforce this strength. We believe that concentrating on what we do best, helping seniors with chronic conditions, solidly positions us to drive multiyear quality Medicare Advantage growth while leveraging our Healthcare Service businesses to reduce costs and improve the clinical outcomes of our Medicare Advantage members. Through integrating our health plans and Healthcare Service businesses more deeply and investing in clinical capabilities and physician partnerships, we've already made great progress improving outcomes, reducing costs and enhancing the member experience. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

My remarks today will also be relatively brief given our Investor Day last week, allowing more time for analysts' questions. As Bruce mentioned, the first quarter of 2017 produced solid results ahead of our prior expectations. And consequently, we raised our adjusted EPS guidance to at least $11.10 and our full year Retail pretax target by $50 million. We also expect our quarterly EPS progression to reflect just under 30% of the full year number in each of the second and third quarters, with the fourth quarter expected to reflect the usual cost increases associated with the open enrollment season. 
I will now provide more details about each of our segment's operating performance. Led by individual Medicare Advantage, our Retail segment outperformed our initial estimates, largely due to better-than-anticipated prior period development. Early indicators also suggest that medical cost utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running well relative to our pricing expectations. Initial indications of Medicare premium levels are also encouraging. 
Finally, we have lowered our expectations around 2017 individual MA membership growth to 15,000 to 25,000 from 30,000 to 40,000, while we are increasing group MA membership by 10,000 members to 80,000 to 90,000. We do not expect these changes to impact overall Medicare profitability. 
With regard to our Medicare Advantage bids for the 2018 plan year, our organization is working diligently on our bid submissions, which are due in early June. With the overhang associated with the terminated transaction now behind us, we believe we will be positioned for stronger growth next year while we maintain pricing discipline. We continue to receive a number of questions about the assumptions that will be reflected in our bids. For competitive reasons, we won't be specific on these, but I will reiterate 3 of the key points we shared at our Investor Day last week. 
First, we are incorporating our recent 2017 outperformance into our pricing and will reflect any new information as it becomes available in advance of the bid submissions. Second, we are assuming the nondeductible health insurance fee, also known as the HIF, resumes in 2018 as is scheduled under current law. This will result in a reduction of benefits and our increases in premiums for our members, which could create some member dislocation, given the importance of stable premiums and benefits to member retention and new sales. And third, our bids will reflect the outcome of our ongoing Stars bonus efforts with CMS, and we will update The Street on our progress in this regard during our second quarter conference call. 
Turning to our other businesses. Our Group and Specialty segment is having another good year. Our performance is running in line with expectations, with the focus on smaller employers paying dividends as it gives the organization focus as well as the opportunity to add meaningful value for our customers. 
Our Healthcare Services segment also continues to deliver profits, steady cash flow to the parent and importantly, clinical excellence in trend vendors for our insurance lines. You will note that we have taken down intersegment revenue guidance by approximately $1 billion for the year. Our Humana At Home optimization continues to pace and is proceeding a little faster than we had expected. We expect this optimization to continue into 2018. 
Additionally, we are seeing lower-than-expected pharmacy volumes, which reflect lower health plan drug utilization than we had previously anticipated. This, of course, is a positive development for overall Humana, though it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions. If these trends continue, we expect that the increase in health plan pretax income would more than offset any reduction in pharmacy profits. Though it's also important to note that any utilization reductions in the health plan would be meaningfully offset by lower member cost share and CMS reinsurance payments. 
I will now make some comments regarding our long-term EPS targets that we discussed during our Investor Day last week. There have been some questions as to how we define low to mid-teens EPS growth. To provide more clarity around -- regarding our intentions, our long-term annual EPS target is 11% to 15%, reflecting our conviction around our strategy and the results it can deliver. 
As we discussed last week, our annual results will vary, sometimes performing above this range as in 2016, other times falling within the range. And depending on the funding environment, competitive landscape and any prior year overperformance, there may be years in which EPS growth is below that range. Given our integrated model, we have multiple levers we can pull to achieve these long-term results, which will also vary year to year. These levers include among others: membership and PMPM premium growth; MA margin changes, depending where the prior year finished in terms of our 4.5% to 5% individual MA pretax margin target; Healthcare Services pretax growth in excess of insurance membership growth to drive additional margin; and of course, capital return and M&A. Enhancing organizational productivity will also be a prime focus of the company to achieve these results while also increasing operational consistency. 
Finally, before opening the call for questions, I would like to share with you the news that Regina Nethery, our Vice President of Investor Relations, has decided to retire at the end of this month after nearly 22 years with Humana. It is impossible to overstate Regina's contributions to Humana over her career. She has not only been consistently recognized as the Investor Relations leader in our industry, but she has also been a critical partner to Bruce and me as well as to our predecessors, helping all of us navigate the tremendous change, both Humana and the industry have undergone over her distinguished career. Her wise counsel and impeccable market judgment have guided us through both good times and bad, demonstrating exemplary leadership and representing the very best of Humana. We can't thank her enough for all that she has done for the company. Regina, you'll be greatly missed, and we wish you the very best. 
With Regina's retirement, Amy Smith will lead Investor Relations. Amy is a CPA who has been at Humana for nearly 14 years, serving most of that time in progressively expanding leadership roles on the financial reporting team, driving SEC reporting and development of external messaging on key financial measurements for our earnings releases. With this expertise, she joined the Investor Relations team in February 2017 and met many of you at our Investor Day last week. Bruce and I look forward to partnering with Amy in her new capacity, and she is very excited about the opportunity of working with all of you. 
With that, we'll open up the lines for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller."

And so the MER and the profitability in the first quarter is within our expectations. We do still expect to lose approximately $45 million overall for our ACA and our non-ACA combined individual products. If you compare versus last year, which you may be looking at, the losses were significantly higher than what we expect this year. And as you know, we exited all of our off-exchange products and meaningfully pared back our on-exchange products, particularly those areas where we were losing a great deal of money. And so that really explains the difference year-over-year. But the seasonality is real in this product, and that's what's explaining that low MER this quarter."

And then in some markets where we were needing to sell membership, there is a lot of push on -- we were selling membership and exiting, which also created some confusion in the marketplace. But that being said, there is a whole host of effort right now of deepening our relationships with the brokers. I mean, I know just in the last 6 weeks, we have had a number of both 1-on-1 meetings and group meetings with our distribution channels. And basically saying we're back in action and we have some great products and the Humana that you knew 2 years ago is even better than ever. So I just think our continued touching with them will be important. We are very competitive on the compensation side. I think this year, we also will continue to support them in marketing actions and other things to help their book of business. And so we feel good about it, and we feel that the confusion in the marketplace over the last few years that some brokers used to our disadvantage is gone.

And it's really optimization of that, that has allowed us to get -- to leverage the great associates that we have in that area. And I would attribute that to both technology and just continuing to advance the care model. So in result, what that does is it allows us to do more with less and in result, lower the operating costs for Humana At One -- I'm sorry, at Humana At Home. And that then allows us to pass those savings on to our Retail division that ultimately also helps in the ability to price the product in the marketplace.

At our Investor Day, we suggested working with other outside independent groups that call a 6%, plus or minus, growth rate year-over-year was something that we could expect. The variance, I would agree that the HIF had probably a less of an impact this year than perhaps one would have thought on overall market growth. And that might suggest that next year, it also, by coming back, may not have as much of an impact on market growth. But it's too early to tell. I mean, the thing that worries us about the HIF a little bit is that it's a big number. And when you go the other way and reduce benefits, that could have an impact on that overall growth rate. But it's really, frankly, hard to tell and hard to model human behavior and how they respond to the reduction in benefits and increased premiums. There are also a number of demographics that vary year to year just in terms of the number of people who are aging into Medicare, and so that's going to vary. It's geographically based as well. And so, again, it's very hard to say whether that 6% is going to hold next year and what the variance around that may be. But that's broadly the number that we're thinking about."

We believe that over time, and there are going to the, again, years where it's faster and years where it's slower, but there are opportunities to further engage with our members and drive pretax Healthcare Services growth faster than revenue growth.

Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts. Christopher Todoroff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, will be joining Bruce and Brian for the Q&A session. 
We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today. 
Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our first quarter 2017 earnings press release as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are also available on our Investor Relations site. 
Call participants should note that today's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. Management's explanation for the use of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release.  Finally, any references to earnings per share, or EPS, made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share.

Also, thanks to many of you for participating in our Investor Day last week. In conjunction with that event, we preannounced our first quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $7.49 per diluted share or $2.75 on an adjusted basis and raised our expectations for the full year GAAP EPS to at least $16.91, with full year adjusted EPS projected to be at least $11.10. 
This morning, we reaffirmed that increased guidance and provided the full detail behind our first quarter 2017 results. While Brian will review the financials in more detail, I want to emphasize that these results reflect the commitment and effort of the entire Humana team to ensuring our integrated care delivery strategy is executed with focus and is flexible and adaptable to local market needs. 
At our recent Investor Day, we spoke of our principles of focus, integration and flexibility, which are not new to us. By consistently applying these principles in our business practices, we've been able to advance our strategy even during the extended period of uncertainty. 
I'll begin with focus. Our strategy is more focused than ever as we concentrate on those lines of business, where our integrated care delivery model adds the most value. Second, we are focusing on the most effective way to extend our touch points with our members, including health care experiences outside of the care of physicians and other institutions. Third, we are continuing to focus on strengthening our operating platform to optimize its productivity and dependability. 
Integration is another area of emphasis and includes: integrating more deeply with our providers to evolve to a more holistic care model; integrating both the lifestyles and health care aspects of a member's health; and integrating technology and processes to remove friction points in the health care delivery system to improve the experience for our members and providers. 
Health care is a local experience. That's why our strategy and capabilities have been developed to be flexible and adaptable to local market conditions. This means adjusting the care platform based on specific market dynamics, related product offerings and the health conditions of our members. 
Our historical success and market differentiation are grounded in our ability to integrate our health plans and Healthcare Service businesses through leveraging our data analytics, clinical programs and consumer-focused platform to drive health engagement and incentivize managing health holistically. By helping our members manage their conditions and by assisting them in slowing disease progression, we are seeing measurable improvement in several of our communities of members experiencing more healthy days. We believe the combination of effective clinical programs, a productive platform and an engaging experience for members and providers leads to an affordable product, which ultimately drives profitable membership growth and growth in our Healthcare Services businesses. All of this combined help to improve the productivity of our platform and allow for a disciplined use of capital. 
In closing, we believe in the strength of our company going forward and its ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders over the long term. Our first quarter results strongly reinforce this strength. We believe that concentrating on what we do best, helping seniors with chronic conditions, solidly positions us to drive multiyear quality Medicare Advantage growth while leveraging our Healthcare Service businesses to reduce costs and improve the clinical outcomes of our Medicare Advantage members. Through integrating our health plans and Healthcare Service businesses more deeply and investing in clinical capabilities and physician partnerships, we've already made great progress improving outcomes, reducing costs and enhancing the member experience. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

My remarks today will also be relatively brief given our Investor Day last week, allowing more time for analysts' questions. As Bruce mentioned, the first quarter of 2017 produced solid results ahead of our prior expectations. And consequently, we raised our adjusted EPS guidance to at least $11.10 and our full year Retail pretax target by $50 million. We also expect our quarterly EPS progression to reflect just under 30% of the full year number in each of the second and third quarters, with the fourth quarter expected to reflect the usual cost increases associated with the open enrollment season. 
I will now provide more details about each of our segment's operating performance. Led by individual Medicare Advantage, our Retail segment outperformed our initial estimates, largely due to better-than-anticipated prior period development. Early indicators also suggest that medical cost utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running well relative to our pricing expectations. Initial indications of Medicare premium levels are also encouraging. 
Finally, we have lowered our expectations around 2017 individual MA membership growth to 15,000 to 25,000 from 30,000 to 40,000, while we are increasing group MA membership by 10,000 members to 80,000 to 90,000. We do not expect these changes to impact overall Medicare profitability. 
With regard to our Medicare Advantage bids for the 2018 plan year, our organization is working diligently on our bid submissions, which are due in early June. With the overhang associated with the terminated transaction now behind us, we believe we will be positioned for stronger growth next year while we maintain pricing discipline. We continue to receive a number of questions about the assumptions that will be reflected in our bids. For competitive reasons, we won't be specific on these, but I will reiterate 3 of the key points we shared at our Investor Day last week. 
First, we are incorporating our recent 2017 outperformance into our pricing and will reflect any new information as it becomes available in advance of the bid submissions. Second, we are assuming the nondeductible health insurance fee, also known as the HIF, resumes in 2018 as is scheduled under current law. This will result in a reduction of benefits and our increases in premiums for our members, which could create some member dislocation, given the importance of stable premiums and benefits to member retention and new sales. And third, our bids will reflect the outcome of our ongoing Stars bonus efforts with CMS, and we will update The Street on our progress in this regard during our second quarter conference call. 
Turning to our other businesses. Our Group and Specialty segment is having another good year. Our performance is running in line with expectations, with the focus on smaller employers paying dividends as it gives the organization focus as well as the opportunity to add meaningful value for our customers. 
Our Healthcare Services segment also continues to deliver profits, steady cash flow to the parent and importantly, clinical excellence in trend vendors for our insurance lines. You will note that we have taken down intersegment revenue guidance by approximately $1 billion for the year. Our Humana At Home optimization continues to pace and is proceeding a little faster than we had expected. We expect this optimization to continue into 2018. 
Additionally, we are seeing lower-than-expected pharmacy volumes, which reflect lower health plan drug utilization than we had previously anticipated. This, of course, is a positive development for overall Humana, though it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions. If these trends continue, we expect that the increase in health plan pretax income would more than offset any reduction in pharmacy profits. Though it's also important to note that any utilization reductions in the health plan would be meaningfully offset by lower member cost share and CMS reinsurance payments. 
I will now make some comments regarding our long-term EPS targets that we discussed during our Investor Day last week. There have been some questions as to how we define low to mid-teens EPS growth. To provide more clarity around -- regarding our intentions, our long-term annual EPS target is 11% to 15%, reflecting our conviction around our strategy and the results it can deliver. 
As we discussed last week, our annual results will vary, sometimes performing above this range as in 2016, other times falling within the range. And depending on the funding environment, competitive landscape and any prior year over-performance, there may be years in which EPS growth is below that range. Given our integrated model, we have multiple levers we can pull to achieve these long-term results, which will also vary year to year. These levers include among others: membership and PMPM premium growth; MA margin changes, depending where the prior year finished in terms of our 4.5% to 5% individual MA pretax margin target; Healthcare Services pretax growth in excess of insurance membership growth to drive additional margin; and of course, capital return and M&A. Enhancing organizational productivity will also be a prime focus of the company to achieve these results while also increasing operational consistency. 
Finally, before opening the call for questions, I would like to share with you the news that Regina Nethery, our Vice President of Investor Relations, has decided to retire at the end of this month after nearly 22 years with Humana. It is impossible to overstate Regina's contributions to Humana over her career. She has not only been consistently recognized as the Investor Relations leader in our industry, but she has also been a critical partner to Bruce and me as well as to our predecessors, helping all of us navigate the tremendous change, both Humana and the industry have undergone over her distinguished career. Her wise counsel and impeccable market judgment have guided us through both good times and bad, demonstrating exemplary leadership and representing the very best of Humana. We can't thank her enough for all that she has done for the company. Regina, you'll be greatly missed, and we wish you the very best. 
With Regina's retirement, Amy Smith will lead Investor Relations. Amy is a CPA who has been at Humana for nearly 14 years, serving most of that time in progressively expanding leadership roles on the financial reporting team, driving SEC reporting and development of external messaging on key financial measurements for our earnings releases. With this expertise, she joined the Investor Relations team in February 2017 and met many of you at our Investor Day last week. Bruce and I look forward to partnering with Amy in her new capacity, and she is very excited about the opportunity of working with all of you.

There's a very steep claims curve in the individual business as the year progresses, given the benefit design of the product. And so the MER and the profitability in the first quarter is within our expectations. We do still expect to lose approximately $45 million overall for our ACA and our non-ACA combined individual products. If you compare versus last year, which you may be looking at, the losses were significantly higher than what we expect this year. And as you know, we exited all of our off-exchange products and meaningfully pared back our on-exchange products, particularly those areas where we were losing a great deal of money. And so that really explains the difference year-over-year. But the seasonality is real in this product, and that's what's explaining that low MER this quarter."

But that being said, there is a whole host of effort right now of deepening our relationships with the brokers.

And basically saying we're back in action and we have some great products and the Humana that you knew 2 years ago is even better than ever.

And it's really optimization of that, that has allowed us to get -- to leverage the great associates that we have in that area. And I would attribute that to both technology and just continuing to advance the care model. So in result, what that does is it allows us to do more with less and in result, lower the operating costs for Humana At One -- I'm sorry, at Humana At Home. And that then allows us to pass those savings on to our Retail division that ultimately also helps in the ability to price the product in the marketplace.

And I think it's going to be the combination of both efforts we're doing in those areas. And as Brian said, we really don't want to share what we're doing on the plan design today as a result of the competitive positioning of the product and the period of time we're in. So we're very optimistic about what we're doing. I know, Peter, you're looking for details, but I'm not going to provide those to you as a result of where we are in the process. But I think we'll do better next year. But I do think the plan design is an important part of that going forward."

At our Investor Day, we suggested working with other outside independent groups that call it a 6%, plus or minus, growth rate year-over-year was something that we could expect. The variance, I would agree that the HIF had probably a less of an impact this year than perhaps one would have thought on overall market growth. And that might suggest that next year, it also, by coming back, may not have as much of an impact on market growth. But it's too early to tell. I mean, the thing that worries us about the HIF a little bit is that it's a big number. And when you go the other way and reduce benefits, that could have an impact on that overall growth rate. But it's really, frankly, hard to tell and hard to model human behavior and how they respond to the reduction in benefits and increased premiums. There are also a number of demographics that vary year to year just in terms of the number of people who are aging into Medicare, and so that's going to vary. It's geographically based as well. And so, again, it's very hard to say whether that 6% is going to hold next year and what the variance around that may be. But that's broadly the number that we're thinking about."

We believe that over time, and there are going to the, again, years where it's faster and years where it's slower, but there are opportunities to further engage with our members and drive pretax Healthcare Services growth faster than revenue growth.

Christopher Todoroff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, will be joining Bruce and Brian for the Q&A session. 
We encourage the investing public and media to listen to both management's prepared remarks and the related Q&A with analysts. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana's website, humana.com, later today. 
Before we begin our discussion, I need to advise call participants of our cautionary statement. Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our first quarter 2017 earnings press release as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's press release, our historical financial news releases and our filings with the SEC are also available on our Investor Relations site.

Also, thanks to many of you for participating in our Investor Day last week. In conjunction with that event, we preannounced our first quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $7.49 per diluted share or $2.75 on an adjusted basis and raised our expectations for the full year GAAP EPS to at least $16.91, with full year adjusted EPS projected to be at least $11.10. 
This morning, we reaffirmed that increased guidance and provided the full detail behind our first quarter 2017 results. While Brian will review the financials in more detail, I want to emphasize that these results reflect the commitment and effort of the entire Humana team to ensuring our integrated care delivery strategy is executed with focus and is flexible and adaptable to local market needs. 
At our recent Investor Day, we spoke of our principles of focus, integration and flexibility, which are not new to us. By consistently applying these principles in our business practices, we've been able to advance our strategy even during the extended period of uncertainty. 
I'll begin with focus. Our strategy is more focused than ever as we concentrate on those lines of business, where our integrated care delivery model adds the most value. Second, we are focusing on the most effective way to extend our touch points with our members, including health care experiences outside of the care of physicians and other institutions. Third, we are continuing to focus on strengthening our operating platform to optimize its productivity and dependability. 
Integration is another area of emphasis and includes: integrating more deeply with our providers to evolve to a more holistic care model; integrating both the lifestyles and health care aspects of a member's health; and integrating technology and processes to remove friction points in the health care delivery system to improve the experience for our members and providers. 
Health care is a local experience. That's why our strategy and capabilities have been developed to be flexible and adaptable to local market conditions. This means adjusting the care platform based on specific market dynamics, related product offerings and the health conditions of our members. 
Our historical success and market differentiation are grounded in our ability to integrate our health plans and Healthcare Service businesses through leveraging our data analytics, clinical programs and consumer-focused platform to drive health engagement and incentivize managing health holistically. By helping our members manage their conditions and by assisting them in slowing disease progression, we are seeing measurable improvement in several of our communities of members experiencing more healthy days. We believe the combination of effective clinical programs, a productive platform and an engaging experience for members and providers leads to an affordable product, which ultimately drives profitable membership growth and growth in our Healthcare Services businesses. All of this combined help to improve the productivity of our platform and allow for a disciplined use of capital. 
In closing, we believe in the strength of our company going forward and its ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders over the long term. Our first quarter results strongly reinforce this strength. We believe that concentrating on what we do best, helping seniors with chronic conditions, solidly positions us to drive multiyear quality Medicare Advantage growth while leveraging our Healthcare Service businesses to reduce costs and improve the clinical outcomes of our Medicare Advantage members. Through integrating our health plans and Healthcare Service businesses more deeply and investing in clinical capabilities and physician partnerships, we've already made great progress improving outcomes, reducing costs and enhancing the member experience. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

My remarks today will also be relatively brief given our Investor Day last week, allowing more time for analysts' questions. As Bruce mentioned, the first quarter of 2017 produced solid results ahead of our prior expectations. And consequently, we raised our adjusted EPS guidance to at least $11.10 and our full year Retail pretax target by $50 million. We also expect our quarterly EPS progression to reflect just under 30% of the full year number in each of the second and third quarters, with the fourth quarter expected to reflect the usual cost increases associated with the open enrollment season. 
I will now provide more details about each of our segment's operating performance. Led by individual Medicare Advantage, our Retail segment outperformed our initial estimates, largely due to better-than-anticipated prior period development. Early indicators also suggest that medical cost utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running well relative to our pricing expectations. Initial indications of Medicare premium levels are also encouraging. 
Finally, we have lowered our expectations around 2017 individual MA membership growth to 15,000 to 25,000 from 30,000 to 40,000, while we are increasing group MA membership by 10,000 members to 80,000 to 90,000. We do not expect these changes to impact overall Medicare profitability. 
With regard to our Medicare Advantage bids for the 2018 plan year, our organization is working diligently on our bid submissions, which are due in early June. With the overhang associated with the terminated transaction now behind us, we believe we will be positioned for stronger growth next year while we maintain pricing discipline. We continue to receive a number of questions about the assumptions that will be reflected in our bids. For competitive reasons, we won't be specific on these, but I will reiterate 3 of the key points we shared at our Investor Day last week. 
First, we are incorporating our recent 2017 outperformance into our pricing and will reflect any new information as it becomes available in advance of the bid submissions. Second, we are assuming the nondeductible health insurance fee, also known as the HIF, resumes in 2018 as is scheduled under current law. This will result in a reduction of benefits and our increases in premiums for our members, which could create some member dislocation, given the importance of stable premiums and benefits to member retention and new sales. And third, our bids will reflect the outcome of our ongoing Stars bonus efforts with CMS, and we will update The Street on our progress in this regard during our second quarter conference call. 
Turning to our other businesses. Our Group and Specialty segment is having another good year. Our performance is running in line with expectations, with the focus on smaller employers paying dividends as it gives the organization focus as well as the opportunity to add meaningful value for our customers. 
Our Healthcare Services segment also continues to deliver profits, steady cash flow to the parent and importantly, clinical excellence in trend vendors for our insurance lines. You will note that we have taken down intersegment revenue guidance by approximately $1 billion for the year. Our Humana At Home optimization continues to pace and is proceeding a little faster than we had expected. We expect this optimization to continue into 2018. 
Additionally, we are seeing lower-than-expected pharmacy volumes, which reflect lower health plan drug utilization than we had previously anticipated. This, of course, is a positive development for overall Humana, though it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions. If these trends continue, we expect that the increase in health plan pretax income would more than offset any reduction in pharmacy profits. Though it's also important to note that any utilization reductions in the health plan would be meaningfully offset by lower member cost share and CMS reinsurance payments. 
I will now make some comments regarding our long-term EPS targets that we discussed during our Investor Day last week. There have been some questions as to how we define low to mid-teens EPS growth. To provide more clarity around -- regarding our intentions, our long-term annual EPS target is 11% to 15%, reflecting our conviction around our strategy and the results it can deliver. 
As we discussed last week, our annual results will vary, sometimes performing above this range as in 2016, other times falling within the range. And depending on the funding environment, competitive landscape and any prior year over-performance, there may be years in which EPS growth is below that range. Given our integrated model, we have multiple levers we can pull to achieve these long-term results, which will also vary year to year. These levers include among others: membership and PMPM premium growth; MA margin changes, depending where the prior year finished in terms of our 4.5% to 5% individual MA pretax margin target; Healthcare Services pretax growth in excess of insurance membership growth to drive additional margin; and of course, capital return and M&A. Enhancing organizational productivity will also be a prime focus of the company to achieve these results while also increasing operational consistency. 
Finally, before opening the call for questions, I would like to share with you the news that Regina Nethery, our Vice President of Investor Relations, has decided to retire at the end of this month after nearly 22 years with Humana. It is impossible to overstate Regina's contributions to Humana over her career. She has not only been consistently recognized as the Investor Relations leader in our industry, but she has also been a critical partner to Bruce and me as well as to our predecessors, helping all of us navigate the tremendous change, both Humana and the industry have undergone over her distinguished career. Her wise counsel and impeccable market judgment have guided us through both good times and bad, demonstrating exemplary leadership and representing the very best of Humana. We can't thank her enough for all that she has done for the company. Regina, you'll be greatly missed, and we wish you the very best. 
With Regina's retirement, Amy Smith will lead Investor Relations. Amy is a CPA who has been at Humana for nearly 14 years, serving most of that time in progressively expanding leadership roles on the financial reporting team, driving SEC reporting and development of external messaging on key financial measurements for our earnings releases. With this expertise, she joined the Investor Relations team in February 2017 and met many of you at our Investor Day last week. Bruce and I look forward to partnering with Amy in her new capacity, and she is very excited about the opportunity of working with all of you.

And so the MER and the profitability in the first quarter is within our expectations. We do still expect to lose approximately $45 million overall for our ACA and our non-ACA combined individual products. If you compare versus last year, which you may be looking at, the losses were significantly higher than what we expect this year. And as you know, we exited all of our off-exchange products and meaningfully pared back our on-exchange products, particularly those areas where we were losing a great deal of money. And so that really explains the difference year-over-year. But the seasonality is real in this product, and that's what's explaining that low MER this quarter."

But that being said, there is a whole host of effort right now of deepening our relationships with the brokers.

And basically saying we're back in action and we have some great products and the Humana that you knew 2 years ago is even better than ever.

And it's really optimization of that, that has allowed us to get -- to leverage the great associates that we have in that area. And I would attribute that to both technology and just continuing to advance the care model. So in result, what that does is it allows us to do more with less and in result, lower the operating costs for Humana At One -- I'm sorry, at Humana At Home. And that then allows us to pass those savings on to our Retail division that ultimately also helps in the ability to price the product in the marketplace.

At our Investor Day, we suggested working with other outside independent groups that call it a 6%, plus or minus, growth rate year-over-year was something that we could expect. The variance, I would agree that the HIF had probably a less of an impact this year than perhaps one would have thought on overall market growth. And that might suggest that next year, it also, by coming back, may not have as much of an impact on market growth. But it's too early to tell. I mean, the thing that worries us about the HIF a little bit is that it's a big number. And when you go the other way and reduce benefits, that could have an impact on that overall growth rate. But it's really, frankly, hard to tell and hard to model human behavior and how they respond to the reduction in benefits and increased premiums. There are also a number of demographics that vary year to year just in terms of the number of people who are aging into Medicare, and so that's going to vary. It's geographically based as well. And so, again, it's very hard to say whether that 6% is going to hold next year and what the variance around that may be. But that's broadly the number that we're thinking about."

We believe that over time, and there are going to the, again, years where it's faster and years where it's slower, but there are opportunities to further engage with our members and drive pretax Healthcare Services growth faster than revenue growth.

Today, we reported second quarter results and raised our full year 2017 earnings guidance. Our second quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $4.46 or $3.49 on an adjusted basis significantly exceeded our previous expectations",1140,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported second quarter results and raised our full year 2017 earnings guidance. Our second quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $4.46 or $3.49 on an adjusted basis significantly exceeded our previous expectations, led by our individual Medicare Advantage business and our Retail segment. Given these results, we have raised our full year 2017 GAAP EPS guidance to approximately $17.83 per share or approximately $11.50 per share on an adjusted basis. Brian will discuss these results in more detail following my remarks. 
The quarter results demonstrate the strength of our focused strategy: improving the health of seniors living with chronic conditions through an integrated care delivery model that brings simplicity and connectivity to the health care experience. Members in our small to midsize group and military businesses also benefit from this integrated model through an improved experience. 
Key to our strategy and woven into all aspects of our business is a philosophy of fewer, bigger and better. We are focused on identifying key improvement areas that drive the greatest benefit for our members, provider partners, associates and our company overall. 
As we've outlined in our Investor Day presentation, we are doing this by focusing on integration in 3 major areas: integrating with providers to evolve economic incentives from treatment to health; integrating lifestyle and health care by expanding our offerings in the home, pharmacy and behavioral health programs; and integrating technology, both internally and externally, with provider partners to reduce friction points. 
We're actively advancing expanding our primary care and home care platforms as part of this strategy. We believe we can accomplish some of this through continued organic development, while some areas will require M&A. Our efforts are focused on expanding our platforms with geographic coverage to serve our members while enhancing clinical capabilities to improve their health. These platforms will be locally oriented, integrated across the provider community and enabled by technology and analytics. 
In addition to expanding our clinical platforms, our associates are working toward a solutions that reduce other friction points for both our members and our providers. For example, navigating the health care system can be complex and challenging. If a member calls with a question and is immediately transferred, sometimes multiple times, it becomes a very frustrating friction point. 
In 2016, we addressed this friction by our members -- by reducing unnecessary call transfers through identifying the root causes and by creating more consumer- and provider-friendly processes. That work continues in 2017, and we expect to see further positive results. By removing these friction points for the member, a few things happen. The member is more satisfied and our response is more timely, which improves Net Promoter Score, a measure of members who recommend us to friends and family. Our associates handling the calls are more engaged because they feel they're making a difference for the member. And finally, our organization becomes more efficient, which results in savings that we can reinvest to benefit members and providers. 
This is just one example of the strides our associates are making to improve the consumer and provider experience. Our service centers are focused on improving our ability to meet our members' needs, particularly in important areas such as benefits, in-network providers and claims payment. 
In addition to reducing call transfers, we've improved our digital capabilities, which enables members to access needed information 24/7. We are leveraging our customer relationship management platform to better meet the needs of our members based on their history and preferences, and we've significantly improved our communication practices by simplifying and personalizing our messages and refining the quality of how messages are delivered. 
As we continue to evolve our integrated care delivery strategy, we have seen increased activity in our members' completion of health risk and in-home assessments, participation in our Go 365 wellness platform and more effective engagement in our Humana At Home chronic care management program, which focuses on members most in need of health support. 
While there is still work to do, we are pleased with our progress to date. Over the course of this year, we've seen significant improvement in our Net Promoter Score relative to last year. For Medicare Advantage through June 30, we have improved our relationship Net Promoter Score by more than 500 basis points and our transactional Net Promoter Score by more than 700 basis points. We believe our focus on eliminating friction points and providing enhanced value through health engagement positions us well for the future as we continue to improve the experience and health of our members. 
To support our strategy, we developed a strong internal framework to advance our enterprise-wide commitment to quality, risk management, compliance and productivity. While these have always been top priority for us, we have renewed our focus on them, beginning with the recent announcement of Sam Dushponda to fill the newly created position of Senior Vice President and Chief Risk Officer. Sam and his team will help to drive integration throughout the enterprise, ensuring timely, proactive discovery and faster mitigation of risks and their causes. 
In addition, last year, we created the process transformation office to drive productivity throughout the organization with a focus on improving our operating structure while also improving member experience and compliance. This renewed focus is evident on how we look at CMS Medicare Star ratings. 
As a background, it's important to note that the Stars program is complex not just for Humana, but the entire industry. A Stars score is an aggregate of multiple measures, some having to do with quality; others with process, policies and procedures. 
There's a lagging indicator with scores for particular bonus years dependent on assessments that took place years previously. Many health plans, including Humana, implement remedial measures as a result of these assessments that are not reflected in the Star scores for the bonus year to which it is assigned. In addition, small movements in individual measurements can have significant impacts, positive or negative, on the overall score. 
With this in mind, we've disclosed in today's earnings release that for the bonus year 2018, we now expect approximately 74% of our Medicare members to be in 4-Star or higher plans, which compares favorably to our previous forecast of 37%. We are pleased with the final outcome for bonus year 2018 and have implemented operational changes that we expect will reduce volatility in future years. 
Aside from our Star results, we're also proud of our strong HEDIS measures, demonstrating the achievement of clinical outcomes, which were at a record-high level for us. 
In closing, I'd like to thank Humana's associates for their outstanding efforts on behalf of our members, providers and our company. It is through their hard work and commitment that our company continues to deliver strong performance. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

As Bruce mentioned, the strong performance of our individual Medicare Advantage franchise resulted in adjusted EPS of $3.49 for the second quarter, well ahead of our previous expectations. We also raised our f",1354,"Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the strong performance of our individual Medicare Advantage franchise resulted in adjusted EPS of $3.49 for the second quarter, well ahead of our previous expectations. We also raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.50 from our previous adjusted EPS guidance of at least $11.10, and we increased our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $200 million due primarily to our better financial performance. 
As a percentage of adjusted full year earnings, we expect our third quarter to reflect adjusted EPS in the high-20% range, with the fourth quarter therefore comprising a percentage in the high teens as it incorporates the usual cost increases associated with the open enrollment season. 
I will now highlight the drivers of each segment's operating performance. Led by individual Medicare Advantage, our Retail segment continues to significantly exceed our expectations. And today, we raised our full year 2017 Retail segment pretax income target by approximately $300 million at the midpoint of the guidance range. Consistent with the early indicators we saw in the first quarter, individual MA medical utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running favorably relative to our pricing assumptions, and we are seeing better-than-anticipated prior period medical claims development. We're also experiencing higher-than-expected revenue on a per member, per month basis. Accordingly, we reduced our projected full year benefit ratio for the Retail segment by a full 100 basis points from our previous guidance. 
Turning to our other businesses. Our Group and Specialty segment is continuing to have a solid year and as a result, we raised our pretax target by approximately $20 million at the midpoint of the guidance range. The increase was driven primarily by positive prior period claims development and specialty results that exceeded our previous expectations as well as current year medical cost trends that are slightly favorable to our expectations. We continue to believe that a key element of our strategy is a focus on small to midsize employers as well as our specialty dental and TRICARE businesses, as each delivers steady cash flow and good returns on capital. 
The Healthcare Services segment continues to generate profits and steady cash flow to the parent, and importantly, reflects the integration of our business model by delivering clinical excellence and trend vendors for our insurance lines. Consistent with the first quarter, we are continuing to see lower-than-expected pharmacy volumes, which reflect less health plan drug utilization than we had previously anticipated. 
In addition, while to date, mail-order rates are higher than last year, we are experiencing slightly lower penetration than we previously expected as some of our new stand-alone PDP members appear to be lower utilized of mail order relative to historical experience. 
Finally, the optimization of our chronic care management programs, whereby we are ensuring that our members are receiving the right level of intervention at the right time, is proceeding at a faster pace than initially expected, also contributing to lower Healthcare Services segment pretax than anticipated. As a result of these items, we reduced our pretax guidance for the segment by approximately $130 million at the midpoint of our guidance range. 
To reiterate my comments from the first quarter call, this dynamic is positive for overall Humana, and we expect that the increase in health plan pretax income would more than offset the reductions in Healthcare Services segment profits, even considering that a meaningful portion of lower pharmacy utilization does not benefit the insurance segments due to the corresponding lower CMS reinsurance and member cost share. These dynamics reinforce our integrated approach to running the business, taking a holistic, enterprise-wide view to drive business decisions that result in the best outcomes for our members, providers and the company. 
To close our segment discussion, I will comment briefly on our Individual Commercial segment results, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS guidance. Our Individual Commercial segment is now expected to generate full year 2017 pretax earnings of approximately $85 million versus our previous expectation of a full year loss of approximately $45 million. These results reflect significant prior period development, positive prior period development, which includes the net favorable settlement of a 2016 2 hours of reinsurance and risk adjustment as well as lower-than-expected utilization in our ACA on-exchange business. 
The strong performance we are seeing across the organization reflects our focus on operational excellence and the solid execution of our strategy. This will enable us in the third quarter to provide the Humana Foundation with a charitable contribution, reflecting our continued commitment to the communities we serve following the deal break. In addition, these results will enable us to spend incremental dollars on the Medicare annual enrollment period. 
Lastly, our compensation policies result in changes in compensation, both up and down, depending on our operating performance, with some years resulting in higher compensation levels relative to others. We are accruing compensation for 2017 based on the strong results we have seen across the company. As a result, we have increased the range of our full year consolidated operating cost ratio guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint. 
Pivoting now to CMS Star ratings in our Medicare bids for 2018. We reported this morning that we now expect approximately 74% of our members to be in 4-Star or higher plans for the 2018 bonus year. We are pleased that we were able to significantly reduce the impact that the lower Star ratings would have had in our members in 2018 and that our final Star ratings reflect our commitment to quality products and services for our members. In particular, these ratings reflect our strong clinical HEDIS measures, which are record-high levels. It is nonetheless important to note that there were certain contracts that we chose not to consolidate and still others that we were not able to consolidate due to state regulatory limitations. 
Taking this into account and considering rebate implications from reductions in Star ratings for certain of our contracts, we still expect to have some Stars-related financial headwinds for 2018. 
With regards to our 2018 Medicare Advantage bids that were submitted in June, we continue to work very hard to offset the negative impact that the return of the nondeductible health insurance fee and the remaining Stars-related financial headwinds could have on our members and the attractiveness of our products more broadly. We are focused on continuing to drive cost out of the organization and expect to make progress in this regard in 2018. The process transformation office that Bruce referenced in his partnership with our various businesses, is working diligently across segments to achieve increased productivity while improving and simplifying our core processes. 
Additionally, we have invested the 2017 outperformance I've discussed directly into our product designs for 2018. When combined with enhanced productivity, this has enabled us to keep benefits stable and competitive, and we believe will allow us to grow individual MA membership growth meaningfully in 2018 while maintaining our commitment to steady EPS growth. 
It is important to note that as we think about our 2018 earnings profile, our 2017 baseline remains our initial 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $11 at the high end given the investment of the strong 2017 performance that I mentioned. 
Finally, I would like to reiterate our previously communicated capital deployment plans. As you're aware, we initiated a $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase, or ASR, in the first quarter of 2017, which we expect to settle in the third quarter. Upon completion of the ASR, we continue to expect to repurchase shares for the balance of the year and have flexibility to spend up to $750 million under our existing authorization. Additionally, as Bruce indicated in his remarks, we continue to explore ways to accelerate our strategy in the home and with providers, including with M&A and other partnerships or collaborations. As discussed at our Investor Day, our capacity for cash M&A is approximately $3.5 billion while allowing us to maintain our investment-grade ratings. 
With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller."

There's roughly $2.15 of excess tax benefit that you'll be able to invest in benefits because you're not pulling that through operating earnings this year. So that's a little less than $3, and we think the hit is coming back at you to about a $4 headwind. So when we think about how that plays out in '18, either you have to absorb the differential in terms of lower earnings growth, you have to reduce benefits, you have to cut G&A or you have to raise premium. Can you help us understand when you say stable benefit, does that literally means stable, including premiums and the bulk of the differential has to get absorbed in earnings?

It is fair to say that, number one, we are going to put products in the market that do have stable benefits, which means we've overcome the health insurance fee.

It's also fair to say that the $0.50 you're talking about was reinvested into product design. But I think it's important to think about really the MER element of it, that 100 basis points that was reinvested into our product design. Some of the additional admin expenses that I mentioned around the foundation and compensation and other things are more onetime items. And so I think it's important to think about the investment as really the MER outperformance. And finally, as it relates to the HIF. Remember, the HIF is coming back next year. And so it's not as if we could take that $2.15 and invest it in benefits. It's just that we didn't have to call it back that perhaps others may have had to if they put that into benefits for 2017."

Both of those have increased over the last 18 months or so. And that's just an indication of how our, I think, our infrastructure is expressing itself in our results. But like everything, we have audits every year, and there's a lot of different inspections that go on in the organization like everybody operating in this regulatory environment. And so there will be fluctuations that come out. And as -- even as of today, we don't know what 2018 holds because we don't know what the relative measurement for others are and the comparison side. But really, the focus of what we are oriented to is this continuing to have solid processes, policies and procedures in the organization that ensures that our Stars performance isn't based on contract consolidations and other matters like that. It's really based on improved quality outcomes that are satisfaction and at the end of the day, also better compliance ratings. And I think that's when we talk about volatility. We talk about it in that context of how our infrastructure has really improved and our ability to manage the business in a highly regulatory environment."

We can compete really, really well as an organization, especially if we are in the raise with the benefit side. The second thing I really need to reemphasize with the investors is the organization has been under somewhat of a cloud for the last few years as a result of the transaction that has been, I think it has caused a little bit of challenge and headwinds in the sales process, whether it was in central parts of the state where we were having to market against it was announced we were going to sell membership to some of the other markets where it was looked upon as it wasn't going to be a Humana product at some point in time. So as you put in context of where our performance is this year, our focus on growing and our ability to keep stable benefits, our improved orientation or relationship with our broker, we feel -- and that's where our confidence is coming from and the organization having clarity on its independence.

I wonder if you could flesh out exactly what you're seeing there and be uptake. I know I've on your cost trend quantify that mentioned the mail-order rates not being as high able to drill down to see why that's happening PBM side. And then lastly, on the specialty. I think you guys you're still looking at home health, and there was a proposal that just came out. I know to help your existing business with a proposal change Medicare way that they think about paying for home health I wonder if that affects your interest in doing something there [indiscernible]."

So when we refer to specialty, what we were talking about in that context was our Group and Specialty segment and specifically, our dental business, which has been outperforming. It's not something that we're prepared to quantify, but it's a business that we don't talk a lot about, but has I think done very, very nicely. Membership higher than we expected as well as better claims experience. Secondly, as it relates to the home care side or the Humana At Home optimization as we called it and the mail-order side, those are both in our Healthcare Services segments. On the optimization side, as we said for a number of months now, we are spending a lot of time making sure that our members are getting the right level of care at the right time and that the right interventions are happening. And so if someone, for example, improves or gets better and no longer needs our services, that's a member we won't touch as many times. And I think we're being a lot more disciplined and operationally rigorous in ensuring that the members who truly need the care are getting the care. And so we continue to see very good results where the member is getting the right level of care, and that's where we're focused. But that does have a pretax implication for Healthcare Services because as we reduce effectively the charges, the intercompany charges to Medicare, Medicare benefits from a lower charge, but Healthcare Services gets impacted because there's lower pretax associated with that because there's a margin there. And so again, I think it's important as we talk about the integration of our model that we're constantly looking at what is the best decision for overall Humana and more importantly, for our members and their clinical health. On the specialty side, on the specialty -- sorry, the pharmacy side, the mail-order side, what we're referring to there is our mail-order rate. And as I mentioned in our low price Walmart plan, which has been and continues to be a very successful plan and a very good partnership with Walmart, we are seeing a slightly lower mail-order rate than we had anticipated. We think it's probably because we made some tweaks to the benefit design that may be causing some of those members to fulfill to fill their prescriptions at retail rather than at mail. But again, overall, it's a -- there's an impact on Healthcare Services, but there's only a small impact to overall Humana because of the way the co-pay structure works with when someone fills at Retail. And then finally, I'm sure Bruce will comment on this as well, as it relates to home health, we continue to look at opportunities. We're obviously mindful of the rate release that came out. We're analyzing that, and I'll just leave it that. But it doesn't fundamentally change our strategy in home and being able to engage with our members at a much more significant way in the home."

The home side, we -- although obviously, we haven't announced any acquisitions, we are working internally as we talked about organic and when we think about home long term, we think about it not only in coordinating care delivery of care in the home, which is the traditional home health side, also being able to have a home-based clinical model that can be nurses and doctors can help people at home through telemedicine or to go to their home.

Today, we reported second quarter results and raised our full year 2017 earnings guidance. Our second quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $4.46 or $3.49 on an adjusted basis significantly exceeded our previous expectations, led by our individual Medicare Advantage business and our Retail segment. Given these results, we have raised our full year 2017 GAAP EPS guidance to approximately $17.83 per share or approximately $11.50 per share on an adjusted basis. Brian will discuss these results in more detail following my remarks.
The quarter results demonstrate the strength of our focused strategy: improving the health of seniors living with chronic conditions through an integrated care delivery model that brings simplicity and connectivity to the health care experience. Members in our small to mid-sized group and military businesses also benefit from this integrated model through an improved experience. 
Key to our strategy and woven into all aspects of our business is a philosophy of fewer, bigger and better. We are focused on identifying key improvement areas that drive the greatest benefit for our members, provider partners, associates and our company, overall. 
As we've outlined in our Investor Day presentation, we are doing this by focusing on integration in 3 major areas: integrating with providers to evolve economic incentives from treatment to health; integrating lifestyle and health care by expanding our offerings in the home, pharmacy and behavioral health programs; and integrating technology, both internally and externally, with provider partners to reduce friction points. 
We are actively advancing expanding our primary care and home care platforms as part of this strategy. We believe we can accomplish some of this through continued organic development, while some areas will require M&A. Our efforts are focused on expanding our platforms with geographic coverage to serve our members, while enhancing clinical capabilities to improve their health. These platforms will be locally oriented, integrated across the provider community and enabled by technology and analytics.
In addition to expanding our clinical platforms, our associates are working toward a solutions that reduce other friction points for both our members and our providers. For example, navigating the health care system can be complex and challenging. If a member calls with a question and is immediately transferred, sometimes multiple times, it becomes a very frustrating friction point. 
In 2016, we addressed this friction by our members -- by reducing unnecessary call transfers through identifying the root causes and by creating more consumer- and provider-friendly processes. That work continues in 2017, and we expect to see further positive results. By removing these friction points for the member, a few things happen. The member is more satisfied and our response is more timely, which improves Net Promoter Score, a measure of members who recommend us to friends and family. Our associates handling the calls are more engaged because they feel they're making a difference for the member. And finally, our organization becomes more efficient, which results in savings that we can reinvest to benefit members and providers. 
This is just one example of the strides our associates are making to improve the consumer and provider experience. Our service centers are focused on improving our ability to meet our members' needs, particularly in important areas such as benefits, in-network providers and claims payment. 
In addition to reducing call transfers, we've improved our digital capabilities, which enables members to access needed information 24/7. We are leveraging our customer relationship management platform to better meet the needs of our members based on their history and preferences. And we've significantly improved our communication practices by simplifying and personalizing our messages and refining the quality of how messages are delivered. 
As we continue to evolve our integrated care delivery strategy, we have seen increased activity in our members' completion of health risk and in-home assessments, participation in our Go365 wellness platform and more effective engagement in our Humana At Home chronic care management program, which focuses on members most in need of health support. 
While there is still work to do, we are pleased with our progress to date. Over the course of this year, we've seen significant improvement in our Net Promoter Score relative to last year. For Medicare Advantage, through June 30, we have improved our relationship Net Promoter Score by more than 500 basis points and our transactional Net Promoter Score by more than 700 basis points. We believe our focus on eliminating friction points and providing enhanced value through health engagement positions us well for the future as we continue to improve the experience and health of our members. 
To support our strategy, we've developed a strong internal framework to advance our enterprise-wide commitment to quality, risk management, compliance and productivity. While these have always been top priority for us, we have renewed our focus on them, beginning with the recent announcement of Sam Deshpande to fill the newly created position of Senior Vice President and Chief Risk Officer. Sam and his team will help to drive integration throughout the enterprise, ensuring timely, proactive discovery and faster mitigation of risks and their causes.
In addition, last year, we created the Process Transformation Office to drive productivity throughout the organization, with a focus on improving our operating structure while also improving member experience and compliance. This renewed focus is evident on how we look at CMS Medicare Star ratings. 
As a background, it is important to note that the Stars program is complex not just for Humana, but the entire industry. A Star score is an aggregate of multiple measures, some having to do with quality; others with process, policies and procedures. 
There's a lagging indicator with scores for particular bonus years dependent on assessments that took place years previously. Many health plans, including Humana, implement remedial measures as a result of these assessments that are not reflected in the Star scores for the bonus year to which it is assigned. In addition, small movements and individual measurements can have significant impacts, positive or negative, on the overall score. 
With this in mind, we've disclosed in today's earnings release that for the bonus year 2018, we now expect approximately 74% of our Medicare members to be in 4-Star or higher plans, which compares favorably to our previous forecast of 37%. We are pleased with the final outcome for bonus year 2018 and have implemented operational changes that we expect will reduce volatility in future years.
Aside from our Star results, we're also proud of our strong HEDIS measures, demonstrating the achievement of clinical outcomes, which were at a record-high level for us. 
In closing, I'd like to thank Humana's associates for their outstanding efforts on behalf of our members, providers and our company. It is through their hard work and commitment that our company continues to deliver strong performance. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
29618,420306428,1262761,"Humana Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Humana Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the strong performance of our individual Medicare Advantage franchise resulted in adjusted EPS of $3.49 for the second quarter, well ahead of our previous expectations. We also raised our f",1358,"Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the strong performance of our individual Medicare Advantage franchise resulted in adjusted EPS of $3.49 for the second quarter, well ahead of our previous expectations. We also raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.50 from our previous adjusted EPS guidance of at least $11.10, and we increased our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $200 million due primarily to our better financial performance. 
As a percentage of adjusted full year earnings, we expect our third quarter to reflect adjusted EPS in the high-20% range, with the fourth quarter therefore comprising a percentage in the high teens as it incorporates the usual cost increases associated with the open enrollment season.
I will now highlight the drivers of each segment's operating performance. Led by individual Medicare Advantage, our Retail segment continues to significantly exceed our expectations. And today, we raised our full year 2017 Retail segment pretax income target by approximately $300 million at the midpoint of the guidance range. Consistent with the early indicators we saw in the first quarter, individual MA medical utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running favorably relative to our pricing assumptions, and we are seeing better-than-anticipated prior period medical claims development. We are also experiencing higher-than-expected revenue on a per member, per month basis. Accordingly, we reduced our projected full year benefit ratio for the Retail segment by a full 100 basis points from our previous guidance. 
Turning to our other businesses. Our Group and Specialty segment is continuing to have a solid year, and as a result, we raised our pretax target by approximately $20 million, at the midpoint of the guidance range. The increase was driven primarily by positive prior period claims development and specialty results that exceeded our previous expectations as well as current year medical cost trends that are slightly favorable to our expectations. We continue to believe that a key element of our strategy is a focus on small to mid-sized employers as well as our specialty dental and TRICARE businesses, as each delivers steady cash flow and good returns on capital. 
The Healthcare Services segment continues to generate profits and steady cash flow to the parent, and importantly, reflects the integration of our business model by delivering clinical excellence and trend vendors for our insurance lines. Consistent with the first quarter, we are continuing to see lower-than-expected pharmacy volumes, which reflect less health plan drug utilization than we had previously anticipated. 
In addition, while to date, mail order rates are higher than last year, we are experiencing slightly lower penetration than we previously expected as some of our new stand-alone PDP members appear to be lower utilizers of mail order relative to historical experience. 
Finally, the optimization of our chronic care management programs, whereby we are ensuring that our members are receiving the right level of intervention at the right time, is proceeding at a faster pace than initially expected, also contributing to lower Healthcare Services segment pretax than anticipated. As a result of these items, we reduced our pretax guidance for the segment by approximately $130 million, at the midpoint of our guidance range. 
To reiterate my comments from the first quarter call, this dynamic is positive for overall Humana, and we expect that the increase in health plan pretax income would more than offset the reductions in Healthcare Services segment profits, even considering that a meaningful portion of lower pharmacy utilization does not benefit the insurance segments due to the corresponding lower CMS reinsurance and member cost share. These dynamics reinforce our integrated approach to running the business, taking a holistic, enterprise-wide view to drive business decisions that result in the best outcomes for our members, providers and the company. 
To close our segment discussion, I will comment briefly on our Individual Commercial segment results, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS guidance. Our Individual Commercial segment is now expected to generate full year 2017 pretax earnings of approximately $85 million versus our previous expectation of a full year loss of approximately $45 million. These results reflect significant prior period development, positive prior period development, which includes the net favorable settlement of a 2016 [ 2 hours ] of reinsurance and risk adjustment as well as lower-than-expected utilization in our ACA on-exchange business. 
The strong performance we are seeing across the organization reflects our focus on operational excellence and the solid execution of our strategy. This will enable us in the third quarter to provide the Humana Foundation with a charitable contribution, reflecting our continued commitment to the communities we serve following the deal break. In addition, these results will enable us to spend incremental dollars on the Medicare annual enrollment period. 
Lastly, our compensation policies result in changes in compensation, both up and down, depending on our operating performance, with some years resulting in higher compensation levels relative to others. We are accruing compensation for 2017 based on the strong results we have seen across the company. As a result, we have increased the range of our full year consolidated operating cost ratio guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint. 
Pivoting now to CMS Star ratings and our Medicare bids for 2018. We reported this morning that we now expect approximately 74% of our members to be in 4-Star or higher plans for the 2018 bonus year. We are pleased that we were able to significantly reduce the impact that the lower Star ratings would have had in our members in 2018 and that our final Star ratings reflect our commitment to quality products and services for our members. In particular, these ratings reflect our strong clinical HEDIS measures, which are record-high levels. It is nonetheless important to note that there were certain contracts that we chose not to consolidate and still others that we were not able to consolidate due to state regulatory limitations. 
Taking this into account and considering rebate implications from reductions in Star ratings for certain of our contracts, we still expect to have some Stars-related financial headwinds for 2018. 
With regard to our 2018 Medicare Advantage bids that were submitted in June, we continue to work very hard to offset the negative impact that the return of the nondeductible health insurance fee and the remaining Stars-related financial headwinds could have on our members and the attractiveness of our products more broadly. We are focused on continuing to drive cost out of the organization and expect to make progress in this regard in 2018. The Process Transformation Office that Bruce referenced in his partnership with our various businesses, is working diligently across segments to achieve increased productivity while improving and simplifying our core processes. 
Additionally, we have invested the 2017 outperformance I've discussed directly into our product designs for 2018. When combined with enhanced productivity, this has enabled us to keep benefits stable and competitive, and we believe will allow us to grow individual MA membership growth meaningfully in 2018 while maintaining our commitment to steady EPS growth. 
It is important to note that as we think about our 2018 earnings profile, our 2017 baseline remains our initial 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $11 at the high end, given the investment of the strong 2017 performance that I mentioned. 
Finally, I would like to reiterate our previously communicated capital deployment plans. As you're aware, we initiated a $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase, or ASR, in the first quarter of 2017, which we expect to settle in the third quarter. Upon completion of the ASR, we continue to expect to repurchase shares for the balance of the year and have flexibility to spend up to $750 million under our existing authorization. Additionally, as Bruce indicated in his remarks, we continue to explore ways to accelerate our strategy in the home and with providers, including with M&A and other partnerships or collaborations.

So if I'm understanding kind of how you're talking about 2018, there's roughly $0.50 of outperformance, the $11.50 versus the $11 you talked about, to invest in 2018. There's roughly $2.15 of excess HIF tax benefit that you'll be able to invest in benefits because you're not pulling that through operating earnings this year. So that's a little less than $3, and we think the HIF is coming back at you with about a $4 headwind. So when we think about how that plays out in '18, either you have to absorb that differential in terms of lower earnings growth, you have to reduce benefits, you have to cut G&A or you have to raise premium. Can you help us understand, when you say stable benefits, does that literally means stable, including premiums and the bulk of the differential has to get absorbed in earnings? Is that the message you're conveying today?"

It is fair to say that, number one, we are going to put products in the market that do have stable benefits, which means we've overcome the health insurance fee. Obviously, it's going to vary by market. But on a national basis, I think that's a fair way to think about it. It's also fair to say that the $0.50 you're talking about was reinvested into product design. But I think it's important to think about really the MER element of it, that 100 basis points that was reinvested into our product design. Some of the additional admin expenses that I mentioned around the foundation and compensation and other things are more onetime items. And so I think it's important to think about the investment as really the MER outperformance. And finally, as it relates to the HIF. Remember, the HIF is coming back next year. And so it's not as if we could take that $2.15 and invest it in benefits. It's just that we didn't have to call it back that perhaps others may have had to if they put that into benefits for 2017."

Both of those have increased over the last 18 months or so, and that's just an indication of how our, I think, our infrastructure is expressing itself in our results. But like everything, we have audits every year, and there's a lot of different inspections that go on in the organization like everybody operating in this regulatory environment. And so there will be fluctuations that come out. And as -- even as of today, we don't know what 2018 holds because we don't know what the relative measurement for others are in the comparison side. But really, the focus of what we are oriented to is just continuing to have solid processes, policies and procedures in the organization that ensures that our Stars performance isn't based on contract consolidations and other matters like that. It's really based on improved clinical outcomes that are satisfaction and at the end of the day, also better compliance ratings. And I think that's when we talk about volatility.

We've always been competitive, and we've always been able to compete there. So we don't -- we feel with the brand we have, the experience we provide the customer, our health offerings that we have, we can compete really, really well as an organization, especially if we are in the race with the benefit side. The second thing I really need to reemphasize with the investors is the organization has been under somewhat of a cloud for the last few years as a result of the transaction that has been. I think it has caused a little bit of challenge and headwinds in the sales process, whether it was in central parts of the state where we were having to market against where it was announced we were going to sell membership to some of the other markets where it was looked upon as, that it wasn't going to be a Humana product at some point in time. So as you put it in context of where our performance is this year, our focus on growing and our ability to keep stable benefits, our improved orientation or relationship with our broker, we feel -- and that's where our confidence is coming from and the organization having clarity on its independence. And so I think that's what you hear from the management team and why we feel that next year, we'll have a good growth here."

I wanted to just flesh out a couple comments that I think Brian made. First, there was a comment about the uptake in the Chronic Care involvement being better than expected. I wonder if you could flesh out exactly what you're seeing there and the uptake. I know that's [ happened ] on your cost trend and [ I don't know if you can quantify that ]. As you mentioned the mail order rates not being as high and able to drill down to see why that's happening in the PBM side. And then lastly, on the specialty. I think you guys, you're still looking at home health, and there was a proposal that just came out. I know you've put your emphasis on [ strategies ] to help your existing business. But the proposal change of Medicare, the way that they think about paying for home health, and I wonder if that affects your interest in doing something there [indiscernible]."

So when we refer to specialty, what we were talking out in that context was our Group and Specialty segment and, specifically, our dental business, which has been outperforming. It's not something that we're prepared to quantify, but it's a business that we don't talk a lot about, but has, I think, done very, very nicely. Membership, higher than we expected as well as better claims experience. Secondly, as it relates to the home care side or the Humana At Home optimization, as we called it, and the mail order side, those are both in our Healthcare Services segments. On the optimization side, as wive said, for a number of months now, we are spending a lot of time making sure that our members are getting the right level of care at the right time and that the right interventions are happening. And so if someone, for example, improves or gets better and no longer needs our services, that's a member we won't touch as many times. And I think we're being a lot more disciplined and operationally rigorous in ensuring that the members who truly need the care are getting the care. And so we continue to see very good results where the member is getting the right level of care, and that's where we're focused. But that does have a pretax implication for Healthcare Services because as we reduce effectively the charges, the intercompany charges to Medicare, Medicare benefits from a lower charge, but Healthcare Services gets impacted because there's lower pretax associated with that because there's a margin there. And so again, I think that's important as we talk about the integration of our model that we're constantly looking at what is the best decision for overall Humana and, more importantly, for our members and their clinical health. On the specialty side, on the specialty -- sorry, the pharmacy side, the mail order side, what we're referring to there is our mail order rate. And as I mentioned in our low-price Walmart plan, which has been and continues to be a very successful plan and a very good partnership with Walmart, we are seeing a slightly lower mail order rate than we had anticipated. We think it's probably because we made some tweaks to the benefit design that may be causing some of those members to fulfill -- to fill their prescriptions at retail rather than at mail. But again, overall, it's a -- there's an impact on Healthcare Services, but there's only a small impact to overall Humana because of the way the co-pay structure works with -- when someone fills at Retail. And then finally, I'm sure Bruce will comment on this as well, as it relates to home health, we continue to look at opportunities. We're obviously mindful of the rate release that came out. We're analyzing that, and I'll just leave it at that. But it doesn't fundamentally change our strategy in home and in being able to engage with our members at a much more significant way in the home."

The home side, we -- although, obviously, we haven't announced any acquisitions, we are working internally as we talked about organic. And when we think about home, long term, we think about it not only in coordinating care, delivery of care in the home, which is the traditional home health side, also being able to have a home-based clinical model that it can be -- nurses and doctors can help people at home through telemedicine or to go to their home. And we're working on all of those different ones, and so it doesn't necessarily mean that we just have to announce an acquisition, and that's our home health strategy. There's a lot of other things that are going on within the organization to advance that home side. But you're right, A.J., it is all wrapped around how do we advance our membership in the long term."

Key to our strategy and woven into all aspects of our business is a philosophy of fewer, bigger and better. We are focused on identifying key improvement areas that drive the greatest benefit for our members, provider partners, associates and our company, overall. 
As we've outlined in our Investor Day presentation, we are doing this by focusing on integration in 3 major areas: integrating with providers to evolve economic incentives from treatment to health; integrating lifestyle and health care by expanding our offerings in the home, pharmacy and behavioral health programs; and integrating technology, both internally and externally, with provider partners to reduce friction points. 
We are actively advancing expanding our primary care and home care platforms as part of this strategy. We believe we can accomplish some of this through continued organic development, while some areas will require M&A. Our efforts are focused on expanding our platforms with geographic coverage to serve our members while enhancing clinical capabilities to improve their health. These platforms will be locally oriented, integrated across the provider community and enabled by technology and analytics.
In addition to expanding our clinical platforms, our associates are working toward solutions that reduce other friction points for both our members and our providers. For example, navigating the health care system can be complex and challenging. If a member calls with a question and is immediately transferred, sometimes multiple times, it becomes a very frustrating friction point. 
In 2016, we addressed this friction by our members -- by reducing unnecessary call transfers through identifying the root causes and by creating more consumer- and provider-friendly processes. That work continues in 2017, and we expect to see further positive results. By removing these friction points for the member, a few things happen. The member is more satisfied and our response is more timely, which improves Net Promoter Score, a measure of members who recommend us to friends and family. Our associates handling the calls are more engaged because they feel they're making a difference for the member. And finally, our organization becomes more efficient, which results in savings that we can reinvest to benefit members and providers. 
This is just one example of the strides our associates are making to improve the consumer and provider experience. Our service centers are focused on improving our ability to meet our members' needs, particularly in important areas such as benefits, in-network providers and claims payment. 
In addition to reducing call transfers, we've improved our digital capabilities, which enable members to access needed information 24/7. We are leveraging our customer relationship management platform to better meet the needs of our members based on their history and preferences. And we've significantly improved our communication practices by simplifying and personalizing our messages and refining the quality of how messages are delivered. 
As we continue to evolve our integrated care delivery strategy, we have seen increased activity in our members' completion of health risk and in-home assessments, participation in our Go365 wellness platform and more effective engagement in our Humana At Home chronic care management program, which focuses on members most in need of health support. 
While there is still work to do, we are pleased with our progress to date. Over the course of this year, we've seen significant improvement in our Net Promoter Score relative to last year. For Medicare Advantage, through June 30, we have improved our relationship Net Promoter Score by more than 500 basis points and our transactional Net Promoter Score by more than 700 basis points. We believe our focus on eliminating friction points and providing enhanced value through health engagement positions us well for the future as we continue to improve the experience and health of our members. 
To support our strategy, we've developed a strong internal framework to advance our enterprise-wide commitment to quality, risk management, compliance and productivity. While these have always been top priority for us, we have renewed our focus on them, beginning with the recent announcement of Sam Deshpande to fill the newly created position of Senior Vice President and Chief Risk Officer. Sam and his team will help to drive integration throughout the enterprise, ensuring timely, proactive discovery and faster mitigation of risks and their causes.
In addition, last year, we created the Process Transformation Office to drive productivity throughout the organization, with a focus on improving our operating structure while also improving member experience and compliance. This renewed focus is evident on how we look at CMS Medicare Star ratings. 
As a background, it is important to note that the Stars program is complex not just for Humana, but the entire industry. A Star score is an aggregate of multiple measures, some having to do with quality; others with process, policies and procedures. 
There's a lagging indicator with scores for particular bonus years dependent on assessments that took place years previously. Many health plans, including Humana, implement remedial measures as a result of these assessments that are not reflected in the Star scores for the bonus year to which it is assigned. In addition, small movements in individual measurements can have significant impacts, positive or negative, on the overall score. 
With this in mind, we've disclosed in today's earnings release that for the bonus year 2018, we now expect approximately 74% of our Medicare members to be in 4-Star or higher plans, which compares favorably to our previous forecast of 37%. We are pleased with the final outcome for bonus year 2018 and have implemented operational changes that we expect will reduce volatility in future years.
Aside from our Star results, we're also proud of our strong HEDIS measures, demonstrating the achievement of clinical outcomes, which are at a record-high level for us. 
In closing, I'd like to thank Humana's associates for their outstanding efforts on behalf of our members, providers and our company. It is through their hard work and commitment that our company continues to deliver strong performance. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
29618,420306428,1268735,"Humana Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Humana Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the strong performance of our individual Medicare Advantage franchise resulted in adjusted EPS of $3.49 for the second quarter, well ahead of our previous expectations. We also raised our f",1359,"Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the strong performance of our individual Medicare Advantage franchise resulted in adjusted EPS of $3.49 for the second quarter, well ahead of our previous expectations. We also raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.50 from our previous adjusted EPS guidance of at least $11.10, and we increased our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $200 million due primarily to our better financial performance. 
As a percentage of adjusted full year earnings, we expect our third quarter to reflect adjusted EPS in the high-20% range, with the fourth quarter, therefore, comprising a percentage in the high teens as it incorporates the usual cost increases associated with the open enrollment season.
I will now highlight the drivers of each segment's operating performance. Led by individual Medicare Advantage, our Retail segment continues to significantly exceed our expectations. And today, we raised our full year 2017 Retail segment pretax income target by approximately $300 million at the midpoint of the guidance range. Consistent with the early indicators we saw in the first quarter, individual MA medical utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running favorably relative to our pricing assumptions, and we are seeing better-than-anticipated prior period medical claims development. We are also experiencing higher-than-expected revenue on a per member, per month basis. Accordingly, we reduced our projected full year benefit ratio for the Retail segment by a full 100 basis points from our previous guidance. 
Turning to our other businesses. Our Group and Specialty segment is continuing to have a solid year, and as a result, we raised our pretax target by approximately $20 million, at the midpoint of the guidance range. The increase was driven primarily by positive prior period claims development and specialty results that exceeded our previous expectations as well as current year medical cost trends that are slightly favorable to our expectations. We continue to believe that a key element of our strategy is a focus on small to mid-sized employers as well as our specialty dental and TRICARE businesses, as each delivers steady cash flow and good returns on capital. 
The Healthcare Services segment continues to generate profits and steady cash flow to the parent, and importantly, reflects the integration of our business model by delivering clinical excellence and trend benders for our insurance lines. Consistent with the first quarter, we are continuing to see lower-than-expected pharmacy volumes, which reflect less health plan drug utilization than we had previously anticipated. 
In addition, while to date, mail order rates are higher than last year, we are experiencing slightly lower penetration than we previously expected as some of our new stand-alone PDP members appear to be lower utilizers of mail order relative to historical experience. 
Finally, the optimization of our chronic care management programs, whereby we are ensuring that our members are receiving the right level of intervention at the right time, is proceeding at a faster pace than initially expected, also contributing to lower Healthcare Services segment pretax than anticipated. As a result of these items, we've reduced our pretax guidance for the segment by approximately $130 million, at the midpoint of our guidance range. 
To reiterate my comments from the first quarter call, this dynamic is positive for overall Humana, and we expect that the increase in health plan pretax income will more than offset the reductions in Healthcare Services segment profits, even considering that a meaningful portion of lower pharmacy utilization does not benefit the insurance segments due to the corresponding lower CMS reinsurance and member cost share. These dynamics reinforce our integrated approach to running the business, taking a holistic, enterprise-wide view to drive business decisions that result in the best outcomes for our members, providers and the company. 
To close our segment discussion, I will comment briefly on our Individual Commercial segment results, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS guidance. Our Individual Commercial segment is now expected to generate full year 2017 pretax earnings of approximately $85 million versus our previous expectation of a full year loss of approximately $45 million. These results reflect significant prior period development -- positive prior period development, which includes the net favorable settlement of the 2016 to ours of reinsurance and risk adjustment as well as lower-than-expected utilization in our ACA on-exchange business. 
The strong performance we are seeing across the organization reflects our focus on operational excellence and the solid execution of our strategy. This will enable us in the third quarter to provide the Humana Foundation with a charitable contribution, reflecting our continued commitment to the communities we serve following the deal break.  In addition, these results will enable us to spend incremental dollars on the Medicare annual enrollment period. 
Lastly, our compensation policies result in changes in compensation, both up and down, depending on our operating performance, with some years resulting in higher compensation levels relative to others. We are accruing compensation for 2017 based on the strong results we have seen across the company. As a result, we have increased the range of our full year consolidated operating cost ratio guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint. 
Pivoting now to CMS Star ratings and our Medicare bids for 2018. We reported this morning that we now expect approximately 74% of our members to be in 4-Star or higher plans for the 2018 bonus year. We are pleased that we were able to significantly reduce the impact that the lower Star ratings would have had in our members in 2018 and that our final Star ratings reflect our commitment to quality products and services for our members. In particular, these ratings reflect our strong clinical HEDIS measures, which are at record-high levels. It is nonetheless important to note that there were certain contracts that we chose not to consolidate and still others that we were not able to consolidate due to state regulatory limitations. 
Taking this into account and considering rebate implications from reductions in Star ratings for certain of our contracts, we still expect to have some Stars-related financial headwinds for 2018. 
With regard to our 2018 Medicare Advantage bids that were submitted in June, we continue to work very hard to offset the negative impact that the return of the nondeductible health insurance fee and the remaining Stars-related financial headwinds could have on our members and the attractiveness of our products more broadly. We are focused on continuing to drive cost out of the organization and expect to make progress in this regard in 2018. The Process Transformation Office that Bruce referenced in his partnership with our various businesses is working diligently across segments to achieve increased productivity while improving and simplifying our core processes. 
Additionally, we have invested the 2017 outperformance I've discussed directly into our product designs for 2018. When combined with enhanced productivity, this has enabled us to keep benefits stable and competitive, and we believe will allow us to grow individual MA membership growth meaningfully in 2018 while maintaining our commitment to steady EPS growth. 
It is important to note that as we think about our 2018 earnings profile, our 2017 baseline remains our initial 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $11 at the high end, given the investment of the strong 2017 performance that I mentioned. 
Finally, I would like to reiterate our previously communicated capital deployment plans. As you're aware, we initiated a $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase, or ASR, in the first quarter of 2017, which we expect to settle in the third quarter. Upon completion of the ASR, we continue to expect to repurchase shares for the balance of the year and have the flexibility to spend up to $750 million under our existing authorization. Additionally, as Bruce indicated in his remarks, we continue to explore ways to accelerate our strategy in the home and with providers, including with M&A and other partnerships or collaborations. As discussed at our Investor Day, our capacity for cash M&A is approximately $3.5 billion while allowing us to maintain our investment-grade ratings. 
With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller."

So if I'm understanding kind of how you're talking about 2018, there's roughly $0.50 of outperformance, the $11.50 versus the $11 you talked about, to invest in 2018. There's roughly $2.15 of excess HIF tax benefit that you'll be able to invest in benefits because you're not pulling that through operating earnings this year. So that's a little less than $3, and we think the HIF coming back at you is about a $4 headwind. So when we think about how that plays out in '18, either you have to absorb that differential in terms of lower earnings growth, you have to reduce benefits, you have to cut G&A or you have to raise premiums. Can you help us understand, when you say stable benefits, does that literally means stable, including premiums and the bulk of that differential has to get absorbed in earnings? Is that the message you're conveying today?"

It is fair to say that, number one, we are going to put products in the market that do have stable benefits, which means we've overcome the health insurance fee.

It's also fair to say that the $0.50 you're talking about was reinvested into product design. But I think it's important to think about really the MER element of it, that 100 basis points that was reinvested into our product design. Some of the additional admin expenses that I mentioned around the foundation and compensation and other things are more onetime items. And so I think it's important to think about the investment as really the MER outperformance. And finally, as it relates to the HIF. Remember, the HIF is coming back next year. And so it's not as if we could take that $2.15 and invest it in benefits. It's just that we didn't have to claw it back that perhaps others may have had to if they put that into benefits for 2017."

So we don't -- we feel with the brand we have, the experience we provide the customer, our health offerings that we have, we can compete really, really well as an organization, especially if we are in the race with the benefit side. The second thing I really need to reemphasize with the investors is the organization has been under somewhat of a cloud for the last few years as a result of the transaction that has been -- I think it has caused a little bit of a challenge and headwinds in the sales process, whether it was in central parts of the state where we were having to market against where it was announced we were going to sell membership to some of the other markets where it was looked upon as that it wasn't going to be a Humana product at some point in time. So as you put it in context of where our performance is this year, our focus on growing and our ability to keep stable benefits, our improved orientation or relationship with our broker, we feel -- and that's where our confidence is coming from and the organization having clarity on its independence.

I wonder if you could flesh out exactly what you're seeing there and the uptake. I know that's [ happened ] on your cost trend and [ I don't know if you can quantify that ]. As you mentioned the mail order rates not being as high and able to drill down to see why that's happening on the PBM side. And then lastly, on the specialty. I think you guys -- you're still looking at home health, and there was a proposal that just came out. I know you've put your emphasis on efforts to help your existing business. But the proposal change of Medicare, the way that they think about paying for home health, and I wonder if that affects your interest in doing something there [indiscernible]."

So when we refer to specialty, what we were talking out in that context was our Group and Specialty segment and, specifically, our dental business, which has been outperforming. It's not something that we're prepared to quantify, but it's a business that we don't talk a lot about, but has, I think, done very, very nicely. Membership, higher than we expected as well as better claims experience. Secondly, as it relates to the home care side or the Humana At Home optimization, as we called it, and the mail order side, those are both in our Healthcare Services segments. On the optimization side, as we've said for a number of months now, we are spending a lot of time making sure that our members are getting the right level of care at the right time and that the right interventions are happening. And so if someone, for example, improves or gets better and no longer needs our services, that's a member we won't touch as many times. And I think we're being a lot more disciplined and operationally rigorous in ensuring that the members who truly need the care are getting the care. And so we continue to see very good results where the member is getting the right level of care, and that's where we're focused. But that does have a pretax implication for Healthcare Services because as we reduce effectively the charges, the intercompany charges to Medicare, Medicare benefits from a lower charge, but Healthcare Services gets impacted because there's lower pretax associated with that because there's a margin there. And so again, I think that's important as we talk about the integration of our model that we're constantly looking at what is the best decision for overall Humana and, more importantly, for our members and their clinical health. On the specialty side, on the specialty -- sorry, the pharmacy side and the mail order side, what we're referring to there is our mail order rate. And as I mentioned in our low-price Walmart plan, which has been and continues to be a very successful plan and a very good partnership with Walmart, we are seeing a slightly lower mail order rate than we had anticipated. We think it's probably because we made some tweaks to the benefit design that may be causing some of those members to fulfill -- to fill their prescriptions at retail rather than at mail. But again, overall, it's a -- there's an impact on Healthcare Services, but there's only a small impact to overall Humana because of the way the co-pay structure works with -- when someone fills at Retail. And then finally, I'm sure Bruce will comment on this as well, as it relates to home health, we continue to look at opportunities. We're obviously mindful of the rate release that came out. We're analyzing that, and I'll just leave it at that. But it doesn't fundamentally change our strategy in the home and in being able to engage with our members in a much more significant way in the home."

The home side, we -- although, obviously, we haven't announced any acquisitions, we are working internally as we talk about organic. And when we think about at home long term, we think about it not only in coordinating care, delivery of care in the home, which is the traditional home health side, also being able to have a home-based clinical model that is, it can be -- nurses and doctors can help people at home through telemedicine or to go to their home.

As it relates to group MA, we continue to be selective in picking our spots. Our team is out there really pounding the pavement for opportunities. We feel pretty good about where we stand in the group MA business and looking at a number of prospects. But I would tell you that as we said in multiple calls, we're going to be disciplined as we price that product. It's got to make sense from a return on capital perspective and from a risk perspective before we're willing to sign up, particularly for some of these large jumbo accounts."

Today, we reported second quarter results and raised our full year 2017 earnings guidance. Our second quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $4.46 or $3.49 on an adjusted basis significantly exceeded our previous expectations",1140,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported second quarter results and raised our full year 2017 earnings guidance. Our second quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $4.46 or $3.49 on an adjusted basis significantly exceeded our previous expectations, led by our individual Medicare Advantage business and our Retail segment. Given these results, we have raised our full year 2017 GAAP EPS guidance to approximately $17.83 per share or approximately $11.50 per share on an adjusted basis. Brian will discuss these results in more detail following my remarks.
The quarter results demonstrate the strength of our focused strategy: improving the health of seniors living with chronic conditions through an integrated care delivery model that brings simplicity and connectivity to the health care experience. Members in our small to mid-sized group and military businesses also benefit from this integrated model through an improved experience. 
Key to our strategy and woven into all aspects of our business is a philosophy of fewer, bigger and better. We are focused on identifying key improvement areas that drive the greatest benefit for our members, provider partners, associates and our company, overall. 
As we've outlined in our Investor Day presentation, we are doing this by focusing on integration in 3 major areas: integrating with providers to evolve economic incentives from treatment to health; integrating lifestyle and health care by expanding our offerings in the home, pharmacy and behavioral health programs; and integrating technology, both internally and externally, with provider partners to reduce friction points. 
We are actively advancing expanding our primary care and home care platforms as part of this strategy. We believe we can accomplish some of this through continued organic development, while some areas will require M&A. Our efforts are focused on expanding our platforms with geographic coverage to serve our members while enhancing clinical capabilities to improve their health. These platforms will be locally oriented, integrated across the provider community and enabled by technology and analytics.
In addition to expanding our clinical platforms, our associates are working toward  solutions that reduce other friction points for both our members and our providers. For example, navigating the health care system can be complex and challenging. If a member calls with a question and is immediately transferred, sometimes multiple times, it becomes a very frustrating friction point. 
In 2016, we addressed this friction by our members -- by reducing unnecessary call transfers through identifying the root causes and by creating more consumer- and provider-friendly processes. That work continues in 2017, and we expect to see further positive results. By removing these friction points for the member, a few things happen. The member is more satisfied and our response is more timely, which improves Net Promoter Score, a measure of members who recommend us to friends and family. Our associates handling the calls are more engaged because they feel they're making a difference for the member. And finally, our organization becomes more efficient, which results in savings that we can reinvest to benefit members and providers. 
This is just one example of the strides our associates are making to improve the consumer and provider experience. Our service centers are focused on improving our ability to meet our members' needs, particularly in important areas such as benefits, in-network providers and claims payment. 
In addition to reducing call transfers, we've improved our digital capabilities, which enable members to access needed information 24/7. We are leveraging our customer relationship management platform to better meet the needs of our members based on their history and preferences. And we've significantly improved our communication practices by simplifying and personalizing our messages and refining the quality of how messages are delivered. 
As we continue to evolve our integrated care delivery strategy, we have seen increased activity in our members' completion of health risk and in-home assessments, participation in our Go365 wellness platform and more effective engagement in our Humana At Home chronic care management program, which focuses on members most in need of health support. 
While there is still work to do, we are pleased with our progress to date. Over the course of this year, we've seen significant improvement in our Net Promoter Score relative to last year. For Medicare Advantage, through June 30, we have improved our relationship Net Promoter Score by more than 500 basis points and our transactional Net Promoter Score by more than 700 basis points. We believe our focus on eliminating friction points and providing enhanced value through health engagement positions us well for the future as we continue to improve the experience and health of our members. 
To support our strategy, we've developed a strong internal framework to advance our enterprise-wide commitment to quality, risk management, compliance and productivity. While these have always been top priority for us, we have renewed our focus on them, beginning with the recent announcement of Sam Deshpande to fill the newly created position of Senior Vice President and Chief Risk Officer. Sam and his team will help to drive integration throughout the enterprise, ensuring timely, proactive discovery and faster mitigation of risks and their causes.
In addition, last year, we created the Process Transformation Office to drive productivity throughout the organization, with a focus on improving our operating structure while also improving member experience and compliance. This renewed focus is evident on how we look at CMS Medicare Star ratings. 
As a background, it is important to note that the Stars program is complex not just for Humana, but the entire industry. A Star score is an aggregate of multiple measures, some having to do with quality; others with process, policies and procedures. 
There's a lagging indicator with scores for particular bonus years dependent on assessments that took place years previously. Many health plans, including Humana, implement remedial measures as a result of these assessments that are not reflected in the Star scores for the bonus year to which it is assigned. In addition, small movements in individual measurements can have significant impacts, positive or negative, on the overall score. 
With this in mind, we've disclosed in today's earnings release that for the bonus year 2018, we now expect approximately 74% of our Medicare members to be in 4-Star or higher plans, which compares favorably to our previous forecast of 37%. We are pleased with the final outcome for bonus year 2018 and have implemented operational changes that we expect will reduce volatility in future years.
Aside from our Star results, we're also proud of our strong HEDIS measures, demonstrating the achievement of clinical outcomes, which are at a record-high level for us. 
In closing, I'd like to thank Humana's associates for their outstanding efforts on behalf of our members, providers and our company. It is through their hard work and commitment that our company continues to deliver strong performance. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
29618,420306428,1269455,"Humana Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Humana Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the strong performance of our individual Medicare Advantage franchise resulted in adjusted EPS of $3.49 for the second quarter, well ahead of our previous expectations. We also raised our f",1359,"Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the strong performance of our individual Medicare Advantage franchise resulted in adjusted EPS of $3.49 for the second quarter, well ahead of our previous expectations. We also raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.50 from our previous adjusted EPS guidance of at least $11.10, and we increased our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $200 million due primarily to our better financial performance. 
As a percentage of adjusted full year earnings, we expect our third quarter to reflect adjusted EPS in the high-20% range, with the fourth quarter, therefore, comprising a percentage in the high teens as it incorporates the usual cost increases associated with the open enrollment season.
I will now highlight the drivers of each segment's operating performance. Led by individual Medicare Advantage, our Retail segment continues to significantly exceed our expectations. And today, we raised our full year 2017 Retail segment pretax income target by approximately $300 million at the midpoint of the guidance range. Consistent with the early indicators we saw in the first quarter, individual MA medical utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running favorably relative to our pricing assumptions, and we are seeing better-than-anticipated prior period medical claims development. We are also experiencing higher-than-expected revenue on a per member, per month basis. Accordingly, we reduced our projected full year benefit ratio for the Retail segment by a full 100 basis points from our previous guidance. 
Turning to our other businesses. Our Group and Specialty segment is continuing to have a solid year, and as a result, we raised our pretax target by approximately $20 million, at the midpoint of the guidance range. The increase was driven primarily by positive prior period claims development and specialty results that exceeded our previous expectations as well as current year medical cost trends that are slightly favorable to our expectations. We continue to believe that a key element of our strategy is a focus on small to mid-sized employers as well as our specialty dental and TRICARE businesses, as each delivers steady cash flow and good returns on capital. 
The Healthcare Services segment continues to generate profits and steady cash flow to the parent, and importantly, reflects the integration of our business model by delivering clinical excellence and trend benders for our insurance lines. Consistent with the first quarter, we are continuing to see lower-than-expected pharmacy volumes, which reflect less health plan drug utilization than we had previously anticipated. 
In addition, while to date, mail order rates are higher than last year, we are experiencing slightly lower penetration than we previously expected as some of our new stand-alone PDP members appear to be lower utilizers of mail order relative to historical experience. 
Finally, the optimization of our chronic care management programs, whereby we are ensuring that our members are receiving the right level of intervention at the right time, is proceeding at a faster pace than initially expected, also contributing to lower Healthcare Services segment pretax than anticipated. As a result of these items, we've reduced our pretax guidance for the segment by approximately $130 million, at the midpoint of our guidance range. 
To reiterate my comments from the first quarter call, this dynamic is positive for overall Humana, and we expect that the increase in health plan pretax income will more than offset the reductions in Healthcare Services segment profits, even considering that a meaningful portion of lower pharmacy utilization does not benefit the insurance segments due to the corresponding lower CMS reinsurance and member cost share. These dynamics reinforce our integrated approach to running the business, taking a holistic, enterprise-wide view to drive business decisions that result in the best outcomes for our members, providers and the company. 
To close our segment discussion, I will comment briefly on our Individual Commercial segment results, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS guidance. Our Individual Commercial segment is now expected to generate full year 2017 pretax earnings of approximately $85 million versus our previous expectation of a full year loss of approximately $45 million. These results reflect significant prior period development -- positive prior period development, which includes the net favorable settlement of the 2016 to ours  of reinsurance and risk adjustment as well as lower-than-expected utilization in our ACA on-exchange business. 
The strong performance we are seeing across the organization reflects our focus on operational excellence and the solid execution of our strategy. This will enable us in the third quarter to provide the Humana Foundation with a charitable contribution, reflecting our continued commitment to the communities we serve following the deal break.  In addition, these results will enable us to spend incremental dollars on the Medicare annual enrollment period. 
Lastly, our compensation policies result in changes in compensation, both up and down, depending on our operating performance, with some years resulting in higher compensation levels relative to others. We are accruing compensation for 2017 based on the strong results we have seen across the company. As a result, we have increased the range of our full year consolidated operating cost ratio guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint. 
Pivoting now to CMS Star ratings and our Medicare bids for 2018. We reported this morning that we now expect approximately 74% of our members to be in 4-Star or higher plans for the 2018 bonus year. We are pleased that we were able to significantly reduce the impact that the lower Star ratings would have had in our members in 2018 and that our final Star ratings reflect our commitment to quality products and services for our members. In particular, these ratings reflect our strong clinical HEDIS measures, which are at record-high levels. It is nonetheless important to note that there were certain contracts that we chose not to consolidate and still others that we were not able to consolidate due to state regulatory limitations. 
Taking this into account and considering rebate implications from reductions in Star ratings for certain of our contracts, we still expect to have some Stars-related financial headwinds for 2018. 
With regard to our 2018 Medicare Advantage bids that were submitted in June, we continue to work very hard to offset the negative impact that the return of the nondeductible health insurance fee and the remaining Stars-related financial headwinds could have on our members and the attractiveness of our products more broadly. We are focused on continuing to drive cost out of the organization and expect to make progress in this regard in 2018. The Process Transformation Office that Bruce referenced in his partnership with our various businesses is working diligently across segments to achieve increased productivity while improving and simplifying our core processes. 
Additionally, we have invested the 2017 outperformance I've discussed directly into our product designs for 2018. When combined with enhanced productivity, this has enabled us to keep benefits stable and competitive, and we believe will allow us to grow individual MA membership growth meaningfully in 2018 while maintaining our commitment to steady EPS growth. 
It is important to note that as we think about our 2018 earnings profile, our 2017 baseline remains our initial 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $11 at the high end, given the investment of the strong 2017 performance that I mentioned. 
Finally, I would like to reiterate our previously communicated capital deployment plans. As you're aware, we initiated a $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase, or ASR, in the first quarter of 2017, which we expect to settle in the third quarter. Upon completion of the ASR, we continue to expect to repurchase shares for the balance of the year and have the flexibility to spend up to $750 million under our existing authorization. Additionally, as Bruce indicated in his remarks, we continue to explore ways to accelerate our strategy in the home and with providers, including with M&A and other partnerships or collaborations. As discussed at our Investor Day, our capacity for cash M&A is approximately $3.5 billion while allowing us to maintain our investment-grade ratings. 
With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller."

Can you help us understand, when you say stable benefits, does that literally means stable, including premiums and the bulk of that differential has to get absorbed in earnings? Is that the message you're conveying today?"

It is fair to say that, number one, we are going to put products in the market that do have stable benefits, which means we've overcome the health insurance fee. Obviously, it's going to vary by market. But on a national basis, I think that's a fair way to think about it. It's also fair to say that the $0.50 you're talking about was reinvested into product design. But I think it's important to think about really the MER element of it, that 100 basis points that was reinvested into our product design. Some of the additional admin expenses that I mentioned around the foundation and compensation and other things are more onetime items. And so I think it's important to think about the investment as really the MER outperformance. And finally, as it relates to the HIF. Remember, the HIF is coming back next year. And so it's not as if we could take that $2.15 and invest it in benefits. It's just that we didn't have to claw it back that perhaps others may have had to if they put that into benefits for 2017."

The second thing I really need to reemphasize with the investors is the organization has been under somewhat of a cloud for the last few years as a result of the transaction that has been -- I think it has caused a little bit of a challenge and headwinds in the sales process, whether it was in central parts of the state where we were having to market against where it was announced we were going to sell membership to some of the other markets where it was looked upon as that it wasn't going to be a Humana product at some point in time.

I wonder if you could flesh out exactly what you're seeing there and the uptake. I know that's [ happened ] on your cost trend and [ I don't know if you can quantify that ]. As you mentioned the mail order rates not being as high and able to drill down to see why that's happening on the PBM side. And then lastly, on the specialty. I think you guys -- you're still looking at home health, and there was a proposal that just came out. I know you've put your emphasis on efforts  to help your existing business. But the proposal change of Medicare, the way that they think about paying for home health, and I wonder if that affects your interest in doing something there [indiscernible]."

So when we refer to specialty, what we were talking out in that context was our Group and Specialty segment and, specifically, our dental business, which has been outperforming. It's not something that we're prepared to quantify, but it's a business that we don't talk a lot about, but has, I think, done very, very nicely. Membership, higher than we expected as well as better claims experience. Secondly, as it relates to the home care side or the Humana At Home optimization, as we called it, and the mail order side, those are both in our Healthcare Services segments. On the optimization side, as we've said for a number of months now, we are spending a lot of time making sure that our members are getting the right level of care at the right time and that the right interventions are happening. And so if someone, for example, improves or gets better and no longer needs our services, that's a member we won't touch as many times. And I think we're being a lot more disciplined and operationally rigorous in ensuring that the members who truly need the care are getting the care. And so we continue to see very good results where the member is getting the right level of care, and that's where we're focused. But that does have a pretax implication for Healthcare Services because as we reduce effectively the charges, the intercompany charges to Medicare, Medicare benefits from a lower charge, but Healthcare Services gets impacted because there's lower pretax associated with that because there's a margin there. And so again, I think that's important as we talk about the integration of our model that we're constantly looking at what is the best decision for overall Humana and, more importantly, for our members and their clinical health. On the specialty side, on the specialty -- sorry, the pharmacy side and the mail order side, what we're referring to there is our mail order rate. And as I mentioned in our low-price Walmart plan, which has been and continues to be a very successful plan and a very good partnership with Walmart, we are seeing a slightly lower mail order rate than we had anticipated. We think it's probably because we made some tweaks to the benefit design that may be causing some of those members to fulfill -- to fill their prescriptions at retail rather than at mail. But again, overall, it's a -- there's an impact on Healthcare Services, but there's only a small impact to overall Humana because of the way the co-pay structure works with -- when someone fills at Retail. And then finally, I'm sure Bruce will comment on this as well, as it relates to home health, we continue to look at opportunities. We're obviously mindful of the rate release that came out. We're analyzing that, and I'll just leave it at that.

Today, we reported strong third quarter results and raised our full year adjusted 2017 earnings guidance. Our third quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $3.44 or $3.39 on an adjusted basis once again exceeded our previous expectations. Our individual Medicare Advantage business continued its strong performance, in line with our most recent guidance, and our Group and Specialty segment performed well ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to approximately $11.60, reflecting the improved Group and Specialty segment performance. This was partially offset by lower than the previously expected Healthcare Service segment pretax. Our full year 2017 GAAP EPS guidance is now approximately $17.62 per share. 
Over the last several years and particularly through -- throughout 2017, we've committed to productivity initiatives designed to promote operational excellence, accelerate our strategy, fund critical initiatives and advance our growth objectives. Following my remarks, Brian will comment on our third quarter results and some of the specific multifaceted productivity initiatives. 
In addition, in October, CMS published its updated Star quality rating bonus year 2019 showing that we have 12 contracts rated 4 Stars or above and 2.4 million members in 4-Star-or-above rated contracts to be offered in 2018. This represents approximately 74% of our Medicare Advantage membership as of July 31, 2017. 
We are pleased that Humana received a 4-Star rating for 5 Medicare Advantage contracts offered in 8 states, an increase from one such contract last year. 
All Humana Medicare Advantage HMO contracts in Florida received a 4.5-Star rating, improving our position with our provider partners. These higher ratings are expected to result in higher rebates in 2019. As discussed in our second quarter earnings call, over the last year, we've renewed our focus on Stars and have made operational changes to reduce volatility in future years. The effectiveness of which we believe is shown and improved results in certain Star measures. 
As our sharp focus on productivity continues to drive cost out of the system, one area we are making critical investments is around our providers. A key pillar of our strategy that we highlighted at our Investor Day in April is to partner with providers to support their transition to value-based care that fosters the management of health holistically. Medicare Advantage is one of the few reimbursement models that rewards holistic health management. The primary care physicians on their own, especially independent physicians, lack the capital, scale and expertise to make the investments in technology and analytics to -- necessary to thrive on a value-based environment. To that end, we are making investments in payer-agnostic care coordination technology and analytics capability that enable providers to be successful in the value-based models, using their administrative burden and enabling more time for clinical management of their patient population. 
In a recent study we completed based on 2016 results for Humana Medicare Advantage members affiliated with providers in Humana value-based reimbursement models, we found that medical costs for Medicare Advantage members affiliated with providers in value-based models were 15% lower versus those affiliated with physicians under original fee-for-service Medicare. In addition, HEDIS scores were 26% higher for providers in value-based arrangements with Humana than providers in standard Medicare Advantage settings. 
We will execute our provider strategy using a range of models that fit the unique characteristics of a local market. This includes owned senior-focused primary care clinics, many of which are payer-agnostic as well as joint ventures, alliance clinics and our MSO model where we will focus on supporting affiliated independent primary care providers. 
We spoke to you previously about our 2016 launch of 4 wholly owned clinics in Greenville, South Carolina. Membership growth in these markets have exceeded our initial expectations. And today, I want to share with you some early encouraging results that we saw between the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017. These results include a 5% reduction in admissions per thousand; a 24% decrease in readmissions per thousand; positive trends and member satisfaction with an improved Net Promoter Score; and improved Star scores associated with the patient experience. 
These results are a testament to the effectiveness of a value-based care model. During 2017, we opened 5 additional clinics, including 4 in Kansas City and 1 in North Carolina. 
In addition, we continue to sophisticated value-based alliance and joint venture partners in new markets. In 2017, we launched 15 new clinics in 7 markets. Among our alliance and joint venture relationships and our fully owned clinics we, today, operate 195 clinics across 27 markets. We will continue to evaluate further investments in M&A opportunities in the provider space that improve our position in priority markets or accelerate the advancement and expansion of our MSO platform. 
[indiscernible] with our provider strategy, we continue to be very focused on the home, as home is often a superior clinical environment to deliver care and reduce high-cost hospital admissions. In its current state, care in the home is often disconnected from primary care physicians, challenged with issues on timeliness of care, lacking in robust data exchange as well as based on a fee-for-service-driven business model. 
We've been utilizing our 6 existing Medicare certified home health agencies in Florida and Texas, along with enhanced relationships with high-performing agencies in select markets to pressure test some of these paradigms. Through these early tests and learned efforts, we've seen that these barriers can be overcome and member and provider experience can be improved. 
As we look to advance our integrated care delivery strategy and expand our access and reach in the home, we are taking a multifaceted approach, including, but not limited to, care coordination, remote monitoring, telemedicine and the provision of care in the home through nurses and doctors. Then insights we've gained from owning home health agencies demonstrates the value of having a home health platform to evolve capabilities and services, including integration of data, advancing moments of influence and transforming home health to value-based reimbursement. This model produces improved outcomes such as lower admissions, readmissions and emergency room visits in common high-cost conditions, including congestive heart failure, diabetes and COPD. This is a change from today's fee-for-service home health reimbursement model, which does not encourage the holistic management of health. It also provides us with an additional touch point with our members to enhance engagement, trust and close additional care gaps such as missing HEDIS measures. 
Many aspects of the care coordination are already in place, and we continue to look for ways to expand and optimize these capabilities. For example, our entry into the long-term support service business via our acquisition of American Healthcare in 2013. In the beginning of what is today our Humana At Home business with the acquisition of Senior Bridge in 2012, are becoming even more important as we continue to seek greater linkage of the Medicare population and Medicaid long-term support services. 
However, other aspects of this strategy, particularly the provision of care in the home, will require M&A and other partnerships for collaborations to effectively bring them to life, as we've discussed previously. In order to advance our strategy, we need to continue to evolve the capabilities of our Healthcare Service segment. Accordingly, over the last several months, we have been working on a newly refined operating model to better align the Healthcare Services segment strategy, business and processes. The new organization will afford us a greater opportunity to engage our members, patients, physicians and associates to drive the best possible financial and clinical outcomes. 
With this new organization, we recently named new leaders of both our home and pharmacy operations, who will work under the leadership of William Fleming, President of Healthcare Services. We welcome Kirk Allen to Humana to lead our home operations as President of Home Care. Kirk brings more than 20 years of experience in health care and was most recently the President of Essential Home and Executive Vice President of Home Care Services at Evolution Health. 
We also welcome to our -- lead our pharmacy operations as President of Humana Pharmacy Solutions. is a registered pharmacist who brings extensive operations, management and business development experience in both the retail and health care industries, most recently servicing -- serving as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President at Brookdale Senior Living. Prior to joining Brookdale in 2015, Labid served in executive leadership role for Walmart stores since 2009, most recently serving as President of Health and Wellness, which included managing retail pharmacies. 
Now to touch on 2018. We are confident in our Medicare Advantage competitive positioning despite the return of the health insurance industry fee in 2018. As a result of our overperformance in 2017 and various cost-saving measures, we've made targeted investments in our product design, clinical programs and operating processes, which enable us to maintain stable benefits, simplify the member experience and improve clinical outcomes. We've been proactive in our broker outreach this year, demonstrating for them our confidence in our stand-alone strategy and commitment to helping seniors achieve their best health. Additionally, we work to simplify the broker experience by investing in technologies that enables them to have 24/7 access to our information, with further plans to roll out simplified enrollment tools in 2018. As a result, we expect to return to meaningful individual Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2018. 
Brian will provide additional commentary on our 2018 in his remarks. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

As Bruce mentioned, today, we reported adjusted EPS of $3.39 for the third quarter, which is ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.60 from",2371,"Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, today, we reported adjusted EPS of $3.39 for the third quarter, which is ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.60 from our previous adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $11.50, and we increased our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $250 million at the midpoint to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion, primarily due to continued better-than-expected financial performance. 
Our Retail results are in line with our most recent forecast and continue to exceed -- significantly exceed our initial expectations for 2017, led by our Medicare Advantage business. Consistent with the first half of the year, third quarter MA medical utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running favorably relative to our pricing assumptions. In addition to our Retail segment producing strong results, our Group and Specialty segment significantly outperformed our previous expectations, primarily due to favorable prior period development and better-than-anticipated utilization trends. Trend is now running at the low end of our initial expectations of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. 
Accordingly, we raised our pretax target for this segment for the second consecutive quarter from a range of $320 million to $340 million to a range of $350 million to $400 million. We also decreased our benefit ratio expectation to a range of 79.0% to 79.25% compared to our previous range of 79.75% to 80.25%. 
The Group and Specialty segment continues to consistently deliver solid results due to the team's strong focus on productivity and on offering innovative products that resonate in the marketplace. We are pleased with the return on investment we generate from this segment. 
As we discussed last quarter, while the Healthcare Services segment continues to generate profits and steady cash flow to the parent, and importantly, reflects the integration of our business model by delivering clinical excellence and trend benders for our insurance lines, we continue to see lower-than-expected mail order utilization, particularly for new members in our Humana-Walmart stand-alone PDP offering. Today, we slightly lowered our pretax target range for this segment to $900 million to $950 million from our previous target of $925 million to $975 million. 
Turning to our Individual Commercial segment results, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS. We now expect Individual Commercial segment pretax income of approximately $150 million, up from our previous estimate of approximately $85 million. Consistent with last quarter, these results reflect significant positive prior period development as well as lower-than-expected utilization in our ACA-compliant business. 
With regard to cost share reduction payments, we do not expect the impact of the recent executive order to be material for us. 
As these collective results demonstrate, we've had a great year so far, with significant outperformance that has enabled us to take the opportunity to invest in our future, including higher AEP marketing spend. This outperformance also results in higher compensation as our performance-based compensation arrangements reward our associates for their excellent work. 
In addition, as Bruce discussed, we have taken significant actions to reduce administrative costs in a sustainable way for 2018 and beyond. Some of these measures have resulted in incremental spend in 2017, including investments in analytics and enabling technologies that have significantly advanced our integrated care delivery model such as investments in our big data and our customer relationship management, or CRM system, among others. Our big data environment now enables us to integrate and routinely mine status sources such as clinician notes, home health assessments and social determinants of health data. Through our CRM, we now have comprehensive longitudinal data view of our members, which helps us know our members deeply and engage them effectively. We have also made investments in the provider space to advance care coordination capabilities, focusing on interoperability and analytics to improve the provider experience. 
And lastly, we invested in a number of productivity and expense management initiatives related to internal management systems as well as vendor contracting and rationalizing our real estate footprint across the country. 
More fundamentally, we have completed the build-out of the Process Transformation Office, or PTO, and we recently named process champions and owners for 3 critical processes that together comprise over $1 billion in administrative spend. These include processing claims, resolving inquiries and issues and designing and delivering member communications. The PTO is working diligently with leaders throughout the organization to optimize these processes horizontally across silos and has already identified meaningful savings by connecting upstream and downstream workflows and eliminating inefficiencies while ultimately increasing automation. We believe that by focusing on these core areas and then extending the PTO to additional processes over time throughout the organization, we can continue to reduce administrative costs and increase the reliability of our processes while improving the member and provider experience that together will set us up for sustainable growth over the long term. 
Lastly, as a result of our efforts to continue to evolve and streamline the organization to align with our integrated care delivery strategy that Bruce has articulated, we've had to make some difficult decisions, including closing certain open roles and initiating both a voluntary Early Retirement Program and an involuntary workforce reduction program that are expected to impact approximately 2,700 employees or just under 6% of our workforce. In the third quarter of 2017, we recorded charges of $0.54 per diluted common share associated with these programs, which has been excluded from our adjusted EPS. This has resulted in a higher operating cost ratio than initially expected for 2017, and we now expect to end the year at or slightly above the higher end of our previous forecast range. We believe the combination of these investments and our associates' hard work during 2017 has positioned us for a solid 2018 in the face of significant headwinds, in particular, the return of the health insurance fee, or HIF. 
While we do not intend to provide specific 2018 guidance until our fourth quarter call, I will now offer some higher-level commentary and direction about next year. I'll begin with membership. We are only 1 month into the annual election period for our individual Medicare Advantage, but we are encouraged, albeit very cautious, with early sales results and our competitive positioning. Our philosophy heading into this enrollment season was to maintain stable benefits for our members and in some markets, improve benefits where we believe we were well positioned relative to the competition. We did this recognizing that the return of the HIF presented significant challenges given its magnitude. And therefore, as discussed previously, we invested our 2017 outperformance and made significant strides in administrative spend productivity to fund this benefit design for our customers. We believe that balancing growth and margin are paramount, and it was essential after 2 years of stagnant membership growth in no small part attributable to the Aetna transaction to drive our top line in a disciplined fashion that would enable us to achieve our EPS growth targets of 11% to 15% over the medium and longer term. In this process, we have also strengthened our relationships and enhanced our partnership with the external brokerage community, who along with our outstanding MarketPoint career sales organization, allows us to achieve this objective. 
Based on what we know today, achieving individual MA membership growth in the neighborhood of 150,000 to 180,000 lives is a reasonable estimate. And while there are scenarios that could certainly reduce that number, including a sales slowdown for the remainder of AEP, there are also factors that could increase it, including greater-than-expected retention of existing members and higher post-AEP sales figures than are currently forecasted. It is important to note that data on member retention is very limited at this point. 
I would also like to comment briefly on our forecast for group MA membership. Based on what we know today, which is significantly more certain than individual MA given the timing of the pricing cycle, we estimate membership growth to be comfortably in the low double digits on a percentage basis for 2018. This achievement will be the second consecutive year of double-digit percentage increases in a highly competitive business, particularly for jumbo accounts, while we have committed to remaining disciplined with our pricing. 
While we are pleased with our estimated growth in MA, there are some pressure in the competitive stand-alone PDP space for 2018. As you are likely aware, Humana offers 3 PDP plans, including a basic plan that serves among others, our low-income members; an enhance plan and a low-price Walmart plan, whose extraordinary growth has made us the leading individual PDP carrier in the country. 
With regard to the basic plan, we price to break-even contribution margin at a regional level. In Florida and South Carolina, our bid proved to be priced over the benchmark, which we anticipated, resulting in the loss of our auto-signed, low-income members in those states. Additionally, our enhance plan continues to lose members each year, but historically, this has been more than offset by the significant growth in our Walmart plan. This year, however, the Walmart plan is no longer the low-price plan in a number of markets as other carriers have priced more aggressively. And as a consequence, while we will still grow that plan, it will likely be at a materially lower rate. Collectively, therefore, we expect that our overall PDP business will decline by a few hundred thousand members. While the impact on PDP insurance profitability will not be meaningful, we expect the lower Walmart plan growth will impact the growth of our pharmacy business given the industry-leading mail order rates in this plan. 
I will now turn to making a few high-level comments regarding our projected 2018 financial performance. As we've discussed previously, Medicare Advantage membership growth drives top line revenue growth that is a critical component of our long-term EPS trajectory. Recall that MA membership growth not only benefits the health plans, but also feeds our Healthcare Services segment as our members engage with us in our pharmacy, home care and provider businesses. Moreover, we are able to achieve increased scale with our administrative spend as the top line increases, which helps drive the bottom line over time. 
From a profitability perspective, I have already highlighted the return of the HIF, which were overall Humana is a nondeductible fee in the neighborhood of $1 billion as well as impact -- as well as the impact of lower PDP growth on our pharmacy business as meaningful headwinds toward 2018 performance. It is also important to note that we will not assume that our mail order rate in the Walmart plan, while still very high, will recover from the lower levels of mail order usage that we have seen this year, particularly among the new members who joined us in 2017 and any members who select this plan for 2018. 
Our provider business also continues to face significant rate pressures in South Florida. Additionally, the Group and Specialty segment will have a timing headwind associated with the HIF due to the timing differences that result from group renewals that are not on a calendar year basis. 
And finally, there are certain stranded costs that result from our exit of the Individual Commercial business on January 1, 2018. Together, the HIF timing issue and individual business stranded costs represent a headwind of approximately $0.30. We expect to offset these headwinds through the productivity initiatives described above and capital deployment, both through share repurchase and M&A. It is important to recall that the impact of new Medicare Advantage members on profitability is relatively muted in the initial year before they are documented appropriately for the risk we are taking and are engaged in our clinical programs. 
Turning now to EPS. Recall that on last quarter's call, we discussed the need to begin with a baseline adjusted EPS of approximately $11, which is largely unchanged. It is also important to note that we have achieved EPS growth well in excess of our long-term range over the last several years. Additionally, we would anticipate guiding to a slightly wider range than we did in 2017, which should be more in line with historical practice given our anticipated greater MA growth in 2018 versus 2017, which can create slightly more uncertainty in our earnings forecasts. 
Finally, we would expect that the high end of our initial guidance range will be a bit below our long-term target of 11% to 15% growth, with our individual MA margin guide slightly below our 4.5% to 5% range. This reflects the significant headwinds that I've articulated and the importance of offering a compelling value proposition to our customers while continuing to invest in the build-out of our integrated care delivery model that will create long-term sustainability. 
Consistent with our historical practice, our 2018 initial guidance will assume a normalized rate of favorable prior period development for our Retail segment, which exceeded expectations in 2017 while assuming no favorable prior period development for our Group and Specialty segment. 
Finally, I would like to briefly discuss the recently announced deal to sell our nonstrategic closed block of long-term care insurance business. Upon consummation, we will have no remaining exposure to this business, where we have seen significant reserve strengthening over the last number of years. Based on the terms of the agreement, the transaction is expected to result in an estimated GAAP loss on sale of approximately $400 million or $2.75 EPS, which includes some noncash charges. That said, we do anticipate a net positive economic benefit for Humana as the $203 million of parent company cash contributed into the subsidiary, together with the transfer of approximately $150 million of statutory capital with the sale, should be more than offset by the estimated $500 million of cash savings associated with the expected tax treatment of the sale. We anticipate the transaction will close by the third quarter of 2018 subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Excluding the loss on sale, the company does not anticipate a material impact to earnings in 2017 or 2018 from the sale of the business.

Those rates have continued to be ratcheted down over the last few years. We've seen that multiple years in a row. I would tell you to date that the competition really hasn't changed fundamentally the benefit design there. And so as a consequence, I think people have just had to get better and better to continue to drive profitability. But there's no doubt that profitability has been reduced in the provider segment because of that -- because of those actions. We've also adjusted some of our contractual terms with our providers to help ease that transition and been very thoughtful about our benefit design and working with our provider partners. But net-net, it has had an impact on our overall profitability in that region in the provider business. As it relates to growth, as I said, I think the carriers, us included, I think have tried to be very prudent about how we deal with these rate declines and still offer compelling value proposition to members. And that's allowed us to continue to grow. I would tell you that were not for those provider -- those rate reductions, we would grow more. There's no doubt about it.

And then more broadly, on your pharmacy comments, you've been able to drill down as to what's happening in mail order. And I know you guys did a strategic review of pharmacy a few years ago, but there seems to be a whole lot of changes in the PBM landscape. Does that cause you to look at anything differently in partnerships, opportunities? And then your push for integrated models, I know guys are talking about engaging with the pharmacists more.

So effectively, what that does is it takes into account the PDP for '17 as we start our baseline. But as you think about '18, when we grow off that $11 base, we're not going to assume the same level of PPD that's occurred. So that's the distinction we make between the '17 PPD that's effectively reflected that outperformance is reflected in taking the baseline back to $11, but the '18 guide will not assume the same level of PPD that we've seen in '17. So hopefully, that makes sense. On the mail order side, I would separate the mail order reduction we've seen and some of the broader questions that you're asking. It's hard to know exactly what's driving the mail order reduction, particularly for the new members. We think it might have something to do with benefit design. It could have something to do with just the nature of the risk that we're attracting versus our -- versus the competition and where perhaps the higher utilizers are going. I think overall, we're benefiting from a health plan perspective in terms of the risk dynamic we're seeing, but it has an impact on the pharmacy profitability. More broadly, to your question on strategic reviews and cost, we constantly are looking for opportunities to drive cost out of the system. We continually review our cost of goods. We continue to look at our cost to fill. And I will tell you that the pharmacy team really does a fantastic job of being best-in-class in both of those areas as we look at the opportunities that are out there. But as we said multiple times, we are not wedded to any particular philosophy with regard to if we can find opportunities to drive out costs the system, we will do that. But what's critical for us is that the pharmacy is a critical -- clinical engagement opportunity of mechanism with our members. And so that can't change. But as it relates to cost, we are always open-minded. And I would tell you, these guys do a great job of driving best-in-class cost of goods for our plan and for the pharmacy."

In addition, we are continuously adding pharmacy locations through our provider areas where we will have a pharmacy inside our pharmacy -- inside our primary care clinics. And again, it's leveraging that moment of influence that the pharmacist has. We are finding mixed results in our relationships with the retail pharmacies and the clinical outcomes.

Today, we reported strong third quarter results and raised our full year adjusted 2017 earnings guidance. Our third quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $3.44 or $3.39 on an adjusted basis once again exceeded our previous expectations. Our individual Medicare Advantage business continued its strong performance, in line with our most recent guidance, and our Group and Specialty segment performed well ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to approximately $11.60, reflecting the improved Group and Specialty segment performance. This was partially offset by lower than previously expected Healthcare Service segment pretax. Our full year 2017 GAAP EPS guidance is now approximately $17.62 per share. 
Over the last several years and particularly throughout 2017, we've committed to productivity initiatives designed to promote operational excellence, accelerate our strategy, fund critical initiatives and advance our growth objectives. Following my remarks, Brian will comment on our third quarter results and some of the specific multifaceted productivity initiatives. 
In addition, in October, CMS published its updated Star quality rating bonus year 2019 showing that we have 12 contracts rated 4 Stars or above and 2.4 million members in 4-Star or above rated contracts to be offered in 2018. This represents approximately 74% of our Medicare Advantage membership as of July 31, 2017. 
We are pleased that Humana received a 4-Star rating for 5 Medicare Advantage contracts offered in 8 states, an increase from one such contract last year. 
All Humana Medicare Advantage HMO contracts in Florida received a 4.5-Star rating, improving our position with our provider partners. These higher ratings are expected to result in higher rebates in 2019. As discussed in our second quarter earnings call, over the last year, we've renewed our focus on Stars and have made operational changes to reduce volatility in future years, the effectiveness of which we believe is shown in improved results in certain Star measures. 
As our sharp focus on productivity continues to drive cost out of the system, one area we are making critical investments is around our providers. A key pillar of our strategy that we highlighted at our Investor Day in April is to partner with providers to support their transition to value-based care that fosters the management of health holistically. Medicare Advantage is one of the few reimbursement models that rewards holistic health management. The primary care physicians on their own, especially independent physicians, lack the capital, scale and expertise to make the investments in technology and analytics necessary to thrive in a value-based environment. To that end, we are making investments in payer-agnostic care coordination technology and analytics capability that enable providers to be successful in the value-based models, easing their administrative burden and enabling more time for clinical management of their patient population. 
In a recent study we completed based on 2016 results for Humana Medicare Advantage members affiliated with providers in Humana value-based reimbursement models, we found that medical costs for Medicare Advantage members affiliated with providers in value-based models were 15% lower versus those affiliated with physicians under original fee-for-service Medicare. In addition, HEDIS scores were 26% higher for providers in value-based arrangements with Humana than providers in standard Medicare Advantage settings. 
We will execute our provider strategy using a range of models that fit the unique characteristics of a local market. This includes owned senior-focused primary care clinics, many of which are payer-agnostic, as well as joint ventures, alliance clinics and our MSO model, where we will focus on supporting affiliated independent primary care providers. 
We spoke to you previously about our 2016 launch of 4 wholly-owned clinics in Greenville, South Carolina. Membership growth in these markets have exceeded our initial expectations. And today, I want to share with you some early encouraging results that we saw between the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017. These results include a 5% reduction in admissions per thousand, a 24% decrease in readmissions per thousand, positive trends in member satisfaction with an improved Net Promoter Score and improved Star scores associated with the patient experience. These results are a testament to the effectiveness of a value-based care model. 
During 2017, we opened 5 additional clinics, including 4 in Kansas City and 1 in North Carolina. 
In addition, we continue to develop sophisticated value-based alliance and joint venture partners in new markets. In 2017, we launched 15 new clinics in 7 markets. Among our alliance and joint venture relationships and our fully-owned clinics, we today operate 195 clinics across 27 markets. 
We will continue to evaluate further investments in M&A opportunities in the provider space that improve our position in priority markets or accelerate the advancement and expansion of our MSO platform. 
Interwoven with our provider strategy, we continue to be very focused on the home, as home is often a superior clinical environment to deliver care and reduce high cost hospital admissions. In its current state, care in the home is often disconnected from primary care physicians, challenged with issues on timeliness of care, lacking in robust data exchange, as well as based on a fee-for-service driven business model. 
We've been utilizing our 6 existing Medicare certified home health agencies in Florida and Texas, along with enhanced relationships with high-performing agencies in select markets to pressure-test some of these paradigms. Through these early tests and learned efforts, we've seen that these barriers can be overcome and the member and provider experience can be improved. 
As we look to advance our integrated care delivery strategy and expand our access and reach in the home, we are taking a multifaceted approach, including, but not limited to, care coordination, remote monitoring, telemedicine and the provision of care in the home through nurses and doctors. The insights we've gained from owning home health agencies demonstrates the value of having a home health platform to evolve capabilities and services, including integration of data, advancing moments of influence and transforming home health to value-based reimbursement. 
This model produces improved outcomes such as lower admissions, readmissions and emergency room visits in common high cost conditions, including congestive heart failure, diabetes and COPD. This is a change from today's fee-for-service home health reimbursement model, which does not encourage the holistic management of health. It also provides us with an additional touch point with our members to enhance engagement, trust and close additional care gaps, such as missing HEDIS measures. 
Many aspects of care coordination are already in place, and we continue to look for ways to expand and optimize these capabilities. For example, our entry into the long-term support service business via our acquisition of American Eldercare in 2013 and the beginning of what is today our Humana At Home business with the acquisition of SeniorBridge in 2012 are becoming even more important as we continue to seek greater linkage of the Medicare D-SNP population and Medicaid long-term support services. 
However, other aspects of this strategy, particularly the provision of care in the home, will require M&A and other partnerships or collaborations to effectively bring them to life, as we've discussed previously. 
In order to advance our strategy, we need to continue to evolve the capabilities of our Healthcare Service segment. Accordingly, over the last several months, we have been working on a newly refined operating model to better align the Healthcare Services segment strategy, business and processes. The new organization will afford us a greater opportunity to engage our members, patients, physicians and associates to drive the best possible financial and clinical outcomes. 
With this new organization, we recently named new leaders of both our Home and Pharmacy operations, who will work under the leadership of William Fleming, President of Healthcare Services. We welcome Kirk Allen to Humana to lead our Home operations as President of Home Care. Kirk brings more than 20 years experience in health care and was most recently the President of Ascension At Home and Executive Vice President of Home Care Services at Evolution Health. 
We also welcome Labeed Diab to lead our Pharmacy operations as President of Humana Pharmacy Solutions. Labeed is a registered pharmacist who brings extensive operations, management and business development experience in both the retail and health care industries, most recently servicing -- serving as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President at Brookdale Senior Living. Prior to joining Brookdale in 2015, Labeed served in executive leadership roles for Walmart stores since 2009, most recently serving as President of Health and Wellness, which included managing retail pharmacies. 
Now to touch on 2018. We are confident in our Medicare Advantage competitive positioning despite the return of the health insurance industry fee in 2018. As a result of our overperformance in 2017 and various cost-saving measures, we've made targeted investments in our product design, clinical programs and operating processes, which enable us to maintain stable benefits, simplify the member experience and improve clinical outcomes. We've been proactive in our broker outreach this year, demonstrating for them our confidence in our stand-alone strategy and commitment to helping seniors achieve their best health. Additionally, we worked to simplify the broker experience by investing in technologies that enables them to have 24/7 access to our information, with further plans to roll out simplified enrollment tools in 2018. As a result, we expect to return to meaningful individual Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2018. 
Brian will provide additional commentary on our 2018 in his remarks. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

As Bruce mentioned, today we reported adjusted EPS of $3.39 for the third quarter, which is ahead of our previous expectations.

As Bruce mentioned, today we reported adjusted EPS of $3.39 for the third quarter, which is ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.60 from our previous adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $11.50, and we increased our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $250 million at the midpoint to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion, primarily due to continued better-than-expected financial performance. 
Our Retail results are in line with our most recent forecasts and continue to exceed -- significantly exceed our initial expectations for 2017, led by our Medicare Advantage business. Consistent with the first half of the year, third quarter MA medical utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running favorably relative to our pricing assumptions. In addition to our Retail segment producing strong results, our Group and Specialty segment significantly outperformed our previous expectations, primarily due to favorable prior period development and better-than-anticipated utilization trends. Trend is now running at the low end of our initial expectations of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. 
Accordingly, we raised our pretax target for this segment for the second consecutive quarter from a range of $320 million to $340 million to a range of $350 million to $400 million. We also decreased our benefit ratio expectation to a range of 79.0% to 79.25% compared to our previous range of 79.75% to 80.25%. 
The Group and Specialty segment continues to consistently deliver solid results due to the team's strong focus on productivity and on offering innovative products that resonate in the marketplace. We are pleased with the return on investment we generate from this segment. 
As we discussed last quarter, while the Healthcare Services segment continues to generate profits and steady cash flow to the parent, and importantly, reflects the integration of our business model by delivering clinical excellence and trend benders for our insurance lines, we continue to see lower-than-expected mail order utilization, particularly for new members in our Humana-Walmart stand-alone PDP offering. Today, we slightly lowered our pretax target range for this segment to $900 million to $950 million from our previous target of $925 million to $975 million. 
Turning to our Individual Commercial segment results, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS, we now expect Individual Commercial segment pretax income of approximately $150 million, up from our previous estimate of approximately $85 million. Consistent with last quarter, these results reflect significant positive prior period development as well as lower-than-expected utilization in our ACA-compliant business. 
With regard to cost share reduction payments, we do not expect the impact of the recent executive order to be material for us. 
As these collective results demonstrate, we've had a great year so far, with significant outperformance that has enabled us to take the opportunity to invest in our future, including higher AEP marketing spend. This outperformance also results in higher compensation as our performance-based compensation arrangements reward our associates for their excellent work. 
In addition, as Bruce discussed, we have taken significant actions to reduce administrative costs in a sustainable way for 2018 and beyond. Some of these measures have resulted in incremental spend in 2017, including investments in analytics and enabling technologies that have significantly advanced our integrated care delivery model, such as investments in our big data and our customer relationship management, or CRM, system, among others. Our big data environment now enables us to integrate and routinely mine data sources such as clinician notes, home health assessments and social determinants of health data. Through our CRM, we now have a comprehensive longitudinal data view of our members, which helps us know our members deeply and engage them effectively. We have also made investments in the provider space to advance care coordination capabilities, focusing on interoperability and analytics to improve the provider experience. 
And lastly, we invested in a number of productivity and expense management initiatives related to internal management systems as well as vendor contracting and rationalizing our real estate footprint across the country. 
More fundamentally, we have completed the build-out of the Process Transformation Office, or PTO, and we recently named process champions and owners for 3 critical processes that together comprise over $1 billion in administrative spend. These include processing claims, resolving inquiries and issues and designing and delivering member communications. The PTO is working diligently with leaders throughout the organization to optimize these processes horizontally across silos and has already identified meaningful savings by connecting upstream and downstream workflows and eliminating inefficiencies while ultimately increasing automation. We believe that by focusing on these core areas and then extending the PTO to additional processes over time throughout the organization, we can continue to reduce administrative costs and increase the reliability of our processes while improving the member and provider experience that together will set us up for sustainable growth over the long term. 
Lastly, as a result of our efforts to continue to evolve and streamline the organization to align with our integrated care delivery strategy that Bruce has articulated, we've had to make some difficult decisions, including closing certain open roles and initiating both a voluntary early retirement program and an involuntary workforce reduction program that are expected to impact approximately 2,700 employees or just under 6% of our workforce. 
In the third quarter of 2017, we recorded charges of $0.54 per diluted common share associated with these programs, which has been excluded from our adjusted EPS. This has resulted in a higher operating cost ratio than initially expected for 2017, and we now expect to end the year at or slightly above the higher end of our previous forecast range. We believe the culmination of these investments and our associates' hard work during 2017 has positioned us for a solid 2018 in the face of significant headwinds, in particular the return of the health insurance fee, or HIF. 
While we do not intend to provide specific 2018 guidance until our fourth quarter call, I will now offer some higher level commentary and direction about next year. I'll begin with membership. We are only 1 month into the annual election period for our individual Medicare Advantage, but we are encouraged, albeit very cautious, with early sales results and our competitive positioning. Our philosophy heading into this enrollment season was to maintain stable benefits for our members and in some markets improve benefits where we believe we were well positioned relative to the competition. We did this recognizing that the return of the HIF presented significant challenges given its magnitude, and therefore, as discussed previously, we invested our 2017 outperformance and made significant strides in administrative spend productivity to fund this benefit design for our customers. 
We believe that balancing growth and margin are paramount, and it was essential after 2 years of stagnant membership growth, in no small part attributable to the Aetna transaction, to drive our top line in a disciplined fashion that would enable us to achieve our EPS growth targets of 11% to 15% over the medium and longer term. In this process, we have also strengthened our relationships and enhanced our partnership with the external brokerage community, who, along with our outstanding MarketPoint career sales organization, allows us to achieve this objective. 
Based on what we know today, achieving individual MA membership growth in the neighborhood of 150,000 to 180,000 lives is a reasonable estimate. And while there are scenarios that could certainly reduce that number, including a sales slowdown for the remainder of AEP, there are also factors that could increase it, including greater-than-expected retention of existing members and higher post-AEP sales figures than are currently forecasted. It is important to note that data on member retention is very limited at this point. 
I would also like to comment briefly on our forecast for group MA membership. Based on what we know today, which is significantly more certain than individual MA given the timing of the pricing cycle, we estimate membership growth to be comfortably in the low double digits on a percentage basis for 2018. This achievement will be the second consecutive year of double-digit percentage increases in a highly competitive business, particularly for jumbo accounts, where we have committed to remaining disciplined with our pricing. 
While we are pleased with our estimated growth in MA, there is some pressure in the competitive stand-alone PDP space for 2018. As you are likely aware, Humana offers 3 PDP plans, including a basic plan that serves, among others, our low-income members; an enhanced plan; and a low-price Walmart plan, whose extraordinary growth has made us the leading individual PDP carrier in the country. 
With regard to the basic plan, we price to break-even contribution margin at a regional level. In Florida and South Carolina, our bid proved to be priced over the benchmark, which we anticipated, resulting in the loss of our auto-signed, low-income members in those states. Additionally, our enhanced plan continues to lose members each year, but historically, this has been more than offset by the significant growth in our Walmart plan. This year, however, the Walmart plan is no longer the low-price plan in a number of markets as other carriers have priced more aggressively. And as a consequence, while we will still grow that plan, it will likely be at a materially lower rate. Collectively, therefore, we expect that our overall PDP business will decline by a few hundred thousand members. While the impact on PDP insurance profitability will not be meaningful, we expect the lower Walmart plan growth will impact the growth of our pharmacy business given the industry-leading mail order rates in this plan. 
I will now turn to making a few high-level comments regarding our projected 2018 financial performance. As we've discussed previously, Medicare Advantage membership growth drives top line revenue growth that is a critical component of our long-term EPS trajectory. Recall that MA membership growth not only benefits the health plans but also feeds our Healthcare Services segment as our members engage with us in our Pharmacy, Home Care and Provider businesses. Moreover, we are able to achieve increased scale with our administrative spend as the top line increases, which helps drive the bottom line over time. 
From a profitability perspective, I have already highlighted the return of the HIF, which, for overall Humana, is a nondeductible fee in the neighborhood of $1 billion, as well as the impact of lower PDP growth on our Pharmacy business as meaningful headwinds to our 2018 performance. It is also important to note that we will not assume that our mail order rate in the Walmart plan, while still very high, will recover from the lower levels of mail order usage that we have seen this year, particularly among the new members who joined us in 2017 and any members who select this plan for 2018. 
Our Provider business also continues to face significant rate pressures in South Florida. Additionally, the Group and Specialty segment will have a timing headwind associated with the HIF due to the timing differences that result from group renewals that are not on a calendar year basis. 
And finally, there are certain stranded costs that result from our exit of the Individual Commercial business on January 1, 2018. Together, the HIF timing issue and Individual Business stranded costs represent a headwind of approximately $0.30. We expect to offset these headwinds through the productivity initiatives described above and capital deployment, both through share repurchase and M&A. It is important to recall that the impact of new Medicare Advantage members on profitability is relatively muted in the initial year before they are documented appropriately for the risk we are taking and are engaged in our clinical programs. 
Turning now to EPS. Recall that on last quarter's call, we discussed the need to begin with a baseline-adjusted EPS of approximately $11, which is largely unchanged. It is also important to note that we have achieved EPS growth well in excess of our long-term range over the last several years. Additionally, we would anticipate guiding to a slightly wider range than we did in 2017, which will be more in line with historical practice given our anticipated greater MA growth in 2018 versus 2017, which can create slightly more uncertainty in our earnings forecasts. 
Finally, we would expect that the high end of our initial guidance range will be a bit below our long-term target of 11% to 15% growth, with our individual MA margin guide slightly below our 4.5% to 5% range. This reflects the significant headwinds that I've articulated and the importance of offering a compelling value proposition to our customers while continuing to invest in the build-out of our integrated care delivery model that will create long-term sustainability. 
Consistent with our historical practice, our 2018 initial guidance will assume a normalized rate of favorable prior period development for our Retail segment, which exceeded expectations in 2017, while assuming no favorable prior period development for our Group and Specialty segment. 
Finally, I would like to briefly discuss the recently announced deal to sell our nonstrategic closed block of long-term care insurance business. Upon consummation, we will have no remaining exposure to this business, where we have seen significant reserve strengthening over the last number of years. Based on the terms of the agreement, the transaction is expected to result in an estimated GAAP loss on sale of approximately $400 million or $2.75 EPS, which includes some noncash charges. 
That said, we do anticipate a net positive economic benefit for Humana as the $203 million of parent company cash contributed into the subsidiary, together with the transfer of approximately $150 million of statutory capital with the sale, should be more than offset by the estimated $500 million of cash savings associated with the expected tax treatment of the sale. We anticipate the transaction will close by the third quarter of 2018 subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Excluding the loss on sale, the company does not anticipate a material impact to earnings in 2017 or 2018 from the sale of the business. 
With that, we'll open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller."

Those rates have continued to be ratcheted down over the last few years. We've seen that multiple years in a row. I would tell you to date that the competition really hasn't changed fundamentally the benefit design there. And so as a consequence, I think people have just had to get better and better to continue to drive profitability. But there's no doubt that profitability has been reduced in the Provider segment because of that -- because of those actions. 
We've also adjusted some of our contractual terms with our providers to help ease that transition and been very thoughtful about our benefit design and working with our provider partners. But net-net, it has had an impact on our overall profitability in that region in the Provider business. 
As it relates to growth, as I said, I think the carriers, us included, I think have tried to be very prudent about how we deal with these rate declines and still offer compelling value proposition to members, and that's allowed us to continue to grow.

But as you think about '18, when we grow off that $11 base, we're not going to assume the same level of PPD that's occurred. So that's the distinction we make between the '17 PPD that's effectively reflected -- that outperformance is reflected in taking the baseline back to $11, but the '18 guide will not assume the same level of PPD that we've seen in '17. So hopefully that makes sense. 
On the mail order side, I would separate the mail order reduction we've seen and some of the broader questions that you're asking. It's hard to know exactly what's driving the mail order reduction, particularly for the new members. We think it might have something to do with benefit design. It could have something to do with just the nature of the risk that we're attracting versus our -- versus the competition and where perhaps the higher utilizers are going. I think overall we're benefiting, from a health plan perspective, in terms of the risk dynamic we're seeing, but it has had an impact on the pharmacy profitability. 
More broadly, to your question on strategic reviews and cost, we constantly are looking for opportunities to drive cost out of the system. We continually review our cost of goods. We continue to look at our cost to fill. And I will tell you that the Pharmacy team really does a fantastic job of being best-in-class in both those areas as we look at the opportunities that are out there. But as we've said multiple times, we are not wedded to any particular philosophy with regard to -- if we can find opportunities to drive out costs in the system, we will do that. But what's critical for us is that the Pharmacy is a critical -- clinical engagement opportunity mechanism with our members. And so that can't change. But as it relates to cost, we are always open-minded. And I will tell you, these guys do a great job of driving best-in-class cost of goods for our plan and for the Pharmacy."

In addition, we are continuously adding pharmacy locations to our provider areas where we will have a pharmacy inside our pharmacy -- inside our primary care clinics. And again, it's leveraging that moment of influence that the pharmacist has. We are finding mixed results in our relationships with the retail pharmacies and clinical outcomes. We find where it's convenient and it's more in a clinical setting it's more effective than it is in the retail setting. But I think that's also just the time that the pharmacist has at the counter to be able to have that engagement."

We believe that we have superior clinical programs and the right operating model to capitalize on that growth. But there's no doubt that we're facing a much stronger competitive environment. 
And I would say that's been compounded by the fact that we have this massive health insurance fee that's returning in 2018. That impacts the customer, and it impacts the industry. And so I think those 2 factors have required us to take significant action, which we've done this year, and invest some of the outperformance that we've done -- that we've had this year into our 2018 benefit design. But long term, I'll tell you, we feel very good about how we're positioned."

And as you look at our investments, it's really focused on how we continuously proactively help people with, especially chronic members, in managing their conditions. 
And I think long term, all organizations to be in this business are going to have to have some really clinical strength. And we believe in the short run we have to meet the competitive natures of pricing relative to the number of players being in the marketplace. But long term, we have to invest and build those clinical outcomes. And it's the combination of those 2 things you see the organization doing."

Today, we reported strong third quarter results and raised our full year adjusted 2017 earnings guidance. Our third quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $3.44 or $3.39 on an adjusted basis once again exceeded our previous expectations. Our individual Medicare Advantage business continued its strong performance, in line with our most recent guidance, and our Group and Specialty segment performed well ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to approximately $11.60, reflecting the improved Group and Specialty segment performance. This was partially offset by lower than previously expected Healthcare Service segment pretax. Our full year 2017 GAAP EPS guidance is now approximately $17.62 per share. 
Over the last several years and particularly throughout 2017, we've committed to productivity initiatives designed to promote operational excellence, accelerate our strategy, fund critical initiatives and advance our growth objectives. Following my remarks, Brian will comment on our third quarter results and some of the specific multifaceted productivity initiatives. 
In addition, in October, CMS published its updated Star quality rating bonus year 2019 showing that we have 12 contracts rated 4 Stars or above and 2.4 million members in 4-Star or above rated contracts to be offered in 2018. This represents approximately 74% of our Medicare Advantage membership as of July 31, 2017. 
We are pleased that Humana received a 4-Star rating for 5 Medicare Advantage contracts offered in 8 states, an increase from one such contract last year. 
All Humana Medicare Advantage HMO contracts in Florida received a 4.5-Star rating, improving our position with our provider partners. These higher ratings are expected to result in higher rebates in 2019. As discussed in our second quarter earnings call, over the last year, we've renewed our focus on Stars and have made operational changes to reduce volatility in future years, the effectiveness of which we believe is shown in improved results in certain Star measures. 
As our sharp focus on productivity continues to drive cost out of the system, one area we are making critical investments is around our providers. A key pillar of our strategy that we highlighted at our Investor Day in April is to partner with providers to support their transition to value-based care that fosters the management of health holistically. Medicare Advantage is one of the few reimbursement models that rewards holistic health management. The primary care physicians on their own, especially independent physicians, lack the capital, scale and expertise to make the investments in technology and analytics necessary to thrive in a value-based environment. To that end, we are making investments in payer-agnostic care coordination technology and analytics capability that enable providers to be successful in the value-based models, easing their administrative burden and enabling more time for clinical management of their patient population. 
In a recent study we completed based on 2016 results for Humana Medicare Advantage members affiliated with providers in Humana value-based reimbursement models, we found that medical costs for Medicare Advantage members affiliated with providers in value-based models were 15% lower versus those affiliated with physicians under original fee-for-service Medicare. In addition, HEDIS scores were 26% higher for providers in value-based arrangements with Humana than providers in standard Medicare Advantage settings. 
We will execute our provider strategy using a range of models that fit the unique characteristics of a local market. This includes owned senior-focused primary care clinics, many of which are payer-agnostic, as well as joint ventures, alliance clinics and our MSO model, where we will focus on supporting affiliated independent primary care providers. 
We spoke to you previously about our 2016 launch of 4 wholly-owned clinics in Greenville, South Carolina. Membership growth in these markets have exceeded our initial expectations. And today, I want to share with you some early encouraging results that we saw between the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017. These results include a 5% reduction in admissions per thousand, a 24% decrease in readmissions per thousand, positive trends in member satisfaction with an improved Net Promoter Score and improved Star scores associated with the patient experience. These results are a testament to the effectiveness of a value-based care model. 
During 2017, we opened 5 additional clinics, including 4 in Kansas City and 1 in North Carolina. 
In addition, we continue to develop sophisticated value-based alliance and joint venture partners in new markets. In 2017, we launched 15 new clinics in 7 markets. Among our alliance and joint venture relationships and our fully-owned clinics, we today operate 195 clinics across 27 markets. 
We will continue to evaluate further investments in M&A opportunities in the provider space that improve our position in priority markets or accelerate the advancement and expansion of our MSO platform. 
Interwoven with our provider strategy, we continue to be very focused on the home, as home is often a superior clinical environment to deliver care and reduce high cost hospital admissions. In its current state, care in the home is often disconnected from primary care physicians, challenged with issues on timeliness of care, lacking in robust data exchange, as well as based on a fee-for-service driven business model. 
We've been utilizing our 6 existing Medicare certified home health agencies in Florida and Texas, along with enhanced relationships with high-performing agencies in select markets to pressure-test some of these paradigms. Through these early tests and learned efforts, we've seen that these barriers can be overcome and the member and provider experience can be improved. 
As we look to advance our integrated care delivery strategy and expand our access and reach in the home, we are taking a multifaceted approach, including, but not limited to, care coordination, remote monitoring, telemedicine and the provision of care in the home through nurses and doctors. The insights we've gained from owning home health agencies demonstrates the value of having a home health platform to evolve capabilities and services, including integration of data, advancing moments of influence and transforming home health to value-based reimbursement. 
This model produces improved outcomes such as lower admissions, readmissions and emergency room visits in common high cost conditions, including congestive heart failure, diabetes and COPD. This is a change from today's fee-for-service home health reimbursement model, which does not encourage the holistic management of health. It also provides us with an additional touch point with our members to enhance engagement, trust and close additional care gaps, such as missing HEDIS measures. 
Many aspects of care coordination are already in place, and we continue to look for ways to expand and optimize these capabilities. For example, our entry into the long-term support service business via our acquisition of American Eldercare in 2013 and the beginning of what is today our Humana At Home business with the acquisition of SeniorBridge in 2012 are becoming even more important as we continue to seek greater linkage of the Medicare D-SNP population and Medicaid long-term support services. 
However, other aspects of this strategy, particularly the provision of care in the home, will require M&A and other partnerships or collaborations to effectively bring them to life, as we've discussed previously. 
In order to advance our strategy, we need to continue to evolve the capabilities of our Healthcare Service segment. Accordingly, over the last several months, we have been working on a newly refined operating model to better align the Healthcare Services segment strategy, business and processes. The new organization will afford us a greater opportunity to engage our members, patients, physicians and associates to drive the best possible financial and clinical outcomes. 
With this new organization, we recently named new leaders of both our Home and Pharmacy operations, who will work under the leadership of William Fleming, President of Healthcare Services. We welcome Kirk Allen to Humana to lead our Home operations as President of Home Care. Kirk brings more than 20 years experience in health care and was most recently the President of Ascension At Home and Executive Vice President of Home Care Services at Evolution Health. 
We also welcome Labeed Diab to lead our Pharmacy operations as President of Humana Pharmacy Solutions. Labeed is a registered pharmacist who brings extensive operations, management and business development experience in both the retail and health care industries, most recently servicing -- serving as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President at Brookdale Senior Living. Prior to joining Brookdale in 2015, Labeed served in executive leadership roles for Walmart stores since 2009, most recently serving as President of Health and Wellness, which included managing retail pharmacies. 
Now to touch on 2018. We are confident in our Medicare Advantage competitive positioning despite the return of the health insurance industry fee in 2018. As a result of our overperformance in 2017 and various cost-saving measures, we've made targeted investments in our product design, clinical programs and operating processes, which enable us to maintain stable benefits, simplify the member experience and improve clinical outcomes. We've been proactive in our broker outreach this year, demonstrating for them our confidence in our stand-alone strategy and commitment to helping seniors achieve their best health. Additionally, we worked to simplify the broker experience by investing in technologies that enables them to have 24/7 access to our information, with further plans to roll out simplified enrollment tools in 2018. As a result, we expect to return to meaningful individual Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2018. 
Brian will provide additional commentary on our 2018 in his remarks. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

As Bruce mentioned, today we reported adjusted EPS of $3.39 for the third quarter, which is ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.60 from o",2368,"Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, today we reported adjusted EPS of $3.39 for the third quarter, which is ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.60 from our previous adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $11.50, and we increased our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $250 million at the midpoint to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion, primarily due to continued better-than-expected financial performance. 
Our Retail results are in line with our most recent forecasts and continue to exceed -- significantly exceed our initial expectations for 2017, led by our Medicare Advantage business. Consistent with the first half of the year, third quarter MA medical utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running favorably relative to our pricing assumptions. In addition to our Retail segment producing strong results, our Group and Specialty segment significantly outperformed our previous expectations, primarily due to favorable prior period development and better-than-anticipated utilization trends. Trend is now running at the low end of our initial expectations of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. 
Accordingly, we raised our pretax target for this segment for the second consecutive quarter from a range of $320 million to $340 million to a range of $350 million to $400 million. We also decreased our benefit ratio expectation to a range of 79.0% to 79.25% compared to our previous range of 79.75% to 80.25%. 
The Group and Specialty segment continues to consistently deliver solid results due to the team's strong focus on productivity and on offering innovative products that resonate in the marketplace. We are pleased with the return on investment we generate from this segment. 
As we discussed last quarter, while the Healthcare Services segment continues to generate profits and steady cash flow to the parent, and importantly, reflects the integration of our business model by delivering clinical excellence and trend benders for our insurance lines, we continue to see lower-than-expected mail order utilization, particularly for new members in our Humana-Walmart stand-alone PDP offering. Today, we slightly lowered our pretax target range for this segment to $900 million to $950 million from our previous target of $925 million to $975 million. 
Turning to our Individual Commercial segment results, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS, we now expect Individual Commercial segment pretax income of approximately $150 million, up from our previous estimate of approximately $85 million. Consistent with last quarter, these results reflect significant positive prior period development as well as lower-than-expected utilization in our ACA-compliant business. 
With regard to cost share reduction payments, we do not expect the impact of the recent executive order to be material for us. 
As these collective results demonstrate, we've had a great year so far, with significant outperformance that has enabled us to take the opportunity to invest in our future, including higher AEP marketing spend. This outperformance also results in higher compensation as our performance-based compensation arrangements reward our associates for their excellent work. 
In addition, as Bruce discussed, we have taken significant actions to reduce administrative costs in a sustainable way for 2018 and beyond. Some of these measures have resulted in incremental spend in 2017, including investments in analytics and enabling technologies that have significantly advanced our integrated care delivery model, such as investments in our big data and our customer relationship management, or CRM, system, among others. Our big data environment now enables us to integrate and routinely mine data sources such as clinician notes, home health assessments and social determinants of health data. Through our CRM, we now have a comprehensive longitudinal data view of our members, which helps us know our members deeply and engage them effectively. We have also made investments in the provider space to advance care coordination capabilities, focusing on interoperability and analytics to improve the provider experience. 
And lastly, we invested in a number of productivity and expense management initiatives related to internal management systems as well as vendor contracting and rationalizing our real estate footprint across the country. 
More fundamentally, we have completed the build-out of the Process Transformation Office, or PTO, and we recently named process champions and owners for 3 critical processes that together comprise over $1 billion in administrative spend. These include processing claims, resolving inquiries and issues and designing and delivering member communications. The PTO is working diligently with leaders throughout the organization to optimize these processes horizontally across silos and has already identified meaningful savings by connecting upstream and downstream workflows and eliminating inefficiencies while ultimately increasing automation. We believe that by focusing on these core areas and then extending the PTO to additional processes over time throughout the organization, we can continue to reduce administrative costs and increase the reliability of our processes while improving the member and provider experience that together will set us up for sustainable growth over the long term. 
Lastly, as a result of our efforts to continue to evolve and streamline the organization to align with our integrated care delivery strategy that Bruce has articulated, we've had to make some difficult decisions, including closing certain open roles and initiating both a voluntary early retirement program and an involuntary workforce reduction program that are expected to impact approximately 2,700 employees or just under 6% of our workforce. 
In the third quarter of 2017, we recorded charges of $0.54 per diluted common share associated with these programs, which has been excluded from our adjusted EPS. This has resulted in a higher operating cost ratio than initially expected for 2017, and we now expect to end the year at or slightly above the higher end of our previous forecast range. We believe the culmination of these investments and our associates' hard work during 2017 has positioned us for a solid 2018 in the face of significant headwinds, in particular the return of the health insurance fee, or HIF. 
While we do not intend to provide specific 2018 guidance until our fourth quarter call, I will now offer some higher level commentary and direction about next year. I'll begin with membership. We are only 1 month into the annual election period for our individual Medicare Advantage, but we are encouraged, albeit very cautious, with early sales results and our competitive positioning. Our philosophy heading into this enrollment season was to maintain stable benefits for our members and in some markets improve benefits where we believe we were well positioned relative to the competition. We did this recognizing that the return of the HIF presented significant challenges given its magnitude, and therefore, as discussed previously, we invested our 2017 outperformance and made significant strides in administrative spend productivity to fund this benefit design for our customers. 
We believe that balancing growth and margin are paramount, and it was essential after 2 years of stagnant membership growth, in no small part attributable to the Aetna transaction, to drive our top line in a disciplined fashion that would enable us to achieve our EPS growth targets of 11% to 15% over the medium and longer term. In this process, we have also strengthened our relationships and enhanced our partnership with the external brokerage community, who, along with our outstanding MarketPoint career sales organization, allows us to achieve this objective. 
Based on what we know today, achieving individual MA membership growth in the neighborhood of 150,000 to 180,000 lives is a reasonable estimate. And while there are scenarios that could certainly reduce that number, including a sales slowdown for the remainder of AEP, there are also factors that could increase it, including greater-than-expected retention of existing members and higher post-AEP sales figures than are currently forecasted. It is important to note that data on member retention is very limited at this point. 
I would also like to comment briefly on our forecast for group MA membership. Based on what we know today, which is significantly more certain than individual MA given the timing of the pricing cycle, we estimate membership growth to be comfortably in the low double digits on a percentage basis for 2018. This achievement will be the second consecutive year of double-digit percentage increases in a highly competitive business, particularly for jumbo accounts, where we have committed to remaining disciplined with our pricing. 
While we are pleased with our estimated growth in MA, there is some pressure in the competitive stand-alone PDP space for 2018. As you are likely aware, Humana offers 3 PDP plans, including a basic plan that serves, among others, our low-income members; an enhanced plan; and a low-price Walmart plan, whose extraordinary growth has made us the leading individual PDP carrier in the country. 
With regard to the basic plan, we price to break-even contribution margin at a regional level. In Florida and South Carolina, our bid proved to be priced over the benchmark, which we anticipated, resulting in the loss of our auto-signed, low-income members in those states. Additionally, our enhanced plan continues to lose members each year, but historically, this has been more than offset by the significant growth in our Walmart plan. This year, however, the Walmart plan is no longer the low-price plan in a number of markets as other carriers have priced more aggressively. And as a consequence, while we will still grow that plan, it will likely be at a materially lower rate. Collectively, therefore, we expect that our overall PDP business will decline by a few hundred thousand members. While the impact on PDP insurance profitability will not be meaningful, we expect the lower Walmart plan growth will impact the growth of our pharmacy business given the industry-leading mail order rates in this plan. 
I will now turn to making a few high-level comments regarding our projected 2018 financial performance. As we've discussed previously, Medicare Advantage membership growth drives top line revenue growth that is a critical component of our long-term EPS trajectory. Recall that MA membership growth not only benefits the health plans but also feeds our Healthcare Services segment as our members engage with us in our Pharmacy, Home Care and Provider businesses. Moreover, we are able to achieve increased scale with our administrative spend as the top line increases, which helps drive the bottom line over time. 
From a profitability perspective, I have already highlighted the return of the HIF, which, for overall Humana, is a nondeductible fee in the neighborhood of $1 billion, as well as the impact of lower PDP growth on our Pharmacy business as meaningful headwinds to our 2018 performance. It is also important to note that we will not assume that our mail order rate in the Walmart plan, while still very high, will recover from the lower levels of mail order usage that we have seen this year, particularly among the new members who joined us in 2017 and any members who select this plan for 2018. 
Our Provider business also continues to face significant rate pressures in South Florida. Additionally, the Group and Specialty segment will have a timing headwind associated with the HIF due to the timing differences that result from group renewals that are not on a calendar year basis. 
And finally, there are certain stranded costs that resulted from our exit of the Individual Commercial business on January 1, 2018. Together, the HIF timing issue and Individual Business stranded costs represent a headwind of approximately $0.30. We expect to offset these headwinds through the productivity initiatives described above and capital deployment, both through share repurchase and M&A. It is important to recall that the impact of new Medicare Advantage members on profitability is relatively muted in the initial year before they are documented appropriately for the risk we are taking and are engaged in our clinical programs. 
Turning now to EPS. Recall that on last quarter's call, we discussed the need to begin with a baseline-adjusted EPS of approximately $11, which is largely unchanged. It is also important to note that we have achieved EPS growth well in excess of our long-term range over the last several years. Additionally, we would anticipate guiding to a slightly wider range than we did in 2017, which will be more in line with historical practice given our anticipated greater MA growth in 2018 versus 2017, which can create slightly more uncertainty in our earnings forecasts. 
Finally, we would expect that the high end of our initial guidance range will be a bit below our long-term target of 11% to 15% growth, with our individual MA margin guide slightly below our 4.5% to 5% range. This reflects the significant headwinds that I've articulated and the importance of offering a compelling value proposition to our customers while continuing to invest in the build-out of our integrated care delivery model that will create long-term sustainability. 
Consistent with our historical practice, our 2018 initial guidance will assume a normalized rate of favorable prior period development for our Retail segment, which exceeded expectations in 2017, while assuming no favorable prior period development for our Group and Specialty segment. 
Finally, I would like to briefly discuss the recently announced deal to sell our nonstrategic closed block of long-term care insurance business. Upon consummation, we will have no remaining exposure to this business, where we have seen significant reserve strengthening over the last number of years. Based on the terms of the agreement, the transaction is expected to result in an estimated GAAP loss on sale of approximately $400 million or $2.75 EPS, which includes some noncash charges. 
That said, we do anticipate a net positive economic benefit for Humana as the $203 million of parent company cash contributed into the subsidiary, together with the transfer of approximately $150 million of statutory capital with the sale, should be more than offset by the estimated $500 million of cash savings associated with the expected tax treatment of the sale. We anticipate the transaction will close by the third quarter of 2018 subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Excluding the loss on sale, the company does not anticipate a material impact to earnings in 2017 or 2018 from the sale of the business.

Those rates have continued to be ratcheted down over the last few years. We've seen that multiple years in a row. I would tell you to date that the competition really hasn't changed fundamentally the benefit design there. And so as a consequence, I think people have just had to get better and better to continue to drive profitability. But there's no doubt that profitability has been reduced in the Provider segment because of that -- because of those actions. 
We've also adjusted some of our contractual terms with our providers to help ease that transition and been very thoughtful about our benefit design and working with our provider partners. But net-net, it has had an impact on our overall profitability in that region in the Provider business. 
As it relates to growth, as I said, I think the carriers, us included, I think have tried to be very prudent about how we deal with these rate declines and still offer compelling value proposition to members, and that's allowed us to continue to grow. I would tell you that, were it not for those provider -- those rate reductions, we would grow more. There's no doubt about it.

Partnerships? Opportunities?

But as you think about '18, when we grow off that $11 base, we're not going to assume the same level of PPD that's occurred. So that's the distinction we make between the '17 PPD that's effectively reflected -- that outperformance is reflected in taking the baseline back to $11, but the '18 guide will not assume the same level of PPD that we've seen in '17. So hopefully that makes sense. 
On the mail order side, I would separate the mail order reduction we've seen and some of the broader questions that you're asking. It's hard to know exactly what's driving the mail order reduction, particularly for the new members. We think it might have something to do with benefit design. It could have something to do with just the nature of the risk that we're attracting versus our -- versus the competition and where perhaps the higher utilizers are going. I think overall we're benefiting, from a health plan perspective, in terms of the risk dynamic we're seeing, but it has had an impact on the pharmacy profitability. 
More broadly, to your question on strategic reviews and cost, we constantly are looking for opportunities to drive cost out of the system. We continually review our cost of goods. We continue to look at our cost to fill. And I will tell you that the Pharmacy team really does a fantastic job of being best-in-class in both those areas as we look at the opportunities that are out there. But as we've said multiple times, we are not wedded to any particular philosophy with regard to -- if we can find opportunities to drive out costs in the system, we will do that. But what's critical for us is that the Pharmacy is a critical -- clinical engagement opportunity mechanism with our members. And so that can't change. But as it relates to cost, we are always open-minded. And I will tell you, these guys do a great job of driving best-in-class cost of goods for our plan and for the Pharmacy."

And today, in fact, we have quality contracts with a number of retail chains that allow that benefit to both encourage pharmacists at the counter to do it and, in addition, to get rewarded for any kind of improvement in quality and clinical outcomes. 
In addition, we are continuously adding pharmacy locations to our provider areas where we will have a pharmacy inside our pharmacy -- inside our primary care clinics. And again, it's leveraging that moment of influence that the pharmacist has. We are finding mixed results in our relationships with the retail pharmacies and clinical outcomes. We find where it's convenient and it's more in a clinical setting it's more effective than it is in the retail setting.

I would tell you that if we found an M&A opportunity that advanced our strategy, that would take precedence over share repurchase if it made sense to do that. But we're very committed to share repurchase. You see that we have leverage capacity in our balance sheet. We're at 30%, 31% debt-to-cap. We have ample parent company cash to accomplish our objectives. And so we won't be shy about deploying our capital, obviously maintaining our investment-grade rating, which is also very important to us."

Today, we reported strong third quarter results and raised our full year adjusted 2017 earnings guidance. Our third quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $3.44 or $3.39 on an adjusted basis once again exceeded our previous expectations. Our individual Medicare Advantage business continued its strong performance, in line with our most recent guidance, and our Group and Specialty segment performed well ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to approximately $11.60, reflecting the improved Group and Specialty segment performance. This was partially offset by lower than previously expected Healthcare Service segment pretax. Our full year 2017 GAAP EPS guidance is now approximately $17.62 per share. 
Over the last several years and particularly throughout 2017, we've committed to productivity initiatives designed to promote operational excellence, accelerate our strategy, fund critical initiatives and advance our growth objectives. Following my remarks, Brian will comment on our third quarter results and some of the specific multifaceted productivity initiatives. 
In addition, in October, CMS published its updated Star quality rating bonus year 2019 showing that we have 12 contracts rated 4 Stars or above and 2.4 million members in 4-Star or above rated contracts to be offered in 2018. This represents approximately 74% of our Medicare Advantage membership as of July 31, 2017. 
We are pleased that Humana received a 4-Star rating for 5 Medicare Advantage contracts offered in 8 states, an increase from one such contract last year. 
All Humana Medicare Advantage HMO contracts in Florida received a 4.5-Star rating, improving our position with our provider partners. These higher ratings are expected to result in higher rebates in 2019. As discussed in our second quarter earnings call, over the last year, we've renewed our focus on Stars and have made operational changes to reduce volatility in future years, the effectiveness of which we believe is shown in improved results in certain Star measures. 
As our sharp focus on productivity continues to drive cost out of the system, one area we are making critical investments is around our providers. A key pillar of our strategy that we highlighted at our Investor Day in April is to partner with providers to support their transition to value-based care that fosters the management of health holistically. Medicare Advantage is one of the few reimbursement models that rewards holistic health management. The primary care physicians on their own, especially independent physicians, lack the capital, scale and expertise to make the investments in technology and analytics necessary to thrive in a value-based environment. To that end, we are making investments in payer-agnostic care coordination technology and analytics capability that enable providers to be successful in the value-based models, easing their administrative burden and enabling more time for clinical management of their patient population. 
In a recent study we completed based on 2016 results for Humana Medicare Advantage members affiliated with providers in Humana value-based reimbursement models, we found that medical costs for Medicare Advantage members affiliated with providers in value-based models were 15% lower versus those affiliated with physicians under original fee-for-service Medicare. In addition, HEDIS scores were 26% higher for providers in value-based arrangements with Humana than providers in standard Medicare Advantage settings. 
We will execute our provider strategy using a range of models that fit the unique characteristics of a local market. This includes owned senior-focused primary care clinics, many of which are payer-agnostic, as well as joint ventures, alliance clinics and our MSO model, where we will focus on supporting affiliated independent primary care providers. 
We spoke to you previously about our 2016 launch of 4 wholly-owned clinics in Greenville, South Carolina. Membership growth in these markets have exceeded our initial expectations. And today, I want to share with you some early encouraging results that we saw between the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017. These results include a 5% reduction in admissions per thousand, a 24% decrease in readmissions per thousand, positive trends in member satisfaction with an improved Net Promoter Score and improved Star scores associated with the patient experience. These results are a testament to the effectiveness of a value-based care model. 
During 2017, we opened 5 additional clinics, including 4 in Kansas City and 1 in North Carolina. 
In addition, we continue to develop sophisticated value-based alliance and joint venture partners in new markets. In 2017, we launched 15 new clinics in 7 markets. Among our alliance and joint venture relationships and our fully-owned clinics, we today operate 195 clinics across 27 markets. 
We will continue to evaluate further investments in M&A opportunities in the provider space that improve our position in priority markets or accelerate the advancement and expansion of our MSO platform. 
Interwoven with our provider strategy, we continue to be very focused on the home, as home is often a superior clinical environment to deliver care and reduce high cost hospital admissions. In its current state, care in the home is often disconnected from primary care physicians, challenged with issues on timeliness of care, lacking in robust data exchange, as well as based on a fee-for-service driven business model. 
We've been utilizing our 6 existing Medicare certified home health agencies in Florida and Texas, along with enhanced relationships with high-performing agencies in select markets to pressure-test some of these paradigms. Through these early tests and learned efforts, we've seen that these barriers can be overcome and the member and provider experience can be improved. 
As we look to advance our integrated care delivery strategy and expand our access and reach in the home, we are taking a multifaceted approach, including, but not limited to, care coordination, remote monitoring, telemedicine and the provision of care in the home through nurses and doctors. The insights we've gained from owning home health agencies demonstrates the value of having a home health platform to evolve capabilities and services, including integration of data, advancing moments of influence and transforming home health to value-based reimbursement. 
This model produces improved outcomes such as lower admissions, readmissions and emergency room visits in common high cost conditions, including congestive heart failure, diabetes and COPD. This is a change from today's fee-for-service home health reimbursement model, which does not encourage the holistic management of health. It also provides us with an additional touch point with our members to enhance engagement, trust and close additional care gaps, such as missing HEDIS measures. 
Many aspects of care coordination are already in place, and we continue to look for ways to expand and optimize these capabilities. For example, our entry into the long-term support service business via our acquisition of American Eldercare in 2013 and the beginning of what is today our Humana At Home business with the acquisition of SeniorBridge in 2012 are becoming even more important as we continue to seek greater linkage of the Medicare D-SNP population and Medicaid long-term support services. 
However, other aspects of this strategy, particularly the provision of care in the home, will require M&A and other partnerships or collaborations to effectively bring them to life, as we've discussed previously. 
In order to advance our strategy, we need to continue to evolve the capabilities of our Healthcare Service segment. Accordingly, over the last several months, we have been working on a newly refined operating model to better align the Healthcare Services segment strategy, business and processes. The new organization will afford us a greater opportunity to engage our members, patients, physicians and associates to drive the best possible financial and clinical outcomes. 
With this new organization, we recently named new leaders of both our Home and Pharmacy operations, who will work under the leadership of William Fleming, President of Healthcare Services. We welcome Kirk Allen to Humana to lead our Home operations as President of Home Care. Kirk brings more than 20 years experience in health care and was most recently the President of Ascension At Home and Executive Vice President of Home Care Services at Evolution Health. 
We also welcome Labeed Diab to lead our Pharmacy operations as President of Humana Pharmacy Solutions. Labeed is a registered pharmacist who brings extensive operations, management and business development experience in both the retail and health care industries, most recently servicing -- serving as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President at Brookdale Senior Living. Prior to joining Brookdale in 2015, Labeed served in executive leadership roles for Walmart stores since 2009, most recently serving as President of Health and Wellness, which included managing retail pharmacies. 
Now to touch on 2018. We are confident in our Medicare Advantage competitive positioning despite the return of the health insurance industry fee in 2018. As a result of our overperformance in 2017 and various cost-saving measures, we've made targeted investments in our product design, clinical programs and operating processes, which enable us to maintain stable benefits, simplify the member experience and improve clinical outcomes. We've been proactive in our broker outreach this year, demonstrating for them our confidence in our stand-alone strategy and commitment to helping seniors achieve their best health. Additionally, we worked to simplify the broker experience by investing in technologies that enables them to have 24/7 access to our information, with further plans to roll out simplified enrollment tools in 2018. As a result, we expect to return to meaningful individual Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2018. 
Brian will provide additional commentary on our 2018 in his remarks. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
29618,420306435,1342423,"Humana Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2017",2017-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Humana Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, today we reported adjusted EPS of $3.39 for the third quarter, which is ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.60 from o",2368,"Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, today we reported adjusted EPS of $3.39 for the third quarter, which is ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.60 from our previous adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $11.50, and we increased our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $250 million at the midpoint to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion, primarily due to continued better-than-expected financial performance. 
Our Retail results are in line with our most recent forecasts and continue to exceed -- significantly exceed our initial expectations for 2017, led by our Medicare Advantage business. Consistent with the first half of the year, third quarter MA medical utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running favorably relative to our pricing assumptions. In addition to our Retail segment producing strong results, our Group and Specialty segment significantly outperformed our previous expectations, primarily due to favorable prior period development and better-than-anticipated utilization trends. Trend is now running at the low end of our initial expectations of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. 
Accordingly, we raised our pretax target for this segment for the second consecutive quarter from a range of $320 million to $340 million to a range of $350 million to $400 million. We also decreased our benefit ratio expectation to a range of 79.0% to 79.25% compared to our previous range of 79.75% to 80.25%. 
The Group and Specialty segment continues to consistently deliver solid results due to the team's strong focus on productivity and on offering innovative products that resonate in the marketplace. We are pleased with the return on investment we generate from this segment. 
As we discussed last quarter, while the Healthcare Services segment continues to generate profits and steady cash flow to the parent, and importantly, reflects the integration of our business model by delivering clinical excellence and trend benders for our insurance lines, we continue to see lower-than-expected mail order utilization, particularly for new members in our Humana-Walmart stand-alone PDP offering. Today, we slightly lowered our pretax target range for this segment to $900 million to $950 million from our previous target of $925 million to $975 million. 
Turning to our Individual Commercial segment results, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS, we now expect Individual Commercial segment pretax income of approximately $150 million, up from our previous estimate of approximately $85 million. Consistent with last quarter, these results reflect significant positive prior period development as well as lower-than-expected utilization in our ACA-compliant business. 
With regard to cost share reduction payments, we do not expect the impact of the recent executive order to be material for us. 
As these collective results demonstrate, we've had a great year so far, with significant outperformance that has enabled us to take the opportunity to invest in our future, including higher AEP marketing spend. This outperformance also results in higher compensation as our performance-based compensation arrangements reward our associates for their excellent work. 
In addition, as Bruce discussed, we have taken significant actions to reduce administrative costs in a sustainable way for 2018 and beyond. Some of these measures have resulted in incremental spend in 2017, including investments in analytics and enabling technologies that have significantly advanced our integrated care delivery model, such as investments in our big data and our customer relationship management, or CRM, system, among others. Our big data environment now enables us to integrate and routinely mine data sources such as clinician notes, home health assessments and social determinants of health data. Through our CRM, we now have a comprehensive longitudinal data view of our members, which helps us know our members deeply and engage them effectively. We have also made investments in the provider space to advance care coordination capabilities, focusing on interoperability and analytics to improve the provider experience. 
And lastly, we invested in a number of productivity and expense management initiatives related to internal management systems as well as vendor contracting and rationalizing our real estate footprint across the country. 
More fundamentally, we have completed the build-out of the Process Transformation Office, or PTO, and we recently named process champions and owners for 3 critical processes that together comprise over $1 billion in administrative spend. These include processing claims, resolving inquiries and issues and designing and delivering member communications. The PTO is working diligently with leaders throughout the organization to optimize these processes horizontally across silos and has already identified meaningful savings by connecting upstream and downstream workflows and eliminating inefficiencies while ultimately increasing automation. We believe that by focusing on these core areas and then extending the PTO to additional processes over time throughout the organization, we can continue to reduce administrative costs and increase the reliability of our processes while improving the member and provider experience that together will set us up for sustainable growth over the long term. 
Lastly, as a result of our efforts to continue to evolve and streamline the organization to align with our integrated care delivery strategy that Bruce has articulated, we've had to make some difficult decisions, including closing certain open roles and initiating both a voluntary early retirement program and an involuntary workforce reduction program that are expected to impact approximately 2,700 employees or just under 6% of our workforce. 
In the third quarter of 2017, we recorded charges of $0.54 per diluted common share associated with these programs, which has been excluded from our adjusted EPS. This has resulted in a higher operating cost ratio than initially expected for 2017, and we now expect to end the year at or slightly above the higher end of our previous forecast range. We believe the culmination of these investments and our associates' hard work during 2017 has positioned us for a solid 2018 in the face of significant headwinds, in particular the return of the health insurance fee, or HIF. 
While we do not intend to provide specific 2018 guidance until our fourth quarter call, I will now offer some higher level commentary and direction about next year. I'll begin with membership. We are only 1 month into the annual election period for our individual Medicare Advantage, but we are encouraged, albeit very cautious, with early sales results and our competitive positioning. Our philosophy heading into this enrollment season was to maintain stable benefits for our members and in some markets improve benefits where we believe we were well positioned relative to the competition. We did this recognizing that the return of the HIF presented significant challenges given its magnitude, and therefore, as discussed previously, we invested our 2017 outperformance and made significant strides in administrative spend productivity to fund this benefit design for our customers. 
We believe that balancing growth and margin are paramount, and it was essential after 2 years of stagnant membership growth, in no small part attributable to the Aetna transaction, to drive our top line in a disciplined fashion that would enable us to achieve our EPS growth targets of 11% to 15% over the medium and longer term. In this process, we have also strengthened our relationships and enhanced our partnership with the external brokerage community, who, along with our outstanding MarketPoint career sales organization, allows us to achieve this objective. 
Based on what we know today, achieving individual MA membership growth in the neighborhood of 150,000 to 180,000 lives is a reasonable estimate. And while there are scenarios that could certainly reduce that number, including a sales slowdown for the remainder of AEP, there are also factors that could increase it, including greater-than-expected retention of existing members and higher post-AEP sales figures than are currently forecasted. It is important to note that data on member retention is very limited at this point. 
I would also like to comment briefly on our forecast for group MA membership. Based on what we know today, which is significantly more certain than individual MA given the timing of the pricing cycle, we estimate membership growth to be comfortably in the low double digits on a percentage basis for 2018. This achievement will be the second consecutive year of double-digit percentage increases in a highly competitive business, particularly for jumbo accounts, where we have committed to remaining disciplined with our pricing. 
While we are pleased with our estimated growth in MA, there is some pressure in the competitive stand-alone PDP space for 2018. As you are likely aware, Humana offers 3 PDP plans, including a basic plan that serves, among others, our low-income members; an enhanced plan; and a low-price Walmart plan, whose extraordinary growth has made us the leading individual PDP carrier in the country. 
With regard to the basic plan, we price to break-even contribution margin at a regional level. In Florida and South Carolina, our bid proved to be priced over the benchmark, which we anticipated, resulting in the loss of our auto-signed, low-income members in those states. Additionally, our enhanced plan continues to lose members each year, but historically, this has been more than offset by the significant growth in our Walmart plan. This year, however, the Walmart plan is no longer the low-price plan in a number of markets as other carriers have priced more aggressively. And as a consequence, while we will still grow that plan, it will likely be at a materially lower rate. Collectively, therefore, we expect that our overall PDP business will decline by a few hundred thousand members. While the impact on PDP insurance profitability will not be meaningful, we expect the lower Walmart plan growth will impact the growth of our pharmacy business given the industry-leading mail order rates in this plan. 
I will now turn to making a few high-level comments regarding our projected 2018 financial performance. As we've discussed previously, Medicare Advantage membership growth drives top line revenue growth that is a critical component of our long-term EPS trajectory. Recall that MA membership growth not only benefits the health plans but also feeds our Healthcare Services segment as our members engage with us in our Pharmacy, Home Care and Provider businesses. Moreover, we are able to achieve increased scale with our administrative spend as the top line increases, which helps drive the bottom line over time. 
From a profitability perspective, I have already highlighted the return of the HIF, which, for overall Humana, is a nondeductible fee in the neighborhood of $1 billion, as well as the impact of lower PDP growth on our Pharmacy business as meaningful headwinds to our 2018 performance. It is also important to note that we will not assume that our mail order rate in the Walmart plan, while still very high, will recover from the lower levels of mail order usage that we have seen this year, particularly among the new members who joined us in 2017 and any members who select this plan for 2018. 
Our Provider business also continues to face significant rate pressures in South Florida. Additionally, the Group and Specialty segment will have a timing headwind associated with the HIF due to the timing differences that result from group renewals that are not on a calendar year basis. 
And finally, there are certain stranded costs that resulted from our exit of the Individual Commercial business on January 1, 2018. Together, the HIF timing issue and Individual Business stranded costs represent a headwind of approximately $0.30. We expect to offset these headwinds through the productivity initiatives described above and capital deployment, both through share repurchase and M&A. It is important to recall that the impact of new Medicare Advantage members on profitability is relatively muted in the initial year before they are documented appropriately for the risk we are taking and are engaged in our clinical programs. 
Turning now to EPS. Recall that on last quarter's call, we discussed the need to begin with a baseline-adjusted EPS of approximately $11, which is largely unchanged. It is also important to note that we have achieved EPS growth well in excess of our long-term range over the last several years. Additionally, we would anticipate guiding to a slightly wider range than we did in 2017, which will be more in line with historical practice given our anticipated greater MA growth in 2018 versus 2017, which can create slightly more uncertainty in our earnings forecasts. 
Finally, we would expect that the high end of our initial guidance range will be a bit below our long-term target of 11% to 15% growth, with our individual MA margin guide slightly below our 4.5% to 5% range. This reflects the significant headwinds that I've articulated and the importance of offering a compelling value proposition to our customers while continuing to invest in the build-out of our integrated care delivery model that will create long-term sustainability. 
Consistent with our historical practice, our 2018 initial guidance will assume a normalized rate of favorable prior period development for our Retail segment, which exceeded expectations in 2017, while assuming no favorable prior period development for our Group and Specialty segment. 
Finally, I would like to briefly discuss the recently announced deal to sell our nonstrategic closed block of long-term care insurance business. Upon consummation, we will have no remaining exposure to this business, where we have seen significant reserve strengthening over the last number of years. Based on the terms of the agreement, the transaction is expected to result in an estimated GAAP loss on sale of approximately $400 million or $2.75 EPS, which includes some noncash charges. 
That said, we do anticipate a net positive economic benefit for Humana as the $203 million of parent company cash contributed into the subsidiary, together with the transfer of approximately $150 million of statutory capital with the sale, should be more than offset by the estimated $500 million of cash savings associated with the expected tax treatment of the sale. We anticipate the transaction will close by the third quarter of 2018 subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Excluding the loss on sale, the company does not anticipate a material impact to earnings in 2017 or 2018 from the sale of the business. 
With that, we'll open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller."

And I know you guys did a strategic review of Pharmacy a few years ago, but there seems to be a whole lot of changes in the PBM landscape. Does that cause you to look at anything differently? Partnerships? Opportunities? 
And in your push for integrated models, I know guys are talking about engaging with the pharmacists more and at the retail pharmacy outlet. You have your relationship with Walmart. Is there any evolution in how you're deploying that in terms of maybe provision of care or dealing with gaps in care?"

So effectively, what that does is it takes into account the PPD for '17 as we start our baseline. But as you think about '18, when we grow off that $11 base, we're not going to assume the same level of PPD that's occurred. So that's the distinction we make between the '17 PPD that's effectively reflected -- that outperformance is reflected in taking the baseline back to $11, but the '18 guide will not assume the same level of PPD that we've seen in '17. So hopefully that makes sense. 
On the mail order side, I would separate the mail order reduction we've seen and some of the broader questions that you're asking. It's hard to know exactly what's driving the mail order reduction, particularly for the new members. We think it might have something to do with benefit design. It could have something to do with just the nature of the risk that we're attracting versus our -- versus the competition and where perhaps the higher utilizers are going. I think overall we're benefiting, from a health plan perspective, in terms of the risk dynamic we're seeing, but it has had an impact on the pharmacy profitability. 
More broadly, to your question on strategic reviews and cost, we constantly are looking for opportunities to drive cost out of the system. We continually review our cost of goods. We continue to look at our cost to fill. And I will tell you that the Pharmacy team really does a fantastic job of being best-in-class in both those areas as we look at the opportunities that are out there. But as we've said multiple times, we are not wedded to any particular philosophy with regard to -- if we can find opportunities to drive out costs in the system, we will do that. But what's critical for us is that the Pharmacy is a critical -- clinical engagement opportunity mechanism with our members. And so that can't change. But as it relates to cost, we are always open-minded. And I will tell you, these guys do a great job of driving best-in-class cost of goods for our plan and for the Pharmacy."

We do think that pharmacists serve an important role in the clinical interaction with our members. And today, in fact, we have quality contracts with a number of retail chains that allow that benefit to both encourage pharmacists at the counter to do it and, in addition, to get rewarded for any kind of improvement in quality and clinical outcomes. 
In addition, we are continuously adding pharmacy locations to our provider areas where we will have a pharmacy inside our pharmacy -- inside our primary care clinics. And again, it's leveraging that moment of influence that the pharmacist has. We are finding mixed results in our relationships with the retail pharmacies and clinical outcomes. We find where it's convenient and it's more in a clinical setting it's more effective than it is in the retail setting. But I think that's also just the time that the pharmacist has at the counter to be able to have that engagement."

I think we feel good that we are really in the strike zone of where the growth of managed care is happening. We believe that we have superior clinical programs and the right operating model to capitalize on that growth. But there's no doubt that we're facing a much stronger competitive environment. 
And I would say that's been compounded by the fact that we have this massive health insurance fee that's returning in 2018. That impacts the customer, and it impacts the industry. And so I think those 2 factors have required us to take significant action, which we've done this year, and invest some of the outperformance that we've done -- that we've had this year into our 2018 benefit design.

Today, we reported strong third quarter results and raised our full year adjusted 2017 earnings guidance. Our third quarter 2017 GAAP EPS of $3.44 or $3.39 on an adjusted basis once again exceeded our previous expectations. Our individual Medicare Advantage business continued its strong performance, in line with our most recent guidance, and our Group and Specialty segment performed well ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to approximately $11.60, reflecting the improved Group and Specialty segment performance. This was partially offset by lower than previously expected Healthcare Service segment pretax. Our full year 2017 GAAP EPS guidance is now approximately $17.62 per share. 
Over the last several years and particularly throughout 2017, we've committed to productivity initiatives designed to promote operational excellence, accelerate our strategy, fund critical initiatives and advance our growth objectives. Following my remarks, Brian will comment on our third quarter results and some of the specific multifaceted productivity initiatives. 
In addition, in October, CMS published its updated Star quality rating bonus year 2019 showing that we have 12 contracts rated 4 Stars or above and 2.4 million members in 4-Star or above rated contracts to be offered in 2018. This represents approximately 74% of our Medicare Advantage membership as of July 31, 2017. 
We are pleased that Humana received a 4-Star rating for 5 Medicare Advantage contracts offered in 8 states, an increase from one such contract last year. 
All Humana Medicare Advantage HMO contracts in Florida received a 4.5-Star rating, improving our position with our provider partners. These higher ratings are expected to result in higher rebates in 2019. As discussed in our second quarter earnings call, over the last year, we've renewed our focus on Stars and have made operational changes to reduce volatility in future years, the effectiveness of which we believe is shown in improved results in certain Star measures. 
As our sharp focus on productivity continues to drive cost out of the system, one area we are making critical investments is around our providers. A key pillar of our strategy that we highlighted at our Investor Day in April is to partner with providers to support their transition to value-based care that fosters the management of health holistically. Medicare Advantage is one of the few reimbursement models that rewards holistic health management. The primary care physicians on their own, especially independent physicians, lack the capital, scale and expertise to make the investments in technology and analytics necessary to thrive in a value-based environment. To that end, we are making investments in payer-agnostic care coordination technology and analytics capability that enable providers to be successful in the value-based models, easing their administrative burden and enabling more time for clinical management of their patient population. 
In a recent study we completed based on 2016 results for Humana Medicare Advantage members affiliated with providers in Humana value-based reimbursement models, we found that medical costs for Medicare Advantage members affiliated with providers in value-based models were 15% lower versus those affiliated with physicians under original fee-for-service Medicare. In addition, HEDIS scores were 26% higher for providers in value-based arrangements with Humana than providers in standard Medicare Advantage settings. 
We will execute our provider strategy using a range of models that fit the unique characteristics of a local market. This includes owned senior-focused primary care clinics, many of which are payer-agnostic, as well as joint ventures, alliance clinics and our MSO model, where we will focus on supporting affiliated independent primary care providers. 
We spoke to you previously about our 2016 launch of 4 wholly-owned clinics in Greenville, South Carolina. Membership growth in these markets have exceeded our initial expectations. And today, I want to share with you some early encouraging results that we saw between the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017. These results include a 5% reduction in admissions per thousand, a 24% decrease in readmissions per thousand, positive trends in member satisfaction with an improved Net Promoter Score and improved Star scores associated with the patient experience. These results are a testament to the effectiveness of a value-based care model. 
During 2017, we opened 5 additional clinics, including 4 in Kansas City and 1 in North Carolina. 
In addition, we continue to develop sophisticated value-based alliance and joint venture partners in new markets. In 2017, we launched 15 new clinics in 7 markets. Among our alliance and joint venture relationships and our fully-owned clinics, we today operate 195 clinics across 27 markets. 
We will continue to evaluate further investments in M&A opportunities in the provider space that improve our position in priority markets or accelerate the advancement and expansion of our MSO platform. 
Interwoven with our provider strategy, we continue to be very focused on the home, as home is often a superior clinical environment to deliver care and reduce high cost hospital admissions. In its current state, care in the home is often disconnected from primary care physicians, challenged with issues on timeliness of care, lacking in robust data exchange, as well as based on a fee-for-service driven business model. 
We've been utilizing our 6 existing Medicare certified home health agencies in Florida and Texas, along with enhanced relationships with high-performing agencies in select markets to pressure-test some of these paradigms. Through these early tests and learned efforts, we've seen that these barriers can be overcome and the member and provider experience can be improved. 
As we look to advance our integrated care delivery strategy and expand our access and reach in the home, we are taking a multifaceted approach, including, but not limited to, care coordination, remote monitoring, telemedicine and the provision of care in the home through nurses and doctors. The insights we've gained from owning home health agencies demonstrates the value of having a home health platform to evolve capabilities and services, including integration of data, advancing moments of influence and transforming home health to value-based reimbursement. 
This model produces improved outcomes such as lower admissions, readmissions and emergency room visits in common high cost conditions, including congestive heart failure, diabetes and COPD. This is a change from today's fee-for-service home health reimbursement model, which does not encourage the holistic management of health. It also provides us with an additional touch point with our members to enhance engagement, trust and close additional care gaps, such as missing HEDIS measures. 
Many aspects of care coordination are already in place, and we continue to look for ways to expand and optimize these capabilities. For example, our entry into the long-term support service business via our acquisition of American Eldercare in 2013 and the beginning of what is today our Humana At Home business with the acquisition of SeniorBridge in 2012 are becoming even more important as we continue to seek greater linkage of the Medicare D-SNP population and Medicaid long-term support services. 
However, other aspects of this strategy, particularly the provision of care in the home, will require M&A and other partnerships or collaborations to effectively bring them to life, as we've discussed previously. 
In order to advance our strategy, we need to continue to evolve the capabilities of our Healthcare Service segment. Accordingly, over the last several months, we have been working on a newly refined operating model to better align the Healthcare Services segment strategy, business and processes. The new organization will afford us a greater opportunity to engage our members, patients, physicians and associates to drive the best possible financial and clinical outcomes. 
With this new organization, we recently named new leaders of both our Home and Pharmacy operations, who will work under the leadership of William Fleming, President of Healthcare Services. We welcome Kirk Allen to Humana to lead our Home operations as President of Home Care. Kirk brings more than 20 years experience in health care and was most recently the President of Ascension At Home and Executive Vice President of Home Care Services at Evolution Health. 
We also welcome Labeed Diab to lead our Pharmacy operations as President of Humana Pharmacy Solutions. Labeed is a registered pharmacist who brings extensive operations, management and business development experience in both the retail and health care industries, most recently servicing -- serving as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President at Brookdale Senior Living. Prior to joining Brookdale in 2015, Labeed served in executive leadership roles for Walmart stores since 2009, most recently serving as President of Health and Wellness, which included managing retail pharmacies. 
Now to touch on 2018. We are confident in our Medicare Advantage competitive positioning despite the return of the health insurance industry fee in 2018. As a result of our overperformance in 2017 and various cost-saving measures, we've made targeted investments in our product design, clinical programs and operating processes, which enable us to maintain stable benefits, simplify the member experience and improve clinical outcomes. We've been proactive in our broker outreach this year, demonstrating for them our confidence in our stand-alone strategy and commitment to helping seniors achieve their best health. Additionally, we worked to simplify the broker experience by investing in technologies that enables them to have 24/7 access to our information, with further plans to roll out simplified enrollment tools in 2018. As a result, we expect to return to meaningful individual Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2018. 
Brian will provide additional commentary on our 2018 in his remarks. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

As Bruce mentioned, today we reported adjusted EPS of $3.39 for the third quarter, which is ahead of our previous expectations.

As Bruce mentioned, today we reported adjusted EPS of $3.39 for the third quarter, which is ahead of our previous expectations. We raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.60 from our previous adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $11.50, and we increased our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $250 million at the midpoint to a range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion, primarily due to continued better-than-expected financial performance. 
Our Retail results are in line with our most recent forecasts and continue to exceed -- significantly exceed our initial expectations for 2017, led by our Medicare Advantage business. Consistent with the first half of the year, third quarter MA medical utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running favorably relative to our pricing assumptions. In addition to our Retail segment producing strong results, our Group and Specialty segment significantly outperformed our previous expectations, primarily due to favorable prior period development and better-than-anticipated utilization trends. Trend is now running at the low end of our initial expectations of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. 
Accordingly, we raised our pretax target for this segment for the second consecutive quarter from a range of $320 million to $340 million to a range of $350 million to $400 million. We also decreased our benefit ratio expectation to a range of 79.0% to 79.25% compared to our previous range of 79.75% to 80.25%. 
The Group and Specialty segment continues to consistently deliver solid results due to the team's strong focus on productivity and on offering innovative products that resonate in the marketplace. We are pleased with the return on investment we generate from this segment. 
As we discussed last quarter, while the Healthcare Services segment continues to generate profits and steady cash flow to the parent, and importantly, reflects the integration of our business model by delivering clinical excellence and trend benders for our insurance lines, we continue to see lower-than-expected mail order utilization, particularly for new members in our Humana-Walmart stand-alone PDP offering. Today, we slightly lowered our pretax target range for this segment to $900 million to $950 million from our previous target of $925 million to $975 million. 
Turning to our Individual Commercial segment results, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS, we now expect Individual Commercial segment pretax income of approximately $150 million, up from our previous estimate of approximately $85 million. Consistent with last quarter, these results reflect significant positive prior period development as well as lower-than-expected utilization in our ACA-compliant business. 
With regard to cost share reduction payments, we do not expect the impact of the recent executive order to be material for us. 
As these collective results demonstrate, we've had a great year so far, with significant outperformance that has enabled us to take the opportunity to invest in our future, including higher AEP marketing spend. This outperformance also results in higher compensation as our performance-based compensation arrangements reward our associates for their excellent work. 
In addition, as Bruce discussed, we have taken significant actions to reduce administrative costs in a sustainable way for 2018 and beyond. Some of these measures have resulted in incremental spend in 2017, including investments in analytics and enabling technologies that have significantly advanced our integrated care delivery model, such as investments in our big data and our customer relationship management, or CRM, system, among others. Our big data environment now enables us to integrate and routinely mine data sources such as clinician notes, home health assessments and social determinants of health data. Through our CRM, we now have a comprehensive longitudinal data view of our members, which helps us know our members deeply and engage them effectively. We have also made investments in the provider space to advance care coordination capabilities, focusing on interoperability and analytics to improve the provider experience. 
And lastly, we invested in a number of productivity and expense management initiatives related to internal management systems as well as vendor contracting and rationalizing our real estate footprint across the country. 
More fundamentally, we have completed the build-out of the Process Transformation Office, or PTO, and we recently named process champions and owners for 3 critical processes that together comprise over $1 billion in administrative spend. These include processing claims, resolving inquiries and issues and designing and delivering member communications. The PTO is working diligently with leaders throughout the organization to optimize these processes horizontally across silos and has already identified meaningful savings by connecting upstream and downstream workflows and eliminating inefficiencies while ultimately increasing automation. We believe that by focusing on these core areas and then extending the PTO to additional processes over time throughout the organization, we can continue to reduce administrative costs and increase the reliability of our processes while improving the member and provider experience that together will set us up for sustainable growth over the long term. 
Lastly, as a result of our efforts to continue to evolve and streamline the organization to align with our integrated care delivery strategy that Bruce has articulated, we've had to make some difficult decisions, including closing certain open roles and initiating both a voluntary early retirement program and an involuntary workforce reduction program that are expected to impact approximately 2,700 employees or just under 6% of our workforce. 
In the third quarter of 2017, we recorded charges of $0.54 per diluted common share associated with these programs, which has been excluded from our adjusted EPS. This has resulted in a higher operating cost ratio than initially expected for 2017, and we now expect to end the year at or slightly above the higher end of our previous forecast range. We believe the culmination of these investments and our associates' hard work during 2017 has positioned us for a solid 2018 in the face of significant headwinds, in particular the return of the health insurance fee, or HIF. 
While we do not intend to provide specific 2018 guidance until our fourth quarter call, I will now offer some higher level commentary and direction about next year. I'll begin with membership. We are only 1 month into the annual election period for our individual Medicare Advantage, but we are encouraged, albeit very cautious, with early sales results and our competitive positioning. Our philosophy heading into this enrollment season was to maintain stable benefits for our members and in some markets improve benefits where we believe we were well positioned relative to the competition. We did this recognizing that the return of the HIF presented significant challenges given its magnitude, and therefore, as discussed previously, we invested our 2017 outperformance and made significant strides in administrative spend productivity to fund this benefit design for our customers. 
We believe that balancing growth and margin are paramount, and it was essential after 2 years of stagnant membership growth, in no small part attributable to the Aetna transaction, to drive our top line in a disciplined fashion that would enable us to achieve our EPS growth targets of 11% to 15% over the medium and longer term. In this process, we have also strengthened our relationships and enhanced our partnership with the external brokerage community, who, along with our outstanding MarketPoint career sales organization, allows us to achieve this objective. 
Based on what we know today, achieving individual MA membership growth in the neighborhood of 150,000 to 180,000 lives is a reasonable estimate. And while there are scenarios that could certainly reduce that number, including a sales slowdown for the remainder of AEP, there are also factors that could increase it, including greater-than-expected retention of existing members and higher post-AEP sales figures than are currently forecasted. It is important to note that data on member retention is very limited at this point. 
I would also like to comment briefly on our forecast for group MA membership. Based on what we know today, which is significantly more certain than individual MA given the timing of the pricing cycle, we estimate membership growth to be comfortably in the low double digits on a percentage basis for 2018. This achievement will be the second consecutive year of double-digit percentage increases in a highly competitive business, particularly for jumbo accounts, where we have committed to remaining disciplined with our pricing. 
While we are pleased with our estimated growth in MA, there is some pressure in the competitive stand-alone PDP space for 2018. As you are likely aware, Humana offers 3 PDP plans, including a basic plan that serves, among others, our low-income members; an enhanced plan; and a low-price Walmart plan, whose extraordinary growth has made us the leading individual PDP carrier in the country. 
With regard to the basic plan, we price to break-even contribution margin at a regional level. In Florida and South Carolina, our bid proved to be priced over the benchmark, which we anticipated, resulting in the loss of our auto-signed, low-income members in those states. Additionally, our enhanced plan continues to lose members each year, but historically, this has been more than offset by the significant growth in our Walmart plan. This year, however, the Walmart plan is no longer the low-price plan in a number of markets as other carriers have priced more aggressively. And as a consequence, while we will still grow that plan, it will likely be at a materially lower rate. Collectively, therefore, we expect that our overall PDP business will decline by a few hundred thousand members. While the impact on PDP insurance profitability will not be meaningful, we expect the lower Walmart plan growth will impact the growth of our pharmacy business given the industry-leading mail order rates in this plan. 
I will now turn to making a few high-level comments regarding our projected 2018 financial performance. As we've discussed previously, Medicare Advantage membership growth drives top line revenue growth that is a critical component of our long-term EPS trajectory. Recall that MA membership growth not only benefits the health plans but also feeds our Healthcare Services segment as our members engage with us in our Pharmacy, Home Care and Provider businesses. Moreover, we are able to achieve increased scale with our administrative spend as the top line increases, which helps drive the bottom line over time. 
From a profitability perspective, I have already highlighted the return of the HIF, which, for overall Humana, is a nondeductible fee in the neighborhood of $1 billion, as well as the impact of lower PDP growth on our Pharmacy business as meaningful headwinds to our 2018 performance. It is also important to note that we will not assume that our mail order rate in the Walmart plan, while still very high, will recover from the lower levels of mail order usage that we have seen this year, particularly among the new members who joined us in 2017 and any members who select this plan for 2018. 
Our Provider business also continues to face significant rate pressures in South Florida. Additionally, the Group and Specialty segment will have a timing headwind associated with the HIF due to the timing differences that result from group renewals that are not on a calendar year basis. 
And finally, there are certain stranded costs that resulted from our exit of the Individual Commercial business on January 1, 2018. Together, the HIF timing issue and Individual Business stranded costs represent a headwind of approximately $0.30. We expect to offset these headwinds through the productivity initiatives described above and capital deployment, both through share repurchase and M&A. It is important to recall that the impact of new Medicare Advantage members on profitability is relatively muted in the initial year before they are documented appropriately for the risk we are taking and are engaged in our clinical programs. 
Turning now to EPS. Recall that on last quarter's call, we discussed the need to begin with a baseline-adjusted EPS of approximately $11, which is largely unchanged. It is also important to note that we have achieved EPS growth well in excess of our long-term range over the last several years. Additionally, we would anticipate guiding to a slightly wider range than we did in 2017, which will be more in line with historical practice given our anticipated greater MA growth in 2018 versus 2017, which can create slightly more uncertainty in our earnings forecasts. 
Finally, we would expect that the high end of our initial guidance range will be a bit below our long-term target of 11% to 15% growth, with our individual MA margin guide slightly below our 4.5% to 5% range. This reflects the significant headwinds that I've articulated and the importance of offering a compelling value proposition to our customers while continuing to invest in the build-out of our integrated care delivery model that will create long-term sustainability. 
Consistent with our historical practice, our 2018 initial guidance will assume a normalized rate of favorable prior period development for our Retail segment, which exceeded expectations in 2017, while assuming no favorable prior period development for our Group and Specialty segment. 
Finally, I would like to briefly discuss the recently announced deal to sell our nonstrategic closed block of long-term care insurance business. Upon consummation, we will have no remaining exposure to this business, where we have seen significant reserve strengthening over the last number of years. Based on the terms of the agreement, the transaction is expected to result in an estimated GAAP loss on sale of approximately $400 million or $2.75 EPS, which includes some noncash charges. 
That said, we do anticipate a net positive economic benefit for Humana as the $203 million of parent company cash contributed into the subsidiary, together with the transfer of approximately $150 million of statutory capital with the sale, should be more than offset by the estimated $500 million of cash savings associated with the expected tax treatment of the sale. We anticipate the transaction will close by the third quarter of 2018 subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Excluding the loss on sale, the company does not anticipate a material impact to earnings in 2017 or 2018 from the sale of the business.

Those rates have continued to be ratcheted down over the last few years. We've seen that multiple years in a row. I would tell you to date that the competition really hasn't changed fundamentally the benefit design there. And so as a consequence, I think people have just had to get better and better to continue to drive profitability. But there's no doubt that profitability has been reduced in the Provider segment because of that -- because of those actions. 
We've also adjusted some of our contractual terms with our providers to help ease that transition and been very thoughtful about our benefit design and working with our provider partners. But net-net, it has had an impact on our overall profitability in that region in the Provider business. 
As it relates to growth, as I said, I think the carriers, us included, I think have tried to be very prudent about how we deal with these rate declines and still offer compelling value proposition to members, and that's allowed us to continue to grow. I would tell you that, were it not for those provider -- those rate reductions, we would grow more. There's no doubt about it.

But as you think about '18, when we grow off that $11 base, we're not going to assume the same level of PPD that's occurred. So that's the distinction we make between the '17 PPD that's effectively reflected -- that outperformance is reflected in taking the baseline back to $11, but the '18 guide will not assume the same level of PPD that we've seen in '17. So hopefully that makes sense. 
On the mail order side, I would separate the mail order reduction we've seen and some of the broader questions that you're asking. It's hard to know exactly what's driving the mail order reduction, particularly for the new members. We think it might have something to do with benefit design. It could have something to do with just the nature of the risk that we're attracting versus our -- versus the competition and where perhaps the higher utilizers are going. I think overall we're benefiting, from a health plan perspective, in terms of the risk dynamic we're seeing, but it has had an impact on the pharmacy profitability. 
More broadly, to your question on strategic reviews and cost, we constantly are looking for opportunities to drive cost out of the system. We continually review our cost of goods. We continue to look at our cost to fill. And I will tell you that the Pharmacy team really does a fantastic job of being best-in-class in both those areas as we look at the opportunities that are out there. But as we've said multiple times, we are not wedded to any particular philosophy with regard to -- if we can find opportunities to drive out costs in the system, we will do that. But what's critical for us is that the Pharmacy is a critical -- clinical engagement opportunity mechanism with our members. And so that can't change. But as it relates to cost, we are always open-minded. And I will tell you, these guys do a great job of driving best-in-class cost of goods for our plan and for the Pharmacy."

In addition, we are continuously adding pharmacy locations to our provider areas where we will have a pharmacy inside our pharmacy -- inside our primary care clinics. And again, it's leveraging that moment of influence that the pharmacist has. We are finding mixed results in our relationships with the retail pharmacies and clinical outcomes.

Some of that will show up actually in our MER because of the nature of the associate base that's being impacted. That actually gets classified as an MER expense. I think it's fair to say that when you look at our adjusted operating cost ratio next year, when you pull out the HIF and other things, that you will see a reduction for sure.

So I wouldn't say it's one specific area related to any one initiative we have. 
In regards to the investment side, is it investing -- is it going to the shareholders or is it going to benefits, I would say it's fairly -- it's fungible and it sort of goes through all that. I think we've continued to manage in how do we invest in the business for long-term sustainability and compete in the local marketplace, how do we continue to have a competitive market offering. And if you look at our market offering, you'll see that we're not the cheapest in the market, so we're constantly trying to ensure that we're not giving the product away and our brand and all the things we do from a customer experience point of view wins the customer over. And then at the same time, we also look at the ability to invest in the advancement of our initiatives. And I would say it's sort of all those items. I wouldn't say we did it just to fund a particular initiative. We really worked through saying how can we be competitive, how can we meet the long-term goals of our shareholders and, at the same time, how do we ensure that we are productive and being able to also invest."

I would tell you that if we found an M&A opportunity that advanced our strategy, that would take precedence over share repurchase if it made sense to do that. But we're very committed to share repurchase. You see that we have leverage capacity in our balance sheet. We're at 30%, 31% debt-to-cap. We have ample parent company cash to accomplish our objectives.

So you see that one side.

So we look at how they're using the digital, what kind of -- from the pharmacy point of view, what are they using in the pharmacy area, how they're using it, are they using mail-order, are they using retail. And that gives us a lot of information about how their preference is in engaging in their health care.

In regards to the question on analytics from a human resource point of view, we have, over the last number of years, and we really haven't brought it out to our investors, have invested significantly both in the consumer analytics and also in our clinical analytics.
