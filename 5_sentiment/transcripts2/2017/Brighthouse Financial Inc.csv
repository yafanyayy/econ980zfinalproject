Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Brighthouse Financial's third quarter 2017 earnings call. Our earnings release and financial supplement were released last night and can be accessed on the Investor Relations website at brighthousefinancial.com. We encourage you to review all of these materials.
Today, you will hear from Erik Steigerwalt, our President and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Anant Bhalla, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of senior management. 
Our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal security laws. Brighthouse Financial's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, included those described from time to time in Brighthouse Financial's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Information discussed on today's call speaks only as of today, November 2, 2017. The company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed on today's call.
During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website, in earnings release and in our financial supplement. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure has not been provided because Brighthouse Financial believes it is not possible to provide reliable forecasts of net investment income and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period, and they have a significant impact on net income. And finally, references to statutory results are preliminary due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statement. 
And now I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Erik Steigerwalt."

Welcome to our first call as Brighthouse Financial. This is a meaningful milestone for us. Over the past 21 months, our team has worked tirelessly to transform Brighthouse Financial into a stand-alone company. These efforts culminated with our separation from MetLife on August 4 and our listing on the NASDAQ stock market on August 7. I would like to thank our employees for their incredible efforts throughout the separation process. I would also like to thank our policyholders and distribution partners for placing their trust in Brighthouse Financial.
Let me set the stage for the rest of my remarks by reiterating the key points of our strategy as an independent company. First, our goal is to offer a tailored set of annuity and life insurance solutions that are simple, transparent and provide value to advisers, clients and our shareholders.  Second, we will deliver our products to clients through a broad network of independent distribution partners. And third, we aim to become a cost-competitive manufacturer over time. Our management team, our board and our employees are focused on executing this strategy and delivering value to our shareholders.
A priority for us has been creating a recognizable brand that resonates with our distribution partners, their advisers and clients. In early March, we launched the Brighthouse Financial brand with a nationwide rollout of our first print and television advertising campaigns. These ads touched millions of people and were successful in introducing Brighthouse Financial to America.  Last month, we began another round of advertising, which continues to build brand awareness and showcases our flagship Shield annuities. You may have seen some of these ads during the World Series and numerous other television shows. The initial feedback to our brand rollout and advertising has been very favorable. These campaigns have helped generate awareness in the market and have allowed us to hit the ground running as a new public company. 
With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss 3 topics. First, I'll touch on progress made on the product and distribution front. Next, I'll provide some perspectives on our third quarter earnings. And lastly, I will provide an update to our financial targets. 
Let me turn to product and distribution. I've Met with a number of our advisers since we launched our brand in March. There is a lot of excitement among them about a focused scale player like Brighthouse Financial. That excitement is creating interest from advisers who already partner with us and advisers who want to begin a relationship with us. That excitement is also evident in our sales results.
Our annuity deposits were up 8%, both sequentially and quarter-over-quarter. Sales of our Shield annuities were $653 million in the quarter, up 67% quarter-over-quarter and up 15%, sequentially. Shield generates strong value of new business for us while meeting critical needs of our distributors and clients. It is an example of a next-generation product that is also a good complement to our in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. 
In late July, we celebrated the launch of Index Horizons, the first product to be created as part of our 10-year distribution agreement with MassMutual. Index Horizons is a white-label, fixed index annuity sold by MassMutual advisers. Brighthouse Financial assumes 90% of the economics through reinsurance with assumed sales of this product of approximately $70 million in the quarter. We are pleased with the launch of Index Horizons and excited to leverage our partnership with MassMutual's more than 9000 advisers moving forward.
We will continue to explore offering new products that meet the need of our distributors and shareholders in a balanced manner in addition to expanding our distribution footprint. I look forward to updating you on further progress on future earnings calls. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to provide a few perspectives on our third quarter results. First, we completed our annual actuarial review and updated assumptions and models, leveraging an additional year of our own data, combined with industry data, to refine our assumptions to reflect emerging behavior and experience. We also aligned certain GAAP and statutory assumptions. I'm pleased that the VA hedging strategy performed in line with our expectations and helped offset some of the impact of the actuarial assumption changes. 
Anant will provide more detail on our third quarter results.  Before I turn the call over to him, I want to touch on our financial targets.
We have set financial targets that we believe best measure the execution of our business strategy and align with the interest of shareholders. The targets for our base case scenario are: to begin returning cash to shareholders at 50% to 70%-plus of operating earnings by approximately the year 2020; to achieve mid- to high single-digit growth of operating earnings per share annually; and to maintain a stable operating return on equity of approximately 8% on average over time.  This is an update to our initial target of approximately 9% for operating return on equity, which was included in our final Form 10 filing. 
The update reflects a change in GAAP equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, to approximately $12.5 billion, which was larger than previously anticipated. There were 3 primary drivers impacting the beginning GAAP equity. First, the distribution paid to MetLife was $400 million less than originally projected. Second, certain separation and restructuring transactions resulted in a more favorable impact of equity than originally estimated. And third, Brighthouse had positive net income in the second quarter.
To achieve these targets, we must consistently execute on the following goals: prudently manage our existing variable annuity block over time and across market cycles with robust asset adequacy at or above CTE95; design and sell compelling products that generate positive value of new business and are aligned with our strategy of delivering distributable cash flow over time; and improve our operating cost competitiveness as a stand-alone company over time.
Let we provide a few perspectives on expenses. We expect that our expenses will be higher in our first few years as we transition to being a stand-alone public company and as we make investments in our technology infrastructure and businesses. We made good progress in the quarter, implementing systems and processes at Brighthouse that enabled us to exit 13 of our 218 TSAs with MetLife, in line with our plans to end the year with approximately 155 TSAs. 
In summary, we are executing on our plans and are very pleased with our sales momentum during our first reporting period as a stand-alone company.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Anant to discuss our third quarter financial results in more details. Anant?"

Today, I will discuss our results for the third quarter, along with our perspective on the key underlying themes. Before we get into the third quarter results, I would like to address one tax accounting ite",1548,"Thank you, Erik, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will discuss our results for the third quarter, along with our perspective on the key underlying themes. 
Before we get into the third quarter results, I would like to address one tax accounting item. In the quarter, we recorded a noncash tax expense of approximately $1.1 billion related to a tax obligation prior to our separation from MetLife. This tax expense has no impact on our stockholders' equity, which we also refer to as our book value. Brighthouse will not be required to make any payment with respect to such tax expense. 
The reported net loss in the quarter was $943 million compared to a net loss of $158 million in the third quarter of 2016. The reported operating loss was $676 million in the quarter compared to operating earnings of $329 million in the third quarter of 2016.
Third quarter ending book value per share, including accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI, was approximately $115. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, was approximately $104. Excluding the previously mentioned noncash tax expense, net income would have been $130 million and operating earnings would have been $397 million. 
There were 2 other net favorable notable items in the quarter that impacted operating earnings, totaling $103 million or $0.86 per share.  Specifically, $134 million net favorable impact primarily related to our annual actuarial review and $31 million of establishment costs related to our technology transformation and branding efforts.  The overall net income impact from our annual actuarial review was an unfavorable $62 million after tax. 
Today, I will provide perspectives around 4 themes that impacted our overall financial performance this quarter. The first key theme is the annual actuarial review. The annual actuarial review this quarter represents our first as an independent company. In addition to one additional year of observable market and company experience, the primary data source related to Brighthouse Financial this year are the results of the quantitative impact study or QIS conducted for the NAIC variable annuity reserve and capital reform initiative. Brighthouse Financial is one of about a dozen companies participating in this industry initiative. The study provides granular client behavior specific experience on an industry-wide basis. While the NAIC reform initiative is still a work in progress with full implementation likely more than a couple of years out, the availability of such a rich data set has informed our update to long-term assumptions about client behavior. This year's client behavior specific updates for Brighthouse are in addition to our 2016 actuarial review that, among other things, lowered guaranteed minimum income benefit or GMIB [utilization] election rate to 2% for clients under the age of 80.
All of our 2017 annual actuarial review assumption and model changes can be classified into 3 broad categories. First, client behavior, we reduced lapse floor assumption for all variable annuity, GMIB and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit or GMWB contracts to 1.5% for deep in-the-money contracts, down from 2% to 3% respectively. We updated our assumptions about variable annuity withdrawal behavior for GMWB for life contract to reflect contract age in addition to client age over time. This change results in earlier client withdrawals for a GMWB contract after the end of the guaranteed rollouts of the benefit base compared to a typical GMIB contract.  Additionally, we reflected refinement to our LIFEBOOK behavior assumptions on mortality, lapses and premium payment patterns.
The second category relates to the harmonization of models and assumptions between GAAP and statutory accounting. As a result of this harmonization effort, we reduced our GAAP separate account return assumptions to the mid-6% range for all of our valuation models. This puts our valuation models in line with our base case financial projection assumption outlined in the Form 10, which is the basis for setting our financial targets.  We also aligned the projection period for models between GAAP and statutory accounting. 
The third and last category of changes in the annual actuarial review is separation related. We replaced the MetLife credit spread with a Brighthouse credit spread. This credit spread is only used in our variable annuity GAAP embedded derivative liability valuation. We are actively involved in the industry efforts around capital reform project, and we will continue to monitor emerging developments over the next year as the NAIC gets closer to finalizing standards.
The second theme for the quarter is variable annuity exposure management. As a reminder, we are managing our variable annuity business to a floor level of capital known as CTE95. CTE95 is defined as assets required over the life of our product in the average of the worst 5% of future market scenarios.  We hold assets to fund this CTE95 level and enter into hedges to protect CTE95 asset in adverse markets. The CTE95 total asset requirement for the quarter was $6.3 billion, up from $6 billion in the prior quarter. The increase was driven by impacts from the annual actuarial review, which increased our CTE95 target funding level by approximately $700 million. Favorable equity markets in the quarter only partially offset this impact.
Assets above CTE95 were $2.3 billion, unchanged on a sequential basis due to 3 contributing factors. First, the hedging program performed, as we would expect in a strong up market quarter, by contributing modestly to the growth in assets above CTE95. Second, subsequent to the end of the quarter, Brighthouse Financial, Inc. contributed $200 million of holding company cash to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company. Lastly, surplus assets in the nonvariable annuity blocks were redirected to the variable annuity blocks.  We intend to manage our variable annuity business with assets of $2 billion to $3 billion above CTE95.  This allows us to deploy an efficient hedging strategy with a greater use of out of the money option to protect against market downside and retain a meaningful amount of upside from favorable movements in capital markets.  Finally, the transition to our hedging strategy is complete with the weighted average life of our equity option book at approximately 3 years, limiting rollover risk of expiring hedges.
The next theme is favorable underwriting. Across our life insurance businesses, we saw lower direct claims and a favorable impact from the reinsurance recaptures completed in the second quarter of 2017 that resulted in favorable impact to operating earnings of about $20 million sequentially. It is important to note that these 2 items, plus reserve changes, can be volatile from quarter to quarter.
The last theme I would like to discuss is expenses. Corporate expenses were $241 million pretax in the quarter, up approximately $32 million compared to the 2016 quarterly average, but still $15 million to $25 million lower than our quarterly expectation in the first full year postseparation.  Corporate expenses do not include the $31 million of establishment costs that I mentioned earlier. As we make investments in our infrastructure over the coming years, we anticipate the establishment costs to be in line with or higher than this quarter's levels. It is important to note that these establishment costs are already factored into our plan and financial targets. 
Turning to the results at the segment level. Operating earnings in the annuity segment were $355 million in the quarter, including favorable notable items of $142 million. Strong equity markets offset continued negative flows with annuity account values at $132 billion compared to $130 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Sequentially, results reflected lower DAC amortization and taxes. Operating earnings in the life segment was $6 million in the quarter, including $17 million of net unfavorable notable items.  Overall, underwriting results in the quarter were favorable sequentially due to lower direct claim and higher retention resulting from reinsurance recaptures from MetLife in the second quarter.  Taxes were also favorable sequentially. 
Operating earnings in the Run-off segment were $83 million in the quarter, including favorable notable items of $9 million primarily related to the 2017 actuarial review. The segment comprises our legacy universal life guarantees or ULSG block and nonretail businesses in the legal entity.  Operating results are typically split equally between the ULSG and the other businesses.  This quarter, ULSG reserve growth was favorable relative to prior quarters. 
Many of the underlying drivers across our segments were favorable compared to the prior quarter, including favorable underwriting and corporate expenses below our anticipated run rate. As a result, operating earnings in the quarter were favorably impacted by approximately $30 million to $40 million compared to the second quarter. 
Let me close with an update on our capital position. First, preliminary combined total adjusted capital or TAC was $6.6 billion, $200 million above the prior quarter. Second, variable annuity assets above CTE95 remained at $2.3 billion. Our plan is to grow the assets above CTE95 to $3 billion, which under our base case scenario is gradual through 2019. This is an important milestone before beginning to return capital to shareholders. Third, cash and liquid assets at the holding company, after reflecting the previously mentioned $200 million capital contribution the life company, are approximately $575 million or about 4x our expected annual fixed charges. And finally, our leverage ratio of 22.5% is below our goal of 25%. This provides us financial flexibility in managing our overall capital position. 
With that, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Our program performed as we expected. We had earned $100 million performance from the hedge program in a quarter where volatility came down as well. That does take a little bit away from the hedge program performance, but even net of that, we had $100 million of positive performance excluding volatility.

We got feedback saying, ""Tell us more about behavior."" we did our first review as an independent company this time. And what we've done with that is actually come out and give some numbers, like that what I mentioned about lapse and rate. So last year's review, even before we talk about the $400 million just prior to separation, was performed by our experience and industry data. This year's review, we had QIS, which is very rich. And once in a long time, you get opportunity to look at granular data that is also credible because you've got a broad level of industry participation in it, right? So with that, we've now come out and actually given you numbers around lapse and the major items. The $400 million was a different matter. It was from really related to a legacy methodology which we sunset as Brighthouse.

Now on why we're still at 2.3 billion, I would really look at us in the third quarter, because that's when we were independent on our own and working towards growing to $2.3 billion. And things worked in the quarter as we expected. S&P was up 4%. So if you look at the sensitivity table we gave you guys, we should have approximately a $400 million growth in the $2.3 billion. hedge program gave us upside. it allows us to participate in the upside with use of option. that was approximately 100 million fall. If it hadn't gone down, it was unchanged, the tables would be more constant. We don't give you a table on [indiscernible]. But because we buy a lot of options, when volatility goes down to these historic low levels, one year [indiscernible] down to like 13 now, we lose value in those options, which will bounce back if [indiscernible] comes back up.

But with the kind of quarterly negative net flows, it's going to take a while, right, I mean, there's a couple of ways it could happen. Flows could -- net negative flows could slow down lapses, or you need a fair amount more sales. And I would say, if you take a look or whatever your guess is, whatever reasonable guess is that our annual rate is for sales, we're going to grow it from here. And I think we're showing how we're going to do that, growth across the board, not just in Wells Fargo. We're experiencing growth in many of our distributors. We also have the brand-new FIA with -- through MassMutual, which on a net basis, was only about 70 million in this quarter. So you can think about that increasing. So I'm looking for sales growth year-over-year and sequentially for a while now. However, it's going to take years, a number of years, and I haven't thrown one out. Eventually, we can try to give a number out, but it's going to take a number of years before we can actually get the sort of breakeven net flows."

Our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal security laws. Brighthouse Financial's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in Brighthouse Financial's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Information discussed on today's call speaks only as of today, November 2, 2017. The company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed on today's call.
During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website, in our earnings release and in our financial supplement. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure has not been provided because Brighthouse Financial believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment income and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on net income. And finally, references to statutory results are preliminary due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statement.

Welcome to our first call as Brighthouse Financial. This is a meaningful milestone for us. Over the past 21 months, our team has worked tirelessly to transform Brighthouse Financial into a stand-alone company. These efforts culminated with our separation from MetLife on August 4 and our listing on the NASDAQ stock market on August 7. I would like to thank our employees for their incredible efforts throughout this separation process. I would also like to thank our policyholders and distribution partners for placing their trust in Brighthouse Financial.
Let me set the stage for the rest of my remarks by reiterating the key points of our strategy as an independent company: first, our goal is to offer a tailored set of annuity and life insurance solutions that are simple, transparent and provide value to advisers, clients and our shareholders; second, we will deliver our products to clients through a broad network of independent distribution partners; and third, we aim to become a cost-competitive manufacturer over time. Our management team, our board and our employees are focused on executing this strategy and delivering value to our shareholders.
A priority for us has been creating a recognizable brand that resonates with our distribution partners, their advisers and clients. In early March, we launched the Brighthouse Financial brand with a nationwide rollout of our first print and television advertising campaigns. These ads touched millions of people and were successful in introducing Brighthouse Financial to America. Last month, we began another round of advertising, which continues to build brand awareness and showcases our flagship Shield annuities. You may have seen some of these ads during the World Series and numerous other television shows. The initial feedback to our brand rollout and advertising has been very favorable. These campaigns have helped generate awareness in the market and have allowed us to hit the ground running as a new public company.
With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss 3 topics: first, I'll touch on progress made on the product and distribution front; next, I'll provide some perspectives on our third quarter earnings; and lastly, I will provide an update to our financial targets.
Let me turn to product and distribution. I've met with a number of advisers since we launched our brand in March. There is a lot of excitement among them about a focused scale player like Brighthouse Financial. That excitement is creating interest from advisers who already partner with us and advisers who want to begin a relationship with us. That excitement is also evident in our sales results.
Our annuity deposits were up 8%, both sequentially and quarter-over-quarter. Sales of our Shield annuities were $653 million in the quarter, up 67% quarter-over-quarter and up 15% sequentially. Shield generates strong value of new business for us while meeting critical needs of our distributors and clients. It is an example of a next-generation product that is also a good complement to our in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees.
In late July, we celebrated the launch of Index Horizons, the first product to be created as part of our 10-year distribution agreement with MassMutual. Index Horizons is a white-label, fixed-index annuity sold by MassMutual advisers. Brighthouse Financial assumes 90% of the economics through reinsurance with assumed sales of this product of approximately $70 million in the quarter. We are pleased with the launch of Index Horizons and excited to leverage our partnership with MassMutual's more than 9,000 advisers moving forward.
We will continue to explore offering new products that meet the needs of our distributors and shareholders in a balanced manner in addition to expanding our distribution footprint. I look forward to updating you on further progress on future earnings calls.
Now I'd like to take a moment to provide a few perspectives on our third quarter results. First, we completed our annual actuarial review and updated assumptions and models, leveraging an additional year of our own data combined with industry data to refine our assumptions to reflect emerging behavioral experience. We also aligned certain GAAP and statutory assumptions. I'm pleased that the VA hedging strategy performed in line with our expectations and helped offset some of the impact of the actuarial assumption changes. 
Anant will provide more detail on our third quarter results. Before I turn the call over to him, I want to touch on our financial targets.
We have set financial targets that we believe best measure the execution of our business strategy and align with the interest of shareholders. The targets for our base case scenario are: to begin returning cash to shareholders at 50% to 70%-plus of operating earnings by approximately the year 2020; to achieve mid- to high single-digit growth of operating earnings per share annually; and to maintain a stable operating return on equity of approximately 8% on average over time. 
This is an update to our initial target of approximately 9% for operating return on equity, which was included in our final Form 10 filing. The update reflects a change in GAAP equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, to approximately $12.5 billion, which was larger than previously anticipated. There were 3 primary drivers impacting the beginning GAAP equity: first, the distribution paid to MetLife was $400 million less than originally projected; second, certain separation and restructuring transactions resulted in a more favorable impact to equity than originally estimated; and third, Brighthouse had positive net income in the second quarter.
To achieve these targets, we must consistently execute on the following goals: prudently manage our existing variable annuity block over time and across market cycles with robust asset adequacy at or above CTE95; design and sell compelling products that generate positive value of new business and are aligned with our strategy of delivering distributable cash flow over time; and improve our operating cost competitiveness as a stand-alone company over time.
Let we provide a few perspectives on expenses. We expect that our expenses will be higher in our first few years as we transition to being a stand-alone public company and as we make investments in our technology infrastructure and businesses. We made good progress in the quarter implementing systems and processes at Brighthouse that enabled us to exit 13 of our 218 TSAs with MetLife, in line with our plans to end the year with approximately 155 TSAs.
In summary, we are executing on our plans and are very pleased with our sales momentum during our first reporting period as a stand-alone company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Anant to discuss our third quarter financial results in more details. Anant?"

Today, I will discuss our results for the third quarter, along with our perspective on the key underlying themes.Before we get into the third quarter results, I would like to address one tax accounting item",1552,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will discuss our results for the third quarter, along with our perspective on the key underlying themes.
Before we get into the third quarter results, I would like to address one tax accounting item. In the quarter, we recorded a noncash tax expense of approximately $1.1 billion related to a tax obligation triggered prior to our separation from MetLife. This tax expense has no impact on our stockholders' equity, which we also refer to as our book value. Brighthouse will not be required to make any payment with respect to such tax expense.
The reported net loss in the quarter was $943 million compared to a net loss of $158 million in the third quarter of 2016. The reported operating loss was $676 million in the quarter compared to operating earnings of $329 million in the third quarter of 2016.
Third quarter ending book value per share, including accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, was approximately $115, and book value per share, excluding AOCI, was approximately $104. Excluding the previously mentioned noncash tax expense, net income would have been $130 million and operating earnings would have been $397 million.
There were 2 other net favorable notable items in the quarter that impacted operating earnings, totaling $103 million or $0.86 per share. Specifically, $134 million net favorable impacts primarily related to our annual actuarial review and $31 million of establishment costs related to our technology transformation and branding efforts. The overall net income impact from the annual actuarial review was an unfavorable $62 million after tax.
Today, I will provide perspectives around 4 themes that impacted our overall financial performance this quarter. The first key theme is the annual actuarial review. The annual actuarial review this quarter represents our first as an independent company. In addition to 1 additional year of observable market and company experience, the primary new data source available to Brighthouse Financial this year are the results of the quantitative impact study, or QIS, conducted for the NAIC Variable Annuity Reserve and Capital Reform initiative. Brighthouse Financial is one of about a dozen companies participating in this industry initiative. The study provides granular client behavior-specific experience on an industry-wide basis. 
While the NAIC VA reform initiative is still a work in progress with full implementation likely more than a couple of years out, the availability of such a rich data set has informed our update to long-term assumptions about client behavior. This year's client behavior-specific updates for Brighthouse are in addition to our 2016 actuarial review that, among other things, lowered guaranteed minimum income benefit, or GMIB, annuitization election rates to 2% for clients under the age of 80.
All of our 2017 annual actuarial review assumption and model changes can be classified into 3 broad categories. First, client behavior. We reduced lapse floor assumptions for all variable-annuity GMIB and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit, or GMWB, contracts to 1.5% for deep in-the-money contracts, down from 2% to 3%, respectively.
We updated our assumptions about variable annuity withdrawal behavior for GMWB for life contracts to reflect contract age in addition to client age over time. This change results in earlier client withdrawals for a GMWB contract after the end of the guaranteed rollup of the benefit base compared to a typical GMIB contract. Additionally, we reflected refinements to our life book behavior assumptions on mortality, lapses and premium payment patterns.
The second category relates to the harmonization of models and assumptions between GAAP and statutory accounting. As a result of this harmonization effort, we reduced our GAAP separate account return assumptions to the mid-6% range for all of our valuation models. This puts our valuation models in line with our base case financial projection assumption outlined in the Form 10, which is the basis for setting our financial targets. We also aligned the projection period for models between GAAP and statutory accounting.
The third and last category of changes in the annual actuarial review is separation related. We replaced the MetLife credit spread with a Brighthouse credit spread. This credit spread is only used in our variable-annuity, GAAP-embedded derivative liability valuation. We are actively involved in the industry efforts around the NAIC VA capital reform project, and we will continue to monitor emerging developments over the next year as the NAIC gets closer to finalizing standards.
The second theme for the quarter is variable annuity exposure management. As a reminder, we are managing our variable annuity business to a floor level of capital known as CTE95. CTE95 is defined as the assets required over the life of a product in the average of the worst 5% of future market scenarios. We hold assets to fund the CTE95 level and enter into hedges to protect CTE95 asset adequacy in adverse markets. The CTE95 total asset requirement for the quarter was $6.3 billion, up from $6 billion in the prior quarter. The increase was driven by impacts from the annual actuarial review, which increased our CTE95 target funding level by approximately $700 million. Favorable equity markets in the quarter only partially offset this impact.
Assets above CTE95 were $2.3 billion, unchanged on a sequential basis due to 3 contributing factors: first, the hedging program performed as we would expect in a strong upmarket quarter by contributing modestly to the growth in assets above CTE95; second, subsequent to the end of the quarter, Brighthouse Financial, Inc. contributed $200 million of holding company cash to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company; lastly, surplus assets in the nonvariable annuity blocks were redirected to the variable annuity block. 
We intend to manage our variable annuity business with assets of $2 billion to $3 billion above CTE95. This allows us to deploy an efficient hedging strategy with a greater use of out-of-the-money options to protect against market downside and retain a meaningful amount of upside from favorable movements in capital markets. Finally, the transition to our hedging strategy is complete with the weighted average life of our equity option book at approximately 3 years limiting rollover risk of expiring hedges.
The next theme is favorable underwriting. Across our life insurance businesses, we saw lower direct claims and a favorable impact from the reinsurance recaptures completed in the second quarter of 2017 that resulted in favorable impact to operating earnings of about $20 million sequentially. It is important to note that these 2 items, plus reserve changes, can be volatile from quarter to quarter.
The last theme I would like to discuss is expenses. Corporate expenses were $241 million pretax in the quarter, up approximately $32 million compared to the 2016 quarterly average, but still $15 million to $25 million lower than our quarterly expectations in the first full year post-separation. Corporate expenses do not include the $31 million of establishment costs that I mentioned earlier. As we make investments in our infrastructure over the coming years, we anticipate establishment costs to be in line with or higher than this quarter's levels. It is important to note that these establishment costs are already factored into our plan and financial targets.
Turning to the results at the segment level. Operating earnings in the annuity segment were $355 million in the quarter, including favorable notable items of $142 million. Strong equity markets offset continued negative net flows with annuity account values at $132 billion compared to $130 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Sequentially, results reflected lower DAC amortization and favorable taxes. 
Operating earnings in the life segment was $6 million in the quarter, including $17 million of net unfavorable notable items.  Overall, underwriting results in the quarter were favorable sequentially due to lower direct claims and higher retention resulting from reinsurance recaptures from MetLife in the second quarter. Taxes were also favorable sequentially.
Operating earnings in the Run-off segment were $83 million in the quarter, including favorable notable items of $9 million primarily related to the 2017 actuarial review. The segment comprises our legacy universal life with secondary guarantees, ULSG, block and nonretail businesses in the legal entity. Operating results are typically split equally between the ULSG and the other businesses. This quarter, ULSG reserve growth was favorable relative to prior quarters.
Many of the underlying drivers across our segments were favorable compared to the prior quarter, including favorable underwriting and corporate expenses below our anticipated run rate. As a result, operating earnings in the quarter were favorably impacted by approximately $30 million to $40 million compared to the second quarter.
Let me close with an update on our capital position. First, preliminary combined total adjusted capital, or TAC, was $6.6 billion, $200 million above the prior quarter. Second, variable annuity assets above CTE95 remained at $2.3 billion. Our plan is to grow the assets above CTE95 to $3 billion, which, under our base case scenario, is gradual through 2019. This is an important milestone before beginning to return capital to shareholders. Third, cash and liquid assets at the holding companies after reflecting the previously mentioned $200 million capital contribution to the life company are approximately $575 million or about 4x our expected annual fixed charges. And finally, our leverage ratio of approximately 22.5% is below our goal of 25%. This provides us financial flexibility in managing our overall capital position.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

If you look at the sensitivity table that we outlined earlier and interpolate the 5% sensitivity there, you would have expected a change of around $400 million over there for a change in assets above CTE95. Our program performed as we expected. We had earned $100 million performance from the hedge program in a quarter where volatility came down as well. That does take a little bit away from our hedge program performance. But even net of that, we had $100 million of positive performance excluding volatility. Had volatility not come down, we probably would have had a couple of hundred million of performance. Additionally, as you look at sensitivities on 256 and compare them with cash flow over multiple quarters and years on 257 and 257 -- 256 and 257 of the Form 10, I'd introduce a part around the passage of time.

First of all, 6 to 6.3 point, right, just to finish out your earlier point. $700 million impact from assumption changes, and then obviously, positive markets helped out, right? It goes down. The CTE95 goes down. Now on why we're still at $2.3 billion, I would really look at us in the third quarter because that's when we were independent, on our own and working towards growing to $2.3 billion. And things worked in the quarter as we expected. S&P was up 4%. So if you look at the sensitivity tables we gave you guys, we should have approximately a $400 million growth in the $2.3 billion. The hedge program gave us upside. It allows us to participate in the upside with the use of options. That was approximately $100 million vol. If it hadn't gone down, if it was unchanged, the sensitivity tables would be vol constant. We don't give you a sensitivity table on vol. But because we buy a lot of options, when volatility goes down to these historic low levels, 1-year vols down to like 13 now, we lose some value in those options, which will bounce back if vol comes back up. And then the passage of time eats into the some of the upside we have as time goes by. So things work as we expected, and that's what I'd leave it at."

We also have the brand-new FIA with -- through MassMutual, which, on a net basis, was only about $70 million in this quarter. So you can think about that increasing. So I'm looking for sales growth year-over-year sequentially for a while now. However, it's going to take years, a number of years, and I haven't thrown one out. Eventually, we can try to give a number out, but it's going to take a number of years before we can actually get to sort of breakeven net flows."

A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure has not been provided because Brighthouse Financial believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment income and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on net income.

Welcome to our first call as Brighthouse Financial. This is a meaningful milestone for us. Over the past 21 months, our team has worked tirelessly to transform Brighthouse Financial into a stand-alone company. These efforts culminated with our separation from MetLife on August 4 and our listing on the NASDAQ stock market on August 7. I would like to thank our employees for their incredible efforts throughout this separation process. I would also like to thank our policyholders and distribution partners for placing their trust in Brighthouse Financial.
Let me set the stage for the rest of my remarks by reiterating the key points of our strategy as an independent company: first, our goal is to offer a tailored set of annuity and life insurance solutions that are simple, transparent and provide value to advisers, clients and our shareholders; second, we will deliver our products to clients through a broad network of independent distribution partners; and third, we aim to become a cost-competitive manufacturer over time. Our management team, our board and our employees are focused on executing this strategy and delivering value to our shareholders.
A priority for us has been creating a recognizable brand that resonates with our distribution partners, their advisers and clients. In early March, we launched the Brighthouse Financial brand with a nationwide rollout of our first print and television advertising campaigns. These ads touched millions of people and were successful in introducing Brighthouse Financial to America. Last month, we began another round of advertising, which continues to build brand awareness and showcases our flagship Shield annuities. You may have seen some of these ads during the World Series and numerous other television shows. The initial feedback to our brand rollout and advertising has been very favorable. These campaigns have helped generate awareness in the market and have allowed us to hit the ground running as a new public company.
With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss 3 topics: first, I'll touch on progress made on the product and distribution front; next, I'll provide some perspectives on our third quarter earnings; and lastly, I will provide an update to our financial targets.
Let me turn to product and distribution. I've met with a number of advisers since we launched our brand in March. There is a lot of excitement among them about a focused scale player like Brighthouse Financial. That excitement is creating interest from advisers who already partner with us and advisers who want to begin a relationship with us. That excitement is also evident in our sales results.
Our annuity deposits were up 8%, both sequentially and quarter-over-quarter. Sales of our Shield annuities were $653 million in the quarter, up 67% quarter-over-quarter and up 15% sequentially. Shield generates strong value of new business for us while meeting critical needs of our distributors and clients. It is an example of a next-generation product that is also a good complement to our in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees.
In late July, we celebrated the launch of Index Horizons, the first product to be created as part of our 10-year distribution agreement with MassMutual. Index Horizons is a white-label, fixed-index annuity sold by MassMutual advisers. Brighthouse Financial assumes 90% of the economics through reinsurance with assumed sales of this product of approximately $70 million in the quarter. We are pleased with the launch of Index Horizons and excited to leverage our partnership with MassMutual's more than 9,000 advisers moving forward.
We will continue to explore offering new products that meet the needs of our distributors and shareholders in a balanced manner in addition to expanding our independent distribution footprint. I look forward to updating you on further progress on future earnings calls.
Now I'd like to take a moment to provide a few perspectives on our third quarter results. First, we completed our annual actuarial review and updated assumptions and models, leveraging an additional year of our own data combined with industry data to refine our assumptions to reflect emerging behavioral experience. We also aligned certain GAAP and statutory assumptions. I'm pleased that the VA hedging strategy performed in line with our expectations and helped offset some of the impact of the actuarial assumption changes. 
Anant will provide more detail on our third quarter results. Before I turn the call over to him, I want to touch on our financial targets.
We have set financial targets that we believe best measure the execution of our business strategy and align with the interest of shareholders. The targets for our base case scenario are: to begin returning cash to shareholders at 50% to 70%-plus of operating earnings by approximately the year 2020; to achieve mid- to high single-digit growth of operating earnings per share annually; and to maintain a stable operating return on equity of approximately 8% on average over time. 
This is an update to our initial target of approximately 9% for operating return on equity, which was included in our final Form 10 filing. The update reflects a change in GAAP equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, to approximately $12.5 billion, which was larger than previously anticipated. There were 3 primary drivers impacting the beginning GAAP equity: first, the distribution paid to MetLife was $400 million less than originally projected; second, certain separation and restructuring transactions resulted in a more favorable impact to equity than originally estimated; and third, Brighthouse had positive net income in the second quarter.
To achieve these targets, we must consistently execute on the following goals: prudently manage our existing variable annuity block over time and across market cycles with robust asset adequacy at or above CTE95; design and sell compelling products that generate positive value of new business and are aligned with our strategy of delivering distributable cash flow over time; and improve our operating cost competitiveness as a stand-alone company over time.
Let we provide a few perspectives on expenses. We expect that our expenses will be higher in our first few years as we transition to being a stand-alone public company and as we make investments in our technology, infrastructure and businesses. We made good progress in the quarter, implementing systems and processes at Brighthouse that enabled us to exit 13 of our 218 TSAs with MetLife, in line with our plans to end the year with approximately 155 TSAs.
In summary, we are executing on our plans and are very pleased with our sales momentum during our first reporting period as a stand-alone company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Anant to discuss our third quarter financial results in more details. Anant?"

Today, I will discuss our results for the third quarter, along with our perspective on the key underlying themes.Before we get into the third quarter results, I would like to address one tax accounting item",1553,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will discuss our results for the third quarter, along with our perspective on the key underlying themes.
Before we get into the third quarter results, I would like to address one tax accounting item. In the quarter, we recorded a noncash tax expense of approximately $1.1 billion related to a tax obligation triggered prior to our separation from MetLife. This tax expense has no impact on our stockholders' equity, which we also refer to as our book value. Brighthouse will not be required to make any payment with respect to such tax expense.
The reported net loss in the quarter was $943 million compared to a net loss of $158 million in the third quarter of 2016. The reported operating loss was $676 million in the quarter compared to operating earnings of $329 million in the third quarter of 2016.
Third quarter ending book value per share, including accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, was approximately $115; and book value per share, excluding AOCI, was approximately $104. Excluding the previously mentioned noncash tax expense, net income would have been $130 million and operating earnings would have been $397 million.
There were 2 other net favorable notable items in the quarter that impacted operating earnings, totaling $103 million or $0.86 per share. Specifically, $134 million net favorable impacts primarily related to our annual actuarial review and $31 million of establishment costs related to our technology transformation and branding efforts. The overall net income impact from the annual actuarial review was an unfavorable $62 million after tax.
Today, I will provide perspectives around 4 themes that impacted our overall financial performance this quarter. The first key theme is the annual actuarial review. The annual actuarial review this quarter represents our first as an independent company. In addition to 1 additional year of observable market and company experience, the primary new data source available to Brighthouse Financial this year are the results of the quantitative impact study, or QIS, conducted for the NAIC Variable Annuity Reserve and Capital Reform initiative. Brighthouse Financial is one of about a dozen companies participating in this industry initiative. The study provides granular client behavior-specific experience on an industry-wide basis. 
While the NAIC VA reform initiative is still a work in progress with full implementation likely more than a couple of years out, the availability of such a rich data set has informed our update to long-term assumptions about client behavior. This year's client behavior-specific updates for Brighthouse are in addition to our 2016 actuarial review that, among other things, lowered guaranteed minimum income benefit, or GMIB, annuitization election rates to 2% for clients under the age of 80.
All of our 2017 annual actuarial review assumption and model changes can be classified into 3 broad categories. First, client behavior. We reduced lapse floor assumptions for all variable-annuity GMIB and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit, or GMWB contracts to 1.5% for deep in-the-money contracts, down from 2% to 3%, respectively.
We updated our assumptions about variable annuity withdrawal behavior for GMWB for life contracts to reflect contract age in addition to client age over time. This change results in earlier client withdrawals for a GMWB contract after the end of the guaranteed roll-up of the benefit base compared to a typical GMIB contract. Additionally, we reflected refinements to our life book behavior assumptions on mortality, lapses and premium payment patterns.
The second category relates to the harmonization of models and assumptions between GAAP and statutory accounting. As a result of this harmonization effort, we reduced our GAAP separate account return assumptions to the mid-6% range for all of our valuation models. This puts our valuation models in line with our base case financial projection assumption outlined in the Form 10, which is the basis for setting our financial targets. We also aligned the projection period for models between GAAP and statutory accounting.
The third and last category of changes in the annual actuarial review is separation related. We replaced the MetLife credit spread with a Brighthouse credit spread. This credit spread is only used in our variable-annuity, GAAP-embedded derivative liability valuation. We are actively involved in the industry efforts around the NAIC VA capital reform project, and we will continue to monitor emerging developments over the next year as the NAIC gets closer to finalizing standards.
The second theme for the quarter is variable annuity exposure management. As a reminder, we are managing our variable annuity business to a floor level of capital known as CTE95. CTE95 is defined as the assets required over the life of a product in the average of the worst 5% of future market scenarios. We hold assets to fund the CTE95 level and enter into hedges to protect CTE95 asset adequacy in adverse markets. The CTE95 total asset requirement for the quarter was $6.3 billion, up from $6 billion in the prior quarter. The increase was driven by impacts from the annual actuarial review, which increased our CTE95 target funding level by approximately $700 million. Favorable equity markets in the quarter only partially offset this impact.
Assets above CTE95 were $2.3 billion, unchanged on a sequential basis due to 3 contributing factors: first, the hedging program performed as we would expect in a strong upmarket quarter by contributing modestly to the growth in assets above CTE95; second, subsequent to the end of the quarter, Brighthouse Financial, Inc. contributed $200 million of holding company cash to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company; lastly, surplus assets in the nonvariable annuity blocks were redirected to the variable annuity block. 
We intend to manage our variable annuity business with assets of $2 billion to $3 billion above CTE95. This allows us to deploy an efficient hedging strategy with a greater use of out-of-the-money options to protect against market downside and retain a meaningful amount of upside from favorable movements in capital markets. Finally, the transition to our hedging strategy is complete with the weighted average life of our equity option book at approximately 3 years limiting rollover risk of expiring hedges.
The next theme is favorable underwriting. Across our life insurance businesses, we saw lower direct claims and a favorable impact from the reinsurance recaptures completed in the second quarter of 2017 that resulted in favorable impact to operating earnings of about $20 million sequentially. It is important to note that these 2 items, plus reserve changes, can be volatile from quarter to quarter.
The last theme I would like to discuss is expenses. Corporate expenses were $241 million pretax in the quarter, up approximately $32 million compared to the 2016 quarterly average, but still $15 million to $25 million lower than our quarterly expectations in the first full year post-separation. Corporate expenses do not include the $31 million of establishment costs that I mentioned earlier. As we make investments in our infrastructure over the coming years, we anticipate establishment costs to be in line with or higher than this quarter's levels. It is important to note that these establishment costs are already factored into our plan and financial targets.
Turning to the results at the segment level. Operating earnings in the annuity segment were $355 million in the quarter, including favorable notable items of $142 million. Strong equity markets offset continued negative net flows with annuity account values at $132 billion compared to $130 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Sequentially, results reflected lower DAC amortization and favorable taxes. 
Operating earnings in the life segment was $6 million in the quarter, including $17 million of net unfavorable notable items.  Overall, underwriting results in the quarter were favorable sequentially due to lower direct claims and higher retention resulting from reinsurance recaptures from MetLife in the second quarter. Taxes were also favorable sequentially.
Operating earnings in the Run-off segment were $83 million in the quarter, including favorable notable items of $9 million primarily related to the 2017 actuarial review. The segment comprises our legacy universal life with secondary guarantees, or ULSG, block and nonretail businesses in the legal entity. Operating results are typically split equally between the ULSG and the other businesses. This quarter, ULSG reserve growth was favorable relative to prior quarters.
Many of the underlying drivers across our segments were favorable compared to the prior quarter, including favorable underwriting and corporate expenses below our anticipated run rate. As a result, operating earnings in the quarter were favorably impacted by approximately $30 million to $40 million compared to the second quarter.
Let me close with an update on our capital position. First, preliminary combined total adjusted capital, or TAC, was $6.6 billion, $200 million above the prior quarter. Second, variable annuity assets above CTE95 remained at $2.3 billion. Our plan is to grow the assets above CTE95 to $3 billion, which, under our base case scenario, is gradual through 2019. This is an important milestone before beginning to return capital to shareholders. Third, cash and liquid assets at the holding companies after reflecting the previously mentioned $200 million capital contribution to the life company are approximately $575 million or about 4x our expected annual fixed charges. And finally, our leverage ratio of approximately 22.5% is below our goal of 25%. This provides us financial flexibility in managing our overall capital position.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

That does take a little bit away from our hedge program performance. But even net of that, we had $100 million of positive performance excluding volatility.

The CTE95 goes down. Now on why we're still at $2.3 billion, I would really look at us in the third quarter because that's when we were independent, on our own and working towards growing to $2.3 billion. And things worked in the quarter as we expected. S&P was up 4%. So if you look at the sensitivity tables we gave you guys, we should have approximately a $400 million growth in the $2.3 billion. The hedge program gave us upside. It allows us to participate in the upside with the use of options. That was approximately $100 million vol. If it hadn't gone down, if it was unchanged, the sensitivity tables would be vol constant. We don't give you a sensitivity table on vol. But because we buy a lot of options, when volatility goes down to these historic low levels, 1-year vol is down to like 13 now. We lose some value in those options, which will bounce back if vol comes back up. And then the passage of time eats into some of the upside we have as time goes by.

Our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal security laws.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure has not been provided because Brighthouse Financial believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment income and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on net income.

Welcome to our first call as Brighthouse Financial. This is a meaningful milestone for us. Over the past 21 months, our team has worked tirelessly to transform Brighthouse Financial into a stand-alone company. These efforts culminated with our separation from MetLife on August 4 and our listing on the NASDAQ stock market on August 7. I would like to thank our employees for their incredible efforts throughout this separation process. I would also like to thank our policyholders and distribution partners for placing their trust in Brighthouse Financial.
Let me set the stage for the rest of my remarks by reiterating the key points of our strategy as an independent company: first, our goal is to offer a tailored set of annuity and life insurance solutions that are simple, transparent and provide value to advisers, clients and our shareholders; second, we will deliver our products to clients through a broad network of independent distribution partners; and third, we aim to become a cost-competitive manufacturer over time. Our management team, our board and our employees are focused on executing this strategy and delivering value to our shareholders.
A priority for us has been creating a recognizable brand that resonates with our distribution partners, their advisers and clients. In early March, we launched the Brighthouse Financial brand with a nationwide rollout of our first print and television advertising campaigns. These ads touched millions of people and were successful in introducing Brighthouse Financial to America. Last month, we began another round of advertising, which continues to build brand awareness and showcases our flagship Shield annuities. You may have seen some of these ads during the World Series and numerous other television shows. The initial feedback to our brand rollout and advertising has been very favorable. These campaigns have helped generate awareness in the market and have allowed us to hit the ground running as a new public company.
With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss 3 topics: first, I'll touch on progress made on the product and distribution front; next, I'll provide some perspectives on our third quarter earnings; and lastly, I will provide an update to our financial targets.
Let me turn to product and distribution. I've met with a number of advisers since we launched our brand in March. There is a lot of excitement among them about a focused scale player like Brighthouse Financial. That excitement is creating interest from advisers who already partner with us and advisers who want to begin a relationship with us. That excitement is also evident in our sales results.
Our annuity deposits were up 8%, both sequentially and quarter-over-quarter. Sales of our Shield annuities were $653 million in the quarter, up 67% quarter-over-quarter and up 15% sequentially. Shield generates strong value of new business for us while meeting critical needs of our distributors and clients. It is an example of a next-generation product that is also a good complement to our in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees.
In late July, we celebrated the launch of Index Horizons, the first product to be created as part of our 10-year distribution agreement with MassMutual. Index Horizons is a white-label, fixed-index annuity sold by MassMutual advisers. Brighthouse Financial assumes 90% of the economics through reinsurance with assumed sales of this product of approximately $70 million in the quarter. We are pleased with the launch of Index Horizons and excited to leverage our partnership with MassMutual's more than 9,000 advisers moving forward.
We will continue to explore offering new products that meet the needs of our distributors and shareholders in a balanced manner in addition to expanding our independent distribution footprint. I look forward to updating you on further progress on future earnings calls.
Now I'd like to take a moment to provide a few perspectives on our third quarter results. First, we completed our annual actuarial review and updated assumptions and models, leveraging an additional year of our own data combined with industry data to refine our assumptions to reflect emerging behavioral experience. We also aligned certain GAAP and statutory assumptions. I'm pleased that the VA hedging strategy performed in line with our expectations and helped offset some of the impact of the actuarial assumption changes. 
Anant will provide more detail on our third quarter results. Before I turn the call over to him, I want to touch on our financial targets.
We have set financial targets that we believe best measure the execution of our business strategy and align with the interest of shareholders. The targets for our base case scenario are: to begin returning cash to shareholders at 50% to 70%-plus of operating earnings by approximately the year 2020; to achieve mid- to high single-digit growth of operating earnings per share annually; and to maintain a stable operating return on equity of approximately 8% on average over time. 
This is an update to our initial target of approximately 9% for operating return on equity, which was included in our final Form 10 filing. The update reflects a change in GAAP equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, to approximately $12.5 billion, which was larger than previously anticipated. There were 3 primary drivers impacting the beginning GAAP equity: first, the distribution paid to MetLife was $400 million less than originally projected; second, certain separation and restructuring transactions resulted in a more favorable impact to equity than originally estimated; and third, Brighthouse had positive net income in the second quarter.
To achieve these targets, we must consistently execute on the following goals: prudently manage our existing variable annuity block over time and across market cycles with robust asset adequacy at or above CTE95; design and sell compelling products that generate positive value of new business and are aligned with our strategy of delivering distributable cash flow over time; and improve our operating cost competitiveness as a stand-alone company over time.
Let we provide a few perspectives on expenses. We expect that our expenses will be higher in our first few years as we transition to being a stand-alone public company and as we make investments in our technology, infrastructure and businesses. We made good progress in the quarter, implementing systems and processes at Brighthouse that enabled us to exit 13 of our 218 TSAs with MetLife, in line with our plans to end the year with approximately 155 TSAs.
In summary, we are executing on our plans and are very pleased with our sales momentum during our first reporting period as a stand-alone company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Anant to discuss our third quarter financial results in more details. Anant?"

Today, I will discuss our results for the third quarter, along with our perspective on the key underlying themes.Before we get into the third quarter results, I would like to address one tax accounting item",1553,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will discuss our results for the third quarter, along with our perspective on the key underlying themes.
Before we get into the third quarter results, I would like to address one tax accounting item. In the quarter, we recorded a noncash tax expense of approximately $1.1 billion related to a tax obligation triggered prior to our separation from MetLife. This tax expense has no impact on our stockholders' equity, which we also refer to as our book value. Brighthouse will not be required to make any payment with respect to such tax expense.
The reported net loss in the quarter was $943 million compared to a net loss of $158 million in the third quarter of 2016. The reported operating loss was $676 million in the quarter compared to operating earnings of $329 million in the third quarter of 2016.
Third quarter ending book value per share, including accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, was approximately $115; and book value per share, excluding AOCI, was approximately $104. Excluding the previously mentioned noncash tax expense, net income would have been $130 million and operating earnings would have been $397 million.
There were 2 other net favorable notable items in the quarter that impacted operating earnings, totaling $103 million or $0.86 per share. Specifically, $134 million net favorable impacts primarily related to our annual actuarial review and $31 million of establishment costs related to our technology transformation and branding efforts. The overall net income impact from the annual actuarial review was an unfavorable $62 million after tax.
Today, I will provide perspectives around 4 themes that impacted our overall financial performance this quarter. The first key theme is the annual actuarial review. The annual actuarial review this quarter represents our first as an independent company. In addition to 1 additional year of observable market and company experience, the primary new data source available to Brighthouse Financial this year are the results of the quantitative impact study, or QIS, conducted for the NAIC Variable Annuity Reserve and Capital Reform initiative. Brighthouse Financial is one of about a dozen companies participating in this industry initiative. The study provides granular client behavior-specific experience on an industry-wide basis. 
While the NAIC VA reform initiative is still a work in progress with full implementation likely more than a couple of years out, the availability of such a rich data set has informed our update to long-term assumptions about client behavior. This year's client behavior-specific updates for Brighthouse are in addition to our 2016 actuarial review that, among other things, lowered guaranteed minimum income benefit, or GMIB, annuitization election rates to 2% for clients under the age of 80.
All of our 2017 annual actuarial review assumption and model changes can be classified into 3 broad categories. First, client behavior. We reduced lapse floor assumptions for all variable-annuity GMIB and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit, or GMWB contracts to 1.5% for deep in-the-money contracts, down from 2% to 3%, respectively.
We updated our assumptions about variable annuity withdrawal behavior for GMWB for life contracts to reflect contract age in addition to client age over time. This change results in earlier client withdrawals for a GMWB contract after the end of the guaranteed roll-up of the benefit base compared to a typical GMIB contract. Additionally, we reflected refinements to our life book behavior assumptions on mortality, lapses and premium payment patterns.
The second category relates to the harmonization of models and assumptions between GAAP and statutory accounting. As a result of this harmonization effort, we reduced our GAAP separate account return assumptions to the mid-6% range for all of our valuation models. This puts our valuation models in line with our base case financial projection assumption outlined in the Form 10, which is the basis for setting our financial targets. We also aligned the projection period for models between GAAP and statutory accounting.
The third and last category of changes in the annual actuarial review is separation related. We replaced the MetLife credit spread with a Brighthouse credit spread. This credit spread is only used in our variable-annuity, GAAP-embedded derivative liability valuation. We are actively involved in the industry efforts around the NAIC VA capital reform project, and we will continue to monitor emerging developments over the next year as the NAIC gets closer to finalizing standards.
The second theme for the quarter is variable annuity exposure management. As a reminder, we are managing our variable annuity business to a floor level of capital known as CTE95. CTE95 is defined as the assets required over the life of a product in the average of the worst 5% of future market scenarios. We hold assets to fund the CTE95 level and enter into hedges to protect CTE95 asset adequacy in adverse markets. The CTE95 total asset requirement for the quarter was $6.3 billion, up from $6 billion in the prior quarter. The increase was driven by impacts from the annual actuarial review, which increased our CTE95 target funding level by approximately $700 million. Favorable equity markets in the quarter only partially offset this impact.
Assets above CTE95 were $2.3 billion, unchanged on a sequential basis due to 3 contributing factors: first, the hedging program performed as we would expect in a strong upmarket quarter by contributing modestly to the growth in assets above CTE95; second, subsequent to the end of the quarter, Brighthouse Financial, Inc. contributed $200 million of holding company cash to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company; lastly, surplus assets in the nonvariable annuity blocks were redirected to the variable annuity block. 
We intend to manage our variable annuity business with assets of $2 billion to $3 billion above CTE95. This allows us to deploy an efficient hedging strategy with a greater use of out-of-the-money options to protect against market downside and retain a meaningful amount of upside from favorable movements in capital markets. Finally, the transition to our hedging strategy is complete with the weighted average life of our equity option book at approximately 3 years limiting rollover risk of expiring hedges.
The next theme is favorable underwriting. Across our life insurance businesses, we saw lower direct claims and a favorable impact from the reinsurance recaptures completed in the second quarter of 2017 that resulted in favorable impact to operating earnings of about $20 million sequentially. It is important to note that these 2 items, plus reserve changes, can be volatile from quarter to quarter.
The last theme I would like to discuss is expenses. Corporate expenses were $241 million pretax in the quarter, up approximately $32 million compared to the 2016 quarterly average, but still $15 million to $25 million lower than our quarterly expectations in the first full year post-separation. Corporate expenses do not include the $31 million of establishment costs that I mentioned earlier. As we make investments in our infrastructure over the coming years, we anticipate establishment costs to be in line with or higher than this quarter's levels. It is important to note that these establishment costs are already factored into our plan and financial targets.
Turning to the results at the segment level. Operating earnings in the annuity segment were $355 million in the quarter, including favorable notable items of $142 million. Strong equity markets offset continued negative net flows with annuity account values at $132 billion compared to $130 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Sequentially, results reflected lower DAC amortization and favorable taxes. 
Operating earnings in the life segment was $6 million in the quarter, including $17 million of net unfavorable notable items.  Overall, underwriting results in the quarter were favorable sequentially due to lower direct claims and higher retention resulting from reinsurance recaptures from MetLife in the second quarter. Taxes were also favorable sequentially.
Operating earnings in the Run-off segment were $83 million in the quarter, including favorable notable items of $9 million primarily related to the 2017 actuarial review. The segment comprises our legacy universal life with secondary guarantees, or ULSG, block and nonretail businesses in the legal entity. Operating results are typically split equally between the ULSG and the other businesses. This quarter, ULSG reserve growth was favorable relative to prior quarters.
Many of the underlying drivers across our segments were favorable compared to the prior quarter, including favorable underwriting and corporate expenses below our anticipated run rate. As a result, operating earnings in the quarter were favorably impacted by approximately $30 million to $40 million compared to the second quarter.
Let me close with an update on our capital position. First, preliminary combined total adjusted capital, or TAC, was $6.6 billion, $200 million above the prior quarter. Second, variable annuity assets above CTE95 remained at $2.3 billion. Our plan is to grow the assets above CTE95 to $3 billion, which, under our base case scenario, is gradual through 2019. This is an important milestone before beginning to return capital to shareholders. Third, cash and liquid assets at the holding companies after reflecting the previously mentioned $200 million capital contribution to the life company are approximately $575 million or about 4x our expected annual fixed charges. And finally, our leverage ratio of approximately 22.5% is below our goal of 25%. This provides us financial flexibility in managing our overall capital position.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Our program performed as we expected. We had earned $100 million performance from the hedge program in a quarter where volatility came down as well. That does take a little bit away from our hedge program performance. But even net of that, we had $100 million of positive performance excluding volatility. Had volatility not come down, we probably would have had a couple of hundred million of performance. Additionally, as you look at sensitivities on 256 and compare them with cash flow over multiple quarters and years on 257 and 257 -- 256 and 257 of the Form 10, I'd introduce a part around the passage of time.

Now on why we're still at $2.3 billion, I would really look at us in the third quarter because that's when we were independent, on our own and working towards growing to $2.3 billion. And things worked in the quarter as we expected. S&P was up 4%. So if you look at the sensitivity tables we gave you guys, we should have approximately a $400 million growth in the $2.3 billion. The hedge program gave us upside. It allows us to participate in the upside with the use of options. That was approximately $100 million vol. If it hadn't gone down, if it was unchanged, the sensitivity tables would be vol constant. We don't give you a sensitivity table on vol. But because we buy a lot of options, when volatility goes down to these historic low levels, 1-year vol is down to like 13 now. We lose some value in those options, which will bounce back if vol comes back up. And then the passage of time eats into some of the upside we have as time goes by.

Today, you will hear from Eric Steigerwalt, our President and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Anant Bhalla, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of senior management.
Our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal security laws. Brighthouse Financial's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in Brighthouse Financial's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Information discussed on today's call speaks only as of today, November 2, 2017. The company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed on today's call.
During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website, in our earnings release and in our financial supplement. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure has not been provided because Brighthouse Financial believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment income and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on net income. And finally, references to statutory results are preliminary due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statement.

Welcome to our first call as Brighthouse Financial. This is a meaningful milestone for us. Over the past 21 months, our team has worked tirelessly to transform Brighthouse Financial into a stand-alone company. These efforts culminated with our separation from MetLife on August 4 and our listing on the NASDAQ stock market on August 7. I would like to thank our employees for their incredible efforts throughout this separation process. I would also like to thank our policyholders and distribution partners for placing their trust in Brighthouse Financial.
Let me set the stage for the rest of my remarks by reiterating the key points of our strategy as an independent company: first, our goal is to offer a tailored set of annuity and life insurance solutions that are simple, transparent and provide value to advisers, clients and our shareholders; second, we will deliver our products to clients through a broad network of independent distribution partners; and third, we aim to become a cost-competitive manufacturer over time. Our management team, our board and our employees are focused on executing this strategy and delivering value to our shareholders.
A priority for us has been creating a recognizable brand that resonates with our distribution partners, their advisers and clients. In early March, we launched the Brighthouse Financial brand with a nationwide rollout of our first print and television advertising campaigns. These ads touched millions of people and were successful in introducing Brighthouse Financial to America. Last month, we began another round of advertising, which continues to build brand awareness and showcases our flagship Shield annuities. You may have seen some of these ads during the World Series and numerous other television shows. The initial feedback to our brand rollout and advertising has been very favorable. These campaigns have helped generate awareness in the market and have allowed us to hit the ground running as a new public company.
With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss 3 topics: first, I'll touch on progress made on the product and distribution front; next, I'll provide some perspectives on our third quarter earnings; and lastly, I will provide an update to our financial targets.
Let me turn to product and distribution. I've met with a number of advisers since we launched our brand in March. There is a lot of excitement among them about a focused scale player like Brighthouse Financial. That excitement is creating interest from advisers who already partner with us and advisers who want to begin a relationship with us. That excitement is also evident in our sales results.
Our annuity deposits were up 8%, both sequentially and quarter-over-quarter. Sales of our Shield annuities were $653 million in the quarter, up 67% quarter-over-quarter and up 15% sequentially. Shield generates strong value of new business for us while meeting critical needs of our distributors and clients. It is an example of a next-generation product that is also a good complement to our in-force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees.
In late July, we celebrated the launch of Index Horizons, the first product to be created as part of our 10-year distribution agreement with MassMutual. Index Horizons is a white-label, fixed-index annuity sold by MassMutual advisers. Brighthouse Financial assumes 90% of the economics through reinsurance with assumed sales of this product of approximately $70 million in the quarter. We are pleased with the launch of Index Horizons and excited to leverage our partnership with MassMutual's more than 9,000 advisers moving forward.
We will continue to explore offering new products that meet the needs of our distributors and shareholders in a balanced manner in addition to expanding our independent distribution footprint. I look forward to updating you on further progress on future earnings calls.
Now I'd like to take a moment to provide a few perspectives on our third quarter results. First, we completed our annual actuarial review and updated assumptions and models, leveraging an additional year of our own data combined with industry data to refine our assumptions to reflect emerging behavioral experience. We also aligned certain GAAP and statutory assumptions. I'm pleased that the VA hedging strategy performed in line with our expectations and helped offset some of the impact of the actuarial assumption changes. 
Anant will provide more detail on our third quarter results. Before I turn the call over to him, I want to touch on our financial targets.
We have set financial targets that we believe best measure the execution of our business strategy and align with the interest of shareholders. The targets for our base case scenario are: to begin returning cash to shareholders at 50% to 70%-plus of operating earnings by approximately the year 2020; to achieve mid- to high single-digit growth of operating earnings per share annually; and to maintain a stable operating return on equity of approximately 8% on average over time. 
This is an update to our initial target of approximately 9% for operating return on equity, which was included in our final Form 10 filing. The update reflects a change in GAAP equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, to approximately $12.5 billion, which was larger than previously anticipated. There were 3 primary drivers impacting the beginning GAAP equity: first, the distribution paid to MetLife was $400 million less than originally projected; second, certain separation and restructuring transactions resulted in a more favorable impact to equity than originally estimated; and third, Brighthouse had positive net income in the second quarter.
To achieve these targets, we must consistently execute on the following goals: prudently manage our existing variable annuity block over time and across market cycles with robust asset adequacy at or above CTE95; design and sell compelling products that generate positive value of new business and are aligned with our strategy of delivering distributable cash flow over time; and improve our operating cost competitiveness as a stand-alone company over time.
Let we provide a few perspectives on expenses. We expect that our expenses will be higher in our first few years as we transition to being a stand-alone public company and as we make investments in our technology, infrastructure and businesses. We made good progress in the quarter, implementing systems and processes at Brighthouse that enabled us to exit 13 of our 218 TSAs with MetLife, in line with our plans to end the year with approximately 155 TSAs.
In summary, we are executing on our plans and are very pleased with our sales momentum during our first reporting period as a stand-alone company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Anant to discuss our third quarter financial results in more details. Anant?"

Today, I will discuss our results for the third quarter, along with our perspective on the key underlying themes.Before we get into the third quarter results, I would like to address one tax accounting item",1553,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will discuss our results for the third quarter, along with our perspective on the key underlying themes.
Before we get into the third quarter results, I would like to address one tax accounting item. In the quarter, we recorded a noncash tax expense of approximately $1.1 billion related to a tax obligation triggered prior to our separation from MetLife. This tax expense has no impact on our stockholders' equity, which we also refer to as our book value. Brighthouse will not be required to make any payment with respect to such tax expense.
The reported net loss in the quarter was $943 million compared to a net loss of $158 million in the third quarter of 2016. The reported operating loss was $676 million in the quarter compared to operating earnings of $329 million in the third quarter of 2016.
Third quarter ending book value per share, including accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, was approximately $115; and book value per share, excluding AOCI, was approximately $104. Excluding the previously mentioned noncash tax expense, net income would have been $130 million and operating earnings would have been $397 million.
There were 2 other net favorable notable items in the quarter that impacted operating earnings, totaling $103 million or $0.86 per share. Specifically, $134 million net favorable impacts primarily related to our annual actuarial review and $31 million of establishment costs related to our technology transformation and branding efforts. The overall net income impact from the annual actuarial review was an unfavorable $62 million after tax.
Today, I will provide perspectives around 4 themes that impacted our overall financial performance this quarter. The first key theme is the annual actuarial review. The annual actuarial review this quarter represents our first as an independent company. In addition to 1 additional year of observable market and company experience, the primary new data source available to Brighthouse Financial this year are the results of the quantitative impact study, or QIS, conducted for the NAIC Variable Annuity Reserve and Capital Reform initiative. Brighthouse Financial is one of about a dozen companies participating in this industry initiative. The study provides granular client behavior-specific experience on an industry-wide basis. 
While the NAIC VA reform initiative is still a work in progress with full implementation likely more than a couple of years out, the availability of such a rich data set has informed our update to long-term assumptions about client behavior. This year's client behavior-specific updates for Brighthouse are in addition to our 2016 actuarial review that, among other things, lowered guaranteed minimum income benefit, or GMIB, annuitization election rates to 2% for clients under the age of 80.
All of our 2017 annual actuarial review assumption and model changes can be classified into 3 broad categories. First, client behavior. We reduced lapse floor assumptions for all variable-annuity GMIB and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit, or GMWB contracts to 1.5% for deep in-the-money contracts, down from 2% to 3%, respectively.
We updated our assumptions about variable annuity withdrawal behavior for GMWB for life contracts to reflect contract age in addition to client age over time. This change results in earlier client withdrawals for a GMWB contract after the end of the guaranteed roll-up of the benefit base compared to a typical GMIB contract. Additionally, we reflected refinements to our life book behavior assumptions on mortality, lapses and premium payment patterns.
The second category relates to the harmonization of models and assumptions between GAAP and statutory accounting. As a result of this harmonization effort, we reduced our GAAP separate account return assumptions to the mid-6% range for all of our valuation models. This puts our valuation models in line with our base case financial projection assumption outlined in the Form 10, which is the basis for setting our financial targets. We also aligned the projection period for models between GAAP and statutory accounting.
The third and last category of changes in the annual actuarial review is separation related. We replaced the MetLife credit spread with a Brighthouse credit spread. This credit spread is only used in our variable-annuity, GAAP-embedded derivative liability valuation. We are actively involved in the industry efforts around the NAIC VA capital reform project, and we will continue to monitor emerging developments over the next year as the NAIC gets closer to finalizing standards.
The second theme for the quarter is variable annuity exposure management. As a reminder, we are managing our variable annuity business to a floor level of capital known as CTE95. CTE95 is defined as the assets required over the life of a product in the average of the worst 5% of future market scenarios. We hold assets to fund the CTE95 level and enter into hedges to protect CTE95 asset adequacy in adverse markets. The CTE95 total asset requirement for the quarter was $6.3 billion, up from $6 billion in the prior quarter. The increase was driven by impacts from the annual actuarial review, which increased our CTE95 target funding level by approximately $700 million. Favorable equity markets in the quarter only partially offset this impact.
Assets above CTE95 were $2.3 billion, unchanged on a sequential basis due to 3 contributing factors: first, the hedging program performed as we would expect in a strong upmarket quarter by contributing modestly to the growth in assets above CTE95; second, subsequent to the end of the quarter, Brighthouse Financial, Inc. contributed $200 million of holding company cash to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company; lastly, surplus assets in the nonvariable annuity blocks were redirected to the variable annuity block. 
We intend to manage our variable annuity business with assets of $2 billion to $3 billion above CTE95. This allows us to deploy an efficient hedging strategy with a greater use of out-of-the-money options to protect against market downside and retain a meaningful amount of upside from favorable movements in capital markets. Finally, the transition to our hedging strategy is complete with the weighted average life of our equity option book at approximately 3 years limiting rollover risk of expiring hedges.
The next theme is favorable underwriting. Across our life insurance businesses, we saw lower direct claims and a favorable impact from the reinsurance recaptures completed in the second quarter of 2017 that resulted in favorable impact to operating earnings of about $20 million sequentially. It is important to note that these 2 items, plus reserve changes, can be volatile from quarter to quarter.
The last theme I would like to discuss is expenses. Corporate expenses were $241 million pretax in the quarter, up approximately $32 million compared to the 2016 quarterly average, but still $15 million to $25 million lower than our quarterly expectations in the first full year post-separation. Corporate expenses do not include the $31 million of establishment costs that I mentioned earlier. As we make investments in our infrastructure over the coming years, we anticipate establishment costs to be in line with or higher than this quarter's levels. It is important to note that these establishment costs are already factored into our plan and financial targets.
Turning to the results at the segment level. Operating earnings in the annuity segment were $355 million in the quarter, including favorable notable items of $142 million. Strong equity markets offset continued negative net flows with annuity account values at $132 billion compared to $130 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Sequentially, results reflected lower DAC amortization and favorable taxes. 
Operating earnings in the life segment was $6 million in the quarter, including $17 million of net unfavorable notable items.  Overall, underwriting results in the quarter were favorable sequentially due to lower direct claims and higher retention resulting from reinsurance recaptures from MetLife in the second quarter. Taxes were also favorable sequentially.
Operating earnings in the Run-off segment were $83 million in the quarter, including favorable notable items of $9 million primarily related to the 2017 actuarial review. The segment comprises our legacy universal life with secondary guarantees, or ULSG, block and nonretail businesses in the legal entity. Operating results are typically split equally between the ULSG and the other businesses. This quarter, ULSG reserve growth was favorable relative to prior quarters.
Many of the underlying drivers across our segments were favorable compared to the prior quarter, including favorable underwriting and corporate expenses below our anticipated run rate. As a result, operating earnings in the quarter were favorably impacted by approximately $30 million to $40 million compared to the second quarter.
Let me close with an update on our capital position. First, preliminary combined total adjusted capital, or TAC, was $6.6 billion, $200 million above the prior quarter. Second, variable annuity assets above CTE95 remained at $2.3 billion. Our plan is to grow the assets above CTE95 to $3 billion, which, under our base case scenario, is gradual through 2019. This is an important milestone before beginning to return capital to shareholders. Third, cash and liquid assets at the holding companies after reflecting the previously mentioned $200 million capital contribution to the life company are approximately $575 million or about 4x our expected annual fixed charges. And finally, our leverage ratio of approximately 22.5% is below our goal of 25%. This provides us financial flexibility in managing our overall capital position.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Our program performed as we expected. We had earned $100 million performance from the hedge program in a quarter where volatility came down as well. That does take a little bit away from our hedge program performance. But even net of that, we had $100 million of positive performance excluding volatility. Had volatility not come down, we probably would have had a couple of hundred million of performance.

The CTE95 goes down. Now on why we're still at $2.3 billion, I would really look at us in the third quarter because that's when we were independent, on our own and working towards growing to $2.3 billion. And things worked in the quarter as we expected. S&P was up 4%. So if you look at the sensitivity tables we gave you guys, we should have approximately a $400 million growth in the $2.3 billion. The hedge program gave us upside. It allows us to participate in the upside with the use of options. That was approximately $100 million vol. If it hadn't gone down, if it was unchanged, the sensitivity tables would be vol constant. We don't give you a sensitivity table on vol. But because we buy a lot of options, when volatility goes down to these historic low levels, 1-year vol is down to like 13 now. We lose some value in those options, which will bounce back if vol comes back up. And then the passage of time eats into some of the upside we have as time goes by.

Flows could -- net negative flows could slow down lapses or you need a fair amount more sales. And I would say if you take a look or whatever your guess is, whatever reasonable guess is, at our annual rate for sales, we're going to grow it from here. And I think we're showing how we're going to do that: growth across the board, not just in Wells Fargo. We're experiencing growth in many of our distributors. We also have the brand-new FIA with -- through MassMutual, which, on a net basis, was only about $70 million in this quarter. So you can think about that increasing. So I'm looking for sales growth year-over-year sequentially for a while now. However, it's going to take years, a number of years, and I haven't thrown one out.
