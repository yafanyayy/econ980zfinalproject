Welcome to first quarter 2017 conference call. We're off to a good start this year with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posting solid results. On a consolidated basis, we reported $499 million in revenue",1024,"Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to first quarter 2017 conference call. We're off to a good start this year with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posting solid results. On a consolidated basis, we reported $499 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.93. CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas resulting in 7% as reported and 9% constant currency revenue growth. Our dailies silicone hydrogel lenses grew 49%, with Biofinity and Avaira products combined growing 15% both in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 29% or 3% pro forma. Fertility was the high spot with growth of 83% or 9% pro forma. 
Moving into the details. CooperVision posted Q1 revenues of 390 -- $389 million, up 9% in constant currency. The Americas grew 7%, Europe grew 7%, and Asia Pacific posted a very strong growth of 16%, all in constant currency. Throughout the world, our growth continues to be driven by our market-leading portfolio of products, including Biofinity in the monthly space, Avaira in the 2-week space and diversified product set in the dailies space. Regarding Biofinity, we continue posting strong growth, supported by our ongoing expansion of the product family, including Biofinity Energys and Biofinity Toric XR. Both of these new products are early into their life cycles but are being received incredibly well and are now available in the Americas and more recently in Europe. 
In addition to growing Biofinity through product expansion, we're also seeing diversified geographic growth, including double-digit growth in all regions this quarter. Within the 2-week space, our transition of Avaira to Avaira Vitality from Avaira continues to move forward successfully. Our customers are receiving this upgraded 2-week offering positively, and we will continue making this transition as we move through the year. 
Regarding the daily lenses. Our broad offering of silicone hydrogel lenses continues driving growth with our clariti porfolio of Spheres, Torics and Multifocals leading the way. MyDay is also doing very well, posting strong growth throughout the world, and MyDay Toric is now being rolled out in Europe, following the successful launch in Japan. 
Turning to product categories. Torics grew a solid 14%, and multifocals grew 7%, both in constant currency. We have a highly diversified product offering within these categories, including both silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel lenses within the daily, 2-week and monthly modalities. We're the global leader in these specialty lenses and expect to continue delivering growth for many years. Looking at just silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 20% in constant currency and now represent 63% of total CooperVision revenues. 
It's no surprise that our strong performance is being driven by our silicone hydrogel portfolio. We also have the broadest portfolio and I believe the best options available in the market. This includes being the only company offering a premium in the mass market, silicone hydrogel lenses, including Spheres, Torics and Multifocal lenses. 
Now turning to the overall contact lens market. We took share in calendar Q4 following -- growing 10% with the market up 6%. Geographically, we grew 12% in the Americas, while the market grew 5%. We grew in line with the market in EMEA or Europe, up 5%. And in Asia Pacific, which grew 10% with the market up 8%. On a modality basis, single-use lenses continued driving growth, with CooperVision up 15% and the market up 13%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 7%, with the market flat. For the calendar -- full calendar 2016, CooperVision grew 9%, while the market grew 4%, so another strong year where we more than doubled the market. 
Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% growth, driven by the continuing shift to improve technology, such as a wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing shift to dailies, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base. We continue growing faster than the market. We expect to continue to grow faster than the market. 
Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported Q1 revenues of $110 million, up 29%, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 3% with fertility, leading the way up 83% or 9% pro forma. I'm also happy to say, this is the first quarter fertility has posted revenue greater than the office and surgical products business. Our initiative to become the global leader in fertility, again, back in 2012 with our acquisition of Origio and has continued through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Our fertility growth is now driven by diversified portfolio of medical device products, capital equipment and lab services, and we believe our market-leading portfolio is the broadest in the space. 
Our office and surgical products business was softer than we would have liked, declining 2% due to tough comps tied to the expiration of our OEM contract in last year's first quarter. If we exclude the OEM contract, growth within the office and surgical would have been 1%, and total for surgical growth would have been 5%. We expect the office and surgical part of the business to bounce back in Q2 to a more normal low to mid-single-digit growth rate. 
Finally, on CooperSurgical, the teams continue making a lot of progress, integrating acquisitions. This includes integrating Wallace, which was acquired in early Q1. Integrating multiple acquisitions is always challenging, especially while running your existing operations, so I'd like to thank the CooperSurgical team for their extra hours and hard work. I remain very excited about the future of this business. 
Lastly, let me update you on our initiatives around expanding our sales and marketing activities within both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. We made a lot of progress this quarter, and I'm happy with where we stand. We're continuing to hire sales reps around the world, while also investing in marketing programs to help drive performance this year and into next. I believe we're in a great position with both businesses, and it's prudent to continue investing to drive long-term growth. 
With that, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication, they truly drive the success of our business. And now, I'll turn it over to Al."

As a reminder, most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, and a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in today's earnings release. It's worth noting that our non-GAAP adjustments are quite a bit smaller this quarter as our Sauflon integration is behind us. Bob covered revenues, so let me walk through the rest of the financials and provide some color on our results. For the quarter, gross margins were 62.9% on a consolidated basis, up from 61.4% last year. CooperVision's gross margins were 63.1%, up from 60.9% last year, driven by product mix, led by Biofinity. CooperSurgical's gross margins were 62.2%, down from 63.6% last year due to a couple of acquisitions, which have lower gross margins. We expect this year-over-year gross margin pressure at CooperSurgical to continue in Q2, at which point we'll annualize the acquisitions. 
One other point on gross margins, which we mentioned out on December call, is that we're still forecasting elevated idle equipment and inventory charges this year. There's no change to our estimate of around $0.30 for the full year with these cost declining as we move through the year. I do believe we'll see some of these cost roll into next year, but we're clearly making progress utilizing more equipment and transitioning products. 
Operating expenses grew 13.1% in the quarter, driven by additional cost from acquisitions. We also continued investing in infrastructure throughout both businesses to support continued growth. Included in these investments is our focus on sales and marketing, and as we discussed in our December call, we're expecting heightened expenses this year in both CooperVision and CooperSurgical as we move through the year. Regardless, operating income grew 14.6%, resulting in operating margins of 22.8%, up from 22.1% last year. 
Moving to items below operating income. We reported $7.3 million of interest expense. We also posted an FX loss of $3 million due to some large currency moves, which resulted in losses tied to revaluing our offshore intercompany loans. Or effective tax rate was 7.9%, which was lower than our initial guidance of 10%, largely due to 2 discrete items, one positive and one negative. These were the adoption of a new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation, which was a positive, offset by a new valuation allowance, which was a negative. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.93, with roughly 49.4 million average shares outstanding. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total debt increased $91 million in the quarter to approximately $1.43 billion. This was driven by our $168 million acquisition of Wallace that closed in the first week of November. We also recorded a $4.1 million balance sheet adjustment to our fiscal 2016 year-end retained earnings to reflect an increase in the rebate accrual accumulated primarily on activity prior to fiscal 2014. This adjustment does not have any impact on this year's numbers. 
Moving to free cash flow. We had a strong start to the year with $80 million of free cash in Q1, comprised of roughly $109 million of operating cash flow, offset by $29 million of CapEx. Regarding guidance for fiscal 2017, revenue guidance remains the same with consolidated revenues at $2.09 billion to $2.13 billion. This is comprised of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion at CooperVision, which equates to roughly 6% to 8% constant currency growth, and $470 million to $480 million at CooperSurgical, which equates to roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth. 
The remainder of the P&L is expected to be similar to our prior discussions, although there are 2 negatives that we need to hurdle. The first is we're now forecasting interest expense to be $2 million higher at around $30 million due to assuming a 25 basis point rate hike at this month's Fed meeting. The second is we've updated FX rates and the impact is now a negative $0.16 for the year or $0.06 worse than when we provided initial guidance in December. This detrimental move has basically happened over the last few days as the odds of a March rate hike have increased. For the primary currencies, we're using euro at 1.05, yen at 1.15 and pound at 1.22. These 2 items combine for a $0.10 negative impact to EPS. 
Having said that, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 on the low end by $0.10 to incorporate our Q1 performance and improved confidence around the remainder of the year. The new range is now $9.10 to $9.30 based on 49.4 million shares outstanding. Note that the FX move also negatively impacted our revenue forecast by an additional $4 million, increasing the full year negative impact to $61 million, but we're guiding to hurdle that. 
Lastly, we continue focusing on delivering consistent annual performance. This includes expecting over $400 million in free cash flow this year, which supports our objective of delivering over $2 billion of cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years, while also targeting operating margins of 28% in 2021. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

Just one quick question, one quick financial and then one strategic question for you, guys.

Is it on plan? Can you talk about  that $10 million? Is it kind of ratable through the year? And then, the strategic question is, you guys can do really well on the specialty side, of course, but there are some recent competitive launches in that space. So I guess, at a high level, could you talk about how you think about the competitive landscape in torics and multifocals?"

On the first item on the sales and marketing, probably the best way to visualize that as well as the timing is we essentially have expanded already as of the end of January our sales force, both in surgical and vision combined, 10% compared to where",385,"Sure. On the first item on the sales and marketing, probably the best way to visualize that as well as the timing is we essentially have expanded already as of the end of January our sales force, both in surgical and vision combined, 10% compared to where it was 6 months ago. So a lot of that investment and a lot of the hiring is already taking place. And obviously, what's gone on in the last 6 months will continue to run through the P&L on a go-forward basis and we'll continue to expand upon that going forward. But pretty much, most of what it would take to get to the $10 million run rate is in place. On the second point, as far as -- yes, we're #1 in the area of specialty lenses, torics and multifocal lenses. You've seen that we put up some pretty good numbers in our -- and clearly, in that venue with our torics business being up 14%. And keep in mind, torics is the lion's share. When you think about the market, it's about 27%, 28% specialty lenses, and for us, it's much higher than that, 42%. And we're sustaining good growth with toric. Our product, Biofinity XR Toric, is pretty knowledge -- novel. A lot of competitors will not go there and address the, if you will, the fringes of the bell-shaped curve. They do the easier set torics but not the custom. So we do have proprietary, if you will, advantage. In addition, obviously, our strategy in the 1-day market with clariti being the only one with a toric, a sphere and a multifocal puts us at an advantage in the 1-day space, and particularly puts us at advantage being the only silicone hydrogel in the mass market of the 1-day space. So we think we have enough going for us. The market will continue to perform well worldwide, with a lot more maturity in the U.S. and a lot less outside the U.S. We will continue to have solid growth in specialty lenses in many of the locations regionally throughout the rest of the world beyond the U.S. So we're looking forward to a good market going forward, and we think we have a broad-enough portfolio to hold our own and continue to actually gain."

And then, with Biofinity off of a very large base since our franchise product, if you will, within CooperVision within the company. The -- we're very early in the game with Energys just starting to pick up momentum in different places. We're very early in the game with Biofinity XR Toric, so look for those to help continue that momentum. And it will take us a very long time to roll them out around the world. Meaning, it's well beyond 2017, even 2018, when it comes to some of those venues. We're, in fact, still rolling out Biofinity, and it's first stage in some parts of the world as we look to some of the -- South America and Asian theaters as well. So a long way to go on that. Gross margins, we're not really leaving a lot of gross margin on the table in terms of -- the market is strong from a pricing point of view and a lot of the margins will continue to improve as we convert Avaira into Vitality and as we convert -- as we continue to expand in Energys, likewise to say, trade-up strategy.

There is, obviously, the disruption of, are they going to be sold or kept. And Novartis reiterated their assessment that they're still open. They still haven't made up their mind on how what to do about Alcon and how that compares to them being a pharma business, if you will. So we obviously like the uncertainty that, that presents. We also like the fact that, with few exceptions, Alcon is at the more mature end of the growth curve with some of their major products, both in the monthly as well as in the 1 Day space. TOTAL1 has the target on its back within -- clearly, within the premium silicone hydrogel space. Everyone is shooting at them. And Cooper is shooting at them and MOIST in the mass market 1 Day space. B&L put up some numbers. They highlight the growth products. They do not put it all together other than to say that their overall business grew 2% of lens of lens care and lenses. So nothing to write home about there and obviously, caught off in the cloud of what that volume is going to do basically pay down some of its $30 billion that. And obviously, in the marketplace, we think that their products are basically behind the curve, both as to the fact that they do not have a 1 Day silicone hydrogel in that market, and they still do not have and they've been adding,I don't know for how many years now, a complete portfolio with ultra, meaning a toric and a multifocal. So very [indiscernible] rolled out in that venue. And for what most of that trade-ins, PureVision into ultra anyway. J&J has completed the acquisition of AML. And obviously, they'll be going through and integration within the Vistakon or eye care piece. They did mention on their call and they put up very robust numbers, but they did indicate that, I think, 3% of the growth was buying on the shelf that had to do with the price increase they had effective early January, and so they were setting into a pretty broad-based price increase that pulled forward some of the purchases. And that's what they were referring to. I would not take that across the rest of the industry. I think that was mainly unique to their strategy and their view that you can -- that was room to increase pricing in the marketplace."

The short share gains in CVIs in EMEA almost in line with the market for the trailing 12 months, first, is that a multiple market for CVI in the Americas and APAC? So Bob, can you just talk about the competitive dynamics in Europe versus America's in APAC, and why they're more muted? What is it more muted your guess Is that just a function of clariti being in Europe first? And then, the second one, Al, maybe this is more for you. I know you guys are getting the gross margin benefit from the very of Vitality in terms of make that switch. But are you guys are seeing that in fiscal '17?

So we have the highest market share of our 3 key geographic locations in Europe. Contrast that to APAC, where we have the lose market share of our 3 regions, yet we have a very full product portfolio. So we would expect, prospectively, to continue to grow faster in Asia Pac, than we would in EMEA.

You obviously had the pull forward of J&J orders before they had some price increases. You delivered 9% in constant currency growth, but you also had an easier comp. So I'd wake think about the full traffic in UPP offices, potential forward orders of J&J versus easier comps than what you all delivered, and should expect the second quarter for some of that to be a little bit easier for you? On the margin side, for gross margins, I just was thinking about you delivered 63.1% in CVI, which is up 220 bps year-over-year. And I just want to understand how to think about the $0.30 of idle equipment still weighing on that segment because you exited 2016 at 64.8, which is a pretty nice uptick.

So some of it's there. I think we've -- we put up good numbers in the first quarter, so most of that is a reflection of our performance in the market in total, with the market growing 6%, us growing 9%. So the market is a little bit more robust. We're assuming that momentum continues as far as the product rollouts, be it Energys, be it Vitality conversion. And I think the Vitality conversion is more, as Al pointed out, somewhat disruptive as you go through the conversion process from a gross margin point of view. And from an Energys perspective, we're spending more time converting than we are looking for new business right now with the Vitality product. So that's some work to do there that will give us some momentum. We also -- I commented on the investment we're making in the sales force. So my belief is The Street is going to translate into a better shot at the top line growth, and I think we have read that going forward for us also, and that momentum builds. We now have a some of the people that we hired in the fourth quarter last year that will start becoming productive as we move throughout the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and things of that nature."

CooperVision has pretty strong gross margins right now, and that does offer a sub side, that $0.30 of idle equipment charge impact on gross margins. So when we look at that, it's not necessarily going to be leaner, but that $0.30 should be declining as we move through this year and moving into next year. We'll probably still have some we have idle equipment associated mostly with dailies, when the strength you're seeing in dailies obviously, is good news as we're turning lights on. And then, some of the inventory activities is associated with things like Avaira and so forth, so that should also decline if the transition happens.

You can look at the fact that the market for 2-week and monthly is flat, and we put up 7% growth to the quarter and the market ex dailies for the trailing 12 months, is down 1% and we put up 6% growth, which obviously, the lion's share of that is driven by our monthly performance with Biofinity. So Biofinity is stellar, as I mentioned earlier, on a question that both Avaira and Biofinity are growing ballpark about the same in constant currency so both around in that 15% mark. So there is nothing -- and that's quite an accomplishment for Vitality when the Energys is really going into that swap out more than it is a trade-up at this juncture.

And I think this is part -- the flip side to that where all of a sudden you had strong publicly reported numbers, and I believe the same thing is true that the skewing that we talked about occurred before was the fact that there was a huge pipeline cell of OASYS 1 Day in the market in the third quarter and the fourth calendar quarter in 2015, and now you're seeing the flip side to that. That pipeline then would have been minimized in the publicly reported number by the difference between growth to net, particularly at J&J and that's speculative but I do think reasonable. So now you have the flip side, where there's less rebating and gross to net differential that is involved. And all of a sudden, the publicly reported numbers are coming out stronger than was the case a year ago. So that gross to net impacted -- more the fourth quarter of publicly reported data a year ago and this year, a lot less.

Relative to the type of marketing dollars, Cooper's spending its marketing dollars broad-based. We had some new novel products to talk about like Energys, so there is some more unique marketing tools that are going on there. We continue to be very active in terms of our alignment with the eye care professionals in terms of making them more efficient. So whether it's a lens or whatever it is called, a number of programs that help the eye care professional become more and more proactive in terms of dealing with their -- their individual customer, so we ought to make them better business people, and we're investing money in that domain. In Surgical on the other hand, as I mentioned, there, it's transitioning from what may have been a word-of-mouth industry in PGS and PGD, which is [indiscernible] diagnostics and screening, to really talking about it and doing the push/pull, not only with the IVF centers but also with the OB/GYN. So there's stories to be told. Once again, trying to enhance the industry called IVF, if you will. MyDay, the MyDay growth versus the clariti growth, basically, MyDay offers a smaller -- much smaller base going faster as a percent but off a smaller base. It is in the process of rolling out the toric and they were at -- first inning of that rollout with a lot of innings to go yet. Even with MyDay, we're probably only in the second or third inning, so a lot further to go. clariti is probably more in the fourth inning than the first or second innings, but it likewise has a lot of countries to access and quite frankly, now that we've gone through that transition of the enhanced edge, we will be more and more aggressive in terms of going after not converting one clariti to another by going after new fits competitive products, so the mass market. So look for the combination of our sales force, feet in the street, the marketing program and having plenty of capacity to put behind the product to make us more aggressive in the mass market space."

Welcome to first quarter 2017 conference call. We're off to a good start this year with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posting solid results. On a consolidated basis, we reported $499 million in revenue",1024,"Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to first quarter 2017 conference call. We're off to a good start this year with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posting solid results. On a consolidated basis, we reported $499 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.93. CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas resulting in 7% as reported and 9% constant currency revenue growth. Our dailies silicone hydrogel lenses grew 49%, with Biofinity and Avaira products combined growing 15% both in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 29% or 3% pro forma. Fertility was the high spot with growth of 83% or 9% pro forma. 
Moving into the details. CooperVision posted Q1 revenues of 390 -- $389 million, up 9% in constant currency. The Americas grew 7%, Europe grew 7%, and Asia Pacific posted a very strong growth of 16%, all in constant currency. Throughout the world, our growth continues to be driven by our market-leading portfolio of products, including Biofinity in the monthly space, Avaira in the 2-week space and diversified product set in the dailies space. Regarding Biofinity, we continue posting strong growth, supported by our ongoing expansion of the product family, including Biofinity Energys and Biofinity Toric XR. Both of these new products are early into their life cycles but are being received incredibly well and are now available in the Americas and more recently in Europe. 
In addition to growing Biofinity through product expansion, we're also seeing diversified geographic growth, including double-digit growth in all regions this quarter. Within the 2-week space, our transition of Avaira to Avaira Vitality from Avaira continues to move forward successfully. Our customers are receiving this upgraded 2-week offering positively, and we will continue making this transition as we move through the year. 
Regarding the daily lenses. Our broad offering of silicone hydrogel lenses continues driving growth with our clariti portfolio of spheres, torics and multifocals leading the way. MyDay is also doing very well, posting strong growth throughout the world, and MyDay Toric is now being rolled out in Europe, following the successful launch in Japan. 
Turning to product categories. Torics grew a solid 14%, and multifocals grew 7%, both in constant currency. We have a highly diversified product offering within these categories, including both silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel lenses within the daily, 2-week and monthly modalities. We're the global leader in these specialty lenses and expect to continue delivering growth for many years. Looking at just silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 20% in constant currency and now represent 63% of total CooperVision revenues. 
It's no surprise that our strong performance is being driven by our silicone hydrogel portfolio. We also have the broadest portfolio and I believe the best options available in the market. This includes being the only company offering a premium in the mass market, silicone hydrogel lenses, including spheres, torics and multifocal lenses. 
Now turning to the overall contact lens market. We took share in calendar Q4 following -- growing 10% with the market up 6%. Geographically, we grew 12% in the Americas, while the market grew 5%. We grew in line with the market in EMEA or Europe, up 5%. And in Asia Pacific, which grew 10% with the market up 8%. On a modality basis, single-use lenses continued driving growth, with CooperVision up 15% and the market up 13%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 7%, with the market flat. For the calendar -- full calendar 2016, CooperVision grew 9%, while the market grew 4%, so another strong year where we more than doubled the market. 
Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% growth, driven by the continuing shift to improve technology, such as a wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing shift to dailies, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base. We continue growing faster than the market. We expect to continue to grow faster than the market. 
Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported Q1 revenues of $110 million, up 29%, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 3% with fertility, leading the way up 83% or 9% pro forma. I'm also happy to say, this is the first quarter fertility has posted revenue greater than the office and surgical products business. Our initiative to become the global leader in fertility, again, back in 2012 with our acquisition of Origio and has continued through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Our fertility growth is now driven by diversified portfolio of medical device products, capital equipment and lab services, and we believe our market-leading portfolio is the broadest in the space. 
Our office and surgical products business was softer than we would have liked, declining 2% due to tough comps tied to the expiration of our OEM contract in last year's first quarter. If we exclude the OEM contract, growth within the office and surgical would have been 1%, and total for surgical growth would have been 5%. We expect the office and surgical part of the business to bounce back in Q2 to a more normal low to mid-single-digit growth rate. 
Finally, on CooperSurgical, the teams continue making a lot of progress, integrating acquisitions. This includes integrating Wallace, which was acquired in early Q1. Integrating multiple acquisitions is always challenging, especially while running your existing operations, so I'd like to thank the CooperSurgical team for their extra hours and hard work. I remain very excited about the future of this business. 
Lastly, let me update you on our initiatives around expanding our sales and marketing activities within both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. We made a lot of progress this quarter, and I'm happy with where we stand. We're continuing to hire sales reps around the world, while also investing in marketing programs to help drive performance this year and into next. I believe we're in a great position with both businesses, and it's prudent to continue investing to drive long-term growth. 
With that, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication, they truly drive the success of our business. And now, I'll turn it over to Al."

It's worth noting that our non-GAAP adjustme",847,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, and a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in today's earnings release. It's worth noting that our non-GAAP adjustments are quite a bit smaller this quarter as our Sauflon integration is behind us. Bob covered revenues, so let me walk through the rest of the financials and provide some color on our results. For the quarter, gross margins were 62.9% on a consolidated basis, up from 61.4% last year. CooperVision's gross margins were 63.1%, up from 60.9% last year, driven by product mix, led by Biofinity. CooperSurgical's gross margins were 62.2%, down from 63.6% last year due to a couple of acquisitions, which have lower gross margins. We expect this year-over-year gross margin pressure at CooperSurgical to continue in Q2, at which point we'll annualize the acquisitions. 
One other point on gross margins, which we mentioned out on December call, is that we're still forecasting elevated idle equipment and inventory charges this year. There's no change to our estimate of around $0.30 for the full year with these cost declining as we move through the year. I do believe we'll see some of these cost roll into next year, but we're clearly making progress utilizing more equipment and transitioning products. 
Operating expenses grew 13.1% in the quarter, driven by additional cost from acquisitions. We also continued investing in infrastructure throughout both businesses to support continued growth. Included in these investments is our focus on sales and marketing, and as we discussed in our December call, we're expecting heightened expenses this year in both CooperVision and CooperSurgical as we move through the year. Regardless, operating income grew 14.6%, resulting in operating margins of 22.8%, up from 22.1% last year. 
Moving to items below operating income. We reported $7.3 million of interest expense. We also posted an FX loss of $3 million due to some large currency moves, which resulted in losses tied to revaluing our offshore intercompany loans. Or effective tax rate was 7.9%, which was lower than our initial guidance of 10%, largely due to 2 discrete items, one positive and one negative. These were the adoption of a new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation, which was a positive, offset by a new valuation allowance, which was a negative. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.93, with roughly 49.4 million average shares outstanding. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total debt increased $91 million in the quarter to approximately $1.43 billion. This was driven by our $168 million acquisition of Wallace that closed in the first week of November. We also recorded a $4.1 million balance sheet adjustment to our fiscal 2016 year-end retained earnings to reflect an increase in the rebate accrual accumulated primarily on activity prior to fiscal 2014. This adjustment does not have any impact on this year's numbers. 
Moving to free cash flow. We had a strong start to the year with $80 million of free cash in Q1, comprised of roughly $109 million of operating cash flow, offset by $29 million of CapEx. Regarding guidance for fiscal 2017, revenue guidance remains the same with consolidated revenues at $2.09 billion to $2.13 billion. This is comprised of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion at CooperVision, which equates to roughly 6% to 8% constant currency growth, and $470 million to $480 million at CooperSurgical, which equates to roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth. 
The remainder of the P&L is expected to be similar to our prior discussions, although there are 2 negatives that we need to hurdle. The first is we're now forecasting interest expense to be $2 million higher at around $30 million due to assuming a 25 basis point rate hike at this month's Fed meeting. The second is we've updated FX rates and the impact is now a negative $0.16 for the year or $0.06 worse than when we provided initial guidance in December. This detrimental move has basically happened over the last few days as the odds of a March rate hike have increased. For the primary currencies, we're using euro at 1.05, yen at 1.15 and pound at 1.22. These 2 items combine for a $0.10 negative impact to EPS. 
Having said that, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 on the low end by $0.10 to incorporate our Q1 performance and improved confidence around the remainder of the year. The new range is now $9.10 to $9.30 based on 49.4 million shares outstanding. Note that the FX move also negatively impacted our revenue forecast by an additional $4 million, increasing the full year negative impact to $61 million, but we're guiding to hurdle that. 
Lastly, we continue focusing on delivering consistent annual performance. This includes expecting over $400 million in free cash flow this year, which supports our objective of delivering over $2 billion of cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years, while also targeting operating margins of 28% in 2021. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

Just one quick question, one quick financial and then one strategic question for you, guys.

Is it on plan? Can you talk about  that $10 million? Is it kind of ratable through the year? And then, the strategic question is, you guys can do really well on the specialty side, of course, but there are some recent competitive launches in that space. So I guess, at a high level, could you talk about how you think about the competitive landscape in torics and multifocals?"

On the first item on the sales and marketing, probably the best way to visualize that as well as the timing is we essentially have expanded already as of the end of January our sales force, both in surgical and vision combined, 10% compared to where",385,"Sure. On the first item on the sales and marketing, probably the best way to visualize that as well as the timing is we essentially have expanded already as of the end of January our sales force, both in surgical and vision combined, 10% compared to where it was 6 months ago. So a lot of that investment and a lot of the hiring is already taking place. And obviously, what's gone on in the last 6 months will continue to run through the P&L on a go-forward basis and we'll continue to expand upon that going forward. But pretty much, most of what it would take to get to the $10 million run rate is in place. On the second point, as far as -- yes, we're #1 in the area of specialty lenses, torics and multifocal lenses. You've seen that we put up some pretty good numbers in our -- and clearly, in that venue with our torics business being up 14%. And keep in mind, torics is the lion's share. When you think about the market, it's about 27%, 28% specialty lenses, and for us, it's much higher than that, 42%. And we're sustaining good growth with toric. Our product, Biofinity XR Toric, is pretty knowledge -- novel. A lot of competitors will not go there and address the, if you will, the fringes of the bell-shaped curve. They do the easier set torics but not the custom. So we do have proprietary, if you will, advantage. In addition, obviously, our strategy in the 1-day market with clariti being the only one with a toric, a sphere and a multifocal puts us at an advantage in the 1-day space, and particularly puts us at advantage being the only silicone hydrogel in the mass market of the 1-day space. So we think we have enough going for us. The market will continue to perform well worldwide, with a lot more maturity in the U.S. and a lot less outside the U.S. We will continue to have solid growth in specialty lenses in many of the locations regionally throughout the rest of the world beyond the U.S. So we're looking forward to a good market going forward, and we think we have a broad-enough portfolio to hold our own and continue to actually gain."

And then, with Biofinity off of a very large base since our franchise product, if you will, within CooperVision within the company. The -- we're very early in the game with Energys just starting to pick up momentum in different places. We're very early in the game with Biofinity XR Toric, so look for those to help continue that momentum. And it will take us a very long time to roll them out around the world. Meaning, it's well beyond 2017, even 2018, when it comes to some of those venues. We're, in fact, still rolling out Biofinity, and it's first stage in some parts of the world as we look to some of the -- South America and Asian theaters as well. So a long way to go on that. Gross margins, we're not really leaving a lot of gross margin on the table in terms of -- the market is strong from a pricing point of view and a lot of the margins will continue to improve as we convert Avaira into Vitality and as we convert -- as we continue to expand in Energys, likewise to say, trade-up strategy.

There is obviously the disruption of are they going to be spun-off, sold or kept. And Novartis reiterated their assessment that they're still open, they still have not made up their mind on what to do about Alcon and how that compares to them being a pharma business, if you will. So we obviously like the uncertainty that, that presents. We also like the fact that, with few exceptions, Alcon is at the more mature end of the growth curve with some of their major products, both in the monthly as well as in the 1-day space. TOTAL1 has the target on its back within -- clearly, within the premium silicone hydrogel space. Everyone is shooting at them. And Cooper is shooting at them and MOIST in the mass market 1-day space. B&L put up some numbers. They highlight the growth products. They do not put it all together other than to say that their overall business grew 2% of lens care and lenses. So nothing to write home about there. They obviously are caught up in the cloud of what is that Valeant going to do to basically pay down some of its $30 billion of debt. And obviously, in the marketplace, we think that their products are basically behind the curve, both as to the fact that they do not have a 1-day silicone hydrogel in that market, and they still do not have, and they've been at it for I don't know for how many years now, a complete portfolio with ultra, meaning a toric and a multifocal. So very slow to roll out in that venue. And quite frankly, most of what they've done their spend, trading from PureVision into ultra anyway. J&J just completed the acquisition of AMO. And obviously, they'll be going through an integration within the Vistakon for eye care piece. They did mention on their call and they put up very robust numbers, but they did indicate that, I think, 3% of their growth was tight buy and sell on shelf that had to do with the price increase they had effective early January, and so they were selling into a pretty broad-based price increase that pulled forward some of their purchases. And that's what they were referring to. I would not take that across the rest of the industry. I think that was mainly unique to their strategy and their view that you can -- there was room to increase pricing in the marketplace."

So Bob, can you just talk to the competitive dynamics in Europe versus Americas and APAC, and why they're more muted? Why is it a more muted European share gains? Is that just a function of clariti being in Europe? First. And then, the second one, Al, maybe this is more for you. I know you guys are getting the gross margin benefit from Avaira to Vitality in terms of when someone makes that switch. But are you guys seeing that in fiscal '17?

So we have the highest market share of our 3 geographic locations in Europe, as contrast that to Asia Pac where we have the lowest market share of our 3 regions, yet we have a very full product portfolio. So we would expect, prospectively, to continue to grow faster in Asia Pac than we would in EMEA. Having said that, we still think we have a lot of legs in terms of growth within EMEA in terms of gaining market share in that market.

But you already talked about J&J, but I just wanted to delve on this a little bit more. It sounds when doing channel checks, the foot traffic in ECP offices were up pretty high in December and January. You obviously had the pull forward of J&J orders before they had some price increases. You delivered 9% in constant currency growth, but you also had an easier comp. So how do I think about the foot traffic in ECP offices, potential forward orders of J&J versus easier comps than what you all delivered, and should expect the second quarter for some of that to be a little bit easier for you? On the margin side, for gross margins, I just was thinking about you delivered 63.1% in CVI, which is up 220 bps year-over-year. And I just want to understand how to think about the $0.30 of idle equipment still weighing on that segment because you exited 2016 at 64.8%, which is a pretty nice uptick.

So some of it there. I think, we've put up good numbers in the first quarter, so most of that is a reflection of our performance in the market in total, with the market growing 6%, us growing 9%. So the market was a little bit more robust. We're assuming that, that momentum continues as far as the product rollouts, be it Energys, be it Vitality conversion. And I think, the Vitality conversion is more, as Al pointed out, somewhat disruptive as you go through the conversion process from a gross margin point of view. And from an energy perspective, we're spending more time converting than we are looking for new business right now with the Vitality product. So we've got some work to do there that will give us some momentum. We also -- I commented on the investment we're making in the sales force. So my belief is feet on the street are going to translate into a better shot at good top line growth, and I think we have that going for us also. And that momentum builds. We now have some of the people that we hired in the fourth quarter last year that will start becoming productive as we move throughout the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and things of that nature."

So when we look at that, it's not necessarily going to be linear, but that $0.30 should be declining as we move through this year. And moving to next year, we'll probably still have some. You have idle equipment associated mostly with daily as well. The strength that we're seeing in dailies, obviously, is good news as we're turning lines on. And then, some of the heightened inventory activity is associated with things like Avaira and so forth, so that should also decline if that transition happens.

You can look at the fact that the market for 2-week and monthly is flat, and we put up 7% growth to the quarter. And the market, ex dailies, for the trailing 12 months is down 1% and we put up 6% growth, which, obviously, the lion's share of that is driven by our monthly performance with Biofinity. So Biofinity is stellar, as I mentioned earlier, on a question that both Avaira and Biofinity are growing ballpark about the same in constant currency, so both in around that 15% mark. So there is nothing -- and that's quite an accomplishment for Vitality when the energy is really going into that to swap out more than it is a trade up at this juncture.

I think we had this discussion last quarter when we talked about there was a little skewing between market data and publicly reported data. And I think, this is kind of -- it's part of the -- the flip side of that where all of a sudden, you had strong public reported numbers, and I believe the same thing is true that the skewing that we talked about that occurred before was the fact that there was a huge pipeline sell of when OASYS 1-day hit the market in the third quarter and the fourth calendar quarter in 2015. And now, you're seeing the flip side of that. That pipeline sell would then minimize in the publicly reported number by the difference between growth to net, particularly at J&J, and that's speculative, but I do think are reasonable. So now, you have the flip side where there's less rebating and gross to net differential that is involved. And all of a sudden, the public reported numbers are coming out stronger than was the case a year ago. So that gross to net more impacted more the fourth quarter of public reported data a year ago, and this year, a lot less.

So the sales and marketing investment is pretty intense in both Vision and Surgical. Surgical obviously is putting together a kind of a whole new business model with a lot of energy on the sales and marketing effort of this new combining. So you have an integration going on, which also have some products being sold with the sales force for the first time. It used to be some of those companies we bought were word-of-mouth in a cottage industry of IVF. So we're investing in both sides of the equation, if you will, both segments. Relative to the type of marketing dollars, Cooper's spending its marketing dollars broad-based. We have some new novel products to talk about like Energys, so there is some more unique marketing tools that are going on there. We continue to be very active in terms of our alignment with the eye care professional in terms of making them more efficient. So whether it's a lens area or whatever it is called, a number of programs that help the eye care professional become more and more proactive in terms of dealing with their customer -- their individual customer. So we're out to make them better business people. And we invest money in that domain. In Surgical on the other hand, as I mentioned, there, it's transitioning from what may have been a word-of-mouth industry in PGS and PGD, which is preemptive implementation diagnostics and screening, to really talking about it and doing the push/pull, not only with the IVF centers but also with the OB/GYN. So there's stories to be told. Once again, trying to enhance the industry called IVF, if you will. MyDay, the MyDay growth versus the clariti growth, basically, MyDay off of a smaller -- much smaller base is growing faster as a percent but off a smaller base. It is in the process of rolling out the toric and they were at -- we're in the first inning of that rollout with a lot of innings to go yet. Even with MyDay, we're probably only in the second or third inning, so a lot further to go. clariti is probably more in the fourth inning than the first or second innings, but it likewise has a lot of countries to access. And quite frankly, now that we've gone through the transition of the enhanced edge, we will be more and more aggressive in terms of going after not converting one clariti to another but going after new fits on our competitive products, so the mass market. So look for the combination of our sales force, feet on the street, the marketing programs and having a good -- plenty of capacity to put behind the product to make us more aggressive in the mass market space."

Welcome to first quarter 2017 conference call. We're off to a good start this year with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posting solid results. On a consolidated basis, we reported $499 million in revenu",1024,"Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to first quarter 2017 conference call. We're off to a good start this year with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posting solid results. 
On a consolidated basis, we reported $499 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.93. CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas resulting in 7% as reported and 9% constant currency revenue growth. 
Our dailies silicone hydrogel lenses grew 49%, with Biofinity and Avaira products combined growing 15% both in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 29% or 3% pro forma. Fertility was the high spot with growth of 83% or 9% pro forma. 
Moving into the details. CooperVision posted Q1 revenues of 390 -- $389 million, up 9% in constant currency. The Americas grew 7%, Europe grew 7%, and Asia Pacific posted a very strong growth of 16%, all in constant currency. 
Throughout the world, our growth continues to be driven by our market-leading portfolio of products, including Biofinity in the monthly space, Avaira in the 2-week space and diversified product set in the dailies space. Regarding Biofinity, we continue posting strong growth, supported by our ongoing expansion of the product family, including Biofinity Energys and Biofinity Toric XR. Both of these new products are early into their life cycles but are being received incredibly well and are now available in the Americas and more recently in Europe. 
In addition to growing Biofinity through product expansion, we're also seeing diversified geographic growth, including double-digit growth in all regions this quarter. Within the 2-week space, our transition of Avaira to Avaira Vitality from Avaira continues to move forward successfully. Our customers are receiving this upgraded 2-week offering positively, and we will continue making this transition as we move through the year. 
Regarding the daily lenses. Our broad offering of silicone hydrogel lenses continues driving growth with our clariti portfolio of spheres, torics and multifocals leading the way. MyDay is also doing very well, posting strong growth throughout the world, and MyDay Toric is now being rolled out in Europe, following the successful launch in Japan. 
Turning to product categories. Torics grew a solid 14% and multifocals grew 7%, both in constant currency. We have a highly diversified product offering within these categories including both silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel lenses within the daily, 2-week and monthly modalities. We're the global leader in these specialty lenses and expect to continue delivering growth for many years. Looking at just silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 20% in constant currency and now represent 63% of total CooperVision revenues. 
It's no surprise that our strong performance is being driven by our silicone hydrogel portfolio. We also have the broadest portfolio and I believe the best options available in the market. This includes being the only company offering a premium in the mass market, silicone hydrogel lenses, including spheres, torics and multifocal lenses. 
Now turning to the overall contact lens market. We took share in calendar Q4 following -- growing 10% with the market up 6%. Geographically, we grew 12% in the Americas while the market grew 5%. We grew in line with the market in EMEA or Europe, up 5%. And in Asia Pacific which grew 10% with the market up 8%. 
On a modality basis, single-use lenses continued driving growth, with CooperVision up 15% and the market up 13%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 7%, with the market flat. For the calendar -- full calendar 2016, CooperVision grew 9% while the market grew 4%. So another strong year where we more than doubled the market. 
Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% growth driven by the continuing shift to improve technology, such as a wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing shift to dailies, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base. We continue growing faster than the market. We expect to continue to grow faster than the market. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported Q1 revenues of $110 million, up 29%, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 3% with fertility, leading the way up 83% or 9% pro forma. I'm also happy to say this is the first quarter fertility has posted revenue greater than the office and surgical products business. Our initiative to become the global leader in fertility, again, back in 2012 with our acquisition of Origio and has continued through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Our fertility growth is now driven by diversified portfolio of medical device products, capital equipment and lab services, and we believe our market-leading portfolio is the broadest in the space. 
Our office and surgical products business was softer than we would have liked, declining 2% due to tough comps tied to the expiration of our OEM contract in last year's first quarter. If we exclude the OEM contract, growth within the office and surgical would have been 1%, and total for surgical growth would have been 5%. We expect the office and surgical part of the business to bounce back in Q2 to a more normal, low to mid-single-digit growth rate. 
Finally, on CooperSurgical, the teams continue making a lot of progress integrating acquisitions. This includes integrating Wallace, which was acquired in early Q1. Integrating multiple acquisitions is always challenging especially while running your existing operations, so I'd like to thank the CooperSurgical team for their extra hours and hard work. I remain very excited about the future of this business. 
Lastly, let me update you on our initiatives around expanding our sales and marketing activities within both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. We made a lot of progress this quarter, and I'm happy with where we stand. We're continuing to hire sales reps around the world, while also investing in marketing programs to help drive performance this year and into next. I believe we're in a great position with both businesses, and it's prudent to continue investing to drive long-term growth. 
With that, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication, they truly drive the success of our business. And now, I'll turn it over to Al."

As a reminder, most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, and a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in today's earnings release. It's worth noting that our non-GAAP adjustme",847,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, and a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in today's earnings release. It's worth noting that our non-GAAP adjustments are quite a bit smaller this quarter as our Sauflon integration is behind us. Bob covered revenues, so let me walk through the rest of the financials and provide some color on our results. 
For the quarter, gross margins were 62.9% on a consolidated basis, up from 61.4% last year. CooperVision's gross margins were 63.1%, up from 60.9% last year, driven by product mix, led by Biofinity. 
CooperSurgical's gross margins were 62.2%, down from 63.6% last year due to a couple of acquisitions, which have lower gross margins. We expect this year-over-year gross margin pressure at CooperSurgical to continue in Q2, at which point we'll annualize the acquisitions. 
One other point on gross margins which we mentioned out on December call, is that we're still forecasting elevated idle equipment and inventory charges this year. There's no change to our estimate of around $0.30 for the full year with these cost declining as we move through the year. I do believe we'll see some of these cost roll into next year, but we're clearly making progress utilizing more equipment and transitioning products. 
Operating expenses grew 13.1% in the quarter, driven by additional cost from acquisitions. We also continued investing in infrastructure throughout both businesses to support continued growth. Included in these investments is our focus on sales and marketing, and as we discussed in our December call, we're expecting heightened expenses this year in both CooperVision and CooperSurgical as we move through the year. Regardless, operating income grew 14.6%, resulting in operating margins of 22.8%, up from 22.1% last year. 
Moving to items below operating income. We reported $7.3 million of interest expense. We also posted an FX loss of $3 million due to some large currency moves, which resulted in losses tied to revaluing our offshore intercompany loans. Or effective tax rate was 7.9%, which was lower than our initial guidance of 10%, largely due to 2 discrete items, one positive and one negative. These were the adoption of a new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation, which was a positive, offset by a new valuation allowance, which was a negative. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.93, with roughly 49.4 million average shares outstanding. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total debt increased $91 million in the quarter to approximately $1.43 billion. This was driven by our $168 million acquisition of Wallace that closed in the first week of November. We also recorded a $4.1 million balance sheet adjustment to our fiscal 2016 year-end retained earnings to reflect an increase in the rebate accrual accumulated primarily on activity prior to fiscal 2014. This adjustment does not have any impact on this year's numbers. 
Moving to free cash flow. We had a strong start to the year with $80 million of free cash in Q1, comprised of roughly $109 million of operating cash flow, offset by $29 million of CapEx. Regarding guidance for fiscal 2017, revenue guidance remains the same with consolidated revenues at $2.09 billion to $2.13 billion. This is comprised of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion at CooperVision, which equates to roughly 6% to 8% constant currency growth, and $470 million to $480 million at CooperSurgical, which equates to roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth. 
The remainder of the P&L is expected to be similar to our prior discussions, although there are 2 negatives that we need to hurdle. The first is we're now forecasting interest expense to be $2 million higher at around $30 million due to assuming a 25 basis point rate hike at this month's Fed meeting. 
The second is we've updated FX rates and the impact is now a negative $0.16 for the year or $0.06 worse than when we provided initial guidance in December. This detrimental move has basically happened over the last few days as the odds of a March rate hike have increased. For the primary currencies, we're using euro at 1.05, yen at 1.15 and pound at 1.22. These 2 items combine for a $0.10 negative impact to EPS. 
Having said that, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 on the low end by $0.10 to incorporate our Q1 performance and improved confidence around the remainder of the year. The new range is now $9.10 to $9.30 based on 49.4 million shares outstanding. Note that the FX move also negatively impacted our revenue forecast by an additional $4 million, increasing the full year negative impact to $61 million, but we're guiding to hurdle that. 
Lastly, we continue focusing on delivering consistent annual performance. This includes expecting over $400 million in free cash flow this year, which supports our objective of delivering over $2 billion of cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years, while also targeting operating margins of 28% in 2021. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

Just one quick question, one quick financial and then one strategic question for you, guys. On the financial side, the OM was -- the operating margin came in very strong, higher than what we're looking for, and SG&A came in a bit lighter. So can you just talk about the investment spend? Is it on plan? Can you talk about that $10 million, is it kind of ratable through the year? And then the strategic question is, you guys can do really well on the specialty side, of course, but there are some recent competitive launches in that space. So I guess at a high level, could you talk about how you think about the competitive landscape in torics and multifocals?"
263609,418783816,1149161,"The Cooper Companies, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 02, 2017",2017-03-02,"Earnings Calls","The Cooper Companies, Inc.","Executives","Sure. On the first item on the sales and marketing, probably the best way to visualize that as well as the timing is we essentially have expanded already as of the end of January our sales force, both in surgical and vision combined 10% compared to where",385,"Sure. On the first item on the sales and marketing, probably the best way to visualize that as well as the timing is we essentially have expanded already as of the end of January our sales force, both in surgical and vision combined 10% compared to where it was 6 months ago. So a lot of that investment and a lot of the hiring is already taking place. And obviously, what's gone on in the last 6 months will continue to run through the P&L on a go-forward basis, and we'll continue to expand upon that going forward. But pretty much, most of what it would take to get to the $10 million run rate is in place. 
On the second point, as far as -- yes, we're #1 in the area of specialty lenses, torics and multifocal lenses. You've seen that we put up some pretty good numbers in our -- clearly, in that venue with our torics business being up 14%. And keep in mind, torics is the lion's share. When you think about the market, it's about 27%, 28% specialty lenses, and for us, it's much higher than that, 42%. And we're sustaining good growth with toric. Our product, Biofinity XR Toric, is pretty knowledge -- novel. A lot of competitors will not go there and address the, if you will, the fringes of the bell-shaped curve. They do the easier to set torics but not the custom. So we do have proprietary, if you will, advantage. In addition, obviously, our strategy in the 1-day market with clariti being the only one with a toric, a sphere and a multifocal, puts us at an advantage in the 1-day space, and particularly puts us at advantage being the only silicone hydrogel in the mass market of the 1-day space. So we think we have enough going for us. The market will continue to perform well worldwide, with a lot more maturity in the U.S. and a lot less outside the U.S. We will continue to have solid growth in specialty lenses in many of the locations regionally throughout the rest of the world beyond the U.S. So we're looking forward to a good market going forward, and we think we have a broad-enough portfolio to hold our own and continue to actually gain."

And then with Biofinity off of a very large base since our franchise product, if you will, within CooperVision within the company. The -- we're very early in the game with Energys, just starting to pick up momentum in different places. We're very early in the game with Biofinity XR Toric. So look for those to help continue that momentum. And it will take us a very long time to roll them out around the world, meaning it's well beyond 2017, even 2018, when it comes to some of those venues. We're in fact still rolling out Biofinity, and it's first stage in some parts of the world as we look to some of the -- South America and Asian theaters as well. So a long way to go on that. Gross margins, we're not really leaving a lot of gross margin on the table in terms of -- the market is strong from a pricing point of view and a lot of the margins will continue to improve as we convert Avaira into Vitality and as we convert -- as we continue to expand in Energys, likewise to say, trade-up strategy. So there are some considerable tailwinds in our cost of goods gross margin area."

We're incredibly active right now integrating the acquisitions that we've done and heavily focused on that. So we'll continue to look at acquisitions if they make sense. They need to be the same as what they've been in the past, which is strategic acquisitions that offer us a good return. If we could find those kind of opportunities, we'll capitalize on them. And if we can't, that's also okay. We'll execute on the acquisitions we've done and integrate them and drive synergies."

There is obviously the disruption of are they going to be spun-off, sold or kept. And Novartis reiterated their assessment that they're still open, they still have not made up their mind on what to do about Alcon and how that compares to them being a pharma business, if you will. So we obviously like the uncertainty that, that presents. We also like the fact that, with few exceptions, Alcon is at the more mature end of the growth curve with some of their major products, both in the monthly as well as in the 1-day space. TOTAL1 has the target on its back within -- clearly, within the premium silicone hydrogel space. Everyone is shooting at them. And Cooper is shooting at them and MOIST in the mass market 1-day space. B&L put up some numbers. They highlight the growth products. They do not put it all together other than to say that their overall business grew 2% of lens care and lenses. So nothing to write home about there. They obviously are caught up in the cloud of what is that Valeant going to do to basically pay down some of its $30 billion of debt. And obviously, in the marketplace, we think that their products are basically behind the curve, both as to the fact that they do not have a 1-day silicone hydrogel in that market, and they still do not have, and they've been at it for I don't know for how many years now, a complete portfolio with ultra, meaning a toric and a multifocal. So very slow to roll out in that venue. And quite frankly, most of what they've done their spend, trading from PureVision into ultra anyway. J&J just completed the acquisition of AMO. And obviously, they'll be going through an integration within the Vistakon for eye care piece. They did mention on their call and they put up very robust numbers, but they did indicate that, I think, 3% of their growth was pipeline sale on shelf that had to do with the price increase they had effective early January, and so they were selling into a pretty broad-based price increase that pulled forward some of their purchases. And that's what they were referring to. I would not take that across the rest of the industry. I think that was mainly unique to their strategy and their view that you can -- there was room to increase pricing in the marketplace."

So Bob, can you just talk to the competitive dynamics in Europe versus Americas and APAC, and why they're more muted? Why is it a more muted European share gains? Is that just a function of clariti being in Europe? First. And then the second one, Al, maybe this is more for you. I know you guys are getting the gross margin benefit from Avaira to Vitality in terms of when someone makes that switch. But are you guys seeing that in fiscal '17?

So we have the highest market share of our 3 geographic locations in Europe, as contrast that to Asia Pac where we have the lowest market share of our 3 regions, yet we have a very full product portfolio. So we would expect, prospectively, to continue to grow faster in Asia Pac than we would in EMEA. Having said that, we still think we have a lot of legs in terms of growth within EMEA in terms of gaining market share in that market.

But you already talked about J&J, but I just wanted to delve on this a little bit more. It sounds when doing channel checks, the foot traffic in ECP offices were up pretty high in December and January. You obviously had the pull forward of J&J orders before they had some price increases. You delivered 9% in constant currency growth, but you also had an easier comp. So how do I think about the foot traffic in ECP offices, potential forward orders of J&J versus easier comps than what you all delivered, and should we expect the second quarter for some of that to be a little bit easier for you? On the margin side, for gross margins, I just was thinking about you delivered 63.1% in CVI, which is up 220 bps year-over-year. And I just want to understand how to think about the $0.30 of idle equipment still weighing on that segment because you exited 2016 at 64.8%, which is a pretty nice uptick.

So some of it there. I think, we've put up good numbers in the first quarter, so most of that is a reflection of our performance in the market in total, with the market growing 6%, us growing 9%. So the market was a little bit more robust. We're assuming that, that momentum continues as far as the product rollouts, be it Energys, be it Vitality conversion. And I think, the Vitality conversion is more, as Al pointed out, somewhat disruptive as you go through the conversion process from a gross margin point of view. And from an energy perspective, we're spending more time converting than we are looking for new business right now with the Vitality product. So we've got some work to do there that will give us some momentum. We also -- I commented on the investment we're making in the sales force. So my belief is feet on the street are going to translate into a better shot at good top line growth, and I think we have that going for us also. And that momentum builds. We now have some of the people that we hired in the fourth quarter last year that will start becoming productive as we move throughout the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and things of that nature."

So when we look at that, it's not necessarily going to be linear, but that $0.30 should be declining as we move through this year. And moving to next year, we'll probably still have some. You have idle equipment associated mostly with daily as well. The strength that we're seeing in daily, obviously, is good news as we're turning lines on. And then some of the heightened inventory activity associated with things like Avaira and so forth, so that should also decline if that transition happens.

You can look at the fact that the market for 2-week and monthly is flat, and we put up 7% growth to the quarter. And the market, ex dailies, for the trailing 12 months is down 1% and we put up 6% growth, which, obviously, the lion's share of that is driven by our monthly performance with Biofinity. So Biofinity is stellar, as I mentioned earlier, on a question that both Avaira and Biofinity are growing ballpark about the same in constant currency, so both in around that 15% mark. So there is nothing -- and that's quite an accomplishment for Vitality when the energy is really going into that to swap out more than it is a trade up at this juncture.

I think we had this discussion last quarter when we talked about there was a little skewing between market data and publicly reported data. And I think, this is kind of -- it's part of the -- the flip side of that where all of a sudden, you had strong public reported numbers, and I believe the same thing is true that the skewing that we talked about that occurred before was the fact that there was a huge pipeline sell of when OASYS 1-day hit the market in the third quarter and the fourth calendar quarter in 2015. And now, you're seeing the flip side of that. That pipeline sell would then minimize in the publicly reported number by the difference between growth to net, particularly at J&J, and that's speculative, but I do think are reasonable. So now, you have the flip side where there's less rebating and gross to net differential that is involved. And all of a sudden, the public reported numbers are coming out stronger than was the case a year ago. So that gross to net more impacted more the fourth quarter of public reported data a year ago, and this year, a lot less.

So the sales and marketing investment is pretty intense in both Vision and Surgical. Surgical obviously is putting together a kind of a whole new business model with a lot of energy on the sales and marketing effort of this new combining. So you have an integration going on, which also have some products being sold with the sales force for the first time. It used to be some of those companies we bought were word-of-mouth in a cottage industry of IVF. So we're investing in both sides of the equation, if you will, both segments. Relative to the type of marketing dollars, Cooper's spending its marketing dollars broad-based. We have some new novel products to talk about like Energys, so there is some more unique marketing tools that are going on there. We continue to be very active in terms of our alignment with the eye care professional in terms of making them more efficient. So whether it's a lens area or whatever it is called, a number of programs that help the eye care professional become more and more proactive in terms of dealing with their customer -- their individual customer. So we're out to make them better business people. And we invest money in that domain. In Surgical on the other hand, as I mentioned, there, it's transitioning from what may have been a word-of-mouth industry in PGS and PGD, which is preemptive implementation diagnostics and screening, to really talking about it and doing the push/pull, not only with the IVF centers but also with the OB/GYN. So there's stories to be told. Once again, trying to enhance the industry called IVF, if you will. MyDay, the MyDay growth versus the clariti growth, basically, MyDay off of a smaller -- much smaller base is growing faster as a percent but off a smaller base. It is in the process of rolling out the toric and they were at -- we're in the first inning of that rollout with a lot of innings to go yet. Even with MyDay, we're probably only in the second or third inning, so a lot further to go. clariti is probably more in the fourth inning than the first or second innings, but it likewise has a lot of countries to access. And quite frankly, now that we've gone through the transition of the enhanced edge, we will be more and more aggressive in terms of going after not converting one clariti to another but going after new fits on our competitive products, so the mass market. So look for the combination of our sales force, feet on the street, the marketing programs and having a good -- plenty of capacity to put behind the product to make us more aggressive in the mass market space."

On a consolidated basis, we reported $499 million in revenu",1024,"Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to first quarter 2017 conference call. We're off to a good start this year with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posting solid results. 
On a consolidated basis, we reported $499 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.93. CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas resulting in 7% as reported and 9% constant currency revenue growth. 
Our dailies silicone hydrogel lenses grew 49%, with Biofinity and Avaira products combined growing 15% both in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 29% or 3% pro forma. Fertility was the high spot with growth of 83% or 9% pro forma. 
Moving into the details. CooperVision posted Q1 revenues of 390 -- $389 million, up 9% in constant currency. The Americas grew 7%, Europe grew 7%, and Asia Pacific posted a very strong growth of 16%, all in constant currency. 
Throughout the world, our growth continues to be driven by our market-leading portfolio of products, including Biofinity in the monthly space, Avaira in the 2-week space and diversified product set in the dailies space. Regarding Biofinity, we continue posting strong growth, supported by our ongoing expansion of the product family, including Biofinity Energys and Biofinity Toric XR. Both of these new products are early into their life cycles but are being received incredibly well and are now available in the Americas and more recently in Europe. 
In addition to growing Biofinity through product expansion, we're also seeing diversified geographic growth, including double-digit growth in all regions this quarter. Within the 2-week space, our transition of Avaira to Avaira Vitality from Avaira continues to move forward successfully. Our customers are receiving this upgraded 2-week offering positively, and we will continue making this transition as we move through the year. 
Regarding the daily lenses. Our broad offering of silicone hydrogel lenses continues driving growth with our clariti portfolio of spheres, torics and multifocals leading the way. MyDay is also doing very well, posting strong growth throughout the world, and MyDay Toric is now being rolled out in Europe, following the successful launch in Japan. 
Turning to product categories. Torics grew a solid 14% and multifocals grew 7%, both in constant currency. We have a highly diversified product offering within these categories including both silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel lenses within the daily, 2-week and monthly modalities. We're the global leader in these specialty lenses and expect to continue delivering growth for many years. Looking at just silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 20% in constant currency and now represent 63% of total CooperVision revenues. 
It's no surprise that our strong performance is being driven by our silicone hydrogel portfolio. We also have the broadest portfolio and I believe the best options available in the market. This includes being the only company offering a premium in the mass market, silicone hydrogel lenses, including spheres, torics and multifocal lenses. 
Now turning to the overall contact lens market. We took share in calendar Q4 following -- growing 10% with the market up 6%. Geographically, we grew 12% in the Americas while the market grew 5%. We grew in line with the market in EMEA or Europe, up 5%. And in Asia Pacific which grew 10% with the market up 8%. 
On a modality basis, single-use lenses continued driving growth, with CooperVision up 15% and the market up 13%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 7%, with the market flat. For the calendar -- full calendar 2016, CooperVision grew 9% while the market grew 4%. So another strong year where we more than doubled the market. 
Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% growth driven by the continuing shift to improve technology, such as a wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing shift to dailies, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base. We continue growing faster than the market. We expect to continue to grow faster than the market. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported Q1 revenues of $110 million, up 29%, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 3% with fertility, leading the way up 83% or 9% pro forma. I'm also happy to say this is the first quarter fertility has posted revenue greater than the office and surgical products business. Our initiative to become the global leader in fertility, again, back in 2012 with our acquisition of Origio and has continued through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Our fertility growth is now driven by diversified portfolio of medical device products, capital equipment and lab services, and we believe our market-leading portfolio is the broadest in the space. 
Our office and surgical products business was softer than we would have liked, declining 2% due to tough comps tied to the expiration of our OEM contract in last year's first quarter. If we exclude the OEM contract, growth within the office and surgical would have been 1%, and total for surgical growth would have been 5%. We expect the office and surgical part of the business to bounce back in Q2 to a more normal, low to mid-single-digit growth rate. 
Finally, on CooperSurgical, the teams continue making a lot of progress integrating acquisitions. This includes integrating Wallace, which was acquired in early Q1. Integrating multiple acquisitions is always challenging especially while running your existing operations, so I'd like to thank the CooperSurgical team for their extra hours and hard work. I remain very excited about the future of this business. 
Lastly, let me update you on our initiatives around expanding our sales and marketing activities within both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. We made a lot of progress this quarter, and I'm happy with where we stand. We're continuing to hire sales reps around the world, while also investing in marketing programs to help drive performance this year and into next. I believe we're in a great position with both businesses, and it's prudent to continue investing to drive long-term growth. 
With that, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication, they truly drive the success of our business. And now, I'll turn it over to Al."

As a reminder, most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, and a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in today's earnings release. It's worth noting that our non-GAAP adjustme",847,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, and a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in today's earnings release. It's worth noting that our non-GAAP adjustments are quite a bit smaller this quarter as our Sauflon integration is behind us. Bob covered revenues, so let me walk through the rest of the financials and provide some color on our results. 
For the quarter, gross margins were 62.9% on a consolidated basis, up from 61.4% last year. CooperVision's gross margins were 63.1%, up from 60.9% last year, driven by product mix, led by Biofinity. 
CooperSurgical's gross margins were 62.2%, down from 63.6% last year due to a couple of acquisitions, which have lower gross margins. We expect this year-over-year gross margin pressure at CooperSurgical to continue in Q2, at which point we'll annualize the acquisitions. 
One other point on gross margins which we mentioned out on December call, is that we're still forecasting elevated idle equipment and inventory charges this year. There's no change to our estimate of around $0.30 for the full year with these cost declining as we move through the year. I do believe we'll see some of these cost roll into next year, but we're clearly making progress utilizing more equipment and transitioning products. 
Operating expenses grew 13.1% in the quarter, driven by additional cost from acquisitions. We also continued investing in infrastructure throughout both businesses to support continued growth. Included in these investments is our focus on sales and marketing, and as we discussed in our December call, we're expecting heightened expenses this year in both CooperVision and CooperSurgical as we move through the year. Regardless, operating income grew 14.6%, resulting in operating margins of 22.8%, up from 22.1% last year. 
Moving to items below operating income. We reported $7.3 million of interest expense. We also posted an FX loss of $3 million due to some large currency moves, which resulted in losses tied to revaluing our offshore intercompany loans. Or effective tax rate was 7.9%, which was lower than our initial guidance of 10%, largely due to 2 discrete items, one positive and one negative. These were the adoption of a new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation, which was a positive, offset by a new valuation allowance, which was a negative. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.93, with roughly 49.4 million average shares outstanding. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total debt increased $91 million in the quarter to approximately $1.43 billion. This was driven by our $168 million acquisition of Wallace that closed in the first week of November. We also recorded a $4.1 million balance sheet adjustment to our fiscal 2016 year-end retained earnings to reflect an increase in the rebate accrual accumulated primarily on activity prior to fiscal 2014. This adjustment does not have any impact on this year's numbers. 
Moving to free cash flow. We had a strong start to the year with $80 million of free cash in Q1, comprised of roughly $109 million of operating cash flow, offset by $29 million of CapEx. Regarding guidance for fiscal 2017, revenue guidance remains the same with consolidated revenues at $2.09 billion to $2.13 billion. This is comprised of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion at CooperVision, which equates to roughly 6% to 8% constant currency growth, and $470 million to $480 million at CooperSurgical, which equates to roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth. 
The remainder of the P&L is expected to be similar to our prior discussions, although there are 2 negatives that we need to hurdle. The first is we're now forecasting interest expense to be $2 million higher at around $30 million due to assuming a 25 basis point rate hike at this month's Fed meeting. 
The second is we've updated FX rates and the impact is now a negative $0.16 for the year or $0.06 worse than when we provided initial guidance in December. This detrimental move has basically happened over the last few days as the odds of a March rate hike have increased. For the primary currencies, we're using euro at 1.05, yen at 1.15 and pound at 1.22. These 2 items combine for a $0.10 negative impact to EPS. 
Having said that, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 on the low end by $0.10 to incorporate our Q1 performance and improved confidence around the remainder of the year. The new range is now $9.10 to $9.30 based on 49.4 million shares outstanding. Note that the FX move also negatively impacted our revenue forecast by an additional $4 million, increasing the full year negative impact to $61 million, but we're guiding to hurdle that. 
Lastly, we continue focusing on delivering consistent annual performance. This includes expecting over $400 million in free cash flow this year, which supports our objective of delivering over $2 billion of cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years, while also targeting operating margins of 28% in 2021. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

Just one quick question, one quick financial and then one strategic question for you, guys.

Is it on plan? Can you talk about that $10 million, is it kind of ratable through the year? And then the strategic question is, you guys can do really well on the specialty side, of course, but there are some recent competitive launches in that space. So I guess at a high level, could you talk about how you think about the competitive landscape in torics and multifocals?"

On the first item on the sales and marketing, probably the best way to visualize that as well as the timing is we essentially have expanded already as of the end of January our sales force, both in surgical and vision combined 10% compared to where",385,"Sure. On the first item on the sales and marketing, probably the best way to visualize that as well as the timing is we essentially have expanded already as of the end of January our sales force, both in surgical and vision combined 10% compared to where it was 6 months ago. So a lot of that investment and a lot of the hiring is already taking place. And obviously, what's gone on in the last 6 months will continue to run through the P&L on a go-forward basis, and we'll continue to expand upon that going forward. But pretty much, most of what it would take to get to the $10 million run rate is in place. 
On the second point, as far as -- yes, we're #1 in the area of specialty lenses, torics and multifocal lenses. You've seen that we put up some pretty good numbers in our -- clearly, in that venue with our torics business being up 14%. And keep in mind, torics is the lion's share. When you think about the market, it's about 27%, 28% specialty lenses, and for us, it's much higher than that, 42%. And we're sustaining good growth with toric. Our product, Biofinity XR Toric, is pretty knowledge -- novel. A lot of competitors will not go there and address the, if you will, the fringes of the bell-shaped curve. They do the easier to set torics but not the custom. So we do have proprietary, if you will, advantage. In addition, obviously, our strategy in the 1-day market with clariti being the only one with a toric, a sphere and a multifocal, puts us at an advantage in the 1-day space, and particularly puts us at advantage being the only silicone hydrogel in the mass market of the 1-day space. So we think we have enough going for us. The market will continue to perform well worldwide, with a lot more maturity in the U.S. and a lot less outside the U.S. We will continue to have solid growth in specialty lenses in many of the locations regionally throughout the rest of the world beyond the U.S. So we're looking forward to a good market going forward, and we think we have a broad-enough portfolio to hold our own and continue to actually gain."

The -- we're very early in the game with Energys, just starting to pick up momentum in different places. We're very early in the game with Biofinity XR Toric. So look for those to help continue that momentum. And it will take us a very long time to roll them out around the world, meaning it's well beyond 2017, even 2018, when it comes to some of those venues. We're in fact still rolling out Biofinity, and it's first stage in some parts of the world as we look to some of the -- South America and Asian theaters as well. So a long way to go on that. Gross margins, we're not really leaving a lot of gross margin on the table in terms of -- the market is strong from a pricing point of view and a lot of the margins will continue to improve as we convert Avaira into Vitality and as we convert -- as we continue to expand in Energys, likewise to say, trade-up strategy.

There is obviously the disruption of are they going to be spun-off, sold or kept. And Novartis reiterated their assessment that they're still open, they still have not made up their mind on what to do about Alcon and how that compares to them being a pharma business, if you will. So we obviously like the uncertainty that, that presents. We also like the fact that, with few exceptions, Alcon is at the more mature end of the growth curve with some of their major products, both in the monthly as well as in the 1-day space. TOTAL1 has the target on its back within -- clearly, within the premium silicone hydrogel space. Everyone is shooting at them. And Cooper is shooting at them and MOIST in the mass market 1-day space. B&L put up some numbers. They highlight the growth products. They do not put it all together other than to say that their overall business grew 2% of lens care and lenses. So nothing to write home about there. They obviously are caught up in the cloud of what is that Valeant going to do to basically pay down some of its $30 billion of debt. And obviously, in the marketplace, we think that their products are basically behind the curve, both as to the fact that they do not have a 1-day silicone hydrogel in that market, and they still do not have, and they've been at it for I don't know for how many years now, a complete portfolio with ultra, meaning a toric and a multifocal. So very slow to roll out in that venue. And quite frankly, most of what they've done their spend, trading from PureVision into ultra anyway. J&J just completed the acquisition of AMO. And obviously, they'll be going through an integration within the Vistakon for eye care piece. They did mention on their call and they put up very robust numbers, but they did indicate that, I think, 3% of their growth was pipeline sale on shelf that had to do with the price increase they had effective early January, and so they were selling into a pretty broad-based price increase that pulled forward some of their purchases. And that's what they were referring to. I would not take that across the rest of the industry. I think that was mainly unique to their strategy and their view that you can -- there was room to increase pricing in the marketplace."

The small felt of share gains for CVIs in EMEA, well it looks like it's almost in line with the market for the trailing 12 months versus sort of multiple market for CVI in Americas and APAC? So Bob, can you just talk to the competitive dynamics in Europe versus Americas and APAC, and why they're more muted? Why is it a more muted European share gains? Is that just a function of clariti being in Europe? First. And then the second one, Al, maybe this is more for you. I know you guys are getting the gross margin benefit from Avaira to Vitality in terms of when someone makes that switch. But are you guys seeing that in fiscal '17?

So we have the highest market share of our 3 geographic locations in Europe, as contrast that to Asia Pac where we have the lowest market share of our 3 regions, yet we have a very full product portfolio. So we would expect, prospectively, to continue to grow faster in Asia Pac than we would in EMEA. Having said that, we still think we have a lot of legs in terms of growth within EMEA in terms of gaining market share in that market.

But you already talked about J&J, but I just wanted to delve on this a little bit more. It sounds when doing channel checks, the foot traffic in ECP offices were up pretty high in December and January. You obviously had the pull forward of J&J orders before they had some price increases. You delivered 9% in constant currency growth, but you also had an easier comp. So how do I think about the foot traffic in ECP offices, potential forward orders of J&J versus easier comps than what you all delivered, and should we expect the second quarter for some of that to be a little bit easier for you? On the margin side, for gross margins, I just was thinking about you delivered 63.1% in CVI, which is up 220 bps year-over-year. And I just want to understand how to think about the $0.30 of idle equipment still weighing on that segment because you exited 2016 at 64.8%, which is a pretty nice uptick.

And the easier comps, as much as anything, had to do with some of the disruption we had a year ago, and that rolled into prior year comps from Asia Pac where we -- I'm sorry, from Europe where we had done the integration of distribution centers in the fourth quarter of 2015, and that rolled into 2016, creating some adjustments, if you will, and some performance issues with European customers. So some of it there. I think, we've put up good numbers in the first quarter, so most of that is a reflection of our performance in the market in total, with the market growing 6%, us growing 9%. So the market was a little bit more robust. We're assuming that, that momentum continues as far as the product rollouts, be it Energys, be it Vitality conversion. And I think, the Vitality conversion is more, as Al pointed out, somewhat disruptive as you go through the conversion process from a gross margin point of view. And from an energy perspective, we're spending more time converting than we are looking for new business right now with the Vitality product. So we've got some work to do there that will give us some momentum. We also -- I commented on the investment we're making in the sales force. So my belief is feet on the street are going to translate into a better shot at good top line growth, and I think we have that going for us also. And that momentum builds. We now have some of the people that we hired in the fourth quarter last year that will start becoming productive as we move throughout the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and things of that nature."

So when we look at that, it's not necessarily going to be linear, but that $0.30 should be declining as we move through this year. And moving to next year, we'll probably still have some. You have idle equipment associated mostly with daily as well. The strength that we're seeing in daily, obviously, is good news as we're turning lines on. And then some of the heightened inventory activity associated with things like Avaira and so forth, so that should also decline if that transition happens. So net-net, all that kind of being good news should indicate that CooperVision's gross margins are going to strengthen as we move through the year."

You can look at the fact that the market for 2-week and monthly is flat, and we put up 7% growth to the quarter. And the market, ex dailies, for the trailing 12 months is down 1% and we put up 6% growth, which, obviously, the lion's share of that is driven by our monthly performance with Biofinity. So Biofinity is stellar, as I mentioned earlier, on a question that both Avaira and Biofinity are growing ballpark about the same in constant currency, so both in around that 15% mark. So there is nothing -- and that's quite an accomplishment for Vitality when the energy is really going into that to swap out more than it is a trade up at this juncture.

I think we had this discussion last quarter when we talked about there was a little skewing between market data and publicly reported data. And I think, this is kind of -- it's part of the -- the flip side of that where all of a sudden, you had strong public reported numbers, and I believe the same thing is true that the skewing that we talked about that occurred before was the fact that there was a huge pipeline sell of when OASYS 1-day hit the market in the third quarter and the fourth calendar quarter in 2015. And now, you're seeing the flip side of that. That pipeline sell would then minimize in the publicly reported number by the difference between growth to net, particularly at J&J, and that's speculative, but I do think are reasonable. So now, you have the flip side where there's less rebating and gross to net differential that is involved. And all of a sudden, the public reported numbers are coming out stronger than was the case a year ago. So that gross to net more impacted more the fourth quarter of public reported data a year ago, and this year, a lot less.

Surgical obviously is putting together a kind of a whole new business model with a lot of energy on the sales and marketing effort of this new combining. So you have an integration going on, which also have some products being sold with the sales force for the first time. It used to be some of those companies we bought were word-of-mouth in a cottage industry of IVF. So we're investing in both sides of the equation, if you will, both segments. Relative to the type of marketing dollars, Cooper's spending its marketing dollars broad-based. We have some new novel products to talk about like Energys, so there is some more unique marketing tools that are going on there. We continue to be very active in terms of our alignment with the eye care professional in terms of making them more efficient. So whether it's a lens area or whatever it is called, a number of programs that help the eye care professional become more and more proactive in terms of dealing with their customer -- their individual customer. So we're out to make them better business people. And we invest money in that domain. In Surgical on the other hand, as I mentioned, there, it's transitioning from what may have been a word-of-mouth industry in PGS and PGD, which is preemptive implementation diagnostics and screening, to really talking about it and doing the push/pull, not only with the IVF centers but also with the OB/GYN. So there's stories to be told. Once again, trying to enhance the industry called IVF, if you will. MyDay, the MyDay growth versus the clariti growth, basically, MyDay off of a smaller -- much smaller base is growing faster as a percent but off a smaller base. It is in the process of rolling out the toric and they were at -- we're in the first inning of that rollout with a lot of innings to go yet. Even with MyDay, we're probably only in the second or third inning, so a lot further to go. clariti is probably more in the fourth inning than the first or second innings, but it likewise has a lot of countries to access. And quite frankly, now that we've gone through the transition of the enhanced edge, we will be more and more aggressive in terms of going after not converting one clariti to another but going after new fits on our competitive products, so the mass market. So look for the combination of our sales force, feet on the street, the marketing programs and having a good -- plenty of capacity to put behind the product to make us more aggressive in the mass market space."

Fertility posted growth of 52% or 5% pro forma. 
Moving to the details. CooperVision posted second quarter revenues of $408 million, up 7% in constant currency. By geography, the Americas grew 4%, EMEA grew 10% and Asia Pacific grew 9%, all in constant currency. CooperVision's growth continues to be driven by a diverse portfolio of clariti and MyDay in the dailies space, Biofinity in the monthly space and Avaira in the 2-week space. Regarding daily lenses, our broad offering of silicone hydrogel lenses continues to drive growth. The daily market is critical to our strategy of gaining share, and we remain focused on driving success in this space. Our clariti portfolio spheres, torics and multifocals leads the way as the mass market offering, and we continue to see very nice growth on all 3 regions. Our MyDay spheres and torics are also doing very well in the premium space as we continue to roll out MyDay toric in Japan and various parts of Europe. Biofinity, we continued seeing success around the world, with strong growth in all regions. We also continued making progress rolling out our expanded offerings, which include Biofinity Energys and Biofinity Toric XR. These products are available in a number of different markets, and we'll continue rolling them out over time. Within the 2-week space, we successfully transitioned wearers to Avaira Vitality from our legacy Avaira product. This is for both spheres and torics. Vitality is a nice upgrade and our customers are receiving this change well. We expect this transition to occur through the remainder of the year and into next. 
Turning to product categories. Torics grew a solid 12% and multifocals grew 4%, both in constant currency. We are the global leader in these areas of lenses, with a highly diversified product offering, including both silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel lenses within the daily, 2-week and monthly modalities. Looking at just silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 18% in constant currency and now represents 66% of total CooperVision sales. These products are the drivers of our growth, and we believe they are -- they have a bright and long future. Our product portfolio is [indiscernible] in the space, and I believe, offers the best options. This includes being the only offering premium in mass market dailies silicone hydrogel lenses, including spheres, torics and multifocal lenses. 
Turning to the overall contact lens market. In calendar Q1, we took share growing 2x the market or 10% against the market growth of 5%. Breaking it down geographically: we grew 8% in the Americas, while the market grew 3%; we grew 10% in the EMEA, while the market grew 7%; and we grew 16% in Asia Pacific, with the market up 7%. On a modality basis, single-use lenses continue driving growth, with CooperVision up 17% and the market up 13%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 7%, with the market down 1%. For the trailing 12-month period, CooperVision grew 9%, while the market grew 4%, so another strong year where we more than doubled the market. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth driven by the continuing shift to improve technologies, such as: a wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses; the continuing trade up of dailies and specialty lenses, such as torics and multifocals; geographic expansion; and the expansion of the wear base, particularly outside the United States. And given our strength in these areas, along with the broad private label offering, we continue to grow faster than the market. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported second quarter revenues of $114 million, up 23%, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 3%, with the fertility leading the way, up 52% or 5% pro forma. Within fertility, we experienced some disruption this quarter from aggressively consolidating distributors associated with past acquisitions. Having said that, we started seeing some upside from recent sales and marketing activity, so getting this activity transferred in-house is the right move. Overall, within IVF, we're continuing to execute on our growth strategy as a global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space. Our fertility growth is driven by a diversified portfolio of medical device products, capital equipment and lab services, and we believe our portfolio is the broadest in the space. Our office and surgical products business grew 1% for the quarter. Similar to our IVF business, we expect growth in Q3 and Q4 to improve based on momentum with new product rollouts, led by EndoSee, our disposable [indiscernible] and new business that we've recently won. Finally, on CooperSurgical, we're making a lot of progress integrating acquisitions, including having completed a significant portion of our distributor consolidations. We probably have roughly another 12 months integration activity in other parts of the business if things are moving along well. Given this progress, we expect improved top line growth for CooperSurgical beginning in the third quarter. Overall, I remain very excited about the future of CooperSurgical, and we believe we're on the right path. 
With that, I want to express our appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. They truly drive the success of our business. 
And now I'll turn it over to Al."

Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.

Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. 
Bob covered revenues, so let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance. For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were very strong at 66%, up from 63.2% last year. CooperVision's gross margins were 67.1%, up from 62.8% last year, driven by the weakening of the pound due to Brexit last summer, product mix shift gains led by Biofinity and manufacturing efficiency improvements. Regarding the pound, remember our inventory turns every 6 months, so this was the first quarter we experienced the full quarter impact of Brexit. On product mix, the message remains the same. The shift to silicone hydrogel lenses, especially Biofinity and now, Avaira Vitality, is having a positive impact on our overall gross margins. Lastly, on manufacturing efficiencies, we've been seeing improvements within our manufacturing environment for some time and this quarter really illustrated that. We discussed this activity in prior quarters, including the negative impact from items, such as inefficiencies with idle equipment and inventory write-offs, which have been negatively impacting us roughly $0.10 per quarter above normal. This quarter showed a marked improvement, with a negative impact of roughly $0.05, so this is a discussion topic we can now put behind us as we move back to normal operations. 
CooperSurgical's gross margins were 61.7%, down from 64.8% last year, due to our genetic testing acquisitions, which carry lower gross margins. Having said that, we now annualize those acquisitions and we've been integrating them within our business, so we expect stable to improving gross margins on a year-over-year basis moving forward. 
Consolidated operating expenses grew 8.8% in the quarter, slightly above our reported revenue growth of 8%. This was driven by investments, such as additional sales personnel, along with expenses layered in from acquisitions. There's not much to highlight here, but it's important to remind everyone, we're continuing to invest in infrastructure in both of our businesses to support continued long-term growth. We've made nice progress on the sales and marketing side along with some key hires and other support areas, so we're in fairly good shape, but we'll continue to invest as we see opportunities. 
Operating income growth was very strong, up 18.9%, driven by our gross margin improvements. Operating margins were 26.8%, up from 24.3% last year. 
Moving to items below operating income. We reported $7.7 million of interest expense and our effective tax rate was 6.6%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.50, with roughly 49.5 million average shares outstanding. 
Regarding shares outstanding, we repurchased 150,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of roughly $190 -- $197 per share, which totaled $29.5 million. We believe share buybacks are an effective way to maximize long-term shareholder value, and we'll continue executing on them in an opportunistic manner. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total debt decreased $38 million in the quarter to approximately $1.39 billion. This paydown was primarily driven by operational cash flow generation, offset by share buybacks. 
Moving to free cash flow. We had a strong quarter, posting $103 million of free cash comprised of roughly $132 million of operating cash flow, offset by $29 million of CapEx. 
Regarding guidance. We are raising fiscal 2017 consolidated revenue to $2.11 billion to $2.135 billion. This includes raising and tightening CooperVision's revenue guidance to $1.645 billion to $1.665 billion or roughly 7% to 8% constant currency growth, while lowering and tightening CooperSurgical's revenue to $465 million to $470 million, which equates to roughly 4.5% to 5% pro forma growth. 
For CooperVision, we expect growth to be driven by a diverse portfolio of products, led by Biofinity, Avaira, clariti and MyDay. 
Regarding CooperSurgical, a significant portion of the integration activity, which negatively impacted revenues, is behind us, and we expect improved growth in the second half of the year. 
Operating margins are now expected to be around 25.5% for the year, supported by slightly stronger gross margins. Interest expense is to be slightly higher at around $31 million, which assumes an additional 25 basis point rate hike this month, and the full year effective tax rate is forecasted to be around 8%. This rate is lower than prior guidance, primarily due to the new accounting for employee stock-based composition, which we adopted in Q1. Although we forecast the positive impact to be much less than Q3 and Q4 due to the vesting schedules for the majority of our equity grants, the impact in the first half of the year is driving our full year tax rate lower by roughly 150 basis points. 
Regarding FX. We have seen an overall favorable move in currency since we last reported earnings. We're now forecasting a roughly neutral impact to EPS for this year versus last quarter's full year forecast of a negative $0.16. 
Regarding revenues. We're forecasting a negative impact of roughly $46 million for the full year, down from last quarter's full year forecasted impact of a negative $61 million. 
Incorporating all this information, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 to $9.50 to $9.65, assuming 49.4 million shares outstanding. 
One final comment for modeling purposes. We expect Q3 EPS to be slightly lower than Q4 due to lower sequential gross margins in CooperVision. This Q3 reduction is fairly common for CVI as inventory turns every 6 months and production levels in December and January decline due to our annual manufacturing set [indiscernible] to upgrade and retool our plans, which results in a slightly higher average cost per unit due to lower overhead absorption. This should be somewhat offset by our Q3 effective tax rate, which is normally lower than in Q4. 
Lastly, we continue focusing on delivering consistent annual performance. We're forecasting over $400 million in free cash flow this year and north of $2 billion of cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years, while targeting consistent improvements in operating margins to reach 28% or higher in 2021. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

The point on the market at 5%, that's perhaps a little bit more normalized than we've had, although the last couple of years, it's been a little uneven, started way back in September of 2015 when J&J kind of went off UPP and a lot of things with their product line that led to some pipelines, so as they rolled out a new OASYS 1 Day modality. So ever since then, it's been a little uneven, by on a trailing 12-month basis, 4%, a solid 4% and clearly, the most recent quarter, at 5% with solid results in Asia and in Europe. As far as clariti, you're right. There's been some pricing changes that have occurred in the industry, and not only has there been pricing changes, but there's been the, for the most part, a post-UPP era, ex Energys, are 1 new product and novel product, and what you're seeing in the industry, not only in Cooper, is we're really working hard to get new fits. Everyone's doing it. We believe clariti is well-positioned by way of rebates to convince more and more people to go to the Energys, changing from one product to the other. We're clearly winning the battle with clariti on trading up some hydrogels to silicone hydrogels. We're winning the battle of new fits very well. We need to work a little harder on converting others in the mass market. And some of our competitors have created an environment that makes that opportunity more right bright now, and we're seizing the moment. Obviously, clariti has done very nicely, and MyDay has done very nicely, up 43% for the quarter. So we're putting up good numbers, but we want to do better, yes."

So it definitely made a nice step and the right direction here and that positive move kind of impact even the Q2 gross margins. If you look at it, it's, to some degree, kind of half and half there. It's a little bit more than half. It's driven by the product mix and those efficiency improvements we're talking about. And then, a little bit less than half is coming from currency. When you look at the sustainability, it's there. I mean, there are some things that are moving around terms of our production, and so forth, and currency as it flows through, the pound moves and so forth but this was a pretty strong legitimate quarter and kind of shows what the business can do when it's sitting on most all cylinders."

We're going to have gross margins a little bit north of 64.5% this year. So on a consolidated basis, pretty strong. We certainly have margin upside in CooperSurgical now that we reset to lift that higher. On a full year basis, we're going to have margin upside on CooperVision also, all else being equal. That'll be driven by kind of the same thing, excluding currency, which will have some upside in currency as we move through this year. But assuming currency holds steady, the manufacturing efficiencies that we have in place, cost reduction programs, product mix shift, which is a positive with items like we talked about of Avaira, Avaira Vitality, the conversion from traditional daily hydrogels to clariti, all of those are kind of positive. So I won't put any specific numbers out there, but we do have margin upside here in the coming years from both businesses. When you look at revenues, I think you're speaking mainly of CooperVision. Yes, and we're kind of running in that 8% constant currency in the first half of the year guide in the 7 to 8. Obviously, took the bottom of that away and pulled the bottom end up to 7 to 8. We do have a challenging comp in Q4, you'll remember from last year. So I think we feel good about revenues. We're obviously put up a very strong Q1. We put up a strong Q2 against the tough comp. We feel good about the back half of the year, but it's prudent to remain in that 7% to 8% range and not get more aggressive."

The supply constraint, as far as Biofinity, which is growing solidly, the combination of Biofinity and Avaira is up 12%, with Biofinity being at the higher end and Avaira, as it goes through the conversion, at the lower end of those numbers or of that number. Energys is still early in the rollout around the world, so it just -- it's made its entry in the U.S. initially and it's gone into Europe now, but has a ways to go in that conversion and rollout. It's not so much maybe production capability as it is the mechanics of rolling out a product around the world. As far as Biofinity Toric XR, that is kind of made-to-order. We do not stock that product. So while we have a reasonable capacity to support the orders that come in, it's -- both of those products are performing extremely well in the U.S., and we believe that's a good indicator of how that will translate around the world as we go deeper. As far as the conversion of Avaira to Vitality, it's gone well, I would say. In the U.S., more than half the revenue now is coming in from Vitality, so it's made some good progress. And -- but still have the other half to go, and that's the Sphere. The Sphere part is the easy part. Torics are a lot more complicated. So look for both of those to roll out, as I indicated, throughout this year and into next year, and we'll be pretty much done as we get through next year with the conversion. As far as market share numbers, the J&J number included what they reported, some of lens care that they picked up in the acquisition that they made from Abbott. So factoring in, their number was a little less than the aggregate that they reported. But the share gainers, with the market growing 5% and Cooper growing 2x the market, pretty much assume that Alcon's not gaining share and there's not a day that goes by that they don't talk about it at Novartis in terms of their frustration with Alcon overall. And so it's still a company that is recently as I think was this morning, the CEO indicated they're evaluating what they're going to do with Alcon in the middle of that. J&J is holding its own, clearly, with its numbers. And then, B&L continues to [indiscernible]. So pretty much, we're closing the gap on number 2, which is Alcon, but have a little ways to go.

Toned down a little maybe the last quarter, but still close to double-digit. We put up lesser numbers, as you indicated, 6%. I think the important thing to remember with us is we had some pretty tough comps, if you're looking at the numbers we had a year ago, it was like 13%. So a solid prior year comp that we were hurdling, if you will, in this last quarter. Overall, the market is now 8% of the world market, so it continues to grow faster than the spherical market, and almost -- and basically, off of a small base, it's growing faster than the toric market but still, the toric market is 3 quarters of specialty market. So toric market is about 22% of the share of the contact lens market, multifocals about 8%, all up 30% in specialty lenses where we're #1. And we think we have the right product portfolio."

CooperVision's gross margins, they are sustainable subject to our normal variability, if you will, by quarter. So as I mentioned in Q3, we had the planned shutdowns, which drives up our cost per unit back in the kind of December, January. You see that in the third quarter. So wouldn't surprise me to see CooperVision's gross margins as an example come back toward 65 in Q3. Q4, again, should be a pretty good quarter. The pound's moved back a little bit back up towards 130, that starts to flow through our P&L. So we're probably 66 or something like that in Q4. Wouldn't surprise me. But the core basis there of sustainability through the mix shift and the manufacturing efficiencies is indeed there. There was nothing to highlight out of this quarter, saying, hey, this was unique or one-time. That was not the case. This is a very strong gross margin quarter. If we look at CooperSurgical, the trough is here and -- or was here, I should say, in Q2. So we accelerated some integration activity there. We pulled force and distributor consolidations and so forth into this quarter, got more aggressive on that based on some of the stuff we're seeing out there, some positive momentum that we're seeing. So I think what you'll get now is, yes, we took a hit in Q2 for CooperSurgical, that's okay. It was done for integration-related reasons and for long-term strategy. You'll see the gross margin come back in Q3. You'll see the sales, the pro forma revenue growth come back in Q3, and that'll continue going forward now. So that was more one-time in nature, if you will, accelerated integration activity."

Welcome to the second quarter 2017 conference call. This was a strong quarter, and we continue to feel confident about the remainder of this year and into the future for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical having a lot of momentum.
On a consolidated basis, we reported $522 million in revenue on a non-GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.50. CooperVision posted another strong quarter in all key areas with 4% as reported or 7% constant currency revenue growth. Dailies silicone hydrogel lenses grew 43% while Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 12% both in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 23% or 3% pro forma. Fertility posted growth of 52% or 5% pro forma.
Moving to the details. CooperVision posted second quarter revenues of $408 million, up 7% in constant currency. By geography, the Americas grew 4%; EMEA grew 10%; and Asia Pacific grew 9%, all in constant currency. 
CooperVision's growth continues to be driven by a diverse portfolio of clariti and MyDay in the dailies space, Biofinity in the monthly space and Avaira in the 2-week space. 
Regarding daily lenses, our broad offering of silicone hydrogel lenses continues to drive growth. The daily market is critical to our strategy of gaining share, and we remain focused on driving success in this space. Our clariti portfolio of spheres, torics and multifocals leads the way as the mass market offering, and we continue to see very nice growth in all 3 regions. Our MyDay spheres and torics are also doing very well in the premium space as we continue to roll out MyDay Toric in Japan and various parts of Europe. 
Biofinity. We continued seeing success around the world with strong growth in all regions. We also continued making progress rolling out our expanded offerings, which include Biofinity Energys and Biofinity Toric XR. These products are available in a number of different markets, and we'll continue rolling them out over time. 
Within the 2-week space, we successfully transitioned wearers to Avaira Vitality from our legacy Avaira product. This is for both spheres and torics. Vitality is a nice upgrade, and our customers are receiving this change well. We expect this transition to occur through the remainder of the year and into next.
Turning to product categories. Torics grew a solid 12%, and multifocals grew 4%, both in constant currency. We are the global leader in these areas of lenses with a highly diversified product offering, including both silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel lenses within the daily, 2-week and monthly modalities. 
Looking at just silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 18% in constant currency and now represents 66% of the total CooperVision sales. These products are the drivers of our growth, and we believe they are bright -- they have a bright and long future. Our product portfolio is the broadest in the space and, I believe, offers the best options. This includes being the only offering premium in mass market dailies silicone hydrogel lenses, including spheres, torics and multifocal lenses.
Turning to the overall contact lens market. In calendar Q1, we took share, growing 2x the market or 10% against the market growth of 5%. Breaking it down geographically, we grew 8% in the Americas while the market grew 3%; we grew 10% in the EMEA while the market grew 7%; and we grew 16% in Asia Pacific, with the market up 7%.
On a modality basis, single-use lenses continue driving growth, with CooperVision up 17% and the market up 13%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 7% with the market down 1%. 
For the trailing 12-month period, CooperVision grew 9% while the market grew 4%. So another strong year where we more than doubled the market. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth, driven by the continuing shift to improve technologies such as a wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses; the continuing trade-up of dailies and specialty lenses, such as torics and multifocals; geographic expansion; and the expansion of the wearer base, particularly outside the United States. And given our strengths in these areas, along with the broad private-label offering, we continue to grow faster than the market.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported second quarter revenues of $114 million, up 23%, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 3%, with fertility leading the way, up 52% or 5% pro forma. Within fertility, we experienced some disruption this quarter from aggressively consolidating distributors associated with past acquisitions. Having said that, we started seeing some upside from recent sales and marketing activity. So getting this activity transferred in-house is the right move. 
Overall, within IVF, we're continuing to execute on our growth strategy as a global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space. Our fertility growth is driven by a diversified portfolio of medical device products, capital equipment and lab services, and we believe our portfolio is the broadest in the space. 
Our office and surgical products business grew 1% for the quarter. Similar to our IVF business, we expect growth in Q3 and Q4 to improve based on momentum with new product rollouts led by EndoSee, our disposable hysteroscope, and new business that we've recently won. 
Finally, on CooperSurgical, we're making a lot of progress integrating acquisitions, including having completed a significant portion of our distributor consolidations. We broadly -- we probably have roughly another 12 months of integration activity in other parts of the business if things are moving along well. Given this progress, we expect improved top line growth for CooperSurgical beginning in the third quarter. Overall, I remain very excited about the future of CooperSurgical, and we believe we're on the right path.
With that, I want to express our appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. They truly drive the success of our business.
And now I'll turn it over to Al."

Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis. So please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.Bob covered revenues.

So please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.
Bob covered revenues. So let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance. For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were very strong at 66%, up from 63.2% last year. CooperVision's gross margins were 67.1%, up from 62.8% last year, driven by the weakening of the pound due to Brexit last summer, product mix shift gains led by Biofinity and manufacturing efficiency improvements. 
Regarding the pound, remember, our inventory turns every 6 months. So this was the first quarter we experienced the full quarter impact of Brexit. On product mix, the message remains the same. The shift to silicone hydrogel lenses, especially Biofinity and now Avaira Vitality, is having a positive impact on our overall gross margins. Lastly, on manufacturing efficiencies, we've been seeing improvements within our manufacturing environment for some time, and this quarter really illustrated that. We've discussed this activity in prior quarters, including the negative impact from items such as inefficiencies with idle equipment and inventory write-offs, which have been negatively impacting us roughly $0.10 per quarter above normal. This quarter showed a marked improvement with a negative impact of roughly $0.05. So this is a discussion topic we can now put behind us as we move back to normal operations.
CooperSurgical's gross margins were 61.7%, down from 64.8% last year due to our genetic testing acquisitions, which carry lower gross margins. Having said that, we've now annualized those acquisitions, and we've been integrating them within our business. So we expect stable to improving gross margins on a year-over-year basis moving forward.
Consolidated operating expenses grew 8.8% in the quarter, slightly above our reported revenue growth of 8%. This was driven by investments such as additional sales personnel, along with expenses layered in from acquisitions. There's not much to highlight here, but it's important to remind everyone, we're continuing to invest in infrastructure in both of our businesses to support continued long-term growth. We've made nice progress on the sales and marketing side, along with some key hires and other support areas. So we're in fairly good shape, but we'll continue to invest as we see opportunities. Operating income growth was very strong, up 18.9%, driven by our gross margin improvements. Operating margins were 26.8%, up from 24.3% last year.
Moving to items below operating income. We reported $7.7 million of interest expense, and our effective tax rate was 6.6%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.50 with roughly 49.5 million average shares outstanding. 
Regarding shares outstanding, we repurchased 150,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of roughly $190 -- $197 per share, which totaled $29.5 million. We believe share buybacks are an effective way to maximize long-term shareholder value, and we'll continue executing on them in an opportunistic manner.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total debt decreased $38 million in the quarter to approximately $1.39 billion. This paydown was primarily driven by operational cash flow generation, offset by share buybacks. 
Moving to free cash flow. We had a strong quarter, posting $103 million of free cash comprised of roughly $132 million of operating cash flow, offset by $29 million of CapEx.
Regarding guidance. We are raising fiscal 2017 consolidated revenue to $2.11 billion to $2.135 billion. This includes raising and tightening CooperVision's revenue guidance to $1.645 billion to $1.665 billion or roughly 7% to 8% constant currency growth while lowering and tightening CooperSurgical's revenue to $465 million to $470 million, which equates to roughly 4.5% to 5% pro forma growth.
For CooperVision, we expect growth to be driven by our diverse portfolio of products led by Biofinity, Avaira, clariti and MyDay. Regarding CooperSurgical, a significant portion of the integration activity, which negatively impacted revenues, is behind us, and we expect improved growth in the second half of the year.
Operating margins are now expected to be around 25.5% for the year, supported by slightly stronger gross margins. Interest expense is to be slightly higher at around $31 million, which assumes an additional 25 basis point rate hike this month, and the full year effective tax rate is forecasted to be around 8%. This rate is lower than prior guidance primarily due to the new accounting for employee stock-based compensation, which we adopted in Q1. Although we forecast the positive impact to be much less in Q3 and Q4 due to the vesting schedules for the majority of our equity grants, the impact in the first half of the year is driving our full year tax rate lower by roughly 150 basis points.
Regarding FX. We have seen an overall favorable move in currency since we last reported earnings. We're now forecasting a roughly neutral impact to EPS for this year versus last quarter's full year forecast of a negative $0.16.
Regarding revenues. We're forecasting a negative impact of roughly $46 million for the full year, down from last quarter's full year forecasted impact of a negative $61 million. Incorporating all this information, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 to $9.50 to $9.65, assuming 49.4 million shares outstanding. 
One final comment for modeling purposes. We expect Q3 EPS to be slightly lower than Q4 due to lower sequential gross margins at CooperVision. This Q3 reduction is fairly common for CVI as inventory turns every 6 months and production levels in December and January declined due to our annual manufacturing shutdowns to upgrade and retool our plants, which results in a slightly higher average cost per unit due to lower overhead absorption. This should be somewhat offset by our Q3 effective tax rate, which is normally lower than in Q4.
Lastly, we continue focusing on delivering consistent annual performance. We're forecasting over $400 million in free cash flow this year and north of $2 billion of cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years while targeting consistent improvements in operating margins to reach 28% or higher in 2021.
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

The point on the market at 5%, that's perhaps a little bit more normalized than we've had over the last couple of years. It's been a little uneven. It started way back in September of 2015 when J&J kind of went off UPP and did a lot of things with their product line that led to some pipelines so as they rolled out the new OASYS 1 Day modality. So ever since then, it's been a little uneven. But on a trailing 12-month basis, 4%, a solid 4%, and clearly, the most recent quarter, at 5% with solid results in Asia and in Europe. As far as clariti, you're right. There's been some pricing changes that have occurred in the industry. And not only has there been pricing changes, but there has been the -- for the most part, a post-UPP era, ex Energys, our one new product and novel product. And what you're seeing in the industry, not only in Cooper, is we're really working hard to get new fits. Everyone's doing it. We believe clariti is well positioned, by way of rebates, to convince more and more people to go to the Energys changing from one product to the other. We're clearly winning the battle with clariti on trading up some hydrogels -- silicone hydrogels. We're winning the battle of new fits very well. We need to work a little harder on converting others in the mass market. And some of our competitors have created an environment that makes that opportunity more ripe right now, and we're seizing the moment. Obviously, clariti has done very nicely, and MyDay has done very nicely, up 43% for the quarter. So we're putting up good numbers, but we want to do better yet."

And that positive move kind of impacted even the Q2 gross margins. If you look at it, it's, to some degree, kind of half and half there. It's a little bit more than half. It's driven by the product mix and those efficiency improvements we're talking about. And then a little bit less than half is coming from currency. When you look at the sustainability, it's there. I mean, there are some things that are moving around in terms of our production and so forth. And currency as it flows through, the pound moves and so forth.

On the margin upside question, we're going to have gross margins a little bit north of 64.5% this year. So on a consolidated basis, it's pretty strong. We're -- we certainly have margin upside in CooperSurgical now that we're reset to lift that higher. On a full year basis, we're going to have margin upside in CooperVision also, all else being equal. That will be driven by kind of the same thing, excluding currency, which we'll have some upside in currency as we move through this year. But assuming currency holds steady, the manufacturing efficiencies that we have in place, cost reduction programs, product mix shift, which is a positive, with items like we've talked about, Avaira to Avaira Vitality, the conversion from traditional daily hydrogels to clariti. All of those are kind of positive. So I won't put any specific numbers out there, but we do have margin upside here in the coming years from both businesses. When you look at revenues, speaking -- I think you're speaking mainly of CooperVision. Yes. And we're kind of running in that 8% constant currency in the first half of the year guiding to 7% to 8%, obviously took the bottom of that away and pulled the bottom end up to 7% to 8%. We do have a challenging comp in Q4, you'll remember, from last year. So I think we feel good about revenues. We obviously put up a very strong Q1. We put up a strong Q2 against the tough comp. We feel good about the back half of the year, but it's prudent to remain in that 7% to 8% range and not get more aggressive."

The supply constraint as far as Biofinity, which is growing solidly -- the combination of Biofinity and Avaira is up 12%, with Biofinity being at the higher end and Avaira, as it goes through the conversion, at the lower end of those numbers -- or of that number. Energys is still early in the rollout around the world. So it just -- it's made its entrée into the U.S. initially, and it's gone into Europe now but has a ways to go in that conversion and rollout. It's not so much maybe production capability as it is the mechanics of rolling out a product around the world. As far as Biofinity Toric XR, that is kind of a made to order. We do not stock that product. So while we have reasonable capacity to support the orders that come in, it's -- both of those products are performing extremely well in the U.S. And we believe that's a good indicator of how that will translate around the world as we go deeper. As far as the conversion of Avaira to Vitality, it's gone well, I would say. In the U.S., more than half the revenue now is coming in from Vitality. So it's made some good progress and -- but still have the other half to go. And that's the sphere. The sphere part is the easy part. Torics are a lot more complicated. So look for both of those to roll out, as I indicated, throughout this year and into next year. And we'll be pretty much done as we get through next year with the conversion. As far as market share numbers, the J&J number included what they reported some of lens care that they picked up in the acquisition that they made of -- from Abbott. So factoring in, their number was a little less than the aggregate that they reported. But the share gainers -- with the market growing 5% and Cooper growing 2x the market, pretty much assume that Alcon is not gaining share and there's not a day that goes by that they don't talk about it at Novartis in terms of their frustration with Alcon overall. And so it's still a company that is as recently as I think was this morning, the CEO indicated they're evaluating what they're going to do with Alcon in the middle of that. J&J is holding its own clearly with its numbers. And then B&L continues to lose. So pretty much, we're closing the gap on #2, which is Alcon. We still have a little ways to go, but we would hope over the next couple of years, we will catch up with them and then pass them."

So it continues to grow faster than the spherical market and almost -- and basically, off of a small base, it's growing faster than the toric market. But still, the toric market is 3/4 of the specialty market. So toric market is about 22% of the share of the contact lens market; multifocals, about 8%; all up 30% in specialty lenses where we're #1. And we think we have the right product portfolio."

So it's geographic specific, and we are monitoring it. And we're at the point now where a lot of these reps start becoming quite productive. But feet on the street and coverage where we were not covering a lot of accounts, obviously, the feet on the street gives us the horsepower to get into more and more locations where our competitors show up and we don't. And there's quite a few of those. So we're not done yet. I would say, we will continue to grow our sales and marketing faster than the revenue at least for the balance of this year, and we'll see about next year."

CooperVision's gross margins, they are sustainable subject to our normal variability, if you will, by quarter. So as I mentioned in Q3, we had the plant shutdowns, which drives up our cost per unit back in the kind of December, January. You see that in the third quarter. So it wouldn't surprise me to see CooperVision's gross margins, as an example, come back towards 65% in Q3. Q4, again, should be a pretty good quarter. The pound has moved back a little bit back up towards $1.30 that starts to flow through our P&L. So we're probably 66% or something like that in Q4. It wouldn't surprise me. But the core basis there of sustainability through the mix shift and manufacturing efficiencies is indeed there. There was nothing to highlight out of this quarter saying, ""Hey, this was unique or onetime."" That was not the case. This is a very strong gross margin quarter. If we look at CooperSurgical, the trough is here in -- or was here, I should say, in Q2. So we accelerated some integration activity there. We pulled force on distributor consolidations and so forth into this quarter, got more aggressive on that based on some of the stuff we're seeing out there, some positive momentum that we're seeing. So I think what you'll get now is yes, we took a hit in Q2 for CooperSurgical. That's okay. It was done for integration-related reasons and for long-term strategy. You'll see the gross margin come back in Q3. You'll see the sales, the pro forma revenue growth come back in Q3. And that will continue going forward now. So that was more onetime in nature, if you will, the accelerated integration activity."

Welcome to the second quarter 2017 conference call. This was a strong quarter, and we continue to feel confident about the remainder of this year and into the future for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical having a lot of momentum.
On a consolidated basis, we reported $522 million in revenue on a non-GAAP -- and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.50. CooperVision posted another strong quarter in all key areas with 4% as reported or 7% constant currency revenue growth. Dailies silicone hydrogel lenses grew 43% while Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 12% both in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 23% or 3% pro forma. Fertility posted growth of 52% or 5% pro forma.
Moving to the details. CooperVision posted second quarter revenues of $408 million, up 7% in constant currency. By geography, the Americas grew 4%; EMEA grew 10%; and Asia-Pacific grew 9%, all in constant currency. 
CooperVision's growth continues to be driven by a diverse portfolio of clariti and MyDay in the dailies space, Biofinity in the monthly space and Avaira in the 2-week space. 
Regarding daily lenses, our broad offering of silicone hydrogel lenses continues to drive growth. The daily market is critical to our strategy of gaining share, and we remain focused on driving success in this space. Our clariti portfolio of spheres, torics and multifocals leads the way as the mass market offering, and we continue to see very nice growth in all 3 regions. Our MyDay spheres and torics are also doing very well in the premium space as we continue to roll out MyDay toric in Japan and various parts of Europe. 
Biofinity. We continued seeing success around the world with strong growth in all regions. We also continued making progress rolling out our expanded offerings, which include Biofinity Energys and Biofinity Toric XR. These products are available in a number of different markets, and we'll continue rolling them out over time. 
Within the 2-week space, we successfully transitioned wearers to Avaira Vitality from our legacy Avaira product. This is for both spheres and torics. Vitality is a nice upgrade, and our customers are receiving this change well. We expect this transition to occur through the remainder of the year and into next.
Turning to product categories. Torics grew a solid 12%, and multifocals grew 4%, both in constant currency. We are the global leader in these areas of lenses with a highly diversified product offering, including both silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel lenses within the daily, 2-week and monthly modalities. 
Looking at just silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 18% in constant currency and now represents 66% of the total CooperVision sales. These products are the drivers of our growth, and we believe they are bright -- they have a bright and long future. Our product portfolio is the broadest in the space and, I believe, offers the best options. This includes being the only offering premium in mass market dailies silicone hydrogel lenses, including spheres, torics and multifocal lenses.
Turning to the overall contact lens market. In calendar Q1, we took share, growing 2x the market or 10% against the market growth of 5%. Breaking it down geographically, we grew 8% in the Americas while the market grew 3%; we grew 10% in the EMEA while the market grew 7%; and we grew 16% in Asia-Pacific, with the market up 7%.
On a modality basis, single-use lenses continue driving growth, with CooperVision up 17% and the market up 13%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 7% with the market down 1%. 
For the trailing 12-month period, CooperVision grew 9% while the market grew 4%. So another strong year where we more than doubled the market. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth, driven by the continuing shift to improve technologies such as a wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses; the continuing trade-up of dailies and specialty lenses, such as torics and multifocals; geographic expansion; and the expansion of the wearer base, particularly outside the United States. And given our strengths in these areas, along with the broad private-label offering, we continue to grow faster than the market.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported second quarter revenues of $114 million, up 23%, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 3%, with fertility leading the way, up 52% or 5% pro forma. Within fertility, we experienced some disruption this quarter from aggressively consolidating distributors associated with past acquisitions. Having said that, we started seeing some upside from recent sales and marketing activity. So getting this activity transferred in-house is the right move. 
Overall, within IVF, we're continuing to execute on our growth strategy as a global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space. Our fertility growth is driven by a diversified portfolio of medical device products, capital equipment and lab services, and we believe our portfolio is the broadest in the space. 
Our office and surgical products business grew 1% for the quarter. Similar to our IVF business, we expect growth in Q3 and Q4 to improve based on momentum with new product rollouts led by EndoSee, our disposable hysteroscope, and new business that we've recently won. 
Finally, on CooperSurgical, we're making a lot of progress integrating acquisitions, including having completed a significant portion of our distributor consolidations. We broadly -- we probably have roughly another 12 months of integration activity in other parts of the business, as things are moving along well. Given this progress, we expect improved top line growth for CooperSurgical beginning in the third quarter. Overall, I remain very excited about the future of CooperSurgical, and we believe we're on the right path.
With that, I want to express our appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. They truly drive the success of our business.
And now I'll turn it over to Al."

Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis. So please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.Bob covered revenues.

So please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.
Bob covered revenues. So let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance. For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were very strong at 66%, up from 63.2% last year. CooperVision's gross margins were 67.1%, up from 62.8% last year, driven by the weakening of the pound due to Brexit last summer, product mix shift gains led by Biofinity and manufacturing efficiency improvements. 
Regarding the pound, remember, our inventory turns every 6 months. So this was the first quarter we experienced the full quarter impact of Brexit. On product mix, the message remains the same. The shift to silicone hydrogel lenses, especially Biofinity and now Avaira Vitality, is having a positive impact on our overall gross margins. Lastly, on manufacturing efficiencies, we've been seeing improvements within our manufacturing environment for some time, and this quarter really illustrated that. We've discussed this activity in prior quarters, including the negative impact from items such as inefficiencies with idle equipment and inventory write-offs, which have been negatively impacting us roughly $0.10 per quarter above normal. This quarter showed a marked improvement with a negative impact of roughly $0.05. So this is a discussion topic we can now put behind us as we move back to normal operations.
CooperSurgical's gross margins were 61.7%, down from 64.8% last year due to our genetic testing acquisitions, which carry lower gross margins. Having said that, we've now annualized those acquisitions, and we've been integrating them within our business. So we expect stable to improving gross margins on a year-over-year basis moving forward.
Consolidated operating expenses grew 8.8% in the quarter, slightly above our reported revenue growth of 8%. This was driven by investments such as additional sales personnel, along with expenses layered in from acquisitions. There's not much to highlight here, but it's important to remind everyone, we're continuing to invest in infrastructure in both of our businesses to support continued long-term growth. We've made nice progress on the sales and marketing side, along with some key hires and other support areas. So we're in fairly good shape, but we'll continue to invest as we see opportunities. Operating income growth was very strong, up 18.9%, driven by our gross margin improvements. Operating margins were 26.8%, up from 24.3% last year.
Moving to items below operating income. We reported $7.7 million of interest expense, and our effective tax rate was 6.6%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.50 with roughly 49.5 million average shares outstanding. 
Regarding shares outstanding, we repurchased 150,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of roughly $190 -- $197 per share, which totaled $29.5 million. We believe share buybacks are an effective way to maximize long-term shareholder value, and we'll continue executing on them in an opportunistic manner.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total debt decreased $38 million in the quarter to approximately $1.39 billion. This paydown was primarily driven by operational cash flow generation, offset by share buybacks. 
Moving to free cash flow. We had a strong quarter, posting $103 million of free cash comprised of roughly $132 million of operating cash flow, offset by $29 million of CapEx.
Regarding guidance. We are raising fiscal 2017 consolidated revenue to $2.11 billion to $2.135 billion. This includes raising and tightening CooperVision's revenue guidance to $1.645 billion to $1.665 billion or roughly 7% to 8% constant currency growth while lowering and tightening CooperSurgical's revenue to $465 million to $470 million, which equates to roughly 4.5% to 5% pro forma growth.
For CooperVision, we expect growth to be driven by our diverse portfolio of products led by Biofinity, Avaira, clariti and MyDay. Regarding CooperSurgical, a significant portion of the integration activity, which negatively impacted revenues, is behind us, and we expect improved growth in the second half of the year.
Operating margins are now expected to be around 25.5% for the year, supported by slightly stronger gross margins. Interest expense is to be slightly higher at around $31 million, which assumes an additional 25 basis point rate hike this month, and the full year effective tax rate is forecasted to be around 8%. This rate is lower than prior guidance primarily due to the new accounting for employee stock-based compensation, which we adopted in Q1. Although we forecast the positive impact to be much less in Q3 and Q4 due to the vesting schedules for the majority of our equity grants, the impact in the first half of the year is driving our full year tax rate lower by roughly 150 basis points.
Regarding FX. We have seen an overall favorable move in currency since we last reported earnings. We're now forecasting a roughly neutral impact to EPS for this year versus last quarter's full year forecast of a negative $0.16.
Regarding revenues. We're forecasting a negative impact of roughly $46 million for the full year, down from last quarter's full year forecasted impact of a negative $61 million. Incorporating all this information, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 to $9.50 to $9.65, assuming 49.4 million shares outstanding. 
One final comment for modeling purposes. We expect Q3 EPS to be slightly lower than Q4 due to lower sequential gross margins at CooperVision. This Q3 reduction is fairly common for CVI as inventory turns every 6 months and production levels in December and January declined due to our annual manufacturing shutdowns to upgrade and retool our plants, which results in a slightly higher average cost per unit due to lower overhead absorption. This should be somewhat offset by our Q3 effective tax rate, which is normally lower than in Q4.
Lastly, we continue focusing on delivering consistent annual performance. We're forecasting over $400 million in free cash flow this year and north of $2 billion of cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years while targeting consistent improvements in operating margins to reach 28% or higher in 2021.
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

The point on the market at 5%, that's perhaps a little bit more normalized than we've had over the last couple of years. It's been a little uneven. It started way back in September of 2015 when J&J kind of went off UPP and did a lot of things with their product line that led to some pipeline [ sell ] as they rolled out the new OASYS 1 Day modality. So ever since then, it's been a little uneven. But on a trailing 12-month basis, 4%, a solid 4%, and clearly, the most recent quarter, at 5% with solid results in Asia and in Europe. As far as clariti, you're right. There's been some pricing changes that have occurred in the industry. And not only has there been pricing changes, but there has been the -- for the most part, a post-UPP era, ex Energys, our one new product and novel product. And what you're seeing in the industry, not only in Cooper, is we're really working hard to get new fits. Everyone's doing it. We believe clariti is well positioned, by way of rebates, to convince more and more people to go to the Energys, changing from one product to the other. We're clearly winning the battle with clariti on trading up from hydrogels -- silicone hydrogels. We're winning the battle of new fits very well. We need to work a little harder on converting others in the mass market. And some of our competitors have created an environment that makes that opportunity more ripe right now, and we're seizing the moment. Obviously, clariti has done very nicely, and MyDay has done very nicely, up 43% for the quarter. So we're putting up good numbers, but we want to do better yet."

So it definitely made a nice step in the right direction here, in that positive move kind of impacted even the Q2 gross margins. If you look at it, it's, to some degree, kind of half and half there. It's -- a little bit more than half is driven by the product mix and those efficiency improvements we're talking about. And then a little bit less than half is coming from currency. When you look at the sustainability, it's there. I mean, there are some things that are moving around in terms of our production and so forth. And currency as it flows through, the pound moves and so forth.

On the margin upside question, we're going to have gross margins a little bit north of 64.5% this year. So on a consolidated basis, it's pretty strong. We're -- we certainly have margin upside in CooperSurgical now that we're reset to lift that higher. On a full year basis, we're going to have margin upside in CooperVision also, all else being equal. That will be driven by kind of the same thing, excluding currency, which we'll have some upside in currency as we move through this year. But assuming currency holds steady, the manufacturing efficiencies that we have in place, the cost reduction programs, product mix shift, which is a positive, with items like we've talked about, Avaira to Avaira Vitality, the conversion from traditional daily hydrogels to clariti. All of those are kind of positive. So I won't put any specific numbers out there, but we do have margin upside here in the coming years from both businesses. When you look at revenues, speaking -- I think you're speaking mainly of CooperVision. Yes. And we're kind of running in that 8% constant currency in the first half of the year guiding to 7% to 8%, obviously took the bottom of that away and pulled the bottom end up to 7% to 8%. We do have a challenging comp in Q4, you'll remember, from last year. So I think we feel good about revenues. We obviously put up a very strong Q1. We put up a strong Q2 against the tough comp. We feel good about the back half of the year, but it's prudent to remain in that 7% to 8% range and not get more aggressive."

The supply constraint as far as Biofinity, which is growing solidly -- the combination of Biofinity and Avaira is up 12%, with Biofinity being at the higher end and Avaira, as it goes through the conversion, at the lower end of those numbers -- or of that number. Energys is still early in the rollout around the world. So it just -- it's made its entrée into the U.S. initially, and it's gone into Europe now but has a ways to go in that conversion and rollout. It's not so much maybe production capability as it is the mechanics of rolling out a product around the world. As far as Biofinity Toric XR, that is kind of a made to order. We do not stock that product. So while we have reasonable capacity to support the orders that come in, it's -- both of those products are performing extremely well in the U.S. And we believe that's a good indicator of how that will translate around the world as we go deeper. As far as the conversion of Avaira to Vitality, it's gone well, I would say. In the U.S., more than half the revenue now is coming in from Vitality. So it's made some good progress and -- but still have the other half to go. And that's the sphere. The sphere part is the easy part. Torics are a lot more complicated. So look for both of those to roll out, as I indicated, throughout this year and into next year. And we'll be pretty much done as we get through next year with the conversion. As far as market share numbers, the J&J number included what they reported some of lens care that they picked up in the acquisition that they made of -- from Abbott. So factoring in, their number was a little less than the aggregate that they reported. But the share gainer -- with the market growing 5% and Cooper growing 2x the market, pretty much assume that Alcon is not gaining share and there's not a day that goes by that they don't talk about it at Novartis in terms of their frustration with Alcon overall. And so it's still a company that is as recently as I think was this morning, the CEO indicated they're evaluating what they're going to do with Alcon in the middle of that. J&J is holding its own clearly with its numbers. And then B&L continues to lose. So pretty much, we're closing the gap on #2, which is Alcon. We still have a little ways to go, but we would hope over the next couple of years, we will catch up with them and then pass them."

So it's geographic-specific, and we are monitoring it. And we're at the point now where a lot of these reps start becoming quite productive. But feet on the street and coverage where we were not covering a lot of accounts, obviously, the feet on the street gives us the horsepower to get into more and more locations where our competitors show up and we don't. And there's quite a few of those. So we're not done yet. I would say, we will continue to grow our sales and marketing faster than the revenue at least for the balance of this year, and we'll see about next year."

CooperVision's gross margins, they are sustainable subject to our normal variability, if you will, by quarter. So as I mentioned in Q3, we had the plant shutdowns, which drives up our cost per unit back in the kind of December, January. You see that in the third quarter. So it wouldn't surprise me to see CooperVision's gross margins, as an example, come back towards 65% in Q3. Q4, again, should be a pretty good quarter. The pound has moved back a little bit back up towards $1.30 that starts to flow through our P&L. So we're probably 66% or something like that in Q4. It wouldn't surprise me. But the core basis there of sustainability through the mix shift and manufacturing efficiencies is indeed there. There was nothing to highlight out of this quarter saying, ""Hey, this was unique or onetime."" That was not the case. This is a very strong gross margin quarter. If we look at CooperSurgical, the trough is here in -- or was here, I should say, in Q2. So we accelerated some integration activity there. We pulled force on distributor consolidations and so forth into this quarter, got more aggressive on that based on some of the stuff we're seeing out there, some positive momentum that we're seeing. So I think what you'll get now is yes, we took a hit in Q2 for CooperSurgical. That's okay. It was done for integration-related reasons and for long-term strategy. You'll see the gross margin come back in Q3. You'll see the sales, the pro forma revenue growth come back in Q3. And that will continue going forward now. So that was more onetime in nature, if you will, the accelerated integration activity."

They -- any time there's price changes, that obviously creates some opportunity by various players, including yours truly. So we have been reactionary in some areas to what's going on in the industry. We happen to be -- have the only product that remains under UPP, which is Energys, which is a novel product. And we think the purpose of UPP is well served by a product like that, a new product where there's a lot of chair time and you're trying to incentivize a doctor to make a switch on a customer that may be comfortable to the current product they have. But overall, the pricing industry is favorable and rebates are favorable, and rebates are very much geared to the world of 'try it, you'll like it'. I want to incentivize you for a new fit. I want to incentivize you to move someone from product A to product B. And then from there, you follow on to a what hopefully is an annuity stream with less aggressive rebates for the new fit. Relative to Surgical, it made 7 or 8 acquisitions over the last 1.5 years or post 2 years now. Will we make any more? We obviously generate a lot of cash.

Welcome to the second quarter 2017 conference call. This was a strong quarter, and we continue to feel confident about the remainder of this year and into the future for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical having a lot of momentum.
On a consolidated basis, we reported $522 million in revenue on a non-GAAP -- and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.50. CooperVision posted another strong quarter in all key areas with 4% as reported or 7% constant currency revenue growth. Dailies silicone hydrogel lenses grew 43% while Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 12% both in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 23% or 3% pro forma. Fertility posted growth of 52% or 5% pro forma.
Moving to the details. CooperVision posted second quarter revenues of $408 million, up 7% in constant currency. By geography, the Americas grew 4%; EMEA grew 10%; and Asia Pacific grew 9%, all in constant currency. 
CooperVision's growth continues to be driven by a diverse portfolio of clariti and MyDay in the dailies space, Biofinity in the monthly space and Avaira in the 2-week space. 
Regarding daily lenses, our broad offering of silicone hydrogel lenses continues to drive growth. The daily market is critical to our strategy of gaining share, and we remain focused on driving success in this space. Our clariti portfolio of spheres, torics and multifocals leads the way as the mass market offering, and we continue to see very nice growth in all 3 regions. Our MyDay spheres and torics are also doing very well in the premium space as we continue to roll out MyDay toric in Japan and various parts of Europe. 
Biofinity. We continued seeing success around the world with strong growth in all regions. We also continued making progress rolling out our expanded offerings, which include Biofinity Energys and Biofinity Toric XR. These products are available in a number of different markets, and we'll continue rolling them out over time. 
Within the 2-week space, we successfully transitioned wearers to Avaira Vitality from our legacy Avaira product. This is for both spheres and torics. Vitality is a nice upgrade, and our customers are receiving this change well. We expect this transition to occur through the remainder of the year and into next.
Turning to product categories. Torics grew a solid 12%, and multifocals grew 4%, both in constant currency. We are the global leader in these areas of lenses with a highly diversified product offering, including both silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel lenses within the daily, 2-week and monthly modalities. 
Looking at just silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 18% in constant currency and now represents 66% of the total CooperVision sales. These products are the drivers of our growth, and we believe they are bright -- they have a bright and long future. Our product portfolio is the broadest in the space and, I believe, offers the best options. This includes being the only offering premium in mass market dailies silicone hydrogel lenses, including spheres, torics and multifocal lenses.
Turning to the overall contact lens market. In calendar Q1, we took share, growing 2x the market or 10% against the market growth of 5%. Breaking it down geographically, we grew 8% in the Americas while the market grew 3%; we grew 10% in the EMEA while the market grew 7%; and we grew 16% in Asia Pacific, with the market up 7%.
On a modality basis, single-use lenses continue driving growth, with CooperVision up 17% and the market up 13%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 7% with the market down 1%. 
For the trailing 12-month period, CooperVision grew 9% while the market grew 4%. So another strong year where we more than doubled the market. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth, driven by the continuing shift to improve technologies such as a wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses; the continuing trade-up of dailies and specialty lenses, such as torics and multifocals; geographic expansion; and the expansion of the wearer base, particularly outside the United States. And given our strengths in these areas, along with the broad private-label offering, we continue to grow faster than the market.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported second quarter revenues of $114 million, up 23%, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 3%, with fertility leading the way, up 52% or 5% pro forma. Within fertility, we experienced some disruption this quarter from aggressively consolidating distributors associated with past acquisitions. Having said that, we started seeing some upside from recent sales and marketing activity. So getting this activity transferred in-house is the right move. 
Overall, within IVF, we're continuing to execute on our growth strategy as a global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space. Our fertility growth is driven by a diversified portfolio of medical device products, capital equipment and lab services, and we believe our portfolio is the broadest in the space. 
Our office and surgical products business grew 1% for the quarter. Similar to our IVF business, we expect growth in Q3 and Q4 to improve based on momentum with new product rollouts led by EndoSee, our disposable hysteroscope, and new business that we've recently won. 
Finally, on CooperSurgical, we're making a lot of progress integrating acquisitions, including having completed a significant portion of our distributor consolidations. We broadly -- we probably have roughly another 12 months of integration activity in other parts of the business, as things are moving along well. Given this progress, we expect improved top line growth for CooperSurgical beginning in the third quarter. Overall, I remain very excited about the future of CooperSurgical, and we believe we're on the right path.
With that, I want to express our appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. They truly drive the success of our business.
And now I'll turn it over to Al."

Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis. So please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.Bob covered revenues.

So please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.
Bob covered revenues. So let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance. For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were very strong at 66%, up from 63.2% last year. CooperVision's gross margins were 67.1%, up from 62.8% last year, driven by the weakening of the pound due to Brexit last summer, product mix shift gains led by Biofinity and manufacturing efficiency improvements. 
Regarding the pound, remember, our inventory turns every 6 months. So this was the first quarter we experienced the full quarter impact of Brexit. On product mix, the message remains the same. The shift to silicone hydrogel lenses, especially Biofinity and now Avaira Vitality, is having a positive impact on our overall gross margins. Lastly, on manufacturing efficiencies, we've been seeing improvements within our manufacturing environment for some time, and this quarter really illustrated that. We've discussed this activity in prior quarters, including the negative impact from items such as inefficiencies with idle equipment and inventory write-offs, which have been negatively impacting us roughly $0.10 per quarter above normal. This quarter showed a marked improvement with a negative impact of roughly $0.05. So this is a discussion topic we can now put behind us as we move back to normal operations.
CooperSurgical's gross margins were 61.7%, down from 64.8% last year due to our genetic testing acquisitions, which carry lower gross margins. Having said that, we've now annualized those acquisitions, and we've been integrating them within our business. So we expect stable to improving gross margins on a year-over-year basis moving forward.
Consolidated operating expenses grew 8.8% in the quarter, slightly above our reported revenue growth of 8%. This was driven by investments such as additional sales personnel, along with expenses layered in from acquisitions. There's not much to highlight here, but it's important to remind everyone, we're continuing to invest in infrastructure in both of our businesses to support continued long-term growth. We've made nice progress on the sales and marketing side, along with some key hires and other support areas. So we're in fairly good shape, but we'll continue to invest as we see opportunities. Operating income growth was very strong, up 18.9%, driven by our gross margin improvements. Operating margins were 26.8%, up from 24.3% last year.
Moving to items below operating income. We reported $7.7 million of interest expense, and our effective tax rate was 6.6%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.50 with roughly 49.5 million average shares outstanding. 
Regarding shares outstanding, we repurchased 150,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of roughly $190 -- $197 per share, which totaled $29.5 million. We believe share buybacks are an effective way to maximize long-term shareholder value, and we'll continue executing on them in an opportunistic manner.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total debt decreased $38 million in the quarter to approximately $1.39 billion. This paydown was primarily driven by operational cash flow generation, offset by share buybacks. 
Moving to free cash flow. We had a strong quarter, posting $103 million of free cash comprised of roughly $132 million of operating cash flow, offset by $29 million of CapEx.
Regarding guidance. We are raising fiscal 2017 consolidated revenue to $2.11 billion to $2.135 billion. This includes raising and tightening CooperVision's revenue guidance to $1.645 billion to $1.665 billion or roughly 7% to 8% constant currency growth while lowering and tightening CooperSurgical's revenue to $465 million to $470 million, which equates to roughly 4.5% to 5% pro forma growth.
For CooperVision, we expect growth to be driven by our diverse portfolio of products led by Biofinity, Avaira, clariti and MyDay. Regarding CooperSurgical, a significant portion of the integration activity, which negatively impacted revenues, is behind us, and we expect improved growth in the second half of the year.
Operating margins are now expected to be around 25.5% for the year, supported by slightly stronger gross margins. Interest expense is to be slightly higher at around $31 million, which assumes an additional 25 basis point rate hike this month, and the full year effective tax rate is forecasted to be around 8%. This rate is lower than prior guidance primarily due to the new accounting for employee stock-based compensation, which we adopted in Q1. Although we forecast the positive impact to be much less in Q3 and Q4 due to the vesting schedules for the majority of our equity grants, the impact in the first half of the year is driving our full year tax rate lower by roughly 150 basis points.
Regarding FX. We have seen an overall favorable move in currency since we last reported earnings. We're now forecasting a roughly neutral impact to EPS for this year versus last quarter's full year forecast of a negative $0.16.
Regarding revenues. We're forecasting a negative impact of roughly $46 million for the full year, down from last quarter's full year forecasted impact of a negative $61 million. Incorporating all this information, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 to $9.50 to $9.65, assuming 49.4 million shares outstanding. 
One final comment for modeling purposes. We expect Q3 EPS to be slightly lower than Q4 due to lower sequential gross margins at CooperVision. This Q3 reduction is fairly common for CVI as inventory turns every 6 months and production levels in December and January declined due to our annual manufacturing shutdowns to upgrade and retool our plants, which results in a slightly higher average cost per unit due to lower overhead absorption. This should be somewhat offset by our Q3 effective tax rate, which is normally lower than in Q4.
Lastly, we continue focusing on delivering consistent annual performance. We're forecasting over $400 million in free cash flow this year and north of $2 billion of cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years while targeting consistent improvements in operating margins to reach 28% or higher in 2021.
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

The point on the market at 5%, that's perhaps a little bit more normalized than we've had over the last couple of years. It's been a little uneven. It started way back in September of 2015 when J&J kind of went off UPP and did a lot of things with their product line that led to some pipeline [ sell ] as they rolled out the new OASYS 1 Day modality. So ever since then, it's been a little uneven. But on a trailing 12-month basis, 4%, a solid 4%, and clearly, the most recent quarter, at 5% with solid results in Asia and in Europe. As far as clariti, you're right. There's been some pricing changes that have occurred in the industry. And not only has there been pricing changes, but there has been the -- for the most part, a post-UPP era, ex Energys, our one new product and novel product. And what you're seeing in the industry, not only in Cooper, is we're really working hard to get new fits. Everyone's doing it. We believe clariti is well positioned, by way of rebates, to convince more and more people to go to the Energys, changing from one product to the other. We're clearly winning the battle with clariti on trading up from hydrogels -- silicone hydrogels. We're winning the battle of new fits very well. We need to work a little harder on converting others in the mass market. And some of our competitors have created an environment that makes that opportunity more ripe right now, and we're seizing the moment. Obviously, clariti has done very nicely, and MyDay has done very nicely, up 43% for the quarter. So we're putting up good numbers, but we want to do better yet."

So it definitely made a nice step in the right direction here, in that positive move kind of impacted even the Q2 gross margins. If you look at it, it's, to some degree, kind of half and half there. It's -- a little bit more than half is driven by the product mix and those efficiency improvements we're talking about. And then a little bit less than half is coming from currency. When you look at the sustainability, it's there. I mean, there are some things that are moving around in terms of our production and so forth. And currency as it flows through, the pound moves and so forth.

On the margin upside question, we're going to have gross margins a little bit north of 64.5% this year. So on a consolidated basis, it's pretty strong. We're -- we certainly have margin upside in CooperSurgical now that we're reset to lift that higher. On a full year basis, we're going to have margin upside in CooperVision also, all else being equal. That will be driven by kind of the same thing, excluding currency, which we'll have some upside in currency as we move through this year. But assuming currency holds steady, the manufacturing efficiencies that we have in place, the cost reduction programs, product mix shift, which is a positive, with items like we've talked about, Avaira to Avaira Vitality, the conversion from traditional daily hydrogels to clariti. All of those are kind of positive. So I won't put any specific numbers out there, but we do have margin upside here in the coming years from both businesses. When you look at revenues, speaking -- I think you're speaking mainly of CooperVision. Yes. And we're kind of running in that 8% constant currency in the first half of the year guiding to 7% to 8%, obviously took the bottom of that away and pulled the bottom end up to 7% to 8%. We do have a challenging comp in Q4, you'll remember, from last year. So I think we feel good about revenues. We obviously put up a very strong Q1. We put up a strong Q2 against the tough comp. We feel good about the back half of the year, but it's prudent to remain in that 7% to 8% range and not get more aggressive."

Energys is still early in the rollout around the world. So it just -- it's made its entrée into the U.S. initially, and it's gone into Europe now but has a ways to go in that conversion and rollout. It's not so much maybe production capability as it is the mechanics of rolling out a product around the world. As far as Biofinity Toric XR, that is kind of a made to order. We do not stock that product. So while we have reasonable capacity to support the orders that come in, it's -- both of those products are performing extremely well in the U.S. And we believe that's a good indicator of how that will translate around the world as we go deeper. As far as the conversion of Avaira to Vitality, it's gone well, I would say. In the U.S., more than half the revenue now is coming in from Vitality. So it's made some good progress and -- but still have the other half to go. And that's the sphere. The sphere part is the easy part. Torics are a lot more complicated. So look for both of those to roll out, as I indicated, throughout this year and into next year. And we'll be pretty much done as we get through next year with the conversion. As far as market share numbers, the J&J number included what they reported some of lens care that they picked up in the acquisition that they made of -- from Abbott. So factoring in, their number was a little less than the aggregate that they reported. But the share gainer -- with the market growing 5% and Cooper growing 2x the market, pretty much assume that Alcon is not gaining share and there's not a day that goes by that they don't talk about it at Novartis in terms of their frustration with Alcon overall. And so it's still a company that is as recently as I think was this morning, the CEO indicated they're evaluating what they're going to do with Alcon in the middle of that. J&J is holding its own clearly with its numbers. And then B&L continues to lose. So pretty much, we're closing the gap on #2, which is Alcon. We still have a little ways to go, but we would hope over the next couple of years, we will catch up with them and then pass them."

Am I correct in thinking the stepped-up level is sustainable in 2H? And then sort of on the other side, for CSI, I thought previously, the trough was thought to be fiscal 2Q. But is it correct to now start thinking that, that trough is fiscal 3Q?"

We are so indexed -- under-indexed against our 2 largest competitors that we will keep -- we will continue to hire as long as it makes sense in the right areas. So it's geographic-specific, and we are monitoring it. And we're at the point now where a lot of these reps start becoming quite productive. But feet on the street and coverage where we were not covering a lot of accounts, obviously, the feet on the street gives us the horsepower to get into more and more locations where our competitors show up and we don't. And there's quite a few of those. So we're not done yet. I would say, we will continue to grow our sales and marketing faster than the revenue at least for the balance of this year, and we'll see about next year."

CooperVision's gross margins, they are sustainable subject to our normal variability, if you will, by quarter. So as I mentioned in Q3, we had the plant shutdowns, which drives up our cost per unit back in the kind of December, January. You see that in the third quarter. So it wouldn't surprise me to see CooperVision's gross margins, as an example, come back towards 65% in Q3. Q4, again, should be a pretty good quarter. The pound has moved back a little bit back up towards $1.30 that starts to flow through our P&L. So we're probably 66% or something like that in Q4. It wouldn't surprise me. But the core basis there of sustainability through the mix shift and manufacturing efficiencies is indeed there. There was nothing to highlight out of this quarter saying, ""Hey, this was unique or onetime."" That was not the case. This is a very strong gross margin quarter. If we look at CooperSurgical, the trough is here in -- or was here, I should say, in Q2. So we accelerated some integration activity there. We pulled force on distributor consolidations and so forth into this quarter, got more aggressive on that based on some of the stuff we're seeing out there, some positive momentum that we're seeing. So I think what you'll get now is yes, we took a hit in Q2 for CooperSurgical. That's okay. It was done for integration-related reasons and for long-term strategy. You'll see the gross margin come back in Q3. You'll see the sales, the pro forma revenue growth come back in Q3. And that will continue going forward now. So that was more onetime in nature, if you will, the accelerated integration activity."

They -- any time there's price changes, that obviously creates some opportunity by various players, including yours truly. So we have been reactionary in some areas to what's going on in the industry. We happen to be -- have the only product that remains under UPP, which is Energys, which is a novel product. And we think the purpose of UPP is well served by a product like that, a new product where there's a lot of chair time and you're trying to incentivize a doctor to make a switch on a customer that may be comfortable to the current product they have.

This was another solid quarter with share gains, improving margins and strong cash flow. On a consolidated basis, we reported $556 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.64. 
CooperVision posted another strong quarter with 7% as reported revenue growth, or up 8% in constant currency. Dailies, silicone hydrogel lenses grew 47%, while Biofinity and Avaira combined growth 10%, both in constant currency. 
CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 13%, up 4% pro forma and -- with fertility up 26% or 6% pro forma. 
Moving to the details. CooperVision posted third quarter revenues of $437 million, up 8% in constant currency. By geography, the Americas grew 2%, EMEA grew 13% and Asia Pacific grew 13%, all in constant currency. The Americas ends up as it was soft, but based on market data, the entire market was soft. We continue to see good shift data in the Americas so in the period, this was an anomaly and we expect stronger growth in future quarters. Overall revenues continue to be driven by our silicone hydrogel lenses, led by my MyDay and clariti and dailies space in Biofinity in the multifocal space. Regarding daily, are 2-tier approach, with the daily silicone -- within the daily silicone hydrogel space allows doctors to offer premium and mass market lenses with the latest materials. MyDay is our premium daily silicone hydrogel lens and is offered a very high-quality Sphere in toric. Our clariti products are sold on a mass market basis and we're named the only daily silicone hydrogel lens family with a sphere, a toric and a multifocal offering. In addition, clariti is competitively priced against several daily hydrogel products that we maintain a nice competitive advantage. Overall, we continue to believe we served the healthiest modality paired with the highest qualities of permeable to ensure the best health for the eye. This is done with daily lenses made from silicone hydrogel lenses such as MyDay and clariti. 
Moving to other products. Biofinity continues to perform extremely well all around the world. This includes a full product offering of Spheres, torics and multifocals, along with our expanded offering of Biofinity, Energys and Biofinity XR toric. We continue to see the diversified geographic strength from Biofinity and expect solid performance from many years to come. Within the 2-week space, we're continuing to transition whereas to our upgraded availability Avaira Vitality lens from our legacy Avaira product. 
As we've discussed in the past, this is a large and time-consuming endeavor, but I'm happy to say that our customers are receiving this upgrade very positively. Our timing remains the same, which is to finish the transition by roughly the end of fiscal 2018. 
Turning to product category. We remain the global leader in torics, which grew a solid 11% in constant currency, primarily driven by clariti, 1 Days toric and Biofinity toric, along with the rollout of MyDay toric in Europe. We believe there's still a lot of room for growth in this category, both by modality and by geography. 
Multifocals grew 7% in constant currency. We have a diversified set of products in this space and arguably the best multifocal design on the market with Biofinity multifocal, so we expect continued growth. 
Turning to the global contact lens market. For calendar Q2, we grew 7% versus the market that was up 4%. This included growing faster than the market in each geography, with the Americas growing 2% against the market, up 1%; EMEA growing 11% versus the market up 6%; and Asia Pacific growing 12% versus a market up 8%. By modality, single-use lenses continued driving growth with CVI up 14% in the market up 12%. And finally, CVI's non-single-use lenses grew 4%, while the market declined 3%. On a trailing 12 month basis, CooperVision also reported very strong numbers, growing 8% versus the market up 4%. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth driven by the continuing shift to improve technology such as wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing trade up to dailies and to specialty lenses, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base, particularly outside of the United States. And given our strength in these areas, along with our broad private label offering, we expect to continue growing faster than the market. 
Turning to a different topic. We completed the acquisition of a small special contact lens company named [ Grocania ] in August. This added a leading ortho-k technology to our lens portfolio and increases access to several fast-growing myopia control markets. This acquisition supports our specialty lens strategy, led by MySight product. Myopia control is currently in its infancy, but we are developing a nice specialty lens platform to remain a leader as this market starts taking shape. Note the financial terms of this acquisition were not disclosed. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported third quarter revenues of $119 million, up 13%, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 4%, with fertility leading the way up 26% or 6% pro forma. This quarter was important over the last -- an improvement over the last 2 quarters, and I believe Q4 will continue another step up in the right direction. With an idea, we're continuing to work through integration matters, but we're making progress. We're also continuing to execute on our growth strategy as the global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space. The IVF space remains global market with long-term, long growth dynamics -- strong growth dynamics and we look forward to continuing our positive trends. Our office and surgical products business grew 1% for the quarter, with strength in our disposable hysteroscope and OC, offset by weakness in our older product lines. 
Before turning it over to Al, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for their hard work and dedication. I also want to expressly send our best wishes to those impacted by the storm in Texas, including our employees located in that area.
And now, I'll turn it over to Al."

Most of my commentary will be in a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenue, so let me focus on the rest of the fina",903,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Most of my commentary will be in a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenue, so let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance. 
For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were 64.8%, up nicely from 63.6% last year with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posting improved gross margins year-over-year. CooperVision's gross margin were 65.5%, up from 64.2% last year, driven by product mix-shift gains and currency, partially offset by higher cost inventory tied to our annual plant shutdowns in fiscal Q1. As a reminder, our inventory currency to the P&L over 6 months so our plant shut down in fiscal Q1 resulted in higher cost inventory carrying through the P&L in our fiscal third quarter. Bob mentioned the Avaira transition and I want to comment quickly that we did experience a higher sequential costs associated with switching patients from Avaira to Avaira Vitality, mostly from writing up inventory. Having said that, we excluded these unique transition costs, following $2.8 million for non-GAAP reporting purposes. To be clear, this is a very positive transition for us and for providing a high-quality replacement product, while realizing manufacturing improvements to significantly improve future gross margins. We expect we'll see most of this benefit in the back half of next year and into fiscal 2019. 
CooperSurgical posted a nice bump in gross margins to 62.4%, up 120 basis points from 61.2% last year. These improvements were driven by success around our integration efforts within infertility, along with our margin improvement in our base medical device systems. Consolidated operating expenses grew 10.5% in the quarter, driven by investments throughout the company. We spent time in prior quarters discussing investments including our sales force expansion, but I want to highlight that we expanded our investment activity this past quarter to include other parts of the business such as distribution. It's important to remember our revenue growth has been strong for many years, and we believe it will continue for many more years. As such, we need to ensure infrastructure is capable of meeting our higher throughput and more stringent customer demand. Ensuring we maintain a strong global distribution, platform is at the top of this list. Combining these investments with other areas, such as sales and marketing, the invest SG&A spending will likely remain elevated. 
Regarding the financial impact of this quarter and into the future, we used currency upside to support these investments and we'll continue to do so. We are currency in a headwind for many years and tightened our belt, so it's nice to have currency as a tailwind to now support needed infrastructure investment. 
Moving to operating income. We grew OI by 9.5%, with operating margins improving to 25.9% from 25.6% last year. Below operating income, we reported $8.3 million of interest expense and our effective tax rate was 6%, both in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP EPS was the $2.64, with roughly 49.6 million average shares outstanding. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Total debt decreased $174 million in the quarter to approximately $1.21 billion. This paydown was driven by strong cash flow and a reduction in cash balances. Regarding cash flow, we posted $117 million of free cash, comprised of roughly $115 million of operating cash flow, offset by $30 million of CapEx. 
Before moving to guidance, I want to mention that CooperVision has recently entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the class action complaint relating to UPP, or unilateral pricing policy. This settlement includes the payment of $3 million and is still subject to court approval. We have excluded the settlement accrual and related costs from our non-GAAP earnings. 
Regarding guidance for fiscal Q4, we're guiding CooperVision revenues to $435 million to $445 million, up roughly 5% to 7.5% pro forma against the top 11% count. And note, I'm highlighting pro forma rather than just constant currency as we're including the small revenue from CooperVision's [indiscernible] acquisition in the prior quarter to provide a true organic growth rate. CooperSurgical's Q4 revenue guidance is $117 million to $120 million, or roughly 3% to 6% pro forma. Regarding non-GAAP EPS, we're guiding to $2.60 and $2.70, up a roughly 9.5% effective tax rate. Within this guidance is an assumption that severe flooding in Texas negatively impact CooperVision revenue by $2 million, CooperSurgical's revenue by $1 million and EPS by roughly $0.03. 
On a full-year basis, this translates to raising consolidated revenue guidance to $2.129 billion to $2.142 billion, with CooperVision at $1.67 billion to $1.68 billion and CooperSurgical at $459 million to $462 million. We are also increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to $9.66 to $9.76. 
Before concluding, I'd like to make a brief comment about next fiscal year. We are comfortable stating that we expect, as reported, non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the low double-digit for fiscal 2018. This includes assumptions around the investment I discussed earlier. In other words, we anticipate using at least some of the recent positive currency tailwinds to support our continuing infrastructure expansion plan. 
With that, let me conclude by saying we remain focused on expanding our business and gaining global market share, while delivering consistent solid financial results and this quarter was certainly another step in that direction. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

It is true that are -- some competitors raising pricing -- lifts pricing. It's also true that as an industry, we've been trading up -- we've been more about treating up. So 90% of the action of prose in the industry is trading up. Less than 10% has anything to do with pricing and that's been that way forever, for 30 years. So pricing, sometimes, is a tactic. It allows you to do things as you are shifting wares from a 2-week modality into a 1-day and a 1-month modality. So you may do something with your list prices. At the end of the day, it's the net growth that matters, it's the trading up that matters and I would say, pricing is nothing more than a minor tactic in achieving whatever you're trying to do. The industry has done a phenomenal job of moving now people out of the 2-week space into the monthly -- into the 1 Day space. The growth of the industry in the last 4-years-plus has been of the 1 Day modality in the U.S. and for the last 10 years, it's been the 1 Day modality outside the U.S. So I'm not going to comment too much more of the granularity of pricing tactics."

We obviously invested a lot of that, and as I talked about, we're taking the opportunity here to do some upgrades especially within distribution throughout the business to ensure we meet customer demands going forward. And there really wasn't much else there. So it's pretty much driven by doing what we were doing, and then outside from foreign exchange, being invested in the infrastructure of the business."

We're still under index against all of our primary competitors and even a smaller competitor. Having said that, the productivity I think is reflective in the fact that we continue to grow twice the market, so we're getting a lot of results out of that expanded feet on the street. It does take 9 to 12 months to have sales person fully productive, so we're still marching up that curve very nicely. It's a global expansion. It's not only in the U.S., so we continue to expand to Asia Pacific as far as we've been a bootstrap pay as we go as many as you need to continue to expand your coverage in Asia PAC. In Europe, borderline almost #1 now in the marketplace, neck and neck with Alcon, and continue to add few feet on the street in Asia -- and in Europe also. So it's going very well.

Net-net-net over a multiyear period, I have to go multiyear even though I use the 12 months, the market is very good, but I must admit, it's 10. I'd always say 1 quarter does not a trend make.

They are about 90% of that market or a little more. So that's the wearer base, and we want that wearer base and they know it out of the 2-weeks space into other spaces and primarily the 1 Day modality. Since they have adopted that strategy, really, when they came out with the 1-week product and then the 1 Day product, meaning a 1-week oasis and then a 1 Day oasis, they have really accelerated the depth of that 2-week space and we find that  we are getting our fair share. Obviously, when you look at clariti and MyDay numbers, 47% growth over a higher base. So year-after-year, that base goes up and it continues to grow very impressively.

It would not surprise me if next year's CapEx is -- I would be surprised if it's not higher, and certainly it could be in that 150 to 200 range depending on what we do. As I mentioned, distribution as an example, wouldn't surprise me if we have new distribution facility, as an example, in each business next year. So I could certainly see CapEx being higher next year. On the flip side, our operating cash flow will continue to grow and year-over-year free cash flow will continue to improve. So fiscal '17, strong close of the year should result in strong free cash flow in fiscal '18, even with higher CapEx that we have, it's going to be an even stronger free cash flow either, is what I'd say at this point."

So 2 week noncompliance wearing it as a monthly, available on a 2-year supply, because they buy a 1-year supply at 2 weeks, which turns into a 3-year supply on a monthly basis. They then shift to buying 730 lenses, and they're very compliant have that's care regiments and all that stuff. So we're probably confident that once you get through the noise level of everything that's gone on, including just how much J&J sells the pipeline in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, that kind of created anomalies throughout the next periods, and including some of the antics of going direct, trying to go around the middleman, and to it, including some of the consolidation going on with partnerships of the large retailers, so there's a lot of moving parts.

The bases of, yes, there's a lot of legacy products there. So NSE, as Bob mentioned disposable hysteroscope is doing really well and we'll continue to make a lot of progress there but some of the base products are a little bit harder to get moving there. So I still think that business is more along the lines of a 3%, 4%, 5% maybe kind of growth business, that component -- that base business component of it. So that was little bit later. It's hard to get into any individual quarter at this point with the specific issues associated with it, but I do think you will see a little bit of an improvement in the Q4 also."

I think you're right that the rebating activity has increased and that makes sense when you think about what where doing as an industry, moving from a 2-week space and trying to provide that incentive to a new fits in the 1 Day modality. So there's a lot of energy being spent on try it, you like it. If we can get you there to try it, once you realize how convenient it is, you'll probably stay and not go back ever again because it's just too convenient. And I speak as a user, not -- I'm not only as a user who used to clean lenses every day. So I don't worry about cleaning lenses everyday, I just normally everyday. So the strategy of rebating and creating that extra incentive to say, ""hey, net-net-net this is not too expensive right now"", keep in mind of there's a list price -- now list price is getting higher and higher relative to the net. So I can net out, take my money I'm spending on lens care and shift it in to the 1 Day modality and feel real good about that in the convenience. Lo and behold, down the road, it could be that the rebates start diminishing once you're on a new set, in the longer run, re-user, who knows what will happen. So I think more important to have your list price -- the list price in that card,the list price of the hotel room, I don't care what list price you're talking about, where you suddenly provide $1,000 list and a $500 refund, well, it's a $1,000 less than -- in a $1,000 bill at certain times. So that's kind of same in this industry as any other industry and how you play that out."

So when you look at it, the numbers are roughly correct, that's true. Some of these are given ranges especially on forward-looking guidance, but that's true. The answer to that though is of the investment side. So when we give guidance last quarter, we saw currency strength already, as a better fact, when we guide it, we guided with some relatively conservative FX rate. And we were getting in front of -- specially distribution, the best example I can give. You a you guys does serve the work and have heard is some distribution issues and we talked about them in the past. We have a lot more volume going through our distribution center, a lot of our business is driven by daily growth. We have customers who are demanding a higher level of excellence when it comes to shipping, that's both true within Vision and Surgical. Our businesses is both growing and growing pretty consistently so we are getting in front of that and we started that at the beginning of last quarter. Now it's much easier to do that, so to speak, and report good numbers when you have currency at you're back. We wanted numbers, years here where we were fighting currency, and still putting up pretty good numbers in the face of currency, and now kind of flipped the other side.

As we've mentioned, and Bob will talk it through, we're growing at around to exit a market with a lot of momentum, a lot of related products, we're going to continue to invest dollars in both business to drive market share gains. So you're going to see that and then when you look at how much, some of that, frankly, to be honest with you, gets dependent upon currency. I mean, if the euro holds where it's at and it continues to give us the opportunity to do some investments, we're going to take advantage of that. Those -- a lot of those are variable expenses and we can maneuver around that, but we do believe in a long-term of the business and we're going to invest accordingly."

So I don't think there's a real lot of still over there. We're tremendously excited about the space, but we also are realistic enough to say that ""this is going to be a long haul development."" Myopia is going up around the world significantly. It's gone from basically 20% of the world, and it will be approaching 50% of the population by 2050, and directionally, its clearly headed that way. What's causing it very much is taking people off the rural areas in the countryside, putting them in schools is one of the leading thoughts, having less natural sunlight is a thought.

So operationally, the underlying fundamentals of CooperVision are very strong and the kind of 5% to 7.5% growth that's given towards the next quarter will be an improvement.

Big in Germany, big in Japan. But the newer generation, the young adults, are not getting our RGPs, they're getting torics when they have astigmatism. So tremendous growth opportunities there.

It was something like $1 million or a little less last quarter. We had not called it out at that point. Now it's moved up to a point here where I think it's worthwhile to actually to highlight it mentioned. It will occur again, I think, probably a similar amount in Q4, probably again in Q1, and then it will tail off as that transition getting done. So I don't think it's going to be that large of a number, but it's important enough, I think, from our perspective, to be transparent, kind of highlight that. If you look at the $3.2 million, the other income on there, a lot of that is going to be associated with foreign exchange, so that's going to be below-the-line FX gains or intercompany loans. So we kind of see that fluctuating, you'll see that the gains quarter, you'll see there's a lapse on quarter, that just kind of maneuvers around the currency. But that's what the majority of that would've been. If you look at what our optimal capital structure, I guess, the way I'll say I look at it, is this quarter, our bank defined net funded debt-to-EBITDA, which is the way I look at it, which is 1.71x. So from a leverage perspective, we're probably on the light side right now. Obviously, we look at things like investing in the business, we look at acquisitions, we look at share buybacks and so forth, there's different avenues at shareholder value. We'll continue to do that. I think from a leverage perspective defined that way, if you start getting below 1.5x, or certainly as you move towards 1x or lower, you're getting kind of undelivered and to today's low interest rate world. If you're moving towards north of 3x, or certainly if you move towards 3.5x, if you were to move that high, right? You'll have to raise a question mark on that as your leverage is going to go up."

This was another solid quarter with share gains, improving margins and strong cash flow. On a consolidated basis, we reported $556 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.64. 
CooperVision posted another strong quarter with 7% as reported revenue growth or up 8% in constant currency. Daily silicone hydrogel lenses grew 47%, while Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 10% both in constant currency.  CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 13%, up 4% pro forma and -- with fertility up 26% or 6% pro forma.
Moving to the details. CooperVision posted third quarter revenues of $437 million, up 8% in constant currency. By geography, the Americas grew 2%. EMEA grew 13%, and Asia Pacific grew 13%, all in constant currency. The Americas stands out as it was soft, but based on market data, the entire market was soft. We continue to see good shift data in the Americas. So it appears this was an anomaly, and we expect stronger growth in future quarters. Overall revenues continue to be driven by our silicone hydrogel lenses led by my MyDay and clariti in the daily space and Biofinity in the monthly space. Regarding dailies, our 2-tier approach with the daily silicone -- within the daily silicone hydrogel space allows doctors to offer premium and mass market lenses with the latest materials. MyDay is our premium daily silicone hydrogel lens and is offered as a very high-quality sphere and toric. Our clariti products are sold on a mass market basis and remain the only daily silicone hydrogel lens family with a sphere, a toric and a multifocal offering. In addition, clariti is competitively priced against several daily hydrogel products that we maintain a nice competitive advantage. Overall, we continue to believe wearers deserve the healthiest modality paired with the highest quality oxygen permeable materials to ensure the best health for the eye. This is done with daily lenses using silicone hydrogel lenses such as MyDay and clariti.
Moving to other products. Biofinity continues to perform extremely well all around the world. This includes a full product offering of spheres, torics and multifocals, along with our expanded offerings of Biofinity Energys and Biofinity XR toric. We continue to see diversified geographic strength from Biofinity and expect solid performance for many years to come.
Within the 2-week space, we're continuing to transition wearers to our upgraded Avaira Vitality lens from our legacy Avaira product. As we've discussed in the past, this is a large and time-consuming endeavor, but I'm happy to say our customers are receiving this upgrade very positively. Our timing remains the same, which is to finish the transition by roughly the end of fiscal 2018.
Turning to product categories. We remain the global leader in torics, which grew a solid 11% in constant currency, primarily driven by clariti 1-day toric and Biofinity toric, along with the rollout of MyDay toric in Europe. We believe there's still a lot of room for growth in this category both by modality and by geography.
Multifocals grew 7% in constant currency. We have a diversified set of products in this space and arguably the best multifocal design on the market with Biofinity Multifocal, so we expect continued growth. 
Turning to the global contact lens market. For calendar Q2, we grew 7% versus the market that was up 4%. This included growing faster than the market in each geography with the Americas growing 2% against the market up 1%, EMEA growing 11% versus the market up 6%, and Asia Pacific growing 12% versus the market up 8%.
By modality, single-use lenses continue driving growth with CVI up 14% and the market up 12%. And finally, CVI's non-single-use lenses grew 4%, while the market declined 3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision also reported very strong numbers, growing 8% versus the market up 4%. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth, driven by the continuing shift to improve technologies such as wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing trade up of -- to dailies and to specialty lenses, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base, particularly outside of the United States. And given our strength in these areas, along with our broad private label offering, we expect to continue growing faster than the market.
Turning to a different topic. We completed the acquisition of a small special contact lens company named Procornea in August. This added a leading ortho-k technology to our lens portfolio and increases access to several fast growing myopia control markets. This acquisition supports our specialty lens strategy led by our MiSight product. Myopia control is currently in its infancy, but we are developing a nice specialty lens platform to remain a leader as this market starts taking shape. Note, the financial terms of this acquisition were not disclosed.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported third quarter revenues of $119 million, up 13%, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 4% in fertility -- with fertility leading the way, up 26% or 6% pro forma. This quarter was important over the last -- an improvement over the last 2 quarters, and I believe Q4 will continue another step up in the right direction.
Within IVF, we're continuing to work through integration matters, but we're making progress. We're also continuing to execute on our growth strategy as the global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space. The IVF space remains a global market with long-term long growth dynamics -- strong growth dynamics, and we look forward to continuing our positive trends.
Our office and surgical products business grew 1% for the quarter with strength in our disposable hysteroscope, EndoSee, offset by weakness in the older product lines.
Before turning it over to Al, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for their hard work and dedication. I also want to especially send our best wishes to those impacted by the storm in Texas, including our employees located in that area.
And now I'll turn it over to Al."

Most of my commentary will be in a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenue, so let me focus on the rest of the fina",910,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Most of my commentary will be in a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenue, so let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance.
For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were 64.8%, up nicely from 63.6% last year with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posting improved gross margins year-over-year. CooperVision's gross margin were 65.5%, up from 64.2% last year, driven by product mix shift gains and currency, partially offset by higher cost inventory tied to our annual plant shutdowns in fiscal Q1. As a reminder, our inventory [ carries through ] the P&L over 6 months, so our plant shutdowns in fiscal Q1 resulted in higher cost inventory carrying through the P&L in our fiscal third quarter.
Bob mentioned the Avaira transition, and I want to comment quickly that we did experience higher sequential costs associated with switching patients from Avaira to Avaira Vitality mostly from writing off inventory. Having said that, we excluded these unique transition costs totaling $2.8 million for non-GAAP reporting purposes. To be clear, this is a very positive transition for us as we're providing a high-quality replacement product while realizing manufacturing improvements to significantly improve future gross margins. We expect we'll see most of this benefit in the back half of next year and into fiscal 2019.
CooperSurgical posted a nice bump in gross margins to 62.4%, up 120 basis points from 61.2% last year. These improvements were driven by success around our integration efforts within fertility along with the margin improvement in our base medical device business. Consolidated operating expenses grew 10.5% in the quarter, driven by investments throughout the company.
We've spent time in prior quarters discussing investments, including our sales force expansion, but I want to highlight that we expanded our investment activity this past quarter to include other parts of the business such as distribution. It's important to remember our revenue growth has been strong for many years, and we believe it will continue for many more years. As such, we need to ensure our infrastructure is capable of meeting our higher throughput and more stringent customer demand. Ensuring we maintain a strong global distribution platform is at the top of this list. Combining these investments with other areas such as sales and marketing, the invest -- G&A spending will likely remain elevated.
Regarding the financial impact of this quarter and into the future, we use currency upside to support these investments, and we'll continue to do so. We had currency as a headwind for many years and tightened our belt, so it's nice to have currency as a tailwind to now support needed infrastructure investment.
Moving to operating income. We grew OI by 9.5% with operating margins improving to 25.9% from 25.6% last year. Below operating income, we reported $8.3 million of interest expense, and our effective tax rate was 6%, both in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP EPS was the $2.64 with roughly 49.6 million average shares outstanding.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total debt decreased $174 million in the quarter to approximately $1.21 billion. This pay down was driven by strong cash flow and a reduction in cash balances. Regarding cash flow, we posted $117 million of free cash comprised of roughly $150 million of operating cash flow offset by $30 million of CapEx.
Before moving to guidance, I want to mention that CooperVision has recently entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the class action complaints relating to UPP or Unilateral Pricing Policy. This settlement includes the payment of $3 million and is still subject to court approval. We have excluded the settlement accrual and related costs from our non-GAAP earnings.
Regarding guidance for fiscal Q4, we're guiding CooperVision revenues to $435 million to $445 million, up roughly 5% to 7.5% pro forma against the tough 11% comp. And note, I am highlighting pro forma rather than just constant currency as we're including the small revenue from CooperVision's Procornea acquisition in the prior quarter to provide a true organic growth rate. CooperSurgical's Q4 revenue guidance is $117 million to $120 million or roughly 3% to 6% pro forma. Regarding non-GAAP EPS, we're guiding to $2.60 to $2.70, off a roughly 9.5% effective tax rate. Within this guidance is an assumption that severe flooding in Texas negatively impacts CooperVision revenue by $2 million, CooperSurgical's revenue by $1 million and EPS by roughly $0.03.
On a full year basis, this translates to raising consolidated revenue guidance to $2.129 billion to $2.142 billion with CooperVision at $1.67 billion to $1.68 billion and CooperSurgical at $459 million to $462 million. We are also increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to $9.66 to $9.76.
Before concluding, I'd like to make a brief comment about next fiscal year. We are comfortable stating that we expect as reported non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the low double digits for fiscal 2018. This includes assumptions around the investments I discussed earlier. In other words, we anticipate using at least some of the recent positive currency tailwinds to support our continuing infrastructure expansion plan.
With that, let me conclude by saying we remain focused on expanding our business and gaining global market share while delivering consistent solid financial results, and this quarter was certainly another step in that direction.
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

It is true there are  some competitors raising prices -- list prices. It's also true that as an industry we've been trading up -- we've been more about trading up. So 90% of the action of growth in the industry is trading up. Less than 10% has anything to do with pricing, and that's been that way forever, for 30 years. So pricing sometimes is a tactic. It allows you to do things as you are shifting wearers from a 2-week modality into a 1-day and a 1-month modality. So you may do something with your list prices. At the end of the day, it's the net growth that matters. It's the trading up that matters, and I would say, pricing is nothing more than a minor tactic in achieving whatever you're trying to do. The industry has done a phenomenal job of moving now people out of the 2-week space into the monthly -- into the 1-day space. The growth of the industry in the last 4 years plus has been the 1-day modality in the U.S. and for the last 10 years, it's been the 1-day modality outside the U.S. So I'm not going to comment too much more on the granularity of pricing tactics."

And I -- there really wasn't much else there.

We're still under indexed against all of our primary competitors and even a smaller competitor. Having said that, the productivity, I think, is reflective in the fact that we continue to grow twice the market, so we're getting a lot of results out of that expanded feet on the street. It does take 9 to 12 months to have a salesperson fully productive, so we're still marching up that curve very nicely. It's a global expansion. It's not only the U.S., so we continue to fund Asia Pacific, has largely been a bootstrap ""pay as you go"" basis but it's hire as many as you need to continue to expand your coverage in Asia Pac.

Since they have adopted that strategy, really, when they came out with the 1-week product and then the 1-day product, meaning a 1-week OASYS and then a 1-day OASYS, they have really accelerated the depth of that 2-week space, and we find that good. We are getting our fair share.

As I mentioned, distribution, as an example, wouldn't surprise me if we have new distribution facility, as an example, in each business next year. So I could see -- certainly see CapEx being higher next year. On the flip side, our operating cash flow will continue to grow and year-over-year free cash flow continue to improve. So fiscal '17, strong close to the year should result in strong free cash flow fiscal '18.

They then shift to buying 730 lenses, and they're very compliant because they don't have lens care regimens and all that stuff. So we're highly confident that once you get through the noise level of everything that's gone on, including just how much J&J sells the pipeline in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, that kind of created anomalies throughout the next periods and to it including some of the antics of going direct, trying to go around the middleman and to it including some of the consolidation going on with partnerships of the large retailers. So there's a lot of moving parts, but underlying that is a market that looks very healthy from a wearer perspective and a trading up perspective. So we're highly confident we'll see normalized correlation between that shift in the revenue line in the future."

So we'll see how that plays out, but I don't want to give specific numbers on that yet or, frankly, where we [ expect the ] currency as much as the market's move. Making the statement that we're comfortable saying low double digits and use 11% as the midpoint, you can argue that, that's conservative, and certainly, when you look at our Q4 guidance here of 14% to 18% as reported, we obviously strive for stronger numbers. At this point in time though, it's still months and months and months away from next year in giving guidance. So I think it's prudent to just stick with where we are right now and we'll update it accordingly when we get on the December call."

And then, I guess, just one last question on the Americas.

Yes, the third quarter was a touch weaker than, certainly, at least I was expecting it was going to be. The fertility business did okay. There was still some integration activity that probably lingered a little bit longer than I thought it was going to. So I think we'll see a little bit stronger fourth quarter performance there. The base is, though, yes, there's a lot of legacy products there. So EndoSee, as Bob mentioned, our disposable hysteroscope, is doing really well, and we're continuing to make a lot of progress there, but some of the base products are a little bit harder to get moving there. So I still think that business is more along the lines of a 3%, 4%, 5% maybe kind of growth business, that component -- that base business component of it. So that was a little bit lighter. It's hard to get into any individual quarter and pinpoint a specific issue associated with it, but I do think you'll see a little bit of improvement on that in Q4 also."

I think you're right that the rebating activity has increased, and that makes sense when you think about what we're doing as an industry, moving from the 2-week space and trying to provide that incentive to a new fit in the 1-day modality. So there's a lot of energy being spent on try it, you'll like it. If we can get you there to try it, once you realize how convenient it is, you'll probably stay and not go back ever again because it's just too convenient. And I speak as a user, not -- I'm not only as a -- a user who used to clean lenses everyday. So I don't worry about cleaning lenses everyday. I just throw them away everyday. So the strategy of rebating and creating that extra incentive to say, hey, net-net-net this is not too expensive right now, keep in mind there's a list price. Now list price is getting higher and higher relative to the net. And so I can net out, take my money I'm spending on lens care and shift it into the 1-day modality and feel real good about that and the convenience. Lo and behold down the road, it could be that the rebates start diminishing once you're a new fit and no longer a new fit but a re-user. Who knows what will happen? So I think more important to have your list price, the list price of that car, the list price of the hotel room, I don't care what list price you're talking about, where you suddenly provide $1,000 list and a $500 refund, well, it's a $1,000 list in -- in a $1,000 bill certain times. So that's kind of same in this industry as every other industry on how you play that out."

I mean, some of these are given ranges especially on forward-looking guidance, but that's true. The answer to that, though, is the investment side. So when we gave guidance last quarter, we saw the currency strength already. As a matter of fact, when we guided, we guided with some relatively conservative FX rates. And we were getting in front of especially distribution. It's the best example I can give. You guys have heard -- you've done survey work and you have heard us some distribution issues, and we've talked about them in the past. We have a lot more volume going through our distribution centers. A lot of our business is driven by daily growth. We have customers who are demanding a higher level of excellence when it comes to shipping. That's both true within Vision and Surgical. Our businesses are both growing and growing pretty consistently. So we are getting in front of that, and we started that at the beginning of last quarter. Now it's much easier to do that, so to speak, and report good numbers when you have currency at your back. We went a number of years here where we were fighting currency and still putting up pretty good numbers in the face of currency and now it kind of flipped the other side.

We have a lot of momentum, a lot of really good products. We're going to continue to invest dollars in both business to drive market share gains. So you're going to see that, and when you look at how much, some of that, frankly, to be honest with you, gets dependent upon currency. I mean, if the euro holds where it's at and continues to give us the opportunity to do some investments, we're going to take advantage of that. Those -- a lot of those are variable expenses, and we can maneuver around that. But we do believe in the long term of the business, and we're going to invest accordingly."

Relative to whether or not and to what degree that will allow us to accelerate our overall franchise in China, I would assume, yes, there will be some benefits, but quite frankly, a lot of what makes -- what's okay and what Procornea is about in myopia control is pretty much in the hands of a specialty area where people really focus in on what it takes to slow the progress of myopia, particularly in the younger generation -- the younger part of the generation. So I don't think there's a real lot of spill over there. We are tremendously excited about the space, but we also are realistic enough to say this is going to be a long-haul development. Myopia is going up around the world significantly. It's gone from basically 20% of the world and is -- will be approaching 50% of the population by 2050, and directionally, it's clearly headed that way. What's causing it very much is taking people off the rural areas, the countryside, putting them in schools, is one of the leading thoughts. Having less natural sunlight is a thought. Whatever the real reason is, it's clear that myopia is going up around the world and that the world will need a better portfolio of products to address. High myopes, which run into problems later in life with retinal detachments and various other forms of eye challenges. So we're excited about it, but it's not going to be immediate. So we're looking beyond the next 5 years, I think, in terms of where it starts moving the needle."

The Vitality, you're right. $2.8 million, it was something like $1 million or maybe a little bit less last quarter. We had not called it out at that point. Now it's moved up to a point here where I think it's worthwhile to actually highlight and mention. It'll occur again, I think, probably a similar amount in Q4, probably again in Q1, and then it'll tail off. That transition's getting done. So I don't believe it's ever going to be that large of a number, but it's important enough, I think, from our perspective, to be transparent, kind of highlight that. If you look at the $3.2 million, the other income on there, a lot of that's going to be associated with foreign exchange, so that's going to be below-the-line FX gains on our intercompany loans. So we tend to see that fluctuate. You'll see the gain some quarters, see it as lot some quarters. That just kind of maneuvers around the currency. But that's what the majority of that would have been. If you look at our optimal capital structure, I guess, the way I'll say I look at it is, this quarter, our bank-defined net funded debt to EBITDA, which is the way I look at it, was 1.71x. So from a leverage perspective, we're probably a little bit on the light side right now. Obviously, we look at things like investing in the business. We look at acquisitions. We look at share buybacks and so forth. There's different avenues that enhance shareholder value. We'll continue to do that. I think that from a leverage perspective defined that way, if you start getting below 1.5x or, certainly, as you move towards 1 or lower, you're getting yourself kind of unlevered in today's low interest rate world. If you were going to move up towards north of 3 or, certainly, as you move towards 3.5, if you were to move that high, right, you'd have to raise a question mark on that as your leverage risk is going to go up."

263609,533264621,1290264,"The Cooper Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2017",2017-08-31,"Earnings Calls","The Cooper Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. This was another solid quarter with share gains, improving margins and strong cash flow. On a consolidated basis, we reported $556 million in revenue and non-",1026,"Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. This was another solid quarter with share gains, improving margins and strong cash flow. On a consolidated basis, we reported $556 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.64. 
CooperVision posted another strong quarter with 7% as reported revenue growth or up 8% in constant currency. Daily silicone hydrogel lenses grew 47%, while Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 10% both in constant currency.  CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 13%, up 4% pro forma and -- with fertility up 26% or 6% pro forma.
Moving to the details. CooperVision posted third quarter revenues of $437 million, up 8% in constant currency. By geography, the Americas grew 2%. EMEA grew 13%, and Asia Pacific grew 13%, all in constant currency. The Americas stands out as it was soft, but based on market data, the entire market was soft. We continue to see good shift data in the Americas. So it appears this was an anomaly, and we expect stronger growth in future quarters. Overall revenues continue to be driven by our silicone hydrogel lenses led by my MyDay and clariti in the daily space and Biofinity in the monthly space. Regarding dailies, our 2-tier approach with the daily silicone -- within the daily silicone hydrogel space allows doctors to offer premium and mass market lenses with the latest materials. MyDay is our premium daily silicone hydrogel lens and is offered as a very high-quality sphere and toric. Our clariti products are sold on a mass market basis and remain the only daily silicone hydrogel lens family with a sphere, a toric and a multifocal offering. In addition, clariti is competitively priced against several daily hydrogel products that we maintain a nice competitive advantage. Overall, we continue to believe wearers deserve the healthiest modality paired with the highest quality oxygen permeable materials to ensure the best health for the eye. This is done with daily lenses using silicone hydrogel lenses such as MyDay and clariti.
Moving to other products. Biofinity continues to perform extremely well all around the world. This includes a full product offering of spheres, torics and multifocals, along with our expanded offerings of Biofinity Energys and Biofinity XR toric. We continue to see diversified geographic strength from Biofinity and expect solid performance for many years to come.
Within the 2-week space, we're continuing to transition wearers to our upgraded Avaira Vitality lens from our legacy Avaira product. As we've discussed in the past, this is a large and time-consuming endeavor, but I'm happy to say our customers are receiving this upgrade very positively. Our timing remains the same, which is to finish the transition by roughly the end of fiscal 2018.
Turning to product categories. We remain the global leader in torics, which grew a solid 11% in constant currency, primarily driven by clariti 1-day toric and Biofinity toric, along with the rollout of MyDay toric in Europe. We believe there's still a lot of room for growth in this category both by modality and by geography.
Multifocals grew 7% in constant currency. We have a diversified set of products in this space and arguably the best multifocal design on the market with Biofinity Multifocal, so we expect continued growth. 
Turning to the global contact lens market. For calendar Q2, we grew 7% versus the market that was up 4%. This included growing faster than the market in each geography with the Americas growing 2% against the market up 1%, EMEA growing 11% versus the market up 6%, and Asia Pacific growing 12% versus the market up 8%.
By modality, single-use lenses continue driving growth with CVI up 14% and the market up 12%. And finally, CVI's non-single-use lenses grew 4%, while the market declined 3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision also reported very strong numbers, growing 8% versus the market up 4%. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth, driven by the continuing shift to improve technologies such as wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing trade up of -- to dailies and to specialty lenses, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base, particularly outside of the United States. And given our strength in these areas, along with our broad private label offering, we expect to continue growing faster than the market.
Turning to a different topic. We completed the acquisition of a small specialty contact lens company named Procornea in August. This added a leading ortho-k technology to our lens portfolio and increases access to several fast growing myopia control markets. This acquisition supports our specialty lens strategy led by our MiSight product. Myopia control is currently in its infancy, but we are developing a nice specialty lens platform to remain a leader as this market starts taking shape. Note, the financial terms of this acquisition were not disclosed.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported third quarter revenues of $119 million, up 13%, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 4% in fertility -- with fertility leading the way, up 26% or 6% pro forma. This quarter was important over the last -- an improvement over the last 2 quarters, and I believe Q4 will continue another step up in the right direction.
Within IVF, we're continuing to work through integration matters, but we're making progress. We're also continuing to execute on our growth strategy as the global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space. The IVF space remains a global market with long-term long growth dynamics -- strong growth dynamics, and we look forward to continuing our positive trends.
Our office and surgical products business grew 1% for the quarter with strength in our disposable hysteroscope, EndoSee, offset by weakness in the older product lines.
Before turning it over to Al, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for their hard work and dedication. I also want to especially send our best wishes to those impacted by the storm in Texas, including our employees located in that area.
And now I'll turn it over to Al."
263609,533264621,1290264,"The Cooper Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2017",2017-08-31,"Earnings Calls","The Cooper Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Most of my commentary will be in a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenue, so let me focus on the rest of the fina",906,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Most of my commentary will be in a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenue, so let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance.
For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were 64.8%, up nicely from 63.6% last year with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posting improved gross margins year-over-year. CooperVision's gross margin were 65.5%, up from 64.2% last year, driven by product mix shift gains and currency, partially offset by higher cost inventory tied to our annual plant shutdowns in fiscal Q1. As a reminder, our inventory turns through the P&L over 6 months, so our plant shutdowns in fiscal Q1 resulted in higher cost inventory turning through the P&L in our fiscal third quarter.
Bob mentioned the Avaira transition, and I want to comment quickly that we did experience higher sequential costs associated with switching patients from Avaira to Avaira Vitality mostly from writing off inventory. Having said that, we excluded these unique transition costs totaling $2.8 million for non-GAAP reporting purposes. To be clear, this is a very positive transition for us as we're providing a high-quality replacement product while realizing manufacturing improvements to significantly improve future gross margins. We expect we'll see most of this benefit in the back half of next year and into fiscal 2019.
CooperSurgical posted a nice bump in gross margins to 62.4%, up 120 basis points from 61.2% last year. These improvements were driven by success around our integration efforts within fertility along with the margin improvement in our base medical device business. Consolidated operating expenses grew 10.5% in the quarter, driven by investments throughout the company.
We've spent time in prior quarters discussing investments, including our sales force expansion, but I want to highlight that we expanded our investment activity this past quarter to include other parts of the business such as distribution. It's important to remember our revenue growth has been strong for many years, and we believe it will continue for many more years. As such, we need to ensure our infrastructure is capable of meeting our higher throughput and more stringent customer demand. Ensuring we maintain a strong global distribution platform is at the top of this list. Combining these investments with other areas such as sales and marketing, means SG&A spending will likely remain elevated.
Regarding the financial impact of this quarter and into the future, we use currency upside to support these investments, and we'll continue to do so. We had currency as a headwind for many years and tightened our belt, so it's nice to have currency as a tailwind to now support needed infrastructure investment.
Moving to operating income. We grew OI by 9.5% with operating margins improving to 25.9% from 25.6% last year. Below operating income, we reported $8.3 million of interest expense, and our effective tax rate was 6%, both in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP EPS was the $2.64 with roughly 49.6 million average shares outstanding.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total debt decreased $174 million in the quarter to approximately $1.21 billion. This pay down was driven by strong cash flow and a reduction in cash balances. Regarding cash flow, we posted $117 million of free cash comprised of roughly $150 million of operating cash flow offset by $30 million of CapEx.
Before moving to guidance, I want to mention that CooperVision has recently entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the class action complaints relating to UPP or Unilateral Pricing Policy. The settlement includes the payment of $3 million and is still subject to court approval. We have excluded the settlement accrual and related costs from our non-GAAP earnings.
Regarding guidance for fiscal Q4, we're guiding CooperVision revenues to $435 million to $445 million, up roughly 5% to 7.5% pro forma against the tough 11% comp. And note, I am highlighting pro forma rather than just constant currency as we're including the small revenue from CooperVision's Procornea acquisition in the prior quarter to provide a true organic growth rate. CooperSurgical's Q4 revenue guidance is $117 million to $120 million or roughly 3% to 6% pro forma. Regarding non-GAAP EPS, we're guiding to $2.60 to $2.70, off a roughly 9.5% effective tax rate. Within this guidance is an assumption that severe flooding in Texas negatively impacts CooperVision revenue by $2 million, CooperSurgical's revenue by $1 million and EPS by roughly $0.03.
On a full year basis, this translates to raising consolidated revenue guidance to $2.129 billion to $2.142 billion with CooperVision at $1.67 billion to $1.68 billion and CooperSurgical at $459 million to $462 million. We are also increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to $9.66 to $9.76.
Before concluding, I'd like to make a brief comment about next fiscal year. We are comfortable stating that we expect as reported non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the low double digits for fiscal 2018. This includes assumptions around the investments I discussed earlier. In other words, we anticipate using at least some of the recent positive currency tailwinds to support our continuing infrastructure expansion plan.
With that, let me conclude by saying we remain focused on expanding our business and gaining global market share while delivering consistent solid financial results, and this quarter was certainly another step in that direction.
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

It is true there are some competitors raising prices -- list prices. It's also true that as an industry we've been trading up -- we've been more about trading up. So 90% of the action of growth in the industry is trading up. Less than 10% has anything to do with pricing, and that's been that way forever, for 30 years. So pricing sometimes is a tactic. It allows you to do things as you are shifting wearers from a 2-week modality into a 1-day and a 1-month modality. So you may do something with your list prices. At the end of the day, it's the net growth that matters. It's the trading up that matters, and I would say, pricing is nothing more than a minor tactic in achieving whatever you're trying to do. The industry has done a phenomenal job of moving now people out of the 2-week space into the monthly -- into the 1-day space. The growth of the industry in the last 4 years plus has been the 1-day modality in the U.S. and for the last 10 years, it's been the 1-day modality outside the U.S. So I'm not going to comment too much more on the granularity of pricing tactics."

We had about $0.06 -- $0.16, I'm sorry, $0.16 benefit from FX this quarter, and when we look at Q4, we have about a $0.12 FX benefit, so some nice benefit coming from currency in Q3 and Q4. We obviously invested a lot of that, and as I talked about, we're taking the opportunity here to do some upgrades, especially within distribution, throughout the business to ensure we meet customer demands going forward. And I -- there really wasn't much else there.

We're still under indexed against all of our primary competitors and even a smaller competitor. Having said that, the productivity, I think, is reflective in the fact that we continue to grow twice the market, so we're getting a lot of results out of that expanded feet on the street. It does take 9 to 12 months to have a salesperson fully productive, so we're still marching up that curve very nicely. It's a global expansion. It's not only the U.S., so we continue to fund Asia Pacific, has largely been a bootstrap ""pay as you go"" basis but it's hire as many as you need to continue to expand your coverage in Asia Pac.

Since they have adopted that strategy, really, when they came out with the 1-week product and then the 1-day product, meaning a 1-week OASYS and then a 1-day OASYS, they have really accelerated the depth of that 2-week space, and we find that good. We are getting our fair share. Obviously, we -- when you look at the clariti and MyDay numbers, 47% growth over a higher base, so year-after-year, that base goes up, and it continues to grow very impressively.

It would not surprise me if next year's CapEx is -- I would be surprised if it's not higher. Certainly could be in that $150 million to $200 million range depending upon what we do. As I mentioned, distribution, as an example, wouldn't surprise me if we have new distribution facility, as an example, in each business next year. So I could see -- certainly see CapEx being higher next year. On the flip side, our operating cash flow will continue to grow and year-over-year free cash flow continue to improve.

I mean, one theory is that it was via stocking a year ago, and that's just kind of rolling out. So can you give us any color as to why you're confident that the market will recover? It's not just a J&J phenomenon. Obviously, your results in the Americas have also been depressed, so a little bit more color on that would be helpful. And then second, for Al, you talked about EPS, but you didn't talk about sales. Consensus right now is about 7% on the top line. I'm assuming that's underlying excluding currency.

On the Americas, our confidence really goes back to -- if we look at it from a 4-year perspective, the Americas has done well, more like 4%, and we do have the acceleration of the trading up. And keep in mind, I've mentioned in the past, that a trade up of an OASYS noncompliant wearer is a 800% trade up to an OASYS 1-day compliant wearer, so a 2-week noncompliant who's wearing it as a monthly and buying it in a -- it's available on a 2-year supply because they buy a 1-year supply at 2 weeks, which turns into a 2-year supply on a monthly basis. They then shift to buying 730 lenses, and they're very compliant because they don't have lens care regimens and all that stuff. So we're highly confident that once you get through the noise level of everything that's gone on, including just how much J&J sells the pipeline in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, that kind of created anomalies throughout the next periods and to and including some of the antics of going direct, trying to go around the middleman and to and including some of the consolidation going on with partnerships of the large retailers. So there's a lot of moving parts, but underlying that is a market that looks very healthy from a wearer perspective and a trading up perspective. So we're highly confident we'll see normalized correlation between that shift and the revenue line in the future."

Making the statement that we're comfortable saying low double digits and use 11% as the midpoint, you could argue that, that's conservative, and certainly, when you look at our Q4 guidance here of 14% to 18% as reported, we obviously strive for stronger numbers. At this point in time though, it's still months and months and months away from next year in giving guidance.

The base is, though, yes, there's a lot of legacy products there. So EndoSee, as Bob mentioned, our disposable hysteroscope, is doing really well, and we're continuing to make a lot of progress there, but some of the base products are a little bit harder to get moving there. So I still think that business is more along the lines of a 3%, 4%, 5% maybe kind of growth business, that component -- that base business component of it. So that was a little bit lighter. It's hard to get into any individual quarter and pinpoint a specific issue associated with it, but I do think you'll see a little bit of improvement on that in Q4 also."

I think you're right that the rebating activity has increased, and that makes sense when you think about what we're doing as an industry, moving from the 2-week space and trying to provide that incentive to a new fit in the 1-day modality. So there's a lot of energy being spent on try it, you'll like it. If we can get you there to try it, once you realize how convenient it is, you'll probably stay and not go back ever again because it's just too convenient. And I speak as a user, not -- I'm not only as a -- a user who used to clean lenses every day. So I don't worry about cleaning lenses every day. I just throw them away every day. So the strategy of rebating and creating that extra incentive to say, hey, net-net-net this is not too expensive right now, keep in mind there's a list price. Now list price is getting higher and higher relative to the net. And so I can net out, take my money I'm spending on lens care and shift it into the 1-day modality and feel real good about that and the convenience. Lo and behold down the road, it could be that the rebates start diminishing once you're a new fit and no longer a new fit but a re-user. Who knows what will happen? So I think more important to have your list price, the list price of that car, the list price of the hotel room, I don't care what list price you're talking about, where you suddenly provide $1,000 list and a $500 refund, well, it's a $1,000 list in -- in a $1,000 bill certain times.

So when we gave guidance last quarter, we saw the currency strength already. As a matter of fact, when we guided, we guided with some relatively conservative FX rates. And we were getting in front of especially distribution. It's the best example I can give. You guys have heard -- you've done survey work and you have heard us some distribution issues, and we've talked about them in the past. We have a lot more volume going through our distribution centers. A lot of our business is driven by daily growth. We have customers who are demanding a higher level of excellence when it comes to shipping. That's both true within Vision and Surgical. Our businesses are both growing and growing pretty consistently. So we are getting in front of that, and we started that at the beginning of last quarter. Now it's much easier to do that, so to speak, and report good numbers when you have currency at your back.

We have a lot of momentum, a lot of really good products. We're going to continue to invest dollars in both business to drive market share gains. So you're going to see that, and when you look at how much, some of that, frankly, to be honest with you, gets dependent upon currency.

Relative to whether or not and to what degree that will allow us to accelerate our overall franchise in China, I would assume, yes, there will be some benefits, but quite frankly, a lot of what makes -- what's okay and what Procornea is about in myopia control is pretty much in the hands of a specialty area where people really focus in on what it takes to slow the progress of myopia, particularly in the younger generation -- the younger part of the generation. So I don't think there's a real lot of spill over there. We are tremendously excited about the space, but we also are realistic enough to say this is going to be a long-haul development. Myopia is going up around the world significantly. It's gone from basically 20% of the world and is -- will be approaching 50% of the population by 2050, and directionally, it's clearly headed that way. What's causing it very much is taking people off the rural areas, the countryside, putting them in schools, is one of the leading thoughts. Having less natural sunlight is a thought. Whatever the real reason is, it's clear that myopia is going up around the world and that the world will need a better portfolio of products to address high myopes, which run into problems later in life with retinal detachments and various other forms of eye challenges. So we're excited about it, but it's not going to be immediate. So we're looking beyond the next 5 years, I think, in terms of where it starts moving the needle."

Now it's moved up to a point here where I think it's worthwhile to actually highlight and mention. It'll occur again, I think, probably a similar amount in Q4, probably again in Q1, and then it'll tail off. That transition's getting done. So I don't believe it's ever going to be that large of a number, but it's important enough, I think, from our perspective, to be transparent, kind of highlight that. If you look at the $3.2 million, the other income on there, a lot of that's going to be associated with foreign exchange, so that's going to be below-the-line FX gains on our intercompany loans. So we tend to see that fluctuate. You'll see it as a gain some quarters, see it as a loss some quarters. That just kind of maneuvers around with currency. But that's what the majority of that would have been. If you look at our optimal capital structure, I guess, the way I'll say I look at it is, this quarter, our bank-defined net funded debt to EBITDA, which is the way I look at it, was 1.71x. So from a leverage perspective, we're probably a little bit on the light side right now. Obviously, we look at things like investing in the business. We look at acquisitions. We look at share buybacks and so forth, as different avenues that enhance shareholder value. We'll continue to do that. I think that from a leverage perspective defined that way, if you start getting below 1.5x or, certainly, as you move towards 1 or lower, you're getting yourself kind of unlevered in today's low interest rate world. If you were going to move up towards north of 3 or, certainly, as you move towards 3.5, if you were to move that high, right, you'd have to raise a question mark on that as your leverage risk is going to go up."

263609,533264621,1290371,"The Cooper Companies, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 31, 2017",2017-08-31,"Earnings Calls","The Cooper Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. This was another solid quarter with share gains, improving margins and strong cash flow. On a consolidated basis, we reported $556 million in revenue and non-",1026,"Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. This was another solid quarter with share gains, improving margins and strong cash flow. On a consolidated basis, we reported $556 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.64. 
CooperVision posted another strong quarter with 7% as reported revenue growth or up 8% in constant currency. Daily silicone hydrogel lenses grew 47%, while Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 10% both in constant currency.  CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 13%, up 4% pro forma and -- with fertility up 26% or 6% pro forma.
Moving to the details. CooperVision posted third quarter revenues of $437 million, up 8% in constant currency. By geography, the Americas grew 2%. EMEA grew 13%, and Asia Pacific grew 13%, all in constant currency. The Americas stands out as it was soft, but based on market data, the entire market was soft. We continue to see good shift data in the Americas. So it appears this was an anomaly, and we expect stronger growth in future quarters. Overall revenues continue to be driven by our silicone hydrogel lenses led by my MyDay and clariti in the daily space and Biofinity in the monthly space. Regarding dailies, our 2-tier approach with the daily silicone -- within the daily silicone hydrogel space allows doctors to offer premium and mass market lenses with the latest materials. MyDay is our premium daily silicone hydrogel lens and is offered as a very high-quality sphere and toric. Our clariti products are sold on a mass market basis and remain the only daily silicone hydrogel lens family with a sphere, a toric and a multifocal offering. In addition, clariti is competitively priced against several daily hydrogel products that we maintain a nice competitive advantage. Overall, we continue to believe wearers deserve the healthiest modality paired with the highest quality oxygen permeable materials to ensure the best health for the eye. This is done with daily lenses using silicone hydrogel lenses such as MyDay and clariti.
Moving to other products. Biofinity continues to perform extremely well all around the world. This includes a full product offering of spheres, torics and multifocals, along with our expanded offerings of Biofinity Energys and Biofinity XR toric. We continue to see diversified geographic strength from Biofinity and expect solid performance for many years to come.
Within the 2-week space, we're continuing to transition wearers to our upgraded Avaira Vitality lens from our legacy Avaira product. As we've discussed in the past, this is a large and time-consuming endeavor, but I'm happy to say our customers are receiving this upgrade very positively. Our timing remains the same, which is to finish the transition by roughly the end of fiscal 2018.
Turning to product categories. We remain the global leader in torics, which grew a solid 11% in constant currency, primarily driven by clariti 1-day toric and Biofinity toric, along with the rollout of MyDay toric in Europe. We believe there's still a lot of room for growth in this category both by modality and by geography.
Multifocals grew 7% in constant currency. We have a diversified set of products in this space and arguably the best multifocal design on the market with Biofinity Multifocal, so we expect continued growth. 
Turning to the global contact lens market. For calendar Q2, we grew 7% versus the market that was up 4%. This included growing faster than the market in each geography with the Americas growing 2% against the market up 1%, EMEA growing 11% versus the market up 6%, and Asia Pacific growing 12% versus the market up 8%.
By modality, single-use lenses continue driving growth with CVI up 14% and the market up 12%. And finally, CVI's non-single-use lenses grew 4%, while the market declined 3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision also reported very strong numbers, growing 8% versus the market up 4%. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth, driven by the continuing shift to improve technologies such as wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing trade up of -- to dailies and to specialty lenses, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base, particularly outside of the United States. And given our strength in these areas, along with our broad private label offering, we expect to continue growing faster than the market.
Turning to a different topic. We completed the acquisition of a small specialty contact lens company named Procornea in August. This added a leading ortho-k technology to our lens portfolio and increases access to several fast growing myopia control markets. This acquisition supports our specialty lens strategy led by our MiSight product. Myopia control is currently in its infancy, but we are developing a nice specialty lens platform to remain a leader as this market starts taking shape. Note, the financial terms of this acquisition were not disclosed.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported third quarter revenues of $119 million, up 13%, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 4% in fertility -- with fertility leading the way, up 26% or 6% pro forma. This quarter was important over the last -- an improvement over the last 2 quarters, and I believe Q4 will continue another step up in the right direction.
Within IVF, we're continuing to work through integration matters, but we're making progress. We're also continuing to execute on our growth strategy as the global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space. The IVF space remains a global market with long-term long growth dynamics -- strong growth dynamics, and we look forward to continuing our positive trends.
Our office and surgical products business grew 1% for the quarter with strength in our disposable hysteroscope, EndoSee, offset by weakness in the older product lines.
Before turning it over to Al, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for their hard work and dedication. I also want to especially send our best wishes to those impacted by the storm in Texas, including our employees located in that area.
And now I'll turn it over to Al."

Most of my commentary will be in a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenue, so let me focus on the rest of the fina",906,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Most of my commentary will be in a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenue, so let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance.
For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were 64.8%, up nicely from 63.6% last year with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posting improved gross margins year-over-year. CooperVision's gross margin were 65.5%, up from 64.2% last year, driven by product mix shift gains and currency, partially offset by higher cost inventory tied to our annual plant shutdowns in fiscal Q1. As a reminder, our inventory turns through the P&L over 6 months, so our plant shutdowns in fiscal Q1 resulted in higher cost inventory turning through the P&L in our fiscal third quarter.
Bob mentioned the Avaira transition, and I want to comment quickly that we did experience higher sequential costs associated with switching patients from Avaira to Avaira Vitality mostly from writing off inventory. Having said that, we excluded these unique transition costs totaling $2.8 million for non-GAAP reporting purposes. To be clear, this is a very positive transition for us as we're providing a high-quality replacement product while realizing manufacturing improvements to significantly improve future gross margins. We expect we'll see most of this benefit in the back half of next year and into fiscal 2019.
CooperSurgical posted a nice bump in gross margins to 62.4%, up 120 basis points from 61.2% last year. These improvements were driven by success around our integration efforts within fertility along with the margin improvement in our base medical device business. Consolidated operating expenses grew 10.5% in the quarter, driven by investments throughout the company.
We've spent time in prior quarters discussing investments, including our sales force expansion, but I want to highlight that we expanded our investment activity this past quarter to include other parts of the business such as distribution. It's important to remember our revenue growth has been strong for many years, and we believe it will continue for many more years. As such, we need to ensure our infrastructure is capable of meeting our higher throughput and more stringent customer demand. Ensuring we maintain a strong global distribution platform is at the top of this list. Combining these investments with other areas such as sales and marketing, means SG&A spending will likely remain elevated.
Regarding the financial impact of this quarter and into the future, we use currency upside to support these investments, and we'll continue to do so. We had currency as a headwind for many years and tightened our belt, so it's nice to have currency as a tailwind to now support needed infrastructure investment.
Moving to operating income. We grew OI by 9.5% with operating margins improving to 25.9% from 25.6% last year. Below operating income, we reported $8.3 million of interest expense, and our effective tax rate was 6%, both in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP EPS was the $2.64 with roughly 49.6 million average shares outstanding.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total debt decreased $174 million in the quarter to approximately $1.21 billion. This pay down was driven by strong cash flow and a reduction in cash balances. Regarding cash flow, we posted $117 million of free cash comprised of roughly $150 million of operating cash flow offset by $30 million of CapEx.
Before moving to guidance, I want to mention that CooperVision has recently entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the class action complaints relating to UPP or Unilateral Pricing Policy. The settlement includes the payment of $3 million and is still subject to court approval. We have excluded the settlement accrual and related costs from our non-GAAP earnings.
Regarding guidance for fiscal Q4, we're guiding CooperVision revenues to $435 million to $445 million, up roughly 5% to 7.5% pro forma against the tough 11% comp. And note, I am highlighting pro forma rather than just constant currency as we're including the small revenue from CooperVision's Procornea acquisition in the prior quarter to provide a true organic growth rate. CooperSurgical's Q4 revenue guidance is $117 million to $120 million or roughly 3% to 6% pro forma. Regarding non-GAAP EPS, we're guiding to $2.60 to $2.70, off a roughly 9.5% effective tax rate. Within this guidance is an assumption that severe flooding in Texas negatively impacts CooperVision revenue by $2 million, CooperSurgical's revenue by $1 million and EPS by roughly $0.03.
On a full year basis, this translates to raising consolidated revenue guidance to $2.129 billion to $2.142 billion with CooperVision at $1.67 billion to $1.68 billion and CooperSurgical at $459 million to $462 million. We are also increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to $9.66 to $9.76.
Before concluding, I'd like to make a brief comment about next fiscal year. We are comfortable stating that we expect as reported non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the low double digits for fiscal 2018. This includes assumptions around the investments I discussed earlier. In other words, we anticipate using at least some of the recent positive currency tailwinds to support our continuing infrastructure expansion plan.
With that, let me conclude by saying we remain focused on expanding our business and gaining global market share while delivering consistent solid financial results, and this quarter was certainly another step in that direction.
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

It is true there are some competitors raising prices -- list prices. It's also true that as an industry we've been trading up -- we've been more about trading up. So 90% of the action of growth in the industry is trading up. Less than 10% has anything to do with pricing, and that's been that way forever, for 30 years. So pricing sometimes is a tactic. It allows you to do things as you are shifting wearers from a 2-week modality into a 1-day and a 1-month modality. So you may do something with your list prices. At the end of the day, it's the net growth that matters. It's the trading up that matters, and I would say, pricing is nothing more than a minor tactic in achieving whatever you're trying to do. The industry has done a phenomenal job of moving now people out of the 2-week space into the monthly -- into the 1-day space. The growth of the industry in the last 4 years plus has been the 1-day modality in the U.S. and for the last 10 years, it's been the 1-day modality outside the U.S. So I'm not going to comment too much more on the granularity of pricing tactics."

From an FX perspective, that's a little bit of a different story. We had about $0.06 -- $0.16, I'm sorry, $0.16 benefit from FX this quarter, and when we look at Q4, we have about a $0.12 FX benefit, so some nice benefit coming from currency in Q3 and Q4. We obviously invested a lot of that, and as I talked about, we're taking the opportunity here to do some upgrades, especially within distribution, throughout the business to ensure we meet customer demands going forward. And I -- there really wasn't much else there.

We're still under indexed against all of our primary competitors and even a smaller competitor. Having said that, the productivity, I think, is reflective in the fact that we continue to grow twice the market, so we're getting a lot of results out of that expanded feet on the street. It does take 9 to 12 months to have a salesperson fully productive, so we're still marching up that curve very nicely. It's a global expansion. It's not only the U.S., so we continue to fund Asia Pacific, has largely been a bootstrap ""pay as you go"" basis but it's hire as many as you need to continue to expand your coverage in Asia Pac.

We've been putting up pretty good Biofinity numbers, so yes, some of them are leaving for the monthly category. I applaud the efforts that J&J has in that arena. They are about 90% of that market or a little more. So that's the wearer base, and we want that wearer base, and they know it, out of the 2-week space into other spaces and primarily the 1-day modality. Since they have adopted that strategy, really, when they came out with the 1-week product and then the 1-day product, meaning a 1-week OASYS and then a 1-day OASYS, they have really accelerated the depth of that 2-week space, and we find that good. We are getting our fair share. Obviously, we -- when you look at the clariti and MyDay numbers, 47% growth over a higher base, so year-after-year, that base goes up, and it continues to grow very impressively. And clearly, the U.S. is a big part of that growth because of that shift from the 2 week into the 1 day space."

It would not surprise me if next year's CapEx is -- I would be surprised if it's not higher. Certainly could be in that $150 million to $200 million range depending upon what we do. As I mentioned, distribution, as an example, wouldn't surprise me if we have new distribution facility, as an example, in each business next year. So I could see -- certainly see CapEx being higher next year. On the flip side, our operating cash flow will continue to grow and year-over-year free cash flow continue to improve. So fiscal '17, strong close to the year should result in strong free cash flow fiscal '18. Even with a higher CapEx, if we have it, it's going to be an even stronger free cash flow year is what I'd say at this point."

And then second, for Al, you talked about EPS, but you didn't talk about sales. Consensus right now is about 7% on the top line. I'm assuming that's underlying excluding currency.

And keep in mind, I've mentioned in the past, that a trade up of an OASYS noncompliant wearer is a 800% trade up to an OASYS 1-day compliant wearer, so a 2-week noncompliant who's wearing it as a monthly and buying it in a -- it's available on a 2-year supply because they buy a 1-year supply at 2 weeks, which turns into a 2-year supply on a monthly basis. They then shift to buying 730 lenses, and they're very compliant because they don't have lens care regimens and all that stuff. So we're highly confident that once you get through the noise level of everything that's gone on, including just how much J&J sells the pipeline in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, that kind of created anomalies throughout the next periods and to and including some of the antics of going direct, trying to go around the middleman and to and including some of the consolidation going on with partnerships of the large retailers. So there's a lot of moving parts, but underlying that is a market that looks very healthy from a wearer perspective and a trading up perspective. So we're highly confident we'll see normalized correlation between that shift and the revenue line in the future."

Making the statement that we're comfortable saying low double digits and use 11% as the midpoint, you could argue that, that's conservative, and certainly, when you look at our Q4 guidance here of 14% to 18% as reported, we obviously strive for stronger numbers.

So EndoSee, as Bob mentioned, our disposable hysteroscope, is doing really well, and we're continuing to make a lot of progress there, but some of the base products are a little bit harder to get moving there. So I still think that business is more along the lines of a 3%, 4%, 5% maybe kind of growth business, that component -- that base business component of it. So that was a little bit lighter. It's hard to get into any individual quarter and pinpoint a specific issue associated with it, but I do think you'll see a little bit of improvement on that in Q4 also."

I think you're right that the rebating activity has increased, and that makes sense when you think about what we're doing as an industry, moving from the 2-week space and trying to provide that incentive to a new fit in the 1-day modality. So there's a lot of energy being spent on try it, you'll like it. If we can get you there to try it, once you realize how convenient it is, you'll probably stay and not go back ever again because it's just too convenient. And I speak as a user, not -- I'm not only as a -- a user who used to clean lenses every day. So I don't worry about cleaning lenses every day. I just throw them away every day. So the strategy of rebating and creating that extra incentive to say, hey, net-net-net this is not too expensive right now, keep in mind there's a list price. Now list price is getting higher and higher relative to the net. And so I can net out, take my money I'm spending on lens care and shift it into the 1-day modality and feel real good about that and the convenience. Lo and behold down the road, it could be that the rebates start diminishing once you're a new fit and no longer a new fit but a re-user. Who knows what will happen? So I think more important to have your list price, the list price of that car, the list price of the hotel room, I don't care what list price you're talking about, where you suddenly provide $1,000 list and a $500 refund, well, it's a $1,000 list in -- in a $1,000 bill certain times.

So when we gave guidance last quarter, we saw the currency strength already. As a matter of fact, when we guided, we guided with some relatively conservative FX rates. And we were getting in front of especially distribution. It's the best example I can give. You guys have heard -- you've done survey work and you have heard us some distribution issues, and we've talked about them in the past. We have a lot more volume going through our distribution centers. A lot of our business is driven by daily growth. We have customers who are demanding a higher level of excellence when it comes to shipping. That's both true within Vision and Surgical. Our businesses are both growing and growing pretty consistently. So we are getting in front of that, and we started that at the beginning of last quarter. Now it's much easier to do that, so to speak, and report good numbers when you have currency at your back.

So you're going to see that, and when you look at how much, some of that, frankly, to be honest with you, gets dependent upon currency.

So I don't think there's a real lot of spill over there. We are tremendously excited about the space, but we also are realistic enough to say this is going to be a long-haul development. Myopia is going up around the world significantly. It's gone from basically 20% of the world and is -- will be approaching 50% of the population by 2050, and directionally, it's clearly headed that way. What's causing it very much is taking people off the rural areas, the countryside, putting them in schools, is one of the leading thoughts. Having less natural sunlight is a thought. Whatever the real reason is, it's clear that myopia is going up around the world and that the world will need a better portfolio of products to address high myopes, which run into problems later in life with retinal detachments and various other forms of eye challenges.

If you look at our optimal capital structure, I guess, the way I'll say I look at it is, this quarter, our bank-defined net funded debt to EBITDA, which is the way I look at it, was 1.71x. So from a leverage perspective, we're probably a little bit on the light side right now. Obviously, we look at things like investing in the business. We look at acquisitions. We look at share buybacks and so forth, as different avenues that enhance shareholder value. We'll continue to do that. I think that from a leverage perspective defined that way, if you start getting below 1.5x or, certainly, as you move towards 1 or lower, you're getting yourself kind of unlevered in today's low interest rate world. If you were going to move up towards north of 3 or, certainly, as you move towards 3.5, if you were to move that high, right, you'd have to raise a question mark on that as your leverage risk is going to go up."

I'm proud of the team and the -- and",1171,"Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call. This was an exciting year, and we finished with a record revenues, earnings per share and free cash flow. I'm proud of the team and the -- and everything we've accomplished and believe we're set for a strong fiscal 2018. 
For the quarter, we reported $562 million in consolidated revenue, up 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.65, up 16%, and free cash flow was a very strong $167 million. 
CooperVision posted fourth quarter revenues of $439 million, up 7% as reported, up 5% pro forma. Dailies silicone hydrogel saw growth up 37% in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenues of $123 million, up 15% as reported, up 7% pro forma. Fertility drove growth up 28%, or up 7% pro forma. 
Moving to the details for CooperVision. This was a solid quarter given tough comps and some hurricane disruption. By geography, the Americas grew 2%; EMEA grew 5%; and Asia Pacific grew 10%, all pro forma. The Americas saw solid growth in August, followed by weakness in September and October. There was some negative impact from the hurricanes during the time, which we estimate at roughly at $2 million or 1%. Regardless, our total share shift in the Americas continues to be better than the revenue growth, indicating we're taking on Eye share. Regarding EMEA and Asia Pac, both had solid quarters, especially considering the difficult comps. We continue to gain share in both regions on diversified geographic basis, which bodes well for continued growth. Overall, revenues continues to be driven by our silicone hydrogel lenses, led by clariti and MyDay in the dailies space and the Biofinity in the monthly space. Our tiered approach within the daily silicone hydrogen space continues to prove successful. We are expanding our offerings geographically and have recently started exceeding the U.S. market with MyDay toric fitting sets, with a full launch to come soon. MyDay toric have been received incredibly well internationally due to its very comfortable design, and we expect a similar response in the U.S. Our clariti 1-day products continue to perform extremely well as the only silicone hydrogen family with a toric and a multifocal offering.
Moving to our other products, our Biofinity and the Avaira family of lenses combined to grow 7% pro forma. Biofinity continued to perform very well with diversified growth around the world. Avaira declined slightly. Our focus remained on transitioning whereas to our upgraded Avaira Vitality lenses, which we anticipate completing by the end of this fiscal year. We did experience some Avaira disruption associated with the hurricane in Puerto Rico, but our team did a phenomenal job responding to that challenge and the impact was minimal. 
Turning to product categories. We remained global leader in torics, which grew 7% pro forma driven by clariti and Biofinity, along with the rollout of MyDay toric in Europe. We continue to believe the toric market will grow faster than the overall market, and we will share in that growth given our strong portfolio and the addition of MyDay toric in the U.S. Multifocals grew 4% pro forma with the strength coming from clariti and Biofinity. 
Turning to the global contact lens market. For calendar Q3, we grew 7% with the market also up 7%. This included growing faster than the market in EMEA, up 6% versus the market up 4%, and Asia Pacific, up 15% versus the market, up 9%. The Americas grew 4% with the market up 7%. By modality, CooperVision grew single-use lenses 15% versus the market up 13%. And finally, CVI's non-single-use lenses grew 3%, while the market grew 1%. 
Overall, Q3 was a good quarter for both CooperVision and the market. Although the market was against ECS tops. In particularly, the top for the America market was specially ECS, it was down 3% last year's third quarter. CooperVision have more difficult 3% comp. On a trailing 12-month basis, we took share throughout the world growing 8% versus the market up 5%. 
Going forward, we're still targeting 4% to 6% market growth driven by continuing shift to improve technology, such as a wider use of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing trade-up to dailies and specialty lenses, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base. And given our strength in these areas, along with the broad private label offering, we expect to continue growing faster than the market.
Regarding other CooperVision activity, we've completed the acquisition of Paragon Vision Sciences on December 1 for Approximately $80 million. Paragon is a specialty lens business with a particular focus on ortho-k contact lens. This acquisition allows us -- follows our recent acquisition of Procornea, another specialty company that we've acquired in August. In combination with our MiSight product for the management of myopia, we are developing a nice specialty lens platform to ensure we'll remain well connected with opinion leaders and technology -- and/or technology leader in this space.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported a strong quarter with Q4 revenues of $123 million, up 15%, driven by organic growth in acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 7%, with fertility leading the way, up 28% or 12% pro forma. It was nice seeing the strength in fertility as the integration disruptions are starting to get behind us. As I mentioned before, we are a global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space, which is a global market with strong long-term growth dynamics. Our office and surgical business grew 2% for the quarter with strength in EndoSee, our disposable hysteroscope, offset by weakness in other product lines. Regarding our CooperSurgical activity, we recently completed the acquisition of PARAGARD IUD from Teva, which closed on November 1 for approximately $1.1 billion. PARAGARD is the only IUD on the U.S. market that is hormone-free, long-lasting and reversible. In fact, its hormone-free is especially important. As you may have heard, there was a major story release yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine, showing women using birth control pills and IUDs that release hormones face a higher risk of breast cancer than women who have never used hormone or contraception. This study was completed over a 10-year period following 1.8 million women. Given PARAGARD is the non-hormonal IUD option in the U.S., and CooperSurgical has the resources and experience to ensure millions of women across the country are aware of this important distinction, I'm very excited about growth potential here.
I'll let Al get into the financial detail but, as you can tell, I'm very bullish about PARAGARD as product and as a strategic fit within CooperSurgical. And finally, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for their hard work and dedication. We continue to post record results, and this wouldn't be possible without them. I'd like to especially thank employees in Puerto Rico, whose vacation and perseverance through the Hurricane Maria was something very special. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Al."

Most of my commentary will be in a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenue, so let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance.
For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were 65.9%, up nicely from 64.3% last year. CooperVision's gross margin was 67.7%, up from 64.8% last year, driven primarily by currency and product mix gains. CooperSurgical's gross margin was 59.6%, down from 62.5% last year, driven by lower genomic pricing and certain inventory write-offs and charges on legacy products. Also within CooperSurgical, we recently purchased an existing manufacturing facility in Costa Rica to consolidate a significant portion of our global manufacturing. We've made a lot of progress upgrading the facility and hiring key employees and plan to begin production of the wall-less transfer catheter in the near future. This should provide a very nice opportunity to reduce costs and improve margins in the coming years. 
Moving to expenses. Consolidated operating expenses grew 7% in the quarter, slightly less than revenue. The expense growth was driven by investments throughout the company, including additions to the sales force and distribution. We continue to enhance our sales force by selectively hiring around the world, while also continuing to upgrade our infrastructure, including distribution. 
Moving to operating income. We grew 17.2% with operating margins improving to 27.2% from 25.1% last year. Both businesses reported strong operating margin improvement with CooperVision growing 14.7% to 31.1%, driven by a gross margin improvement. While CooperSurgical improved 15.4% to 22.4%, driven by operating expense leverage.
Below operating income, we reported $7.9 million of interest expense, a $1.5 million FX loss and an effective tax rate of 8.1%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.65 with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding. We posted $167 million of free cash flow comprised of roughly $199 million of operating cash flow, offset by $32 million of CapEx. Total debt declined roughly $41 million to $1.173 billion, supported by cash flow generation and an increase in cash balances, offset by our acquisition of Procornea in August and $25 million of stock buybacks in October. 
Regarding full year fiscal 2017 results, consolidated revenues were $2.139 billion, up 9% or 7% pro forma. CooperVision revenues were $1.674 billion, up 6% or 7% pro forma and CooperSurgical's revenues were $464.9 million, up 19% or 4% pro forma. Non-GAAP EPS was $9.70, up 15%, and free cash flow was very strong at $466 million. 
Before moving to guidance, let me quickly add a reminder that we announced on November 1 a new $1.425 billion 5-year senior unsecured term loan, which matures November 1, 2022. The facility was used to fund the PARAGARD acquisition and reduce our revolver borrowings, allowing greater flexibility for general corporate purposes, including the recent funding of the Paragon acquisition. 
Moving to fiscal 2018. We're guiding the consolidated revenues of $2.48 billion to $2.53 billion, which is comprised of $1.83 billion to $1.87 billion at CooperVision, or roughly 9% to 11% as reported growth, 6% to 8% pro forma growth, and $650 million to $665 million at CooperSurgical are roughly 40% to 43% as reported growth, 2% to 4% pro forma growth. CooperSurgical revenue guidance assumes roughly $170 million for PARAGARD, which is slightly lower than originally expected with a negative impact coming entirely in fiscal Q1 due to higher-than-expected channel inventory. We're not providing detailed quarterly guidance, but to help model this, we expect Q1 revenues for consolidated CooperSurgical to be around $150 million, with PARAGARD being roughly $34 million of that. This $34 million would be a year-over-year decline of roughly 25%. This unusual activity is related to a price increase, which resulted in a significantly higher channel inventory in September, but then also, unexpectedly, in the month of October, the month before we closed the acquisition. 
Subsequent to Q1, we expect PARAGARD to do roughly $135 million to $138 million during Q2 to Q4, which equates to upper single-digit growth, driven by the price increase and underlying unit growth.
Note, we have not included any potential upside from the new study Bob mentioned in the New England Journal of Medicine. We still expect to meet or exceed our targeted EPS accretion of $0.70 to $0.75 for PARAGARD for the full year. And including PARAGARD, on a consolidated basis, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $11.35 to $11.65, up 17% to 20% based on 49.8 million shares outstanding. 
Moving to details within the P&L. We expect fiscal 2018 gross margin to improve to around 68%. Operating margins are expected to improve to around 28%, and this includes a negative $3 million impact from the reintroduction of the 2.3% medical device tax -- excise tax beginning in January. This tax only impacts our domestic CooperSurgical business, excluding PARAGARD, which is treated as a pharmaceutical product.
Interest expense is expected to be around $68 million, which includes the additional debt from the PARAGARD and Paragon acquisitions, and the assumption of a 25 basis point rate increase this month. 
Regarding taxes. There's obviously a lot of activity with several bill spending at the house and the Senate, so let me add a caveat that my commentary is based on unfinished tax legislation that could change materially. Given our fiscal year ended in October, many of the proposed tax reform provisions will not be effective for us until fiscal 2019. So we're assuming an effective tax rate of 11% for our fiscal 2018 guidance. Having said that, the proposed tax reform does include a few provision of that would impact us in fiscal '18, with the most material being the mandatory repatriation of previously deferred earnings. That being said, we would exclude these types of one-time P&L charges from our non-GAAP EPS to allow clear comparability of year-over-year results. Reporting my disclaimer that there's still a lot of moving parts, we currently see risk to our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 and beyond to the mid-teens, from items such as the minimum tax on foreign income.
Lastly on guidance, excluding any impact from unknown nontax matters, we expect free cash flow to be similar to this year, but with CapEx around $175 million. The higher CapEx is mostly due to carryover from fiscal 2017 due to lower-than-expected spending in Q4 as our manufacturing team dealt with the hurricane in Puerto Rico. 
With that, let me conclude by saying we remain focused on expanding our businesses and gaining global market share, while delivering consistent, solid financial results. This quarter and this year were another step in that direction, and we look forward to reporting results as we work through fiscal 2018. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

If we look at -- first of all, if we look at this coming fiscal year, fiscal '18 that we're in right now, most of the tax reform, again, won't impact us. So if we look at fiscal 2019 and beyond, that's where you start",210,"Yes. So a couple of comments on that.

Solid-state 15s, just so we're working off a number. If we take a look at where we have been in the past and yet PARAGARD which is fairly significant U.S. income associated with that, obviously, higher U.S. taxes associated with that, that moves up towards the 11% this year, and then the other tax changes move us up to the 15%, keeping in mind that under that scenario, PARAGARD is actually a positive because the positive tax rate is a positive for PARAGARD and in our CooperSurgical business. So that's kind of the flow. I mean, as you can imagine, as you know, there's a lot of that goes into that, but at this point in time based on the measures of that are out there, that's where we see taxes coming up."

We also felt good about on Eye even though the market from the point of view of what we sold into the market was a little lighter than what was the on eye activity, we felt that based on what we saw on eye activity, we were still gaining market share. So whether or not you can period to the 7% as the overall market did, which is of course, is kind of above the normal all the average growth of the market over a multiyear period. So if we look at the market as growing 4 to 6 to midpoint 5, the Americas should grow 4 to 6, probably midpoint 5, on average. The 7 is a little on the high side. We continue to gain market share. We've been growing north of 1.5x the market. I still think the best way to look at the market is on a trailing 12-month basis, where the market overall for the Americas was 4%. We were 6%. So on average, we're kind of moving down the path we planned on and, of course, we're excited about the MyDay toric coming into the market."

And then of course, we'll be rolling out the MyDay toric into really the biggest toric market in the world and in the sweet spot of that market, which is the 1 Day, which is driving the will market. And if you think about the will market being up for the quarter, 15% and other being up 3%, or more importantly, for the year, the market being up 12% in single use and us and everything else, flat, we are the driver of the market growth in the all other bucket and we continue to gain share in the single use bucket.

Basically, we've guided our midpoint 7%, and we expect to continue to gain market share. There is, as I pointed out, some easy comps. The fact that our competitors grew over the prior year when the prior year, for example, was only 1%, and this year, was 7%. We frequently follow the, with many of the analyst, we set 2 years stacking. So if I look at it 2 years stacking, 7 this year, 1 last year, midpoint 8% overall, the market is growing 5% on a towing 12-month, that's more indicative.

On discounting and pricing, of course, the industry got a master, trading up, trading up and trading up. And to overlay on that, we, as an industry, it was a fair amount of price increases in the last 12 months. On the flipside, there has been a lot of, not so much discounting, but rebating. A lot of that is focused in on trying -- you'll like it, trying to get you to convert to 1-day. The strategy is working well as we can see from the growth of the 1-day being the driver of the overall market for the last 4 years in a row now and that will continue into the future. So the fact that there are discounts to incentivize or rebates to incentivize you to transition from a 2-week space into the 1-day space, which for OASYS 2-week noncompliant going to OASYS 1-day, that's 800% trade-up. There is a lot of room for rebating and incentives to get you to make the switch. Today, trade-up to 1-day is still a 400% to 600% step up in revenue at the manufacturer level, so we'd trade-up all day, even if we had to give rebates all day. And that's  -- we've now hit the flip point where there's more revenue generated by 1 Day  than there is revenue generated by non-1 Day. So this last quarter, $1.5 billion in revenue in single use and only $975 million in non-single-use. We're now past the 50% market. How is Cooper doing? We continue to be the driver of the 1 day, particularly within the space of the silicone hydrogel. For example, last 12 months, we're up 50% year-over-year. Whereas, the overall market is up 28% year-over-year, up for silicone hydrogel 1-day lenses. And of course, you've seen our overall numbers, market was up 13%, single-use and we were up 15% single-use for the quarter. So we're -- we think there's a lot of legs left in it. And the rollout of MyDay toric would only further enhance that -- those market get shared gains as well."

We still have market share that is in around 30% market share worldwide in a growth market. But one of the short of it is, others have played a little catch up in the market. It is still small part of the market, so when you're looking at the overall market, multifocals are 8%. We're at 10% of our revenues in multifocals.

Right now, they're putting a lot behind, basically, not talking up oxygen and all the features to silicone hydrogel that apply to the non-1-Day product. And they're really riding the wave of moist, in the case of J&J and daily counterparts in the case of Alcon. So they have 2 big products. So 1 of their dilemmas is ""gee, if you come into the market, what -- are you competing with yourself? Or your putting somewhat in play that is in hydrogel, they're kind of between a rock in a hot spot. We have nothing to lose because we have 2 great products, premium and low cost. We're the only one with that cost structure that could price a silicone hydrogel comparable to a MOIST and a daily AquaComfort Plus. And that's complete product range. If they were going to come into the market, we'll start with a sphere, as they got the cost down, and, then they would have to take you back on that, eventually the multifocal and a toric to get comparable to clariti.

From our perspective, important for that model is having a couple of things: one is, private label. For those that want to embark on their own design and model; number 2 is having a broad -- the broadest product portfolio of spheres, torics and multifocals, still makes it more attractive that you can do more things with it. I understand that companies -- and I'll pick on Hubble for the moment. Like Hubble, we'll continue to have a very narrow generic offering importing products from Taiwan. So that only can get so far, at the end of the day, eyecare professionals -- try to tell an eyecare professional you're ought to convert to writing script for generic sphere from Taiwan will only get you so far in terms of developing the model. You're going to need the breadth of products. The reasons doctors prescribe silicone hydrogel, there are reasons doctors prescribe torics, there are reasons they prescribe multifocals.

Now having said that, we are investing within sales and marketing, this tradition and some other areas of the business. We're going to continue to do that even though currency and so forth has moved against that. We have not gone back on those investments. So we're able to put those guidance because of the fundamental strength of the business itself, be it operating margins and leveraging OpEx in some parts of the business, leveraging our improvements within cost of goods. Things look pretty good kind of throughout the P&L. So I won't get too specific on how much we're going to spend each quarter.

Welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call. This was an exciting year, and we finished with record revenues, earnings per share and free cash flow. I'm proud of the team and the -- and ev",1174,"Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call. This was an exciting year, and we finished with record revenues, earnings per share and free cash flow. I'm proud of the team and the -- and everything we've accomplished and believe we're set for a strong fiscal 2018. 
For the quarter, we reported $562 million in consolidated revenue, up 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.65, up 16%, and free cash flow was a very strong $167 million. CooperVision posted fourth quarter revenues of $439 million, up 7% as reported, up 5% pro forma. Daily silicone hydrogel lenses drove growth up 37% in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenues of $123 million, up 15% as reported, up 7% pro forma. Fertility drove growth up 28%, or up 7% pro forma. 
Moving to the details for CooperVision. This was a solid quarter given tough comps and some hurricane disruptions. By geography, the Americas grew 2%; EMEA grew 5%; and Asia Pacific grew 10%, all pro forma. The Americas saw solid growth in August followed by weakness in September and October. There was some negative impact from the hurricanes during the time, which we estimate at -- estimate roughly at $2 million or 1%. Regardless, our total [ share fit ] in the Americas continues to be better than the revenue growth, indicating we're taking on-eye share. Regarding EMEA and Asia Pac, both had solid quarters, especially considering the difficult comps. We continue to gain share in both regions on a diversified geographic basis, which bodes well for continued growth. 
Overall, revenues continued to be driven by our silicone hydrogel lenses, led by clariti and MyDay in the dailies space and Biofinity in the monthly space. Our tiered approach within the daily silicone hydrogel space continues to prove successful. We are expanding our offerings geographically and have recently started seeding the U.S. market with MyDay toric fitting sets with the full launch to come soon. MyDay toric has been received incredibly well internationally due to its very comfortable design, and we expect a similar response in the U.S. Our clariti 1-day products continue to perform extremely well as the only silicone hydrogel family with the sphere, toric and a multifocal offering.
Moving to other products. Our Biofinity and Avaira family of lenses combined to grow 7% pro forma. Biofinity continued to perform very well with diversified growth around the world. Avaira declined slightly as our focus remained on transitioning wearers to our upgraded Avaira Vitality lenses, which we anticipate completing by the end of this fiscal year. We did experience some Avaira disruption associated with the hurricane in Puerto Rico, but our team did a phenomenal job responding to that challenge, and the impact was minimal. 
Turning to product categories. We remain the global leader in torics, which grew 7% pro forma, driven by clariti and Biofinity along with the roll-out of MyDay toric in Europe. We continue to believe the toric market will grow faster than the overall market, and we will share in that growth given our strong portfolio and the addition of MyDay toric in the U.S. Multifocals grew 4% pro forma, with strength coming from clariti and Biofinity. 
Turning to global contact lens market. For calendar Q3, we grew 7%, with the market also up 7%. This included growing faster than the market in EMEA, up 6%, versus the market, up 4%; and Asia Pacific, up 15%, versus the market, up 9%. The Americas grew 4%, with the market up 7%. By modality, CooperVision grew single-use lenses 15% versus the market, up 13%. And finally, CVI's non-single-use lenses grew 3%, while the market grew 1%. 
Overall, Q3 was a good quarter for both CooperVision and the market although the market was against easy tops. In particular, the top for the America market was especially easiest. It was down 3% last year's third quarter. CooperVision had more difficult 3% comp. On a trailing 12-month basis, we took share throughout the world, growing 8% versus the market, up 5%. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth, driven by continuing shift to improve technology, such as the wider use of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing trade-up to dailies and specialty lenses, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base. And given our strength in these areas along with the broad private label offering, we expect to continue growing faster than the market.
Regarding other CooperVision activity, we've completed the acquisition of Paragon Vision Sciences on December 1 for approximately $80 million. Paragon is a specialty lens business with a particular focus on ortho-k contact lenses. This acquisition allows us -- follows our recent acquisition of Procornea, another specialty company that we acquired in August. In combination with our MiSight product for the management of myopia, we are developing a nice specialty lens platform to ensure we remain well connected with opinion leaders and our -- and a technology leader in this space.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported a strong quarter with Q4 revenues of $123 million, up 15%, driven by organic growth in acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 7%, with fertility leading the way, up 28% or 12% pro forma. It was nice seeing the strength in fertility as the integration disruptions are starting to get behind us. As I mentioned before, we are a global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space, which is a global market with strong long-term growth dynamics. Our office and surgical business grew 2% for the quarter, with strength in EndoSee, our disposable hysteroscope, offset by weakness in other product lines. 
Regarding our CooperSurgical activity, we recently completed the acquisition of PARAGARD IUD from Teva, which closed on November 1, for approximately $1.1 billion. PARAGARD is the only IUD on the U.S. market that is hormone-free, long-lasting and reversible. In fact, it's -- hormone-free is especially important. As you may have heard, there was a major story released yesterday in The New England Journal of Medicine, showing women using birth control pills and IUDs that release hormones face a higher risk of breast cancer than women who have never used hormonal contraception. This study was completed over a 10-year period following 1.8 million women. Given PARAGARD is the only non-hormonal IUD option in the U.S. and CooperSurgical has resources and experience to ensure millions of women across country are aware of this important distinction, I'm very excited about the growth potential here.
I'll let Al get into the financial details, but as you can tell, I'm very bullish about PARAGARD as product and as a strategic fit within CooperSurgical. And finally, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for their hard work and dedication. We continue to post record results, and this wouldn't be possible without them. I'd like to especially thank employees in Puerto Rico, whose dedication and perseverance through the Hurricane Maria was something special. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Al."

So please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenue. So let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance.
For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were 65.9%, up nicely from 64.3% last year. CooperVision's gross margin was 67.7%, up from 64.8% last year, driven primarily by currency and product mix gains. CooperSurgical's gross margin was 59.6%, down from 62.5% last year, driven by lower genomic pricing and certain inventory write-offs and charges on legacy products. Also, within CooperSurgical, we recently purchased an existing manufacturing facility in Costa Rica to consolidate a significant portion of our global manufacturing. We've made a lot of progress upgrading the facility and hiring key employees and plan to begin production of the Wallace transfer catheter in the near future. This should provide a very nice opportunity to reduce cost and improve margins in the coming years. 
Moving to expenses. Consolidated operating expenses grew 7% in the quarter, slightly less than revenue. The expense growth was driven by investments throughout the company, including additions to the sales force and distribution. We continue to enhance our sales force by selectively hiring around the world while also continuing to upgrade our infrastructure, including distribution. 
Moving to operating income. We grew 17.2%, with operating margins improving to 27.2% from 25.1% last year. Both businesses reported strong operating margin improvement, with CooperVision growing 14.7% to 31.1%, driven by gross margin improvement; while CooperSurgical improved 15.4% to 22.4%, driven by operating expense leverage.
Below operating income, we reported $7.9 million of interest expense, a $1.5 million FX loss and an effective tax rate of 8.1%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.65, with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding. We posted $167 million of free cash flow comprised of roughly $199 million of operating cash flow, offset by $32 million of CapEx. Total debt declined roughly $41 million to $1.173 billion, supported by cash flow generation and an increase in cash balances, offset by our acquisition of Procornea in August and $25 million of stock buybacks in October. 
Regarding full year fiscal 2017 results, consolidated revenues were $2.139 billion, up 9% or 7% pro forma. CooperVision revenues were $1.674 billion, up 6% or 7% pro forma; and CooperSurgical's revenues were $464.9 million, up 19% or 4% pro forma. Non-GAAP EPS was $9.70, up 15%; and free cash flow was very strong at $466 million. 
Before moving to guidance, let me quickly add a reminder that we announced on November 1, a new $1.425 billion 5-year senior unsecured term loan, which matures November 1, 2022. The facility was used to fund the PARAGARD acquisition and reduce our revolver borrowings, allowing greater flexibility for general corporate purposes, including the recent funding of the Paragon acquisition. 
Moving to fiscal 2018. We're guiding the consolidated revenues of $2.48 billion to $2.53 billion, which is comprised of $1.83 billion to $1.87 billion at CooperVision, or roughly 9% to 11% as reported growth, 6% to 8% pro forma growth; and $650 million to $665 million at CooperSurgical, or roughly 40% to 43% as reported growth, 2% to 4% pro forma growth. 
CooperSurgical revenue guidance assumes roughly $170 million for PARAGARD, which is slightly lower than originally expected, with the negative impact coming entirely in fiscal Q1 due to higher-than-expected channel inventory. We're not providing detailed quarterly guidance, but to help model this, we expect Q1 revenues for consolidated CooperSurgical to be around $150 million, with PARAGARD being roughly $34 million of that. This $34 million would be a year-over-year decline of roughly 25%. This unusual activity is related to a price increase, which resulted in a significantly higher channel inventory in September but then also, unexpectedly, in the month of October, the month before we closed the acquisition. Subsequent to Q1, we expect PARAGARD to do roughly $135 million to $138 million during Q2 to Q4, which equates to upper single-digit growth, driven by the price increase and underlying unit growth. Note we have not included any potential upside from the new study Bob mentioned in The New England Journal of Medicine. We still expect to meet or exceed our targeted EPS accretion of $0.70 to $0.75 for PARAGARD for the full year. And including PARAGARD, on a consolidated basis, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $11.35 to $11.65, up 17% to 20% based on 49.8 million shares outstanding. 
Moving to details within the P&L. We expect fiscal 2018 gross margins to improve to around 68%. Operating margins are expected to improve to around 28%, and this includes a negative $3 million impact from the reintroduction of the 2.3% medical device tax -- excise tax beginning in January. This tax only impacts our domestic CooperSurgical business, excluding PARAGARD, which is treated as a pharmaceutical product. Interest expense is expected to be around $68 million, which includes the additional debt from the PARAGARD and Paragon acquisitions and the assumption of a 25 basis point rate increase this month. 
Regarding taxes. There's obviously a lot of activity with several bills pending at the House and Senate. So let me add a caveat that my commentary is based on unfinished tax legislation that could change materially. Given our fiscal year end is in October, many of the proposed tax reform provisions will not be effective for us until fiscal 2019. So we're assuming an effective tax rate of 11% for our fiscal 2018 guidance. Having said that, the proposed tax reform does include a few provisions that would impact us in fiscal '18, with the most material being the mandatory repatriation of previously deferred earnings. That being said, we would exclude these types of one-time P&L charges from our non-GAAP EPS to allow clear comparability of year-over-year results. Repeating my disclaimer that there are still a lot of moving parts, we currently see risk to our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 and beyond to the mid-teens from items such as the minimum tax on foreign income.
Lastly, on guidance, excluding any impact from unknown tax matters, we expect free cash flow to be similar to this year but with CapEx around $175 million. The higher CapEx is mostly due to carryover from fiscal 2017 due to lower-than-expected spending in Q4 as our manufacturing team dealt with the hurricane in Puerto Rico. 
With that, let me conclude by saying we remain focused on expanding our businesses and gaining global market share while delivering consistent, solid financial results. This quarter and this year were another step in that direction, and we look forward to reporting results as we work through fiscal 2018. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

If we look at -- first of all, if we look at this coming fiscal year, fiscal '18 that we're in right now, most of the tax reform, again, won't impact us. So if we look at fiscal 2019 and beyond, that's where you start",212,"Yes. So a couple of comments on that. If we look at -- first of all, if we look at this coming fiscal year, fiscal '18 that we're in right now, most of the tax reform, again, won't impact us. So if we look at fiscal 2019 and beyond, that's where you start looking at it and say ""Okay, what is the impact of the full tax provision changes?"" And that's where we're talking somewhere in the mid-teens. So let's say 15%, just so we're working off a number. If we take a look at where we have been in the past and you had PARAGARD, which has fairly significant U.S. income associated with it, obviously higher U.S. taxes associated with that, that moves us up towards the 11% this year. And then the other tax changes move us up to the 15%, keeping in mind that under that scenario, PARAGARD is actually a positive because the positive tax rate is a positive for PARAGARD and our CooperSurgical business. So that's kind of the flow. I mean, as you can imagine, as you know, there's a lot that goes into that, but at this point in time, based on the measures that are out there, that's where we see taxes coming up."

The fact that our competitors grew over the prior year when the prior year, for example, was only 1% and this year was 7%. We frequently follow the -- with many of the analysts, use a 2-year stacking. So if I look at a 2-year stacking, 7% this year, 1% last year, midpoint 8%, overall, the market has been growing 5% on a trialing 12 month, that's more indicative.

On discounting and pricing, of course, the industry's been [indiscernible] trading up, trading up and trading up. And to overlay on that, we, as an industry, there was a fair amount of price increases the last 12 months. On the flip side, there has been a lot of -- not so much discounting but rebating. A lot of that is focused in on trying -- you'll like it, trying to get you to convert to 1-day. The strategy is working well, as we can see from the growth of the 1-day being the driver of the overall market for the last 4 years in a row now, and that will continue into the future. So the fact that there are discounts to incentivize or rebates to incentivize you to transition from a 2-week space into the 1-day space, which for OASYS 2-week [ noncompliant ] going to OASYS 1-day, that's 800% trade-up. There is a lot of room for rebating and incentives to get you to make the switch. Today, trade-up to 1-day is still a 400% to 600% step-up in revenue at the manufacturer level. So we'd trade up all day even if we had to give rebates all day. And that -- we've now hit the flip point where there is more revenue generated by 1-day than there is revenue generated by non-1-day; so this last quarter, $1.5 billion in revenue in single use and only $975 million in non-single-use. We're now past the 50% market. How is Cooper doing? We continue to be the driver of the 1-day particularly within the space of the silicone hydrogel. For example, the last 12 months, we're up 50% year-over-year, whereas the overall market is up 28% year-over-year, up for silicone hydrogel 1-day lenses. And of course, you've seen our overall numbers. Market was up 13%, single-use, and we were up 15%, single-use, for the quarter. So we're -- we think there's a lot of legs left in it. And the roll-out of MyDay toric would only further enhance that -- those market share gains as well."

We still have market share that is in around 30% market share worldwide in a growth market. But the long and the short of it is others have played a little catch-up in the market. It is still a small part of the market. So when you look at the overall market, multifocals are 8%. We're at 10% of our revenue in multifocals. And the bigger action point is the torics, where the overall market is around 22% and we're about 1/3 of that market. So torics is a much bigger fish, if you will.

They're kind of between a rock and a hard spot. We have nothing to lose because we have 2 great products, premium and low cost.

From our perspective, important for that model is having a couple of things: One is private label for those that want to embark on their own design and model. Number two is having a broad -- the broadest product portfolio of spheres, torics and multifocals still makes it more attractive that you can do more things with it. I understand that companies -- and I'll pick on Hubble for the moment. Like Hubble, we'll continue to have a very narrow generic offering, importing products from Taiwan. So that only can get so far. At the end of the day, eye care professionals -- try to tell an eye care professional, you'll all have to convert to -- writing script for generic sphere from Taiwan will only get you so far in terms of developing the model. You're going to need the breadth of products. There are reasons doctors prescribe silicone hydrogel, there are reasons doctors prescribe torics, and there are reasons they prescribe multifocals. And they're a lot more complicated to fit than just a generic model that is tempting to have the patient influence the eye care professional on what to prescribe. That's a tough model."

And there are some competitors in that space who are getting very aggressive with price, interestingly companies who are losing significant amounts of money.

Now having said that, we are investing within sales and marketing, distribution, some other areas in the business. We're going to continue to do that. Even though currency and so forth has moved against that, we are -- we have not cut back on those investments. So we're able to put up this guidance because of fundamental strength in the business itself, be it operating margins and leveraging OpEx in some parts of the business, leveraging our improvements within cost of goods. Things look pretty good kind of throughout the P&L. So I won't get too specific on how much we're going to spend each quarter. I guess I'd probably just say that we're investing in the business.

This was an exciting year, and we finished with record revenues, earnings per share and free cash flow. I'm proud of the team and the -- and everything we've accomplished and believe we're set for a strong fiscal 2018. 
For the quarter, we reported $562 million in consolidated revenue, up 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.65, up 16%, and free cash flow was a very strong $167 million. CooperVision posted fourth quarter revenues of $439 million, up 7% as reported, up 5% pro forma. Daily silicone hydrogel lenses drove growth up 37% in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenues of $123 million, up 15% as reported, up 7% pro forma. Fertility drove growth up 28%, or up 7% pro forma. 
Moving to the details for CooperVision. This was a solid quarter given tough comps and some hurricane disruptions. By geography, the Americas grew 2%; EMEA grew 5%; and Asia Pacific grew 10%, all pro forma. The Americas saw solid growth in August followed by weakness in September and October. There was some negative impact from the hurricanes during the time, which we estimate at -- estimate roughly at $2 million or 1%. Regardless, our total [ share fit ] in the Americas continues to be better than the revenue growth, indicating we're taking on-eye share. Regarding EMEA and Asia Pac, both had solid quarters, especially considering the difficult comps. We continue to gain share in both regions on a diversified geographic basis, which bodes well for continued growth. 
Overall, revenues continued to be driven by our silicone hydrogel lenses, led by clariti and MyDay in the dailies space and Biofinity in the monthly space. Our tiered approach within the daily silicone hydrogel space continues to prove successful. We are expanding our offerings geographically and have recently started seeding the U.S. market with MyDay toric fitting sets with the full launch to come soon. MyDay toric has been received incredibly well internationally due to its very comfortable design, and we expect a similar response in the U.S. Our clariti 1-day products continue to perform extremely well as the only silicone hydrogel family with the sphere, toric and a multifocal offering.
Moving to other products. Our Biofinity and Avaira family of lenses combined to grow 7% pro forma. Biofinity continued to perform very well with diversified growth around the world. Avaira declined slightly as our focus remained on transitioning wearers to our upgraded Avaira Vitality lenses, which we anticipate completing by the end of this fiscal year. We did experience some Avaira disruption associated with the hurricane in Puerto Rico, but our team did a phenomenal job responding to that challenge, and the impact was minimal. 
Turning to product categories. We remain the global leader in torics, which grew 7% pro forma, driven by clariti and Biofinity, along with the roll-out of MyDay toric in Europe. We continue to believe the toric market will grow faster than the overall market, and we will share in that growth given our strong portfolio and the addition of MyDay toric in the U.S. Multifocals grew 4% pro forma, with strength coming from clariti and Biofinity. 
Turning to global contact lens market. For calendar Q3, we grew 7%, with the market also up 7%. This included growing faster than the market in EMEA, up 6%, versus the market, up 4%; and Asia Pacific, up 15%, versus the market, up 9%. The Americas grew 4%, with the market up 7%. By modality, CooperVision grew single-use lenses 15% versus the market, up 13%. And finally, CVI's non-single-use lenses grew 3%, while the market grew 1%. 
Overall, Q3 was a good quarter for both CooperVision and the market although the market was against easy comp. In particular, the comp for the America market was especially easy as it was down 3% last year's third quarter. CooperVision had more difficult 3% comp. On a trailing 12-month basis, we took share throughout the world, growing 8% versus the market, up 5%. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth, driven by continuing shift to improve technology, such as the wider use of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing trade-up to dailies and specialty lenses, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base. And given our strength in these areas along with the broad private label offering, we expect to continue growing faster than the market.
Regarding other CooperVision activity, we've completed the acquisition of Paragon Vision Sciences on December 1 for approximately $80 million. Paragon is a specialty lens business with a particular focus on ortho-k contact lenses. This acquisition allows us -- follows our recent acquisition of Procornea, another specialty company that we acquired in August. In combination with our MiSight product for the management of myopia, we are developing a nice specialty lens platform to ensure we remain well connected with opinion leaders and are a technology leader in this space.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported a strong quarter with Q4 revenues of $123 million, up 15%, driven by organic growth in acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 7%, with fertility leading the way, up 28% or 12% pro forma. It was nice seeing the strength in fertility as the integration disruptions are starting to get behind us. As I mentioned before, we are a global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space, which is a global market with strong long-term growth dynamics. Our office and surgical business grew 2% for the quarter, with strength in EndoSee, our disposable hysteroscope, offset by weakness in other product lines. 
Regarding our CooperSurgical activity, we recently completed the acquisition of PARAGARD IUD from Teva, which closed on November 1, for approximately $1.1 billion. PARAGARD is the only IUD on the U.S. market that is hormone-free, long-lasting and reversible. In fact, it's -- hormone-free is especially important. As you may have heard, there was a major story released yesterday in The New England Journal of Medicine, showing women using birth control pills and IUDs that release hormones face a higher risk of breast cancer than women who have never used hormonal contraception. This study was completed over a 10-year period following 1.8 million women. Given PARAGARD is the only non-hormonal IUD option in the U.S. and CooperSurgical has resources and experience to ensure millions of women across country are aware of this important distinction, I'm very excited about the growth potential here.
I'll let Al get into the financial details, but as you can tell, I'm very bullish about PARAGARD as product and as a strategic fit within CooperSurgical. And finally, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for their hard work and dedication. We continue to post record results, and this wouldn't be possible without them. I'd like to especially thank employees in Puerto Rico, whose dedication and perseverance through the Hurricane Maria was something special. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Al."

So please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenue. So let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance.
For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were 65.9%, up nicely from 64.3% last year. CooperVision's gross margin was 67.7%, up from 64.8% last year, driven primarily by currency and product mix gains. CooperSurgical's gross margin was 59.6%, down from 62.5% last year, driven by lower genomic pricing and certain inventory write-offs and charges on legacy products. Also, within CooperSurgical, we recently purchased an existing manufacturing facility in Costa Rica to consolidate a significant portion of our global manufacturing. We've made a lot of progress upgrading the facility and hiring key employees and plan to begin production of the Wallace transfer catheter in the near future. This should provide a very nice opportunity to reduce cost and improve margins in the coming years. 
Moving to expenses. Consolidated operating expenses grew 7% in the quarter, slightly less than revenue. The expense growth was driven by investments throughout the company, including additions to the sales force and distribution. We continue to enhance our sales force by selectively hiring around the world while also continuing to upgrade our infrastructure, including distribution. 
Moving to operating income. We grew 17.2%, with operating margins improving to 27.2% from 25.1% last year. Both businesses reported strong operating margin improvement, with CooperVision growing 14.7% to 31.1%, driven by gross margin improvement; while CooperSurgical improved 15.4% to 22.4%, driven by operating expense leverage.
Below operating income, we reported $7.9 million of interest expense, a $1.5 million FX loss and an effective tax rate of 8.1%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.65, with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding. We posted $167 million of free cash flow comprised of roughly $199 million of operating cash flow, offset by $32 million of CapEx. Total debt declined roughly $41 million to $1.173 billion, supported by cash flow generation and an increase in cash balances, offset by our acquisition of Procornea in August and $25 million of stock buybacks in October. 
Regarding full year fiscal 2017 results, consolidated revenues were $2.139 billion, up 9% or 7% pro forma. CooperVision revenues were $1.674 billion, up 6% or 7% pro forma; and CooperSurgical's revenues were $464.9 million, up 19% or 4% pro forma. Non-GAAP EPS was $9.70, up 15%; and free cash flow was very strong at $466 million. 
Before moving to guidance, let me quickly add a reminder that we announced on November 1, a new $1.425 billion 5-year senior unsecured term loan, which matures November 1, 2022. The facility was used to fund the PARAGARD acquisition and reduce our revolver borrowings, allowing greater flexibility for general corporate purposes, including the recent funding of the Paragon acquisition. 
Moving to fiscal 2018. We're guiding the consolidated revenues of $2.48 billion to $2.53 billion, which is comprised of $1.83 billion to $1.87 billion at CooperVision, or roughly 9% to 11% as reported growth, 6% to 8% pro forma growth; and $650 million to $665 million at CooperSurgical, or roughly 40% to 43% as reported growth, 2% to 4% pro forma growth. 
CooperSurgical revenue guidance assumes roughly $170 million for PARAGARD, which is slightly lower than originally expected, with the negative impact coming entirely in fiscal Q1 due to higher-than-expected channel inventory. We're not providing detailed quarterly guidance, but to help model this, we expect Q1 revenues for consolidated CooperSurgical to be around $150 million, with PARAGARD being roughly $34 million of that. This $34 million would be a year-over-year decline of roughly 25%. This unusual activity is related to a price increase, which resulted in a significantly higher channel inventory in September but then also, unexpectedly, in the month of October, the month before we closed the acquisition. Subsequent to Q1, we expect PARAGARD to do roughly $135 million to $138 million during Q2 to Q4, which equates to upper single-digit growth, driven by the price increase and underlying unit growth. Note we have not included any potential upside from the new study Bob mentioned in The New England Journal of Medicine. We still expect to meet or exceed our targeted EPS accretion of $0.70 to $0.75 for PARAGARD for the full year. And including PARAGARD, on a consolidated basis, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $11.35 to $11.65, up 17% to 20% based on 49.8 million shares outstanding. 
Moving to details within the P&L. We expect fiscal 2018 gross margins to improve to around 68%. Operating margins are expected to improve to around 28%, and this includes a negative $3 million impact from the reintroduction of the 2.3% medical device tax -- excise tax beginning in January. This tax only impacts our domestic CooperSurgical business, excluding PARAGARD, which is treated as a pharmaceutical product. Interest expense is expected to be around $68 million, which includes the additional debt from the PARAGARD and Paragon acquisitions and the assumption of a 25 basis point rate increase this month. 
Regarding taxes. There's obviously a lot of activity with several bills pending at the House and Senate. So let me add a caveat that my commentary is based on unfinished tax legislation that could change materially. Given our fiscal year end is in October, many of the proposed tax reform provisions will not be effective for us until fiscal 2019. So we're assuming an effective tax rate of 11% for our fiscal 2018 guidance. Having said that, the proposed tax reform does include a few provisions that would impact us in fiscal '18, with the most material being the mandatory repatriation of previously deferred earnings. That being said, we would exclude these types of one-time P&L charges from our non-GAAP EPS to allow clear comparability of year-over-year results. Repeating my disclaimer that there are still a lot of moving parts, we currently see risk to our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 and beyond to the mid-teens from items such as the minimum tax on foreign income.
Lastly, on guidance, excluding any impact from unknown tax matters, we expect free cash flow to be similar to this year but with CapEx around $175 million. The higher CapEx is mostly due to carryover from fiscal 2017 due to lower-than-expected spending in Q4 as our manufacturing team dealt with the hurricane in Puerto Rico. 
With that, let me conclude by saying we remain focused on expanding our businesses and gaining global market share while delivering consistent, solid financial results. This quarter and this year were another step in that direction, and we look forward to reporting results as we work through fiscal 2018. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

If we look at -- first of all, if we look at this coming fiscal year, fiscal '18 that we're in right now, most of the tax reform, again, won't impact us. So if we look at fiscal 2019 and beyond, that's where you start",212,"Yes. So a couple of comments on that.

So if we look at fiscal 2019 and beyond, that's where you start looking at it and say ""Okay, what is the impact of the full tax provision changes?"" And that's where we're talking somewhere in the mid-teens. So let's say 15%, just so we're working off a number. If we take a look at where we have been in the past and you add PARAGARD, which has fairly significant U.S. income associated with it, obviously higher U.S. taxes associated with that, that moves us up towards the 11% this year. And then the other tax changes move us up to the 15%, keeping in mind that under that scenario, PARAGARD is actually a positive because the positive tax rate is a positive for PARAGARD and our CooperSurgical business. So that's kind of the flow. I mean, as you can imagine, as you know, there's a lot that goes into that, but at this point in time, based on the measures that are out there, that's where we see taxes coming out."

So if we look at the market as growing 4% to 6%, midpoint 5%, the Americas should grow 4% to 6%, probably midpoint 5%, on average. The 7% is a little on the high side.

The fact that our competitors grew over the prior year when the prior year, for example, was only 1% and this year was 7%. We frequently follow the -- with many of the analysts, use a 2-year stacking. So if I look at a 2-year stacking, 7% this year, 1% last year, midpoint 8%, overall, the market has been growing 5% on a trailing 12 month, that's more indicative.

On discounting and pricing, of course, the industry's been a master at trading up, trading up and trading up. And to overlay on that, we, as an industry, there was a fair amount of price increases the last 12 months. On the flip side, there has been a lot of -- not so much discounting but rebating. A lot of that is focused in on try and you'll like it, trying to get you to convert to 1-day. The strategy is working well, as we can see from the growth of the 1-day being the driver of the overall market for the last 4 years in a row now, and that will continue into the future. So the fact that there are discounts to incentivize or rebates to incentivize you to transition from a 2-week space into the 1-day space, which it were a OASYS 2-week [ noncompliant ] going to OASYS 1-day, that's 800% trade-up. There is a lot of room for rebating and incentives to get you to make the switch. Today, trade-up to 1-day is still a 400% to 600% step-up in revenue at the manufacturer level. So we'd trade up all day even if we had to give rebates all day. And that -- we've now hit the flip point where there is more revenue generated by 1-day than there is revenue generated by non-1-day; so this last quarter, $1.5 billion in revenue in single use and only $975 million in non-single-use. We're now past the 50% market. How is Cooper doing? We continue to be the driver of the 1-day particularly within the space of the silicone hydrogel. For example, the last 12 months, we're up 50% year-over-year, whereas the overall market is up 28% year-over-year, up for silicone hydrogel 1-day lenses. And of course, you've seen our overall numbers. Market was up 13%, single-use, and we were up 15%, single-use, for the quarter. So we're -- we think there's a lot of legs left in it. And the roll-out of MyDay toric would only further enhance that -- those market share gains as well."

We still have market share that is in around 30% market share worldwide in a growth market. But the long and the short of it is others have played a little catch-up in the market.

But one of the other things that is starting to come into its own in Asia Pac that started in the U.S. is our specialty lenses. So torics and multifocals are early in the game, and we have a good portfolio. And as I mentioned, we're essentially #1 in the specialty lens space. So we'll continue to ride that wave with a very broad product line. So looking forward, I expect to see pretty good growth in Asia Pac as a market and us to continue to gain market share, moving to a more respectful level of overall market share with our portfolio."

And they're really riding the wave of MOIST in the case of J&J and daily AquaComfort Plus in the case of Alcon. So they have 2 big products. So one of their dilemmas is ""Gee, if you come into the market, what -- are you competing with yourself? Are you putting someone in play that is in a hydrogel?"" They're kind of between a rock and a hard spot. We have nothing to lose because we have 2 great products, premium and low cost. We're the only one with that cost structure that can price a silicone hydrogel comparable to a MOIST and a daily AquaComfort Plus and there -- and a complete product range. If they were going to come into the market, we'd start with sphere as they got the cost down, and then they would have to piggyback on that, eventually multifocal and a toric to get comparable to clariti.

We have companies out there like Hubble and different things. We've been kind of leading the way with home delivery outside the U.S. for many, many, many years, so highly experienced with that model. And of course, it's an enhancer for the eye care professional. So it's not a bad model. From our perspective, important for that model is having a couple of things: One is private label for those that want to embark on their own design and model. Number two is having a broad -- the broadest product portfolio of spheres, torics and multifocals still makes it more attractive that you can do more things with it. I understand that companies -- and I'll pick on Hubble for the moment. Like Hubble will continue to have a very narrow generic offering, importing products from Taiwan. So that only can get so far. At the end of the day, eye care professionals -- try to tell an eye care professional, you'll all have to convert to -- writing script for generic sphere from Taiwan will only get you so far in terms of developing the model. You're going to need the breadth of products. There are reasons doctors prescribe silicone hydrogel, there are reasons doctors prescribe torics, and there are reasons they prescribe multifocals. And they're a lot more complicated to fit than just a generic model that is tempting to have the patient influence the eye care professional on what to prescribe. That's a tough model."

This was an exciting year, and we finished with record revenues, earnings per share and free cash flow. I'm proud of the team and the -- and everything we've accomplished and believe we're set for a strong fiscal 2018. 
For the quarter, we reported $562 million in consolidated revenue, up 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.65, up 16%, and free cash flow was a very strong $167 million. CooperVision posted fourth quarter revenues of $439 million, up 7% as reported, up 5% pro forma. Daily silicone hydrogel lenses drove growth up 37% in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenues of $123 million, up 15% as reported, up 7% pro forma. Fertility drove growth up 28%, or up 7% pro forma. 
Moving to the details for CooperVision. This was a solid quarter given tough comps and some hurricane disruptions. By geography, the Americas grew 2%; EMEA grew 5%; and Asia Pacific grew 10%, all pro forma. The Americas saw solid growth in August followed by weakness in September and October. There was some negative impact from the hurricanes during the time, which we estimate at -- estimate roughly at $2 million or 1%. Regardless, our total [ share fit ] in the Americas continues to be better than the revenue growth, indicating we're taking on-eye share. Regarding EMEA and Asia Pac, both had solid quarters, especially considering the difficult comps. We continue to gain share in both regions on a diversified geographic basis, which bodes well for continued growth. 
Overall, revenues continued to be driven by our silicone hydrogel lenses, led by clariti and MyDay in the dailies space and Biofinity in the monthly space. Our tiered approach within the daily silicone hydrogel space continues to prove successful. We are expanding our offerings geographically and have recently started seeding the U.S. market with MyDay toric fitting sets with the full launch to come soon. MyDay toric has been received incredibly well internationally due to its very comfortable design, and we expect a similar response in the U.S. Our clariti 1-day products continue to perform extremely well as the only silicone hydrogel family with the sphere, toric and a multifocal offering.
Moving to other products. Our Biofinity and Avaira family of lenses combined to grow 7% pro forma. Biofinity continued to perform very well with diversified growth around the world. Avaira declined slightly as our focus remained on transitioning wearers to our upgraded Avaira Vitality lenses, which we anticipate completing by the end of this fiscal year. We did experience some Avaira disruption associated with the hurricane in Puerto Rico, but our team did a phenomenal job responding to that challenge, and the impact was minimal. 
Turning to product categories. We remain the global leader in torics, which grew 7% pro forma, driven by clariti and Biofinity, along with the roll-out of MyDay toric in Europe. We continue to believe the toric market will grow faster than the overall market, and we will share in that growth given our strong portfolio and the addition of MyDay toric in the U.S. Multifocals grew 4% pro forma, with strength coming from clariti and Biofinity. 
Turning to global contact lens market. For calendar Q3, we grew 7%, with the market also up 7%. This included growing faster than the market in EMEA, up 6%, versus the market, up 4%; and Asia Pacific, up 15%, versus the market, up 9%. The Americas grew 4%, with the market up 7%. By modality, CooperVision grew single-use lenses 15% versus the market, up 13%. And finally, CVI's non-single-use lenses grew 3%, while the market grew 1%. 
Overall, Q3 was a good quarter for both CooperVision and the market although the market was against easy comp. In particular, the comp for the America market was especially easy as it was down 3% last year's third quarter. CooperVision had more difficult 3% comp. On a trailing 12-month basis, we took share throughout the world, growing 8% versus the market, up 5%. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth, driven by continuing shift to improve technology, such as the wider use of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing trade-up to dailies and specialty lenses, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base. And given our strength in these areas along with the broad private label offering, we expect to continue growing faster than the market.
Regarding other CooperVision activity, we've completed the acquisition of Paragon Vision Sciences on December 1 for approximately $80 million. Paragon is a specialty lens business with a particular focus on ortho-k contact lenses. This acquisition allows us -- follows our recent acquisition of Procornea, another specialty company that we acquired in August. In combination with our MiSight product for the management of myopia, we are developing a nice specialty lens platform to ensure we remain well connected with opinion leaders and are a technology leader in this space.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported a strong quarter with Q4 revenues of $123 million, up 15%, driven by organic growth in acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 7%, with fertility leading the way, up 28% or 12% pro forma. It was nice seeing the strength in fertility as the integration disruptions are starting to get behind us. As I mentioned before, we are a global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space, which is a global market with strong long-term growth dynamics. Our office and surgical business grew 2% for the quarter, with strength in EndoSee, our disposable hysteroscope, offset by weakness in other product lines. 
Regarding our CooperSurgical activity, we recently completed the acquisition of PARAGARD IUD from Teva, which closed on November 1, for approximately $1.1 billion. PARAGARD is the only IUD on the U.S. market that is hormone-free, long-lasting and reversible. In fact, it's -- hormone-free is especially important. As you may have heard, there was a major story released yesterday in The New England Journal of Medicine, showing women using birth control pills and IUDs that release hormones face a higher risk of breast cancer than women who have never used hormonal contraception. This study was completed over a 10-year period following 1.8 million women. Given PARAGARD is the only non-hormonal IUD option in the U.S. and CooperSurgical has resources and experience to ensure millions of women across country are aware of this important distinction, I'm very excited about the growth potential here.
I'll let Al get into the financial details, but as you can tell, I'm very bullish about PARAGARD as product and as a strategic fit within CooperSurgical. And finally, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for their hard work and dedication. We continue to post record results, and this wouldn't be possible without them. I'd like to especially thank employees in Puerto Rico, whose dedication and perseverance through the Hurricane Maria was something special. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Al."

Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis. So please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenue.

So please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenue. So let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance.
For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were 65.9%, up nicely from 64.3% last year. CooperVision's gross margin was 67.7%, up from 64.8% last year, driven primarily by currency and product mix gains. CooperSurgical's gross margin was 59.6%, down from 62.5% last year, driven by lower genomic pricing and certain inventory write-offs and charges on legacy products. Also, within CooperSurgical, we recently purchased an existing manufacturing facility in Costa Rica to consolidate a significant portion of our global manufacturing. We've made a lot of progress upgrading the facility and hiring key employees and plan to begin production of the Wallace transfer catheter in the near future. This should provide a very nice opportunity to reduce cost and improve margins in the coming years. 
Moving to expenses. Consolidated operating expenses grew 7% in the quarter, slightly less than revenue. The expense growth was driven by investments throughout the company, including additions to the sales force and distribution. We continue to enhance our sales force by selectively hiring around the world while also continuing to upgrade our infrastructure, including distribution. 
Moving to operating income. We grew 17.2%, with operating margins improving to 27.2% from 25.1% last year. Both businesses reported strong operating margin improvement, with CooperVision growing 14.7% to 31.1%, driven by gross margin improvement; while CooperSurgical improved 15.4% to 22.4%, driven by operating expense leverage.
Below operating income, we reported $7.9 million of interest expense, a $1.5 million FX loss and an effective tax rate of 8.1%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.65, with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding. We posted $167 million of free cash flow comprised of roughly $199 million of operating cash flow, offset by $32 million of CapEx. Total debt declined roughly $41 million to $1.173 billion, supported by cash flow generation and an increase in cash balances, offset by our acquisition of Procornea in August and $25 million of stock buybacks in October. 
Regarding full year fiscal 2017 results, consolidated revenues were $2.139 billion, up 9% or 7% pro forma. CooperVision revenues were $1.674 billion, up 6% or 7% pro forma; and CooperSurgical's revenues were $464.9 million, up 19% or 4% pro forma. Non-GAAP EPS was $9.70, up 15%; and free cash flow was very strong at $466 million. 
Before moving to guidance, let me quickly add a reminder that we announced on November 1, a new $1.425 billion 5-year senior unsecured term loan, which matures November 1, 2022. The facility was used to fund the PARAGARD acquisition and reduce our revolver borrowings, allowing greater flexibility for general corporate purposes, including the recent funding of the Paragon acquisition. 
Moving to fiscal 2018. We're guiding the consolidated revenues of $2.48 billion to $2.53 billion, which is comprised of $1.83 billion to $1.87 billion at CooperVision, or roughly 9% to 11% as reported growth, 6% to 8% pro forma growth; and $650 million to $665 million at CooperSurgical, or roughly 40% to 43% as reported growth, 2% to 4% pro forma growth. 
CooperSurgical revenue guidance assumes roughly $170 million for PARAGARD, which is slightly lower than originally expected, with the negative impact coming entirely in fiscal Q1 due to higher-than-expected channel inventory. We're not providing detailed quarterly guidance, but to help model this, we expect Q1 revenues for consolidated CooperSurgical to be around $150 million, with PARAGARD being roughly $34 million of that. This $34 million would be a year-over-year decline of roughly 25%. This unusual activity is related to a price increase, which resulted in a significantly higher channel inventory in September but then also, unexpectedly, in the month of October, the month before we closed the acquisition. Subsequent to Q1, we expect PARAGARD to do roughly $135 million to $138 million during Q2 to Q4, which equates to upper single-digit growth, driven by the price increase and underlying unit growth. Note we have not included any potential upside from the new study Bob mentioned in The New England Journal of Medicine. We still expect to meet or exceed our targeted EPS accretion of $0.70 to $0.75 for PARAGARD for the full year. And including PARAGARD, on a consolidated basis, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $11.35 to $11.65, up 17% to 20% based on 49.8 million shares outstanding. 
Moving to details within the P&L. We expect fiscal 2018 gross margins to improve to around 68%. Operating margins are expected to improve to around 28%, and this includes a negative $3 million impact from the reintroduction of the 2.3% medical device tax -- excise tax beginning in January. This tax only impacts our domestic CooperSurgical business, excluding PARAGARD, which is treated as a pharmaceutical product. Interest expense is expected to be around $68 million, which includes the additional debt from the PARAGARD and Paragon acquisitions and the assumption of a 25 basis point rate increase this month. 
Regarding taxes. There's obviously a lot of activity with several bills pending at the House and Senate. So let me add a caveat that my commentary is based on unfinished tax legislation that could change materially. Given our fiscal year end is in October, many of the proposed tax reform provisions will not be effective for us until fiscal 2019. So we're assuming an effective tax rate of 11% for our fiscal 2018 guidance. Having said that, the proposed tax reform does include a few provisions that would impact us in fiscal '18, with the most material being the mandatory repatriation of previously deferred earnings. That being said, we would exclude these types of one-time P&L charges from our non-GAAP EPS to allow clear comparability of year-over-year results. Repeating my disclaimer that there are still a lot of moving parts, we currently see risk to our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 and beyond to the mid-teens from items such as the minimum tax on foreign income.
Lastly, on guidance, excluding any impact from unknown tax matters, we expect free cash flow to be similar to this year but with CapEx around $175 million. The higher CapEx is mostly due to carryover from fiscal 2017 due to lower-than-expected spending in Q4 as our manufacturing team dealt with the hurricane in Puerto Rico. 
With that, let me conclude by saying we remain focused on expanding our businesses and gaining global market share while delivering consistent, solid financial results. This quarter and this year were another step in that direction, and we look forward to reporting results as we work through fiscal 2018. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

If we look at -- first of all, if we look at this coming fiscal year, fiscal '18 that we're in right now, most of the tax reform, again, won't impact us. So if we look at fiscal 2019 and beyond, that's where you start",212,"Yes. So a couple of comments on that.

So if we look at fiscal 2019 and beyond, that's where you start looking at it and say ""Okay, what is the impact of the full tax provision changes?"" And that's where we're talking somewhere in the mid-teens. So let's say 15%, just so we're working off a number. If we take a look at where we have been in the past and you add PARAGARD, which has fairly significant U.S. income associated with it, obviously higher U.S. taxes associated with that, that moves us up towards the 11% this year. And then the other tax changes move us up to the 15%, keeping in mind that under that scenario, PARAGARD is actually a positive because the positive tax rate is a positive for PARAGARD and our CooperSurgical business. So that's kind of the flow. I mean, as you can imagine, as you know, there's a lot that goes into that, but at this point in time, based on the measures that are out there, that's where we see taxes coming out."

And then of course, we'll be rolling out the MyDay toric into really the biggest toric market in the world and in the sweet spot of that market, which is the 1-day, which is driving the whole market. When you think about the whole market being up for the quarter 15% and other being up 3%, or more importantly for the year the market being up 12% in single use and us -- and everything else flat, we are the driver of the market growth in the all other bucket, and we continue to gain share in the single use bucket. So a good profile. And of course, the catalyst for that is clariti and MyDay, the silicone hydrogel 1-day products we have."

As far as looking at the competitors, looking at the overall market, if the overall market does move up to the 7-plus arena, I'm not going to totally complain about that as long as we're growing. Basically, we've guided our midpoint 7% and we expect to continue to gain market share. There is, as I pointed out, some easy comps. The fact that our competitors grew over the prior year when the prior year, for example, was only 1% and this year was 7%. We frequently follow the -- with many of the analysts, use a 2-year stacking. So if I look at a 2-year stacking, 7% this year, 1% last year, midpoint 8%, overall, the market has been growing 5% on a trailing 12 month, that's more indicative. So there's a little bit of anomalies in the 7%, but if the 7% stays because of momentum going forward, we think we'll do well with that and continuing to gain market share."

On discounting and pricing, of course, the industry's been a master at trading up, trading up and trading up. And to overlay on that, we, as an industry, there was a fair amount of price increases the last 12 months. On the flip side, there has been a lot of -- not so much discounting but rebating. A lot of that is focused in on try and you'll like it, trying to get you to convert to 1-day. The strategy is working well, as we can see from the growth of the 1-day being the driver of the overall market for the last 4 years in a row now, and that will continue into the future. So the fact that there are discounts to incentivize or rebates to incentivize you to transition from a 2-week space into the 1-day space, which it were a OASYS 2-week [ noncompliant ] going to OASYS 1-day, that's 800% trade-up. There is a lot of room for rebating and incentives to get you to make the switch. Today, trade-up to 1-day is still a 400% to 600% step-up in revenue at the manufacturer level. So we'd trade up all day even if we had to give rebates all day. And that -- we've now hit the flip point where there is more revenue generated by 1-day than there is revenue generated by non-1-day; so this last quarter, $1.5 billion in revenue in single use and only $975 million in non-single-use. We're now past the 50% market. How is Cooper doing? We continue to be the driver of the 1-day particularly within the space of the silicone hydrogel. For example, the last 12 months, we're up 50% year-over-year, whereas the overall market is up 28% year-over-year, up for silicone hydrogel 1-day lenses. And of course, you've seen our overall numbers. Market was up 13%, single-use, and we were up 15%, single-use, for the quarter. So we're -- we think there's a lot of legs left in it. And the roll-out of MyDay toric would only further enhance that -- those market share gains as well."

We still have market share that is in around 30% market share worldwide in a growth market. But the long and the short of it is others have played a little catch-up in the market. It is still a small part of the market. So when you look at the overall market, multifocals are 8%. We're at 10% of our revenue in multifocals.

They're kind of between a rock and a hard spot. We have nothing to lose because we have 2 great products, premium and low cost.

First, Bob, I was wondering if you could provide us an update on -- in the fourth quarter -- in the past quarter, you've talked about what your daily disposable silicone hydrogel lenses grew in total versus your frequent replacement silicone hydrogel lenses. I don't believe you provided that in your provided remarks. And then secondly, Bob, could you just give us your opinion on the state of subscription offerings? I guess, globally but also in the U.S., there's been some M&A as it relates to that. And I know you guys have your LensFerry product. So I'm just wondering for an update on that."

We have companies out there like Hubble and different things. We've been kind of leading the way with home delivery outside the U.S. for many, many, many years, so highly experienced with that model. And of course, it's an enhancer for the eye care professional. So it's not a bad model. From our perspective, important for that model is having a couple of things: One is private label for those that want to embark on their own design and model. Number two is having a broad -- the broadest product portfolio of spheres, torics and multifocals still makes it more attractive that you can do more things with it. I understand that companies -- and I'll pick on Hubble for the moment. Like Hubble will continue to have a very narrow generic offering, importing products from Taiwan. So that only can get so far. At the end of the day, eye care professionals -- try to tell an eye care professional, you'll all have to convert to -- writing script for generic sphere from Taiwan will only get you so far in terms of developing the model. You're going to need the breadth of products. There are reasons doctors prescribe silicone hydrogel, there are reasons doctors prescribe torics, and there are reasons they prescribe multifocals. And they're a lot more complicated to fit than just a generic model that is tempting to have the patient influence the eye care professional on what to prescribe. That's a tough model."

We've experienced that more recently within genetic testing, within the IVF space. And there are some competitors in that space who are getting very aggressive with price, interestingly companies who are losing significant amounts of money. And I guess as long as people are willing to give them money and their strategy is just to do as many tests as can be, we could continue to experience some pressure there. But we'll stick by our strategy of running a good, profitable business and putting money into R&D and developing improved test and so forth. So we'll see how that plays out. I think that we could face that a little bit more as we move through fiscal '18."

Al, you had mentioned that the incremental investments in the distribution center and maybe some above and beyond sales force investments, things like that, were $0.11 to the fiscal fourth quarter. How does that continue into 2018? I know you said those will continue, but if FX is a $0.38 tailwind, what are those investments offsetting? And then if PARAGARD is $0.70, are there any other pluses and minuses we should be thinking about in the quarter -- or for the year, I'm sorry?"

I'll give a little color on that because the guidance that we're giving here for fiscal '18 is clearly quite a bit stronger than what we indicated it would be back on our September call, meaning we're hurdling a good $0.20, $0.25 of FX. We're also hurdling the medical device tax that we talked about, which is about $3 million. So the numbers look pretty good. Now having said that, we are investing within sales and marketing, distribution, some other areas in the business. We're going to continue to do that. Even though currency and so forth has moved against us, we are -- we have not cut back on those investments. So we're able to put up this guidance because of fundamental strength in the business itself, be it operating margins and leveraging OpEx in some parts of the business, leveraging our improvements within cost of goods. Things look pretty good kind of throughout the P&L. So I won't get too specific on how much we're going to spend each quarter. I guess I'd probably just say that we're investing in the business. We're excited about it. We're excited about growth. We're excited about taking market share. We're -- there's a number of areas within CooperVision. They're going really well that we want to continue to invest in. PARAGARD, it looks like there's a lot of upside in that. So we're pretty excited about that. We're going to continue to hire people there and invest in sales and marketing on that part of the business. So suffice it to say, feeling pretty good and not stopping investing in the business to continue to drive top line growth."
