With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.The Private Securities Litigation Reform Ac",991,"Thank you, and good evening. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
We are pleased to report that revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28, was $1,281,000,000, an increase of 5.3% over last year's third quarter. The organic growth rates, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, was 6.5%. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 7.3%. Third quarter gross margin improved to 44.2% from 43.1% last year. As Cintas Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, stated in this afternoon's press release, this is our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. This and our industry-leading revenue growth are indicative of a healthy company with significant opportunities ahead. We thank our employees, whom we call partners for best-in-class execution and results.
Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 45%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 44.8%, a year-over-year increase of 260 basis points, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of a difficult comparison due to favorable worker's comp. experienced in the prior year third quarter. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue as we continue to prepare for the acquisition of G&K Services.
Operating income for the third quarter of $195 million increased 0.9% from last year's third quarter. Operating income margin was 15.2% compared to 15.9% in last year's third quarter. Third quarter operating income included $9 million or 0.7% of third quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K. Excluding this G&K transaction-related expense, our operating income margin was 15.9%.
We're pleased with our incremental profit margins. Note that our third quarter had 1 less workday than last year. This had a negative impact of approximately 40 to 50 basis points on this year's operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. In addition, as Paul will soon discuss in greater detail, energy has a negative impact on this year's third quarter operating margin of 50 basis points. So to put it in perspective, excluding G&K transaction expenses, operating margin was the same as last year's third quarter despite about 100 basis points of headwinds from 1 less workday and energy.
Net income and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $119 million and $1.08, respectively. This quarter's EPS included a positive $0.03 impact from a change in the accounting for equity compensation as required under ASU 2016-09. Remember that this benefit shows up in a way of a lower effective tax rate, offset by higher equity compensation expense and share count. We also had a $0.06 negative impact from expenses related to the G&K transaction, such as legal and professional expenses associated with the regulatory review. Exclusive of these items, EPS was $1.11.
Yesterday, we closed on the acquisition of G&K. First and most importantly, I want to welcome our new partners from G&K. We look forward to getting to know you better, and we remain very excited about this opportunity. As we discussed, we continue to expect annual synergies in the range of $130 million to $140 million in the fourth full year following the acquisition. We will now begin the process of integrating the 2 companies together.
As Scott Farmer indicated in today's press release, we have pulled our revenue and EPS guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, because we need to complete the purchase accounting process and confirm our assumption used in estimating nonrecurring costs. For example, in an acquisition of this size, we are required to use a third party to value our intangibles. There can be a fairly wide range of outcomes in this type of analysis, and we won't know that outcome until the third party completes this process. Another example is that we need to record all G&K fixed assets and inventory at fair value. Much of this work is performed by a third-party firm. Again, we will not know these values until the process is completed. In the absence of this information, providing a meaningful guidance range for our fourth fiscal quarter is not possible at this time.
Paul will soon provide additional details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Paul though, I wanted to add that we are very pleased with our third quarter results. Excluding the impact of the G&K acquisition, that will come in our fourth quarter, our third quarter results keep us on pace to attain the annual guidance previously provided and to achieve a seventh consecutive year of organic growth in the mid to high single digits, with double-digit growth in EPS.
I will now turn the call over to Paul."

First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. As Mike stated, it was this quarter, the third quarter of fiscal 2017, that had 1 less day than the prior year quarter. 1 less day will negativ",1336,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. As Mike stated, it was this quarter, the third quarter of fiscal 2017, that had 1 less day than the prior year quarter. 1 less day will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points, and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. The negative impact on the fiscal 2017 third quarter was about 40 to 50 basis points of revenue growth and about 40 to 50 basis points of operating margin. Our fiscal fourth quarter contained 66 workdays, the same number as the prior year fourth quarter.
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $993 million, an increase of 6.1% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, acquisitions and workday differences, the organic growth rate was 7.3% compared to 6.5% last quarter. We continue to see the impact of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industry. However, as we predicted on last quarter's earnings call, the impact has lessened. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 60 basis points in the third quarter. This compares to about a 75 basis point headwind in the previous quarter.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from 44.0% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related costs were about 20 basis points higher than in last year's third quarter. In addition, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year third quarter operating margin by about 30 basis points. So on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 50 basis points. Keep in mind that margins were also negatively impacted by 1 less day of revenue. Therefore, gross margin expansion of 100 basis points was achieved despite about 100 basis points of headwind from 1 less workday and energy.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $124 million, which was 4.4% higher than last year's third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 5.5%.
Last quarter, we disclosed that we believe that the First Aid segment organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates. Acceleration in the organic growth rate from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% this quarter was expected. Route consolidation and optimization have been completed. We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base through penetration with our broad range of products and services. We expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year.
This segment's gross margin was 44.8% in the third quarter compared to 42.2% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 260 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 51% over 2 years ago and up 18% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue, of course, is significantly greater.
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $163 million, an increase of 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 2.4%. All Other gross margin was 39.1% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 38.9% for last year's third quarter. The Direct Sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are, such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow at a consistently rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was just short of 10%.
As Mike stated earlier, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of a difficult comparison due to favorable workers' compensation experience in the prior year third quarter. We are self-insured, which can result in some volatility from time to time. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue as we continue to prepare for the acquisition of G&K. Finally, this year's third quarter includes SAP expenses amounting to about 20 basis points of revenue.
Regarding SAP, since last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been converted. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Due to the acquisition of G&K, we are planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 34.5% compared to 33.8% for last year's third quarter. This year's third quarter rate is lower than historical rates due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. Note that last year's third quarter effective tax rate benefited from the closing of a federal tax audit with favorable results.
Our cash balances as of February 28 were $147 million, and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from investing -- or cash flow rather from operating activities in the current year quarter was $182 million and free cash flow was about $119 million. Uses of cash in the third quarter included CapEx and payment of our regular annual dividend.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $63 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $55 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $5 million in First Aid and Safety; and $3 million in All Other.
As of February 28, total debt was about $1.1 billion consisting of $399 million in short-term debt and $745 million of long-term debt. Subsequent to quarter end, debt increased about $2.3 billion to fund the acquisition of G&K. Sources of acquisition funds included the following: $100 million of G&K senior notes; $50 million of additional existing Cintas senior notes due in 2022; $1 billion of senior notes due in 2027; $650 million of senior notes due in 2022; a new term loan of $250 million; and commercial paper of about $250 million. With this additional debt, we estimate that our leverage has increased to about 3.1x debt to EBITDA. Our goal is to reduce our leverage to 2x debt to EBITDA within 3 years. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance, $250 million of term loan and $250 million of commercial paper, we have structured our debt appropriately to achieve the goal.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

As it relates to the customer attrition or retention, I don't know that I expect much of a difference there, but let me speak a little bit towards revenue -- or thoughts on revenue in general. So when we think about the Cintas business as we move forward, we have no expectations for change. We continue to expect growth in that mid to high single digits. When we think about the G&K revenue, though, you can think about it in terms of there's a new business component, there is the kind of customer penetration component, and there's a lost business or attrition component in the normal course of doing business. And as we move forward, we're going to continue to have that customer attrition that we've seen in -- that G&K has seen historically and that will likely see -- continue into the future. There will likely be a little bit of an increase due to disruption of the integration but generally speaking, I would say not a lot of change. The difference, though, will be the new business component. So as you can kind of think about new business and the G&K sales team over the course of the last 7 months, they've been trying to sell in an environment where selling a 5-year contract under kind of an uncertain future is, as you can imagine, is quite difficult. So the new business component certainly has been pressured quite a bit over the last 7 months. As we move into now the post-closing process, that momentum carries into our post-closing process. In addition, as we think about their sales people, you can imagine that the difficulty in selling new business in contractual new business in the environment resulted in some attrition. And so as we move forward, we will need to hire new people to replace some of those salespeople but also train all of their salespeople as we move forward. So training them on selling our products and services, training them on our systems, using our processes, et cetera and there certainly will be a productivity -- a negative productivity impact. So as we look forward, we will continue to probably see the normal customer attrition that the business has seen maybe a little bit higher, but we will also see some significant pressures on the new business. And so as we think about that moving forward, our experience has been, for years and years, that we will see some pressure to the point where we may see revenue come down in the 5% to 10% range over the course of the next year or so."

And that was a requirement so that we were not jumping ahead of the regulatory process. And I tell you that because we are just now -- we just closed yesterday. We are just now getting into the confirming of our assumptions. And we need to do that before we can provide more timing -- more specific timing on the synergies. But we do feel like we will be accretive in year 2. And in year 1, we're going to have some one-time expenses that are nonrecurring in nature, things like rebranding, asset impairments, severance, lease breakage-type things. And we're going to be -- going to work over the course of the next several months really confirming what those amounts will be. Once we do that, once we confirm our assumptions for the integration plan, we'll have a better idea of what fiscal '18 will look like and our expectation would be, we'd certainly share that in July.

Again, we haven't had visibility and insight until really starting today. And we'll start to learn that more and more. So it's hard for me to try to estimate what any revenue penetration might be. We have told -- we have talked a lot about -- if you think about our Uniform Rental customers, for example, the highest penetrated item is our mats, entrance mats. And I would say about 60% of our Uniform Rental customers have entrance mats. That doesn't mean they have as many as we believe that they should have but it means they have at least some presence in the entrance mat. In addition to that, all of our other products are less than 20% penetrated. So we have a lot of runway on our own. And I would suspect that G&K's profile is, from a Uniform Rental and mats, is probably not elective and in ours, although that is purely a guess. And I would say that the broader line for us likely in the hygiene and the chemical cleaning, First Aid and Safety, fire protection, those become nice opportunities. I don't have any kind of information as far as quantifying that because we just don't know enough about those customers. And an example would be I want to see -- or we would want to see the profile of the G&K customers. And that's when we start to analyze or look for the opportunities in terms of what other products and services we can provide to them. So we need some time to be able to do that. I -- as it relates to your second question of retention, I again, don't have specifics on that, but I would say that they are probably not too different from ours although I would suggest that because our growth rate is so much higher than the industry in general that our retention is likely a little bit better."

And then second, the SAP cost that you previously outlined, the $40 million to $45 million for 2018, how should we think about that number now that you're bringing in G&K?

And the additional -- any additional cost related to integration of G&K will come in the way of a lengthened integration or implementation process. So I wouldn't expect that it drives up our costs in fiscal '18. I would just -- I think we've talked a little bit about it drives the implementation process into fiscal '19.

In terms of the margins though, we're -- the gross margins continue to improve. We mentioned in the prepared remarks how much the dollars are up over a couple of years, 50-some-odd percent, 18% year-over-year increase in gross margin dollars. The incremental gross margins have been very strong. Last year, they were in the 30% range. This year, last 2 quarters, they're 100%. So gross margins are moving along as we expected as we continue to realize those synergies. SG&A, we do have a little bit of a heavier investment in the selling part of that component as we mentioned in our first quarter. We invested in the sales force to be able to grow that acquired big block of ZEE business. And they've only been there what, a quarter or 2 at most. They'll continue to become more productive.

The organic growth rates, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, was 6.5%. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 7.3%. Third quarter gross margin improved to 44.2% from 43.1% last year. As Cintas Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, stated in this afternoon's press release, this is our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. This and our industry-leading revenue growth are indicative of a healthy company with significant opportunities ahead. We thank our employees, whom we call partners for best-in-class execution and results.
Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 45%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 44.8%, a year-over-year increase of 260 basis points, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of a difficult comparison due to favorable worker's comp. experienced in the prior year third quarter. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue as we continue to prepare for the acquisition of G&K Services.
Operating income for the third quarter of $195 million increased 0.9% from last year's third quarter. Operating income margin was 15.2% compared to 15.9% in last year's third quarter. Third quarter operating income included $9 million or 0.7% of third quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K. Excluding this G&K transaction-related expense, our operating income margin was 15.9%.
We're pleased with our incremental profit margins. Note that our third quarter had 1 less workday than last year. This had a negative impact of approximately 40 to 50 basis points on this year's operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. In addition, as Paul will soon discuss in greater detail, energy has a negative impact on this year's third quarter operating margin of 50 basis points. So to put it in perspective, excluding G&K transaction expenses, operating margin was the same as last year's third quarter despite about 100 basis points of headwinds from 1 less workday and energy.
Net income and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $119 million and $1.08, respectively. This quarter's EPS included a positive $0.03 impact from a change in the accounting for equity compensation as required under ASU 2016-09. Remember that this benefit shows up in a way of a lower effective tax rate, offset by higher equity compensation expense and share count. We also had a $0.06 negative impact from expenses related to the G&K transaction, such as legal and professional expenses associated with the regulatory review. Exclusive of these items, EPS was $1.11.
Yesterday, we closed on the acquisition of G&K. First and most importantly, I want to welcome our new partners from G&K. We look forward to getting to know you better, and we remain very excited about this opportunity. As we discussed, we continue to expect annual synergies in the range of $130 million to $140 million in the fourth full year following the acquisition. We will now begin the process of integrating the 2 companies together.
As Scott Farmer indicated in today's press release, we have pulled our revenue and EPS guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, because we need to complete the purchase accounting process and confirm our assumption used in estimating nonrecurring costs. For example, in an acquisition of this size, we are required to use a third party to value our intangibles. There can be a fairly wide range of outcomes in this type of analysis, and we won't know that outcome until the third party completes this process. Another example is that we need to record all G&K fixed assets and inventory at fair value. Much of this work is performed by a third-party firm. Again, we will not know these values until the process is completed. In the absence of this information, providing a meaningful guidance range for our fourth fiscal quarter is not possible at this time.
Paul will soon provide additional details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Paul though, I wanted to add that we are very pleased with our third quarter results. Excluding the impact of the G&K acquisition, that will come in our fourth quarter, our third quarter results keep us on pace to attain the annual guidance previously provided and to achieve a seventh consecutive year of organic growth in the mid to high single digits, with double-digit growth in EPS.
I will now turn the call over to Paul."

First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. As Mike stated, it was this quarter, the third quarter of fiscal 2017, that had 1 less day than the prior year quarter. 1 less day will negativ",1336,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. As Mike stated, it was this quarter, the third quarter of fiscal 2017, that had 1 less day than the prior year quarter. 1 less day will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points, and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. The negative impact on the fiscal 2017 third quarter was about 40 to 50 basis points of revenue growth and about 40 to 50 basis points of operating margin. Our fiscal fourth quarter contained 66 workdays, the same number as the prior year fourth quarter.
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $993 million, an increase of 6.1% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, acquisitions and workday differences, the organic growth rate was 7.3% compared to 6.5% last quarter. We continue to see the impact of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industry. However, as we predicted on last quarter's earnings call, the impact has lessened. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 60 basis points in the third quarter. This compares to about a 75 basis point headwind in the previous quarter.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from 44.0% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related costs were about 20 basis points higher than in last year's third quarter. In addition, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year third quarter operating margin by about 30 basis points. So on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 50 basis points. Keep in mind that margins were also negatively impacted by 1 less day of revenue. Therefore, gross margin expansion of 100 basis points was achieved despite about 100 basis points of headwind from 1 less workday and energy.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $124 million, which was 4.4% higher than last year's third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 5.5%.
Last quarter, we disclosed that we believe that the First Aid segment organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates. Acceleration in the organic growth rate from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% this quarter was expected. Route consolidation and optimization have been completed. We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base through penetration with our broad range of products and services. We expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year.
This segment's gross margin was 44.8% in the third quarter compared to 42.2% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 260 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 51% over 2 years ago and up 18% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue, of course, is significantly greater.
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $163 million, an increase of 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 2.4%. All Other gross margin was 39.1% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 38.9% for last year's third quarter. The Direct Sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are, such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow at a consistently rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was just short of 10%.
As Mike stated earlier, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of a difficult comparison due to favorable workers' compensation experience in the prior year third quarter. We are self-insured, which can result in some volatility from time to time. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue as we continue to prepare for the acquisition of G&K. Finally, this year's third quarter includes SAP expenses amounting to about 20 basis points of revenue.
Regarding SAP, since last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been converted. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Due to the acquisition of G&K, we are planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 34.5% compared to 33.8% for last year's third quarter. This year's third quarter rate is lower than historical rates due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. Note that last year's third quarter effective tax rate benefited from the closing of a federal tax audit with favorable results.
Our cash balances as of February 28 were $147 million, and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from investing -- or cash flow rather from operating activities in the current year quarter was $182 million and free cash flow was about $119 million. Uses of cash in the third quarter included CapEx and payment of our regular annual dividend.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $63 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $55 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $5 million in First Aid and Safety; and $3 million in All Other.
As of February 28, total debt was about $1.1 billion consisting of $399 million in short-term debt and $745 million of long-term debt. Subsequent to quarter end, debt increased about $2.3 billion to fund the acquisition of G&K. Sources of acquisition funds included the following: $100 million of G&K senior notes; $50 million of additional existing Cintas senior notes due in 2022; $1 billion of senior notes due in 2027; $650 million of senior notes due in 2022; a new term loan of $250 million; and commercial paper of about $250 million. With this additional debt, we estimate that our leverage has increased to about 3.1x debt to EBITDA. Our goal is to reduce our leverage to 2x debt to EBITDA within 3 years. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance, $250 million of term loan and $250 million of commercial paper, we have structured our debt appropriately to achieve the goal.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

As it relates to the customer attrition or retention, I don't know that I expect much of a difference there, but let me speak a little bit towards revenue -- or thoughts on revenue in general. So when we think about the Cintas business as we move forward, we have no expectations for change. We continue to expect growth in that mid to high single digits. When we think about the G&K revenue, though, you can think about it in terms of there's a new business component, there is the kind of customer penetration component, and there's a lost business or attrition component in the normal course of doing business. And as we move forward, we're going to continue to have that customer attrition that we've seen in -- that G&K has seen historically and that will likely see -- continue into the future. There will likely be a little bit of an increase due to disruption of the integration but generally speaking, I would say not a lot of change. The difference, though, will be the new business component. So as you can kind of think about new business and the G&K sales team over the course of the last 7 months, they've been trying to sell in an environment where selling a 5-year contract under kind of an uncertain future is, as you can imagine, is quite difficult. So the new business component certainly has been pressured quite a bit over the last 7 months. As we move into now the post-closing process, that momentum carries into our post-closing process. In addition, as we think about their sales people, you can imagine that the difficulty in selling new business in contractual new business in the environment resulted in some attrition. And so as we move forward, we will need to hire new people to replace some of those salespeople but also train all of their salespeople as we move forward. So training them on selling our products and services, training them on our systems, using our processes, et cetera and there certainly will be a productivity -- a negative productivity impact. So as we look forward, we will continue to probably see the normal customer attrition that the business has seen maybe a little bit higher, but we will also see some significant pressures on the new business. And so as we think about that moving forward, our experience has been, for years and years, that we will see some pressure to the point where we may see revenue come down in the 5% to 10% range over the course of the next year or so."

We are just now getting into the confirming of our assumptions. And we need to do that before we can provide more timing -- more specific timing on the synergies. But we do feel like we will be accretive in year 2.

Once we do that, once we confirm our assumptions for the integration plan, we'll have a better idea of what fiscal '18 will look like and our expectation would be, we'd certainly share that in July.

A lot of the hygiene products that we talked about in the past, our Sanis Signature Series, a new offering in the last couple of years, that's really helped us with penetration.

Again, we haven't had visibility and insight until really starting today. And we'll start to learn that more and more. So it's hard for me to try to estimate what any revenue penetration might be. We have told -- we have talked a lot about -- if you think about our Uniform Rental customers, for example, the highest penetrated item is our mats, entrance mats. And I would say about 60% of our Uniform Rental customers have entrance mats. That doesn't mean they have as many as we believe that they should have, but it means they have at least some presence in the entrance mat. In addition to that, all of our other products are less than 20% penetrated. So we have a lot of runway on our own. And I would suspect that G&K's profile is, from a Uniform Rental and mats, is probably not a lot different than ours, although that is purely a guess. And I would say that the broader line for us likely in the hygiene and the chemical cleaning, First Aid and Safety, fire protection, those become nice opportunities. I don't have any kind of information as far as quantifying that because we just don't know enough about those customers. And an example would be I want to see -- or we would want to see the profile of the G&K customers. And that's when we start to analyze or look for the opportunities in terms of what other products and services we can provide to them. So we need some time to be able to do that. I -- as it relates to your second question of retention, again, I don't have specifics on that, but I would say that they are probably not too different from ours, although I would suggest that because our growth rate is so much higher than the industry in general that our retention is likely a little bit better."

And the additional -- any additional cost related to an integration of G&K will come in the way of a lengthened integration or implementation process. So I wouldn't expect that it drives up our costs in fiscal '18. I would just -- I think we've talked a little bit about it drives the implementation process into fiscal '19.

We mentioned in the prepared remarks how much the dollars are up over a couple of years, 50-some-odd percent, 18% year-over-year increase in gross margin dollars. The incremental gross margins have been very strong. Last year, they were in the 30% range. This year, the last 2 quarters, they're 100%. So gross margins are moving along as we expected as we continue to realize those synergies. SG&A, we do have a little bit of a heavier investment in the selling part of that component as we mentioned in our first quarter. We invested in the sales force to be able to grow that acquired big block of ZEE business. And they've only been there, what, a quarter or 2 at most. They'll continue to become more productive.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
We are pleased to report that revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28, was $1,281,000,000, an increase of 5.3% over last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, was 6.5%. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 7.3%. Third quarter gross margin improved to 44.2% from 43.1% last year. As Cintas Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, stated in this afternoon's press release, this is our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. This and our industry-leading revenue growth are indicative of a healthy company with significant opportunities ahead. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for best-in-class execution and results.
Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 45%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 44.8%, a year-over-year increase of 260 basis points, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of a difficult comparison due to favorable worker's comp experience in the prior year third quarter. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue as we continued to prepare for the acquisition of G&K Services.
Operating income for the third quarter of $195 million increased 0.9% from last year's third quarter. Operating income margin was 15.2% compared to 15.9% in last year's third quarter. Third quarter operating income included $9 million or 0.7% of third quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K. Excluding this G&K transaction-related expense, our operating income margin was 15.9%.
We're pleased with our incremental profit margins. Note that our third quarter had 1 less workday than last year. This had a negative impact of approximately 40 to 50 basis points on this year's operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. In addition, as Paul will soon discuss in greater detail, energy had a negative impact on this year's third quarter operating margin of 50 basis points. So to put it in perspective, excluding G&K transaction expenses, operating margin was the same as last year's third quarter despite about 100 basis points of headwinds from 1 less workday and energy.
Net income and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $119 million and $1.08, respectively. This quarter's EPS included a positive $0.03 impact from a change in the accounting for equity compensation as required under ASU 2016-09. Remember that this benefit shows up in the way of a lower effective tax rate, offset by higher equity compensation expense and share count. We also had a $0.06 negative impact from expenses related to the G&K transaction, such as legal and professional expenses associated with the regulatory review. Exclusive of these items, EPS was $1.11.
Yesterday, we closed on the acquisition of G&K. First and most importantly, I want to welcome our new partners from G&K. We look forward to getting to know you better, and we remain very excited about this opportunity. As we've discussed, we continue to expect annual synergies in the range of $130 million to $140 million in the fourth full year following the acquisition. We will now begin the process of integrating the 2 companies together.
As Scott Farmer indicated in today's press release, we have pulled our revenue and EPS guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, because we need to complete the purchase accounting process and confirm our assumptions used in estimating nonrecurring costs. For example, in an acquisition of this size, we are required to use a third party to value our intangibles. There can be a fairly wide range of outcomes in this type of analysis, and we won't know that outcome until the third party completes its process. Another example is that we need to record all G&K fixed assets and inventory at fair value. Much of this work is performed by a third-party firm. Again, we will not know these values until the process is completed. In the absence of this information, providing a meaningful guidance range for our fourth fiscal quarter is not possible at this time.
Paul will soon provide additional details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Paul though, I wanted to add that we are very pleased with our third quarter results. Excluding the impact of the G&K acquisition, that will come in our fourth quarter, our third quarter results keep us on pace to attain the annual guidance previously provided and to achieve a seventh consecutive year of organic growth in the mid to high single digits, with double-digit growth in EPS.
I will now turn the call over to Paul."

First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. As Mike stated, it was this quarter, the third quarter of fiscal 2017, that had 1 less day than the prior year quarter. 1 less day will negativ",1336,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. As Mike stated, it was this quarter, the third quarter of fiscal 2017, that had 1 less day than the prior year quarter. 1 less day will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points, and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. The negative impact on the fiscal 2017 third quarter was about 40 to 50 basis points of revenue growth and about 40 to 50 basis points of operating margin. Our fiscal fourth quarter contained 66 workdays, the same number as the prior year fourth quarter.
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $993 million, an increase of 6.1% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, acquisitions and workday differences, the organic growth rate was 7.3% compared to 6.5% last quarter. We continue to see the impact of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industry. However, as we predicted on last quarter's earnings call, the impact has lessened. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 60 basis points in the third quarter. This compares to about a 75 basis point headwind in the previous quarter.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from 44.0% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related costs were about 20 basis points higher than in last year's third quarter. In addition, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year third quarter operating margin by about 30 basis points. So on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 50 basis points. Keep in mind that margins were also negatively impacted by 1 less day of revenue. Therefore, gross margin expansion of 100 basis points was achieved despite about 100 basis points of headwind from 1 less workday and energy.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $124 million, which was 4.4% higher than last year's third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 5.5%.
Last quarter, we disclosed that we believe that the First Aid segment's organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates. Acceleration in the organic growth rate from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% this quarter was expected. Route consolidation and optimization have been completed. We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base through penetration with our broad range of products and services. We expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year.
This segment's gross margin was 44.8% in the third quarter compared to 42.2% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 260 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 51% over 2 years ago and up 18% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue, of course, is significantly greater.
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $163 million, an increase of 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 2.4%. All Other gross margin was 39.1% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 38.9% for last year's third quarter. The Direct Sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are, such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow at a consistently rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was just short of 10%.
As Mike stated earlier, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of a difficult comparison due to favorable workers' compensation experience in the prior year third quarter. We are self-insured, which can result in some volatility from time to time. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue as we continued to prepare for the acquisition of G&K. Finally, this year's third quarter includes SAP expenses amounting to about 20 basis points of revenue.
Regarding SAP, since last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been converted. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Due to the acquisition of G&K, we are planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 34.5% compared to 33.8% for last year's third quarter. This year's third quarter rate is lower than historical rates due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. Note that last year's third quarter effective tax rate benefited from the closing of a federal tax audit with favorable results.
Our cash balances as of February 28 were $147 million, and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from investing -- or cash flow rather from operating activities in the current year quarter was $182 million and free cash flow was about $119 million. Uses of cash in the third quarter included CapEx and payment of our regular annual dividend.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $63 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $55 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $5 million in First Aid and Safety; and $3 million in All Other.
As of February 28, total debt was about $1.1 billion consisting of $399 million in short-term debt and $745 million of long-term debt. Subsequent to quarter end, debt increased about $2.3 billion to fund the acquisition of G&K. Sources of acquisition funds included the following: $100 million of G&K senior notes; $50 million of additional existing Cintas senior notes due in 2022; $1 billion of senior notes due in 2027; $650 million of senior notes due in 2022; a new term loan of $250 million; and commercial paper of about $250 million. With this additional debt, we estimate that our leverage has increased to about 3.1x debt to EBITDA. Our goal is to reduce our leverage to 2x debt to EBITDA within 3 years. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance, $250 million of term loan and $250 million of commercial paper, we have structured our debt appropriately to achieve the goal.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

As it relates to the customer attrition or retention, I don't know that I expect much of a difference there, but let me speak a little bit towards revenue -- or thoughts on revenue in general. So when we think about the Cintas business as we move forward, we have no expectations for change. We continue to expect growth in that mid to high single digits. When we think about the G&K revenue, though, you can think about it in terms of there's a new business component, there is the kind of customer penetration component, and there's a lost business or attrition component in the normal course of doing business. And as we move forward, we're going to continue to have that customer attrition that we've seen in -- that G&K has seen historically and that we'll likely see continue into the future. There will likely be a little bit of an increase due to disruption of the integration but generally speaking, I would say not a lot of change. The difference, though, will be the new business component. So as you can kind of think about new business and the G&K sales team over the course of the last 7 months, they've been trying to sell in an environment where selling a 5-year contract under kind of an uncertain future is, as you can imagine, is quite difficult. So the new business component certainly has been pressured quite a bit over the last 7 months. As we move into now the post-closing process, that momentum carries into our post-closing process. In addition, as we think about their sales people, you can imagine that the difficulty in selling new business -- in contractual new business in the environment resulted in some attrition. And so as we move forward, we will need to hire new people to replace some of those salespeople, but also train all of their salespeople as we move forward. So training them on selling our products and services, training them on our systems, using our processes, et cetera, and there certainly will be a productivity -- a negative productivity impact. So as we look forward, we will continue to probably see the normal customer attrition that the business has seen maybe a little bit higher, but we will also see some significant pressures on the new business. And so as we think about that moving forward, our experience has been, for years and years, that we will see some pressure to the point where we may see revenue come down in the 5% to 10% range over the course of the next year or so."

So that's been very consistent through this year and really in the near past as well. New business also includes the penetration of our existing customers, that is certainly part of our vision. And that continues at a very good pace. A lot of the hygiene products that we've talked about in the past, our Sanis Signature Series, a new offering in the last couple of years, that's really helped us with penetration.

Again, we haven't had visibility and insight until really starting today. And we'll start to learn that more and more. So it's hard for me to try to estimate what any revenue penetration might be. We have told -- we have talked a lot about -- if you think about our Uniform Rental customers, for example, the highest penetrated item is our mats, entrance mats. And I would say about 60% of our Uniform Rental customers have entrance mats. That doesn't mean they have as many as we believe that they should have, but it means they have at least some presence in the entrance mat. In addition to that, all of our other products are less than 20% penetrated. So we have a lot of runway on our own. And I would suspect that G&K's profile is, from a Uniform Rental and mats, is probably not a lot different than ours, although that is purely a guess. And I would say that the broader line for us likely in the hygiene and the chemical cleaning, First Aid and Safety, fire protection, those become nice opportunities. I don't have any kind of information as far as quantifying that because we just don't know enough about those customers. And an example would be, I'd want to see -- or we would want to see the profile of the G&K customers.

I -- as it relates to your second question of retention, again, I don't have specifics on that, but I would say that they are probably not too different from ours, although I would suggest that because our growth rate is so much higher than the industry in general that our retention is likely a little bit better."

So I wouldn't expect that it drives up our costs in fiscal '18. I would just -- I think we've talked a little bit about it drives the implementation process into fiscal '19.

The incremental gross margins have been very strong. Last year, they were in the 30% range. This year, the last 2 quarters, they're 100%. So gross margins are moving along as we expected as we continue to realize those synergies. SG&A, we do have a little bit of a heavier investment in the selling part of that component as we mentioned in our first quarter. We invested in the sales force to be able to grow that acquired big block of ZEE business. And they've only been there, what, a quarter or 2 at most. They'll continue to become more productive.

With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
We are pleased to report that revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28, was $1,281,000,000, an increase of 5.3% over last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, was 6.5%. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 7.3%. Third quarter gross margin improved to 44.2% from 43.1% last year. As Cintas Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, stated in this afternoon's press release, this is our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. This and our industry-leading revenue growth are indicative of a healthy company with significant opportunities ahead. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for best-in-class execution and results.
Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 45%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 44.8%, a year-over-year increase of 260 basis points, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of a difficult comparison due to favorable worker's comp experience in the prior year third quarter. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue as we continued to prepare for the acquisition of G&K Services.
Operating income for the third quarter of $195 million increased 0.9% from last year's third quarter. Operating income margin was 15.2% compared to 15.9% in last year's third quarter. Third quarter operating income included $9 million or 0.7% of third quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K. Excluding this G&K transaction-related expense, our operating income margin was 15.9%.
We're pleased with our incremental profit margins. Note that our third quarter had 1 less workday than last year. This had a negative impact of approximately 40 to 50 basis points on this year's operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. In addition, as Paul will soon discuss in greater detail, energy had a negative impact on this year's third quarter operating margin of 50 basis points. So to put it in perspective, excluding G&K transaction expenses, operating margin was the same as last year's third quarter despite about 100 basis points of headwinds from 1 less workday and energy.
Net income and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $119 million and $1.08, respectively. This quarter's EPS included a positive $0.03 impact from a change in the accounting for equity compensation as required under ASU 2016-09. Remember that this benefit shows up in the way of a lower effective tax rate, offset by higher equity compensation expense and share count. We also had a $0.06 negative impact from expenses related to the G&K transaction, such as legal and professional expenses associated with the regulatory review. Exclusive of these items, EPS was $1.11.
Yesterday, we closed on the acquisition of G&K. First and most importantly, I want to welcome our new partners from G&K. We look forward to getting to know you better, and we remain very excited about this opportunity. As we've discussed, we continue to expect annual synergies in the range of $130 million to $140 million in the fourth full year following the acquisition. We will now begin the process of integrating the 2 companies together.
As Scott Farmer indicated in today's press release, we have pulled our revenue and EPS guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, because we need to complete the purchase accounting process and confirm our assumptions used in estimating nonrecurring costs. For example, in an acquisition of this size, we are required to use a third party to value our intangibles. There can be a fairly wide range of outcomes in this type of analysis, and we won't know that outcome until the third party completes its process. Another example is that we need to record all G&K fixed assets and inventory at fair value. Much of this work is performed by a third-party firm. Again, we will not know these values until the process is completed. In the absence of this information, providing a meaningful guidance range for our fourth fiscal quarter is not possible at this time.
Paul will soon provide additional details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Paul though, I wanted to add that we are very pleased with our third quarter results. Excluding the impact of the G&K acquisition, that will come in our fourth quarter, our third quarter results keep us on pace to attain the annual guidance previously provided and to achieve a seventh consecutive year of organic growth in the mid to high single digits, with double-digit growth in EPS.
I will now turn the call over to Paul."

First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. As Mike stated, it was this quarter, the third quarter of fiscal 2017, that had 1 less day than the prior year quarter. 1 less day will negativ",1336,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. As Mike stated, it was this quarter, the third quarter of fiscal 2017, that had 1 less day than the prior year quarter. 1 less day will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points, and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. The negative impact on the fiscal 2017 third quarter was about 40 to 50 basis points of revenue growth and about 40 to 50 basis points of operating margin. Our fiscal fourth quarter contained 66 workdays, the same number as the prior year fourth quarter.
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $993 million, an increase of 6.1% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, acquisitions and workday differences, the organic growth rate was 7.3% compared to 6.5% last quarter. We continue to see the impact of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industry. However, as we predicted on last quarter's earnings call, the impact has lessened. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 60 basis points in the third quarter. This compares to about a 75 basis point headwind in the previous quarter.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from 44.0% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related costs were about 20 basis points higher than in last year's third quarter. In addition, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year third quarter operating margin by about 30 basis points. So on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 50 basis points. Keep in mind that margins were also negatively impacted by 1 less day of revenue. Therefore, gross margin expansion of 100 basis points was achieved despite about 100 basis points of headwind from 1 less workday and energy.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $124 million, which was 4.4% higher than last year's third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 5.5%.
Last quarter, we disclosed that we believe that the First Aid segment's organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates. Acceleration in the organic growth rate from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% this quarter was expected. Route consolidation and optimization have been completed. We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base through penetration with our broad range of products and services. We expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year.
This segment's gross margin was 44.8% in the third quarter compared to 42.2% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 260 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 51% over 2 years ago and up 18% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue, of course, is significantly greater.
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $163 million, an increase of 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 2.4%. All Other gross margin was 39.1% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 38.9% for last year's third quarter. The Direct Sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are, such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow at a consistently rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was just short of 10%.
As Mike stated earlier, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of a difficult comparison due to favorable workers' compensation experience in the prior year third quarter. We are self-insured, which can result in some volatility from time to time. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue as we continued to prepare for the acquisition of G&K. Finally, this year's third quarter includes SAP expenses amounting to about 20 basis points of revenue.
Regarding SAP, since last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been converted. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Due to the acquisition of G&K, we are planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 34.5% compared to 33.8% for last year's third quarter. This year's third quarter rate is lower than historical rates due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. Note that last year's third quarter effective tax rate benefited from the closing of a federal tax audit with favorable results.
Our cash balances as of February 28 were $147 million, and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from investing -- or cash flow rather from operating activities in the current year quarter was $182 million and free cash flow was about $119 million. Uses of cash in the third quarter included CapEx and payment of our regular annual dividend.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $63 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $55 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $5 million in First Aid and Safety; and $3 million in All Other.
As of February 28, total debt was about $1.1 billion consisting of $399 million in short-term debt and $745 million of long-term debt. Subsequent to quarter end, debt increased about $2.3 billion to fund the acquisition of G&K. Sources of acquisition funds included the following: $100 million of G&K senior notes; $50 million of additional existing Cintas senior notes due in 2022; $1 billion of senior notes due in 2027; $650 million of senior notes due in 2022; a new term loan of $250 million; and commercial paper of about $250 million. With this additional debt, we estimate that our leverage has increased to about 3.1x debt to EBITDA. Our goal is to reduce our leverage to 2x debt to EBITDA within 3 years. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance, $250 million of term loan and $250 million of commercial paper, we have structured our debt appropriately to achieve the goal.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

As it relates to the customer attrition or retention, I don't know that I expect much of a difference there, but let me speak a little bit towards revenue -- or thoughts on revenue in general. So when we think about the Cintas business as we move forward, we have no expectations for change. We continue to expect growth in that mid to high single digits. When we think about the G&K revenue, though, you can think about it in terms of there's a new business component, there is the kind of customer penetration component, and there's a lost business or attrition component in the normal course of doing business. And as we move forward, we're going to continue to have that customer attrition that we've seen in -- that G&K has seen historically and that we'll likely see continue into the future. There will likely be a little bit of an increase due to disruption of the integration but generally speaking, I would say not a lot of change. The difference, though, will be the new business component. So as you can kind of think about new business and the G&K sales team over the course of the last 7 months, they've been trying to sell in an environment where selling a 5-year contract under kind of an uncertain future is, as you can imagine, is quite difficult. So the new business component certainly has been pressured quite a bit over the last 7 months. As we move into now the post-closing process, that momentum carries into our post-closing process. In addition, as we think about their sales people, you can imagine that the difficulty in selling new business -- in contractual new business in the environment resulted in some attrition. And so as we move forward, we will need to hire new people to replace some of those salespeople, but also train all of their salespeople as we move forward. So training them on selling our products and services, training them on our systems, using our processes, et cetera, and there certainly will be a productivity -- a negative productivity impact. So as we look forward, we will continue to probably see the normal customer attrition that the business has seen maybe a little bit higher, but we will also see some significant pressures on the new business. And so as we think about that moving forward, our experience has been, for years and years, that we will see some pressure to the point where we may see revenue come down in the 5% to 10% range over the course of the next year or so."

We are just now getting into the confirming of our assumptions. And we need to do that before we can provide more timing -- more specific timing on the synergies.

A lot of the hygiene products that we've talked about in the past, our Sanis Signature Series, a new offering in the last couple of years, that's really helped us with penetration. Retention has been roughly 95%, so still strong. No significant change in that. So really, no significant movements in any of the key components of organic growth drivers."

Again, we haven't had visibility and insight until really starting today. And we'll start to learn that more and more. So it's hard for me to try to estimate what any revenue penetration might be. We have told -- we have talked a lot about -- if you think about our Uniform Rental customers, for example, the highest penetrated item is our mats, entrance mats. And I would say about 60% of our Uniform Rental customers have entrance mats. That doesn't mean they have as many as we believe that they should have, but it means they have at least some presence in the entrance mat. In addition to that, all of our other products are less than 20% penetrated. So we have a lot of runway on our own. And I would suspect that G&K's profile is, from a Uniform Rental and mats, is probably not a lot different than ours, although that is purely a guess. And I would say that the broader line for us likely in the hygiene and the chemical cleaning, First Aid and Safety, fire protection, those become nice opportunities. I don't have any kind of information as far as quantifying that because we just don't know enough about those customers. And an example would be, I'd want to see -- or we would want to see the profile of the G&K customers. And that's when we start to analyze or look for the opportunities in terms of what other products and services we can provide to them. So we need some time to be able to do that. I -- as it relates to your second question of retention, again, I don't have specifics on that, but I would say that they are probably not too different from ours, although I would suggest that because our growth rate is so much higher than the industry in general that our retention is likely a little bit better."

So I wouldn't expect that it drives up our costs in fiscal '18. I would just -- I think we've talked a little bit about it drives the implementation process into fiscal '19.

And with the exception of the oil and gas vertical, which we've, in fact, seen get a little bit better, we haven't seen much of a change one way or the other.

In terms of the margins, though, we're -- the gross margins continue to improve. We mentioned in the prepared remarks how much the dollars are up over a couple of years, 50-some-odd percent, 18% year-over-year increase in gross margin dollars. The incremental gross margins have been very strong. Last year, they were in the 30% range. This year, the last 2 quarters, they're 100%. So gross margins are moving along as we expected as we continue to realize those synergies. SG&A, we do have a little bit of a heavier investment in the selling part of that component as we mentioned in our first quarter. We invested in the sales force to be able to grow that acquired big block of ZEE business. And they've only been there, what, a quarter or 2 at most. They'll continue to become more productive.

We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
We are pleased to report that revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31, was $1,530,000,000, an increase of 23.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.1%. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. 
The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 8%. And the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.2%. Fourth quarter gross margin improved to 44.4% from 43.9% last year. This is our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. Operating income for the fourth quarter of $177.3 million decreased 11.2% from last year's fourth quarter. Fiscal 2017 fourth quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $63.7 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition. Excluding G&K results and acquisition charges as well as a benefit from a change in the accounting for equity compensation as required by a recent accounting standard, our operating income margin was 16.4% versus 16.1% last year, an improvement of 30 basis points. 
Net income and earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 were $82.2 million and $0.75, respectively. Fiscal '17 fourth quarter EPS included a positive impact of $0.02 from the change in the accounting for equity compensation and a $0.05 from the G&K business. Fiscal '17 fourth quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.50 from transaction and integration expenses and certain incremental nonrecurring bank fees included in the interest expense related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.18 versus $1.06 last year, an 11% increase over last year's fourth quarter. 
Our fiscal 2017 results added to our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 46 of the past 48 years, with the only exception being the great recession years. For the seventh consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid- to high single digits. We continue to grow by multiples in excess of both gross domestic products and employment. For the seventh consecutive year, we grew EPS double digits, excluding the G&K results and acquisition-related items as well as the benefit from ASU 2016-09. And we increased the annual dividend for the 33rd consecutive year.
For Cintas, the past is indicative of the future because of the constant we share, which is our culture. Our culture is part of our strategy and drives our meaningful performance. We value honesty and integrity, competitive urgency and challenging the status quo in a positive manner. Profitable growth is in our DNA. The opportunities for us to seize are significant. We get inspired garments, health care scrub rental and branded rental garments like Carhartt, our recent investments in the product line which have a long runway. Our First Aid and Safety business has a run rate of more than $500 million, and yet we just recently completed our national footprint. National account opportunities also remain. And despite acquiring a significant competitor, new business wins were up significantly over last year. Also, our fire services business is only in about 70 of the top 100 largest markets in North America.
We continue to evolve as a business services company, helping over 1 million customers get Ready for the Workday. With an array of products and services including dust mask, hygiene products, first aid products and services and fire protection services, we have a product or service for every business in North America. Our opportunity for continued growth is the 16 million businesses we currently don't do business with. 
Not only is the opportunity significant to expand market share, but we have huge potential to grow revenue and profit by penetrating our existing customer base. Within our uniform-wearing customer base, our penetration rates of other products and services, with the exception of entrance mats, are less than 20%. And less than 10% of our customers do business with 2 or more of our business units. We've added sales reps specifically focused on penetrating existing customers. They are supported by a national branding campaign whose purpose is to educate on all that we can do for businesses so they can concentrate on their core competencies. 
Cintas is a business that was built to last and that building doesn't stop. Our focus on the long-term means that we make the needed investments. Our investment in an enterprise resource planning system is a significant one. The implementation of SAP will continue into fiscal year 2020 due to the additional operations from the G&K acquisition. Once completed, SAP will produce cost savings and will better equip us to cross-sell. We will be a stronger company with this new technology.
And finally, we are excited about our recent acquisition of G&K. Preliminary results are very encouraging. We are on track to meet our financial and nonfinancial objectives and look forward to the many opportunities G&K provides.
The synergies are compelling and result from the significant overlap in operations. Route density will also improve. We can spend more time helping customers solve their problems. We will have more time to sell into the accounts. The cost synergies alone will improve G&K operating margins to about 25% in 4 years. 
So in sum, our record of success is a lengthy one. The past has been great but the future too is very bright. So looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.27 billion to $6.36 billion. And fiscal '18 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.25. Our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business: no transaction and integration expenses; revenue of $870 million to $900 million, compared to a prior year run rate of $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; purchase price amortization expense related to intangible assets of $50 million; interest expense on G&K acquisition debt of about $65 million; and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.17. Again, this EPS guidance does not include any G&K transaction and integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these expenses in fiscal '18 as we continue to integrate the acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $65 million. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I want to discuss the G&K revenue guidance. We've discussed this over the course of the last year but want to be clear. Obviously, the 2 most significant components of revenue growth rate are new business and lost business. The legacy G&K operations, just like Cintas operations, will continue to have lost business in the normal course as contracts come up for renewal. The G&K lost business may be slightly higher than normal due to the disruption of the integration but not significantly so. The new business component from the legacy G&K sales reps though will significantly decrease for a temporary period. We are in the process of filling open positions and training all new reps on how to sell using the Cintas processes, how to sell Cintas products and services and to use the Cintas systems. As a result, the new business typically generated to offset the normal lost business will temporarily be reduced until the sales reps get back to their territories and begin to ramp productivity to normal levels. The result is that legacy G&K revenue will decline in fiscal '18. This was expected and we modeled the deal based upon this reality.
So now I'll turn the call over to Paul"

First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contain 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It was the third quarter that had 1 less day than the prior year quarter. 1 less workday negatively impacted fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. Looking ahead to fiscal '18, there will be no differences in workdays as fiscal '18 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal '17.
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consist of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,220,000,000, an increase of 27.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.6% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Current year fourth quarter gross margin, of course, included the margin on the acquired G&K business, which was 40.2% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the acquired G&K business, the Cintas legacy Uniform Rental and Facility Services business gross margin improved 100 basis points from 44.4% to 45.4%. The G&K gross margin will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we realize the synergies from the acquisition. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a currently lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is 80 basis points higher than the Cintas legacy business. This is of the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin.
Our First Aid and Safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $134 million, which was 9.4% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 9.2%.
I want to take some time to revisit the impact of the ZEE Medical business on this segment's organic growth rate. We've acquired ZEE in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. ZEE was a significant acquisition, increasing the total First Aid business by about 1/3. In our fiscal 2017 second quarter, 15 months after the acquisition, this segment's organic growth rate was less than the typical high single digits. This lower organic growth rate was due to 2 main reasons: first, not only was the acquired ZEE business significant in size, but it was also not growing. The ZEE business pre-acquisition had no sales force; second, our focus in the first year of an acquisition is to secure the customer base and earn the trust of the acquired customers through outstanding service. On our second quarter earnings call of this fiscal year, we disclosed that we believe that the First Aid segment's organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates. We added sales reps to grow the ZEE customer base with our broad range of products and services. And meanwhile, the legacy Cintas First Aid and Safety business continue to grow at a strong pace. As we expected, our organic growth rate did climb from the bottom, increasing from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% in the third quarter, and now 9.2% in the fourth quarter. Thus, the decline in the organic growth rate was expected due to the weight of the acquired business, and it was temporary. This segment has returned to its customary organic growth rates in the high single digits, and on a significantly larger revenue base.
This segment's gross margin was 44.5% from the fourth quarter compared to 42.9% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 160 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of ZEE acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses.
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $175 million, an increase of 9.2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 8.3%. All Other gross margin was 42.8% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42% for last year's fourth quarter. The Direct Sale business, by its nature, is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. We installed some large accounts in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, driving double-digit organic growth in this business. One of these accounts was Southwest Airlines. Majority of the product was shipped and recognized as revenue at the end of fiscal 2017 as opposed to early fiscal 2018, as originally expected.
On July 11, 2017, we sold a business that was not a good strategic fit. The business was reported as discontinued operations for the periods ended May 31, 2017, and 2016. Revenue and EPS for the sold business were about $26 million and $0.01, respectively, in Q4 of fiscal '17, and $28 million and $0.02, respectively, in Q4 of fiscal 2016.
Revenue and EPS for the business were about $105 million and $0.07, respectively, for the full fiscal year of 2017; and $110 million and $0.07, respectively, for the full fiscal year of 2016. These amounts are important to remember as you consider our fiscal 2018 guidance. Proceeds from the sale, net of taxes paid, will be approximately $85 million. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 27.9% in last year's fourth quarter. 60 of the 70 basis points is attributable to the amortization expense of the intangible assets established in the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 37.8% compared to 37.2% for last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be about 34%. Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31 was $169 million. And we had $22 million of marketable securities as of quarter end.
Cash flow from operating activities in the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter was $280 million and free cash flow was $225 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were approximately $55 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $45 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $7 million in First Aid and Safety and $3 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. 
As of May 31, total debt was about $3,133,000,000, consisting of $363 million in short-term debt and $2,770,000,000 of long-term debt. Our leverage at May 31 was 2.8x debt-to-EBITDA. Subsequent to May 31, we repaid $50 million of the term loan. We expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance, $200 million of term loan and commercial paper, we have structured our debt to help us achieve our goal of reducing leverage to 2.0x debt-to-EBITDA.
Regarding SAP, this last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been converted to the system. As of the end of this month, we will have converted about 30 locations. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. New to the acquisition of G&K, we are adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary. Certain G&K acquisition locations will also be converted to SAP. And therefore, because of this additional work, we expect the implementation to extend through fiscal 2020. The good news is that we can leverage the system over an even larger organization because the SAP hardware and software costs will not increase. They are sunk costs. We expect that fiscal 2018 SAP expenses will amount to approximately $30 million. This compares to about $12 million in fiscal 2017. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So let me maybe talk a little bit about the synergies real quickly. We spent the fourth quarter really confirming our assumptions with our integration plan. And the good news is we did not see anything that changed our mind about our opportunity. No unforeseen issues. We still expect that we'll achieve $130 million to $140 million in synergies. So that's -- I think that was 1 step, and that was a good start for us. We didn't do many integration activities in the fourth quarter because of the confirming and really spending time communicating with our new partners and our new customers. However, we've gotten pretty busy in June and July. And in June, we did convert the G&K payroll to our payroll system. That's a big first step and that went very well. We have converted to our -- to the Cintas financial system, that's another big step that went well. And we've gone through the first few waves of branch consolidations, and those have gone well. And so I think we're off to a good start. No, surprises as of yet. And we really like what we've seen so far. We mentioned that the year 1 synergies are $50 million to $55 million. And let me step back and say we did announce that we were closing the corporate headquarters, and that is -- that closure is proceeding. And so certainly, the year 1 synergies are certainly coming some from the corporate closures and other G&A activities, probably more than half of those first year synergies. And the rest are from the integration activities of the integration of locations. Again, we think that most of those integration activities are going to happen in the first 2 years. The synergy recognition though generally will happen in the 12 months following that integration activity. So in year 1, we're going to see $50 million to $55 million. In year 2, I think, we'll see another meaningful increase in synergies. And in year 3, we'll see the annualizing of the year 2 synergy -- I'm sorry, the year 2 integration activities. We'll also start to see some sourcing benefits in that third year. And we expect to fully realize the $130 million to $140 million in year 4. So that's a little bit of the cadence of the synergy recognition. And let's just -- it's a little bit of a nuance, but the integration activities are a little bit different than the synergy recognition."

Our revenue is roughly half uniform. And then I'll move maybe into our Rental segment, about half of the Rental segment is nonuniform, so Facility Services making -- made up of entrance mats, hygiene products, chemical cleaning solutions, et cetera. So today, compared to, let's call it, 10 years ago, the percentage of uniform revenue is certainly lower than then. It was probably closer to the 7 -- 60% to 70% range back then. The only thing I would say is we have worked hard not just to create solutions that are nonuniform but also within our uniform programs. We worked hard to great innovative products, retail-inspired products, garment-solution-based products that can reach new and different customers even in a time when there is no employment growth. So in other words, we think there is a large unserved opportunity our there. And we have products and services, I would say, today, that are better able to capture that unserved market than maybe 10 years ago. And so if we look back over the last 7 years-or-so, and I think we've talked about our revenue growth being multiples of GDP and employment, a lot of it is because of the innovative garments that people want to wear as well as then the nongarments solutions that we've created that really can create value for every type of business in America. So we feel good about that, a little bit of that decoupling from the employment that maybe tied us a little bit closer 10 years ago."

So we would not -- when we convert revenue from, let's call it, that legacy system to our system, that certainly is not organic growth to us. So why the acceleration in organic growth? I think it is because we continue to execute at very high levels. I think we got a little bit of benefit in this fourth quarter -- not I think, I know we got a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter from a bit of a bounce back in -- or a lessening of the negative in the oil and gas area. Last year, when we talked about fourth quarter performance, we have said that the headwind in oil and gas was about 100 basis points. This year, we would have said, I think in the third quarter, we said 60-basis-point headwind. We would say it's probably more like 30. And so the year-over-year comps in the oil and gas are starting to be beneficial. That won't last forever but starting to be beneficial. So I think we got a little bit of bounce from that. But most of it is we continue to execute well, our reps are very productive and customer retention remains in good."

But for now, I can tell you that the Cintas legacy Uniform Rental business, about 49% of the revenue, and I'm referring to the segment, not to the consolidated entity. So in looking at the uniform segment, 49% is garments; dust control is 18%; hygiene, which is restrooms, cleaning services, chemical services, that was 17% of revenue; shop towels were 4%; linen was 8%; and catalog sales were 4%. And then in comparison, for G&K, their Uniform Rental mix: the garments are 55% of total revenue; dust is 15%; hygiene is 3%; shop towels are 9%; and, let's see, linen is 14%; and catalog sales were 4%. So it really highlights what we had talked about previously that this is a business that doesn't have as broad of an offering as we do. And so some good opportunities for us in the future.

And so maybe I'll touch on that a bit. And so I'm speaking of the $130 million to $140 million now. We would expect that the largest bucket is the G&A stream. It's the elimination of redundant corporate processes as well as some location G&A expenses. The second largest would be -- the second largest bucket would be that production facility. So the combination of location, the elimination of redundant capacity is certainly a fairly good-sized opportunity for us. We think the third bucket will be the sourcing piece. And while that is one of the longer timeframes of this process, we think that's a good opportunity. We think that from a routing perspective, there certainly is the fuel benefits that Paul talked about from combining the route forces and creating much more density. But we're hesitant to say that there will be a lot of route consolidation. We definitely need capacity on our routes to make sure that we have the time to meet with our customers, the time to build relationships, to make the service calls that we need to make. And so we see that as certainly a route optimization opportunity. But we don't see that as one of the bigger, a consolidation being one of the bigger opportunities there because we like the capacity. We're generally, for the last probably 7 years, we've been adding routes every single year. And the last thing we want to do is to cut routes only to add them again. So it's really more about route optimization. And now as it relates to the timing of that, the -- an integration generally will mean the systems first. We have to get on the same system so that our different operations can speak to each other. And once we get on the same system, then the route optimization can happen. So it's usually following the location consolidation or system integration."

Yes, there are a few buckets that we can talk about. The first is Scrub Rental. We've talked about that in the past. Scrubs was largely a Direct Sale, new commodity, and we work to change it into a rental program with a service element to help hospitals and the other health care institutions, control their inventory through those dispensing units. But that's something we've really gotten into in earnest in the last 5 years. It's a huge market and it's a market that we are in the very early innings of penetrating. And so we're getting some good wins but we have a long way to go in that sector. Another good industry for us, the sector for us for no-programmers is in the trades areas. That Carhartt product line that we've talked about, that rugged look, those are garments that really appeal to people that work in the utility industries or plumbers, electricians, anyone in trades. And we've had a lot of traction in that product. So and then just in general, it's really the recognition that, and I think Mike mentioned this earlier, we have to gravitate in the product line to where the employment is. We've done a very good job of that by creating these garments, some are branded. But also creating garments that are more retail inspired, polos and microbial shirts, et cetera, that we can get into industries that are customer-facing like resorts, theme parks, et cetera. And so a lot of opportunity that just kind of gives you some idea of some of those no-programmers that are out there."

We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
We are pleased to report that revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31, was $1,530,000,000, an increase of 23.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.1%. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remain strong. 
The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 8%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.2%. Fourth quarter gross margin improved to 44.4% from 43.9% last year. This is our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. Operating income for the fourth quarter of $177.3 million decreased 11.2% from last year's fourth quarter. Fiscal 2017 fourth quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $63.7 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition. Excluding G&K results and acquisition charges as well as a benefit from a change in the accounting for equity compensation as required by a recent accounting standard, our operating income margin was 16.4% versus 16.1% last year, an improvement of 30 basis points. 
Net income and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 were $82.2 million and $0.75, respectively. Fiscal '17 fourth quarter EPS included a positive impact of $0.02 from the change in the accounting for equity compensation and of $0.05 from the G&K business. Fiscal '17 fourth quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.50 from transaction and integration expenses and certain incremental non-recurring bank fees included in the interest expense related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.18 versus $1.06 last year, an 11% increase over last year's fourth quarter. 
Our fiscal 2017 results added to our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 46 of the past 48 years, with the only exception being the Great Recession years. For the seventh consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid- to high-single digits. We continue to grow by multiples in excess of both gross domestic product and employment. For the seventh consecutive year, we grew EPS double digits, excluding the G&K results and acquisition-related items as well as the benefit from ASU 2016-09. And we increased the annual dividend for the 33rd consecutive year.
For Cintas, the past is indicative of the future because of the constant we share, which is our culture. Our culture is part of our strategy and drives our meaningful performance. We value honesty and integrity, competitive urgency and challenging the status quo in a positive manner. Profitable growth is in our DNA. The opportunities for us to seize are significant. 
Retail-inspired garments; health care scrub rental; and branded rental garments like Carhartt, are recent investments in the product line which have a long runway. Our First Aid and Safety business has a run rate of more than $500 million, and yet we just recently completed our national footprint. National account opportunities also remain. And despite acquiring a significant competitor, new business wins were up significantly over last year. Also, our fire services business is only at about 70 of the top 100 largest markets in North America. 
We continue to evolve as a business services company, helping over 1 million customers get Ready for the Workday. With an array of products and services including dust mask, hygiene products, first aid products and services, and fire protection services, we have a product or service for every business in North America. Our opportunity for continued growth is the 16 million businesses we currently don't do business with. 
Not only is the opportunity significant to expand market share, but we have huge potential to grow revenue and profit by penetrating our existing customer base. Within our uniform-wearing customer base, our penetration rates of other products and services, with the exception of entrance mats, are less than 20%. And less than 10% of our customers do business with 2 or more of our business units. We've added sales reps specifically focused on penetrating existing customers. They are supported by a national branding campaign whose purpose is to educate on all that we can do for businesses so they can concentrate on their core competencies. 
Cintas is a business that was built to last and that building doesn't stop. Our focus on the long-term means that we make the needed investments. Our investment in an enterprise resource planning system is a significant one. The implementation of SAP will continue into fiscal year 2020 due to the additional operations from the G&K acquisition. Once completed, SAP will produce cost savings and will better equip us to cross-sell. We will be a stronger company with this new technology.
And finally, we are excited about our recent acquisition of G&K. Preliminary results are very encouraging. We are on track to meet our financial and non-financial objectives and look forward to the many opportunities G&K provides. The synergies are compelling and result from the significant overlap in operations. Route density will also improve. We can spend more time helping customers solve their problems. We will have more time to sell into the accounts. The cost synergies alone will improve G&K operating margins to about 25% in 4 years. 
So in sum, our record of success is a lengthy one. The past has been great but the future, too, is very bright. 
So looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.27 billion to $6.36 billion, and fiscal '18 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.25. 
Our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business: no transaction and integration expenses; revenue of $870 million to $900 million compared to a prior-year run rate of $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; purchase price amortization expense related to intangible assets of $50 million; interest expense on G&K acquisition debt of about $65 million; and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.17. Again, this EPS guidance does not include any G&K transaction and integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these expenses in fiscal '18 as we continue to integrate the acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $65 million. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I want to discuss the G&K revenue guidance. We've discussed this over the course of the last year but want to be clear. Obviously, the 2 most significant components of revenue growth rate are new business and lost business. The legacy G&K operations, just like Cintas operations, will continue to have lost business in the normal course as contracts come up for renewal. The G&K lost business may be slightly higher than normal due to the disruption of the integration but not significantly so. The new business component from the legacy G&K sales reps, though, will significantly decrease for a temporary period. We are in the process of filling open positions and training all new reps on how to sell using the Cintas processes, how to sell Cintas products and services and to use the Cintas systems. As a result, the new business, typically generated to offset the normal lost business, will temporarily be reduced until the sales reps get back to their territories and begin to ramp productivity to normal levels. The result is that legacy G&K revenue will decline in fiscal '18. This was expected and we modeled the deal based upon this reality.
So now, I'll turn the call over to Paul."

One less workday negatively impacted fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. Looking ahead to fiscal '18, there will be no differences in workdays as fiscal '18 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal '17.
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,220,000,000, an increase of 27.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.6% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Current year fourth quarter gross margin, of course, includes the margin on the acquired G&K business, which was 40.2% for the fourth quarter. 
Excluding the acquired G&K business, the Cintas legacy Uniform Rental and Facility Services business gross margin improved 100 basis points from 44.4% to 45.4%. The G&K gross margin will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we realize the synergies from the acquisition. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a currently lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is 80 basis points higher than the Cintas legacy business. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin. 
Our First Aid and Safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $134 million which was 9.4% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 9.2%.
I want to take some time to revisit the impact of the ZEE Medical business on this segment's organic growth rate. We acquired ZEE in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. ZEE was a significant acquisition, increasing the total First Aid business by about 1/3. In our fiscal 2017 second quarter, 15 months after the acquisition, this segment's organic growth rate was less than the typical high single digits. This lower organic growth rate was due to 2 main reasons: First, not only was the acquired ZEE business significant in size, but it was also not growing. The ZEE business, pre-acquisition, had no sales force; Second, our focus in the first year of an acquisition is to secure the customer base and earn the trust of the acquired customers through outstanding service. On our second quarter earnings call of this fiscal year, we disclosed that we believe that the First Aid segment's organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates. We added sales reps to grow the ZEE customer base with our broad range of products and services, and meanwhile, the legacy Cintas First Aid and Safety business continued to grow at a strong pace. As we expected, our organic growth rate did climb from the bottom, increasing from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% in the third quarter, and now, 9.2% in the fourth quarter. Thus, the decline in the organic growth rate was expected due to the weight of the acquired business and it was temporary. The segment has returned to its customary organic growth rates in the high single digits and on a significantly larger revenue base.
This segment's gross margin was 44.5% from the fourth quarter compared to 42.9% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 160 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of ZEE acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses.
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $175 million, an increase of 9.2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 8.3%. All Other gross margin was 42.8% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42% for last year's fourth quarter. The Direct Sale business, by its nature, is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. We installed some large accounts in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, driving double-digit organic growth in this business. One of these accounts was Southwest Airlines. Majority of the product was shipped and recognized as revenue at the end of fiscal 2017 as opposed to early fiscal 2018, as originally expected.
On July 11, 2017, we sold a business that was not a good strategic fit. The business was reported as discontinued operations for the periods ended May 31, 2017, and 2016. Revenue and EPS for the sold business were about $26 million and $0.01, respectively, in Q4 of fiscal '17; and $28 million and $0.02, respectively, in Q4 of fiscal 2016.
Revenue and EPS for the business were about $105 million and $0.07, respectively, for the full fiscal year of 2017; and $110 million and $0.07, respectively, for the full fiscal year of 2016. These amounts are important to remember as you consider our fiscal 2018 guidance. Proceeds from the sale, net of taxes paid, will be approximately $85 million. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 27.9% in last year's fourth quarter. 60 of the 70 basis points is attributable to the amortization expense of the intangible assets established in the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 37.8% compared to 37.2% for last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve billed and releases relating to discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be about 34%. 
Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31 was $169 million, and we had $22 million of marketable securities as of quarter end.
Cash flow from operating activities in the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter was $280 million, and free cash flow was $225 million. 
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were approximately $55 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $45 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $7 million in First Aid and Safety, and $3 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. 
As of May 31, total debt was about $3,133,000,000, consisting of $363 million in short-term debt and $2,770,000,000 of long-term debt. Our leverage at May 31 was 2.8x debt-to-EBITDA. Subsequent to May 31, we repaid $50 million of the term loan. We expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance, $200 million of term loan and commercial paper, we have structured our debt to help us achieve our goal of reducing leverage to 2.0x debt-to-EBITDA.
Regarding SAP, since last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been converted to the system. As of the end of this month, we will have converted about 30 locations. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. 
Due to the acquisition of G&K, we are adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary. Certain G&K acquisition locations will also be converted to SAP and, therefore, because of this additional work, we expect the implementation to extend through fiscal 2020. The good news is that we can leverage the system over an even larger organization because the SAP hardware and software costs will not increase. They are sunk costs. We expect that fiscal 2018 SAP expenses will amount to approximately $30 million. This compares to about $12 million in fiscal 2017. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So let me maybe talk a little bit about the synergies real quickly. We spent the fourth quarter really confirming our assumptions with our integration plan. And the good news is we did not see anything that changed our mind about our opportunity. No unforeseen issues. We still expect that we'll achieve $130 million to $140 million in synergies. So that's -- I think that was one step, and that was a good start for us. We didn't do many integration activities in the fourth quarter because of the confirming and really spending time communicating with our new partners and our new customers. However, we've gotten pretty busy in June and July. And in June, we did convert the G&K payroll to our payroll system. That's a big first step, and that went very well. We have converted to our -- to the Cintas financial system. That's another big step that went well. And we've gone through the first few waves of branch consolidations, and those have gone well. And so I think we're off to a good start. No surprises as of yet, and we really like what we've seen so far. We mentioned that the year 1 synergies are $50 million to $55 million. And let me step back and say we did announce that we were closing the corporate headquarters, and that is -- that closure is proceeding. And so certainly, the year 1 synergies are certainly coming some from the corporate closure and other G&A activities, probably more than half of those first year synergies. And the rest are from the integration activities of the integration of locations. Again, we think that most of those integration activities are going to happen in the first 2 years. The synergy recognition, though, generally will happen in the 12 months following that integration activity. So in year 1, we're going to see $50 million to $55 million. In year 2, I think we'll see another meaningful increase in synergies. And in year 3, we'll see the annualizing of the year 2 synergy -- I'm sorry, the year 2 integration activities. We'll also start to see some sourcing benefits in that third year. And we expect to fully realize the $130 million to $140 million in year 4. So that's a little bit of the cadence of the synergy recognition. And let's just -- it's a little bit of a nuance, but the integration activities are a little bit different than the synergy recognition."

Our revenue is roughly half uniform. And then I'll move maybe into our Rental segment, about half of the Rental segment is nonuniform, so Facility Services making -- made up of entrance mats, hygiene products, chemical cleaning solutions, et cetera. So if -- today, compared to, let's call it, 10 years ago, the percentage of uniform revenue is certainly lower than then. It was probably closer to the 7 -- 60% to 70% range back then. The other thing I would say is we have worked hard, not just to create solutions that are nonuniform, but also within our uniform programs. We've worked hard to great innovative products, retail-inspired products, garment-solution-based products that can reach new and different customers even in a time when there is not employment growth. So in other words, we think there is a large unserved opportunity out there, and we have products and services, I would say, today, that are better able to capture that unserved market than maybe 10 years ago. And so when we look back over the last 7 years or so, and I think we've talked about our revenue growth being multiples of GDP and employment, a lot of it is because of the innovative garments that people want to wear as well as then the non-garments solutions that we've created that really can create value for every type of business in America. So we feel good about that, a little bit of that decoupling from the employment that maybe tied us a little bit closer 10 years ago."

Last year, when we talked about fourth quarter performance, we had said that the headwind in oil and gas was about 100 basis points. This year, we would have said -- I think in the third quarter, we said 60-basis-point headwind. We would say it's probably more like 30. And so the year-over-year comps in the oil and gas are starting to be beneficial. That won't last forever but starting to be beneficial. So I think we got a little bit of bounce from that.

But for now, I can tell you that the Cintas legacy Uniform Rental business, about 49% of the revenue. And I'm referring to the segment, not to the consolidated entity. So in looking at the uniform segment, 49% is garments; dust control is 18%; hygiene, which is restrooms, cleaning services, chemical services, that was 17% of revenue; shop towels were 4%; linen was 8%; and catalog sales were 4%. And then in comparison, for G&K, their Uniform Rental mix: the garments are 55% of total revenue; dust is 15%; hygiene is 3%; shop towels are 9%; and, let's see, linen is 14%; and catalog sales were 4%. So it really highlights what we had talked about previously that this is a business that doesn't have as broad of an offering as we do, and so some good opportunities for us in the future. You can see that hygiene line is much smaller as a percent of the total than it is for us."

And so maybe I'll touch on that a bit. And so I'm speaking of the $130 million to $140 million now. We would expect that the largest bucket is the G&A stream. It's the elimination of redundant corporate processes as well as some location G&A expenses. The second largest would be -- the second largest bucket would be that production facility. So the combination of location, the elimination of redundant capacity is certainly a fairly good-sized opportunity for us. We think the third bucket will be the sourcing piece. And while that is one of the longer timeframes of this process, we think that's a good opportunity. We think that from a routing perspective, there certainly is the fuel benefits that Paul talked about from combining the route forces and creating much more density. But we're hesitant to say that there will be a lot of route consolidation. We definitely need capacity on our routes to make sure that we have the time to meet with our customers, the time to build relationships, to make the service calls that we need to make. And so we see that as certainly a route-optimization opportunity. But we don't see that as one of the bigger -- a consolidation being one of the bigger opportunities there because we like the capacity. We're generally -- for the last probably 7 years, we've been adding routes every single year. And the last thing we want to do is to cut routes only to add them again. So it's really more about route optimization. And now, as it relates to the timing of that, the -- a --  an integration generally will mean the systems first. We have to get on the same system so that our different operations can speak to each other. And once we get on the same system, then the route optimization can happen. So it's usually following the location consolidation or system integration."

And yes, I mean, there are a few buckets that we can talk about. The first is Scrub Rental. We've talked about that in the past. Scrubs was largely a Direct Sale, a commodity. And we worked to change it into a rental program with a service element to help hospitals and the other health care institutions control their inventory through those dispensing units. But that's something we've really gotten into in earnest in the last 5 years. It's a huge market and it's a market that we are in the very early innings of penetrating. And so we're getting some good wins but we have a long way to go in that sector. Another good industry for us, the sector for us for no-programmers is in the trades areas. That Carhartt product line that we've talked about, that rugged look, those are garments that really appeal to people that work in the utility industries or plumbers, electricians, anyone in trades. And we've had a lot of traction with that product. So and then just in general, it's really the recognition that, and I think Mike mentioned this earlier, we have to gravitate in the product line to where the employment is. We've done a very good job of that by creating these garments, some are branded. But also creating garments that are more retail inspired, polos and microbial shirts, et cetera, that we can get into industries that are customer-facing like resorts, theme parks, et cetera. And so, yes, a lot of opportunity that just kind of gives you some idea of some of those no-programmers that are out there."

We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
We are pleased to report that revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31, was $1,530,000,000, an increase of 23.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.1%. New business wins,, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remain strong. 
The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 8%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.2%. Fourth quarter gross margin improved to 44.4% from 43.9% last year. This is our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. Operating income for the fourth quarter of $177.3 million decreased 11.2% from last year's fourth quarter. Fiscal 2017 fourth quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $63.7 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition. Excluding G&K results and acquisition charges as well as a benefit from a change in the accounting for equity compensation as required by a recent accounting standard, our operating income margin was 16.4% versus 16.1% last year, an improvement of 30 basis points. 
Net income and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 were $82.2 million and $0.75, respectively. Fiscal '17 fourth quarter EPS included a positive impact of $0.02 from the change in the accounting for equity compensation and of $0.05 from the G&K business. Fiscal '17 fourth quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.50 from transaction and integration expenses and certain incremental non-recurring bank fees included in the interest expense related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.18 versus $1.06 last year, an 11% increase over last year's fourth quarter. 
Our fiscal 2017 results added to our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 46 of the past 48 years, with the only exception being the Great Recession years. For the seventh consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid- to high-single digits. We continue to grow by multiples in excess of both gross domestic product and employment. For the seventh consecutive year, we grew EPS double digits, excluding the G&K results and acquisition-related items as well as the benefit from ASU 2016-09. And we increased the annual dividend for the 33rd consecutive year.
For Cintas, the past is indicative of the future because of the constant we share, which is our culture. Our culture is part of our strategy and drives our meaningful performance. We value honesty and integrity, competitive urgency and challenging the status quo in a positive manner. Profitable growth is in our DNA. The opportunities for us to seize are significant. 
Retail-inspired garments; health care scrub rental; and branded rental garments like Carhartt, are recent investments in the product line which have a long runway. Our First Aid and Safety business has a run rate of more than $500 million, and yet we just recently completed our national footprint. National account opportunities also remain. And despite acquiring a significant competitor, new business wins were up significantly over last year. Also, our fire services business is only at about 70 of the top 100 largest markets in North America. 
We continue to evolve as a business services company, helping over 1 million customers get Ready for the Workday. With an array of products and services including dust masks, hygiene products, first aid products and services, and fire protection services, we have a product or service for every business in North America. Our opportunity for continued growth is the 16 million businesses we currently don't do business with. 
Not only is the opportunity significant to expand market share, but we have huge potential to grow revenue and profit by penetrating our existing customer base. Within our uniform-wearing customer base, our penetration rates of other products and services, with the exception of entrance mats, are less than 20%. And less than 10% of our customers do business with 2 or more of our business units. We've added sales reps specifically focused on penetrating existing customers. They are supported by a national branding campaign whose purpose is to educate on all that we can do for businesses so they can concentrate on their core competencies. 
Cintas is a business that was built to last and that building doesn't stop. Our focus on the long-term means that we make the needed investments. Our investment in an enterprise resource planning system is a significant one. The implementation of SAP will continue into fiscal year 2020 due to the additional operations from the G&K acquisition. Once completed, SAP will produce cost savings and will better equip us to cross-sell. We will be a stronger company with this new technology.
And finally, we are excited about our recent acquisition of G&K. Preliminary results are very encouraging. We are on track to meet our financial and non-financial objectives and look forward to the many opportunities G&K provides. The synergies are compelling and result from the significant overlap in operations. Route density will also improve. We can spend more time helping customers solve their problems. We will have more time to sell into the accounts. The cost synergies alone will improve G&K operating margins to about 25% in 4 years. 
So in sum, our record of success is a lengthy one. The past has been great but the future, too, is very bright. 
So looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.27 billion to $6.36 billion, and fiscal '18 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.25. 
Our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business: no transaction and integration expenses; revenue of $870 million to $900 million compared to a prior-year run rate of $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; purchase price amortization expense related to intangible assets of $50 million; interest expense on G&K acquisition debt of about $65 million; and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.17. Again, this EPS guidance does not include any G&K transaction and integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these expenses in fiscal '18 as we continue to integrate the acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $65 million. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I want to discuss the G&K revenue guidance. We've discussed this over the course of the last year, but want to be clear. Obviously, the 2 most significant components of revenue growth rate are new business and lost business. The legacy G&K operations, just like Cintas operations, will continue to have lost business in the normal course as contracts come up for renewal. The G&K lost business may be slightly higher than normal due to the disruption of the integration but not significantly so. The new business component from the legacy G&K sales reps, though, will significantly decrease for a temporary period. We are in the process of filling open positions and training all new reps on how to sell using the Cintas processes, how to sell Cintas products and services and to use the Cintas systems. As a result, the new business, typically generated to offset the normal lost business, will temporarily be reduced until the sales reps get back to their territories and begin to ramp productivity to normal levels. The result is that legacy G&K revenue will decline in fiscal '18. This was expected and we modeled the deal based upon this reality.
So now I'll turn the call over to Paul."

First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains 1 less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It was the third quarter that had 1 less day than the prior year quarter. One less workday negatively impacted fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. Looking ahead to fiscal '18, there will be no differences in workdays as fiscal '18 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal '17.
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,220,000,000, an increase of 27.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.6% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Current year fourth quarter gross margin, of course, includes the margin on the acquired G&K business, which was 40.2% for the fourth quarter. 
Excluding the acquired G&K business, the Cintas legacy Uniform Rental and Facility Services business gross margin improved 100 basis points from 44.4% to 45.4%. The G&K gross margin will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we realize the synergies from the acquisition. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a currently lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is 80 basis points higher than the Cintas legacy business. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin. 
Our First Aid and Safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $134 million which was 9.4% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 9.2%.
I want to take some time to revisit the impact of the ZEE Medical business on this segment's organic growth rate. We acquired ZEE in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. ZEE was a significant acquisition, increasing the total First Aid business by about 1/3. In our fiscal 2017 second quarter, 15 months after the acquisition, this segment's organic growth rate was less than the typical high single digits. This lower organic growth rate was due to 2 main reasons: First, not only was the acquired ZEE business significant in size, but it was also not growing. The ZEE business, pre-acquisition, had no sales force; Second, our focus in the first year of an acquisition is to secure the customer base and earn the trust of the acquired customers through outstanding service. On our second quarter earnings call of this fiscal year, we disclosed that we believe that the First Aid segment's organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates. We added sales reps to grow the ZEE customer base with our broad range of products and services, and meanwhile, the legacy Cintas First Aid and Safety business continued to grow at a strong pace. As we expected, our organic growth rate did climb from the bottom, increasing from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% in the third quarter, and now, 9.2% in the fourth quarter. Thus, the decline in the organic growth rate was expected due to the weight of the acquired business and it was temporary. The segment has returned to its customary organic growth rates in the high single digits and on a significantly larger revenue base.
This segment's gross margin was 44.5% from the fourth quarter compared to 42.9% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 160 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of ZEE acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses.
Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $175 million, an increase of 9.2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 8.3%. All Other gross margin was 42.8% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42% for last year's fourth quarter. The Direct Sale business, by its nature, is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. We installed some large accounts in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, driving double-digit organic growth in this business. One of these accounts was Southwest Airlines. Majority of the product was shipped and recognized as revenue at the end of fiscal 2017 as opposed to early fiscal 2018, as originally expected.
On July 11, 2017, we sold a business that was not a good strategic fit. The business was reported as discontinued operations for the periods ended May 31, 2017, and 2016. Revenue and EPS for the sold business were about $26 million and $0.01, respectively, in Q4 of fiscal '17; and $28 million and $0.02, respectively, in Q4 of fiscal 2016.
Revenue and EPS for the business were about $105 million and $0.07, respectively, for the full fiscal year of 2017; and $110 million and $0.07, respectively, for the full fiscal year of 2016. These amounts are important to remember as you consider our fiscal 2018 guidance. Proceeds from the sale, net of taxes paid, will be approximately $85 million. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 27.9% in last year's fourth quarter. 60 of the 70 basis points is attributable to the amortization expense of the intangible assets established in the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 37.8% compared to 37.2% for last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve billed and releases relating to discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be about 34%. 
Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31 was $169 million, and we had $22 million of marketable securities as of quarter end.
Cash flow from operating activities in the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter was $280 million, and free cash flow was $225 million. 
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were approximately $55 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $45 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $7 million in First Aid and Safety, and $3 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. 
As of May 31, total debt was about $3,133,000,000, consisting of $363 million in short-term debt and $2,770,000,000 of long-term debt. Our leverage at May 31 was 2.8x debt-to-EBITDA. Subsequent to May 31, we repaid $50 million of the term loan. We expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance, $200 million of term loan and commercial paper, we have structured our debt to help us achieve our goal of reducing leverage to 2.0x debt-to-EBITDA.
Regarding SAP, since last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been converted to the system. As of the end of this month, we will have converted about 30 locations. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. 
Due to the acquisition of G&K, we are adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary. Certain G&K acquisition locations will also be converted to SAP and, therefore, because of this additional work, we expect the implementation to extend through fiscal 2020. The good news is that we can leverage the system over an even larger organization because the SAP hardware and software costs will not increase. They are sunk costs. We expect that fiscal 2018 SAP expenses will amount to approximately $30 million. This compares to about $12 million in fiscal 2017. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So let me maybe talk a little bit about the synergies real quickly. We spent the fourth quarter really confirming our assumptions with our integration plan. And the good news is we did not see anything that changed our mind about our opportunity. No unforeseen issues. We still expect that we'll achieve $130 million to $140 million in synergies. So that's -- I think that was one step, and that was a good start for us. We didn't do many integration activities in the fourth quarter because of the confirming and really spending time communicating with our new partners and our new customers. However, we've gotten pretty busy in June and July. And in June, we did convert the G&K payroll to our payroll system. That's a big first step, and that went very well. We have converted to our -- to the Cintas financial system. That's another big step that went well. And we've gone through the first few waves of branch consolidations, and those have gone well. And so I think we're off to a good start. No surprises as of yet, and we really like what we've seen so far. We mentioned that the year 1 synergies are $50 million to $55 million. And let me step back and say we did announce that we were closing the corporate headquarters, and that is -- that closure is proceeding. And so certainly, the year 1 synergies are certainly coming some from the corporate closure and other G&A activities, probably more than half of those first year synergies. And the rest are from the integration activities of the integration of locations. Again, we think that most of those integration activities are going to happen in the first 2 years. The synergy recognition, though, generally will happen in the 12 months following that integration activity. So in year 1, we're going to see $50 million to $55 million. In year 2, I think we'll see another meaningful increase in synergies. And in year 3, we'll see the annualizing of the year 2 synergy -- I'm sorry, the year 2 integration activities. We'll also start to see some sourcing benefits in that third year. And we expect to fully realize the $130 million to $140 million in year 4. So that's a little bit of the cadence of the synergy recognition. And let's just -- it's a little bit of a nuance, but the integration activities are a little bit different than the synergy recognition."

Our revenue is roughly half uniform. And then I'll move maybe into our Rental segment, about half of the Rental segment is nonuniform, so Facility Services making -- made up of entrance mats, hygiene products, chemical cleaning solutions, et cetera. So if -- today, compared to, let's call it, 10 years ago, the percentage of uniform revenue is certainly lower than then. It was probably closer to the 7 -- 60% to 70% range back then. The other thing I would say is we have worked hard, not just to create solutions that are nonuniform, but also within our uniform programs. We've worked hard to create innovative products, retail-inspired products, garment-solution-based products that can reach new and different customers even in a time when there is not employment growth. So in other words, we think there is a large unserved opportunity out there, and we have products and services, I would say, today, that are better able to capture that unserved market than maybe 10 years ago. And so when we look back over the last 7 years or so, and I think we've talked about our revenue growth being multiples of GDP and employment, a lot of it is because of the innovative garments that people want to wear as well as then the non-garments solutions that we've created that really can create value for every type of business in America. So we feel good about that, a little bit of that decoupling from the employment that maybe tied us a little bit closer 10 years ago."

This year, we would have said -- I think in the third quarter, we said 60-basis-point headwind. We would say it's probably more like 30.

I can give you the Cintas legacy business and the G&K business separately just so you all, for the first time, have a little bit of an idea of that mix. Going forward, it will be very difficult if near impossible to separate the 2 as we continued to integrate. But for now, I can tell you that the Cintas legacy Uniform Rental business, about 49% of the revenue. And I'm referring to the segment, not to the consolidated entity. So in looking at the uniform segment, 49% is garments; dust control is 18%; hygiene, which is restrooms, cleaning services, chemical services, that was 17% of revenue; shop towels were 4%; linen was 8%; and catalog sales were 4%. And then in comparison, for G&K, their Uniform Rental mix: the garments are 55% of total revenue; dust is 15%; hygiene is 3%; shop towels are 9%; and, let's see, linen is 14%; and catalog sales were 4%. So it really highlights what we had talked about previously that this is a business that doesn't have as broad of an offering as we do, and so some good opportunities for us in the future. You can see that hygiene line is much smaller as a percent of the total than it is for us."

And so maybe I'll touch on that a bit. And so I'm speaking of the $130 million to $140 million now. We would expect that the largest bucket is the G&A stream. It's the elimination of redundant corporate processes as well as some location G&A expenses. The second largest would be -- the second largest bucket would be that production facility. So the combination of location, the elimination of redundant capacity is certainly a fairly good-sized opportunity for us. We think the third bucket will be the sourcing piece. And while that is one of the longer timeframes of this process, we think that's a good opportunity. We think that from a routing perspective, there certainly is the fuel benefits that Paul talked about from combining the route forces and creating much more density. But we're hesitant to say that there will be a lot of route consolidation. We definitely need capacity on our routes to make sure that we have the time to meet with our customers, the time to build relationships, to make the service calls that we need to make. And so we see that as certainly a route-optimization opportunity. But we don't see that as one of the bigger -- a consolidation being one of the bigger opportunities there because we like the capacity. We're generally -- for the last probably 7 years, we've been adding routes every single year. And the last thing we want to do is to cut routes only to add them again. So it's really more about route optimization. And now, as it relates to the timing of that, the -- a --  an integration generally will mean the systems first. We have to get on the same system so that our different operations can speak to each other. And once we get on the same system, then the route optimization can happen. So it's usually following the location consolidation or system integration."

And yes, I mean, there are a few buckets that we can talk about. The first is Scrub Rental. We've talked about that in the past. Scrubs was largely a Direct Sale, a commodity. And we worked to change it into a rental program with a service element to help hospitals and the other health care institutions control their inventory through those dispensing units. But that's something we've really gotten into in earnest in the last 5 years. It's a huge market and it's a market that we are in the very early innings of penetrating. And so we're getting some good wins but we have a long way to go in that sector. Another good industry for us, the sector for us for no-programmers is in the trades areas. That Carhartt product line that we've talked about, that rugged look, those are garments that really appeal to people that work in the utility industries or plumbers, electricians, anyone in trades. And we've had a lot of traction with that product. So and then just in general, it's really the recognition that, and I think Mike mentioned this earlier, we have to gravitate in the product line to where the employment is. We've done a very good job of that by creating these garments, some are branded. But also creating garments that are more retail inspired, polos and microbial shirts, et cetera, that we can get into industries that are customer-facing like resorts, theme parks, et cetera. And so, yes, a lot of opportunity that just kind of gives you some idea of some of those no-programmers that are out there."

After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
Before getting into our financial results, I want to take this opportunity to recognize our employees, whom we call partners, impacted by the major hurricanes striking Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and surrounding areas. Many of our partners suffered significant losses in these natural disasters. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them. In addition, we thank them for their dedication to the company as they continue to tend to the business and needs of our customers despite the impact to their personal lives.  Finally, we are grateful to the many Cintas partners who have helped their fellow partners in need via donations of money, clothing, personal care and time. In true Cintas' spirit, you were ready and eager to help. 
We are pleased to report that revenue for the first quarter, which ended August 31, was $1,611,000,000, an increase of 27.2% over last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 8.3%. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 8.1%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 11.9%. First quarter gross margin improved 40 basis points to 45.9% from 45.5% last year. This is our 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. We believe that this quarter's increase in gross margin over prior year is particularly noteworthy because it was realized despite the headwind of adding the G&K business at a considerably lower gross margin. The Cintas legacy gross margins continue to expand, and the G&K gross margins will too as we realize the acquisition synergies. 
Operating income for the first quarter of $249 million increased 22.1% from last year's first quarter. Fiscal '18 first quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $4 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition compared to about $3 million of such expenses in the first quarter of last year. Excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, operating income increased 22.4% to a margin of 15.7% versus 16.3% last year. The 60 basis point decrease in the operating margin is due to  an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Intangible asset amortization expense increased about 75 basis points over last year's first quarter due to the G&K acquisition. Another year-over-year impact is a 20 basis point increase in depreciation expense because of SAP. 
Net income and earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '18 were $161 million and $1.45, respectively. EPS was negatively impacted by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $0.03 and $0.02 in the first quarters of fiscal '18 and fiscal '17, respectively. Excluding these expenses, EPS was $1.48 versus $1.26, a 17.5% increase. 
As a result of our first quarter results, we are increasing our annual guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $6,325,000,000 to $6,400,000,000, and fiscal '18 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.38. Our guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. The guidance does, however, include our preliminary estimates of the negative impact from the hurricanes. Based on our early assessment, we estimate fiscal '18 revenue to be reduced by approximately $10 million to $15 million and EPS to be reduced by about $0.05 to $0.08. These estimates are subject to change as more information becomes available.  Again, this EPS guidance does not include any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. However, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the remainder of fiscal '18 as we continue to integrate the significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $65 million for the full fiscal year. 
As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in today's earnings press release, the integration of G&K continues to proceed as expected. We are pleased with our performance. We remain on track to meet the acquisition's financial and nonfinancial objectives. Our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business: revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $905 million compared to a prior-year amount run rate of about $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.17. 
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional details."

First, please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within the fiscal year 2018 due differ, however, and are as follows: 66 in Q1; 65 in Q2;",1138,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within the fiscal year 2018 due differ, however, and are as follows: 66 in Q1; 65 in Q2; 64 in Q3; and 66 in Q4. 1 less workday in a quarter has a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,311,000,000, an increase of 31.9% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 8.1%. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 46.1% for the first quarter, an increase of 10 basis points from 46.0% in last year's first quarter. 
As Mike touched upon earlier, there was more to the performance here than meets the eye. Last quarter, when we were still able to separate the performance of the G&K business from the legacy Cintas business, we noted that the G&K gross margin was 40.2%. Also, when excluding the G&K business, last quarter's legacy Cintas Uniform Rental and Facility Services business gross margin improved 100 basis points. Considering the fact that we have only just begun to recognize synergies from the acquisition and those synergies realized to date are mostly general and administrative in nature as opposed to benefiting gross margin, gross margin performance is similar in this first quarter as it was in the previous quarter, meaning, excluding the G&K business, there was healthy improvement year-over-year in the gross margin of the legacy Cintas Uniform Rental and Facility Services business. 
As previously stated, the G&K gross margin will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we realize the synergies from the acquisition. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a currently lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is much higher than the Cintas legacy business. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefits of redundant capacity, will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin over time. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $140 million, which was 12.6% higher than last year's first quarter.  On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 11.9%. This segment's gross margin was 47.5% in the first quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 170 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of ZEE acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. In addition to the strong year-over-year performance, it is exciting to see the improvements to the gross margin percentage from pre-ZEE acquisition levels. In the quarter before the ZEE acquisition, the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2015, the segment's gross margin was 46.8%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the margin is 70 basis points higher. This is due not only to the realization of the ZEE acquisition synergies but also to continued strong execution in both sales and operations that ensures growth in both the top and bottom line. 
Our Fire Protection Services and uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $159 million, an increase of 7.9% compared to last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.3%. All Other gross margin was 42.5% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.1% from last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. Uniform Direct Sale business, by its nature, is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low single-digit and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. 
Our Fire business, however, continues to grow at a rapid pace. The Fire business' organic growth rate was just shy of 10%, and operating margins expanded. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.2% in the first quarter compared to 29.2% in last year's first quarter. About 75 of the 100 basis point increase is attributable to the amortization expense of the intangible assets established in the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. Also, SAP expense was up 20 basis points year-over-year. The prior year first quarter did not include any depreciation expense from SAP because the project was still in the pilot phase. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter was 26.5% compared to 28.2% from last year's first quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve billed and re-leases relating to discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be about 34%. 
Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $191 million, and we had $21 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities in the fiscal 2018 first quarter was $254 million, and free cash flow was $191 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $62 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $51 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $7 million in First Aid and Safety; and $4 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. As of August 31, total debt was $2,841,000,000, consisting of $307 million in short-term debt and $2,534,000,000 of long-term debt. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, $293 million of debt was repaid. At August 31, our leverage was 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. We expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0 to 2.2x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

The smaller amount in the first quarter is just simply because there's still a lot of heavy lifting to do as it relates to the integration. And I'll give you an example. While we've made some really good progress on reducing the former corporate headquarters, we're not fully out of that headquarter building yet and we're not able to impair that lease until we're fully out of it. So that's an example of while we've made quite a bit of progress, there will likely be an impairment charge coming still, and there, we have a number of similar examples. So I would say, we're still going to be somewhere in that range certainly given that it was only about $4 million in the first quarter. It going to pick up, and I would say that the back half of the year is going to see the bulk of that."

The first quarter revenue was about $236 million. That was about a 3% decrease from the prior year for that block of business. As you know, we've talked a lot about that continuing to decrease through this year such that it will probably bottom out in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of fiscal '19. And so while we are seeing the revenue that we expected, we still believe that it's going to continue to decrease as we start to recover from the absence of new business.

Our first quarter synergies were about $7 million. So that's [ 7 out of the 50 to 55 ]. The activities that happened in that first quarter, and I'm not going to give you every single one, but generally speaking, we converted the payroll system as we talked about on our last call. We converted to the Cintas financial system. We have made progress on reducing the functions located at the former headquarters, and we have also converted or consolidated a few dozen branches into Cintas locations and 1 processing plant [ in 2 ] Cintas locations. So we have had some -- we've had a lot of activity, much of that coming towards the end of the first quarter where we'll start to see the synergies from those in the last 3 quarters of the year. I'm not ready to give you any number on how many we expect to eventually consolidate, but maybe I will give you a little bit of color on the integration activities. It's a fairly complex process for us, and our partners are doing a great job of executing so far. But maybe I'll give you a couple of details of what goes on in one of these integration activities. It's about a 16-week process, and maybe I'll touch on a couple of areas starting with data. We need to, for that location's information, we need to map every item and every product and service from a former product number in the legacy G&K system to the Cintas system. We need to set up every single G&K legacy customer into the Cintas system. That means everywhere, everywhere's garments sizes, the number and type of masks that they might have, all other items that they are getting serviced, the pricing related to each customer, where, mat, et cetera, any recent activity we need to bring over to know if we have new hires at a customer, if there are recent terminations or any other changes in the services. And then we've got to run parallel on invoicing data and other data to make sure that it has been loaded properly. So there's a lot of data work that needs to be done with each and every one of these. Next area is inventory. For example, we need to take every garment that we have from the G&K product line and map it or determine what we're going to do with that garment. Are we going to replace it with a Cintas product? Or are we going to continue to source that G&K product. So we got to map all of those different products and services. We have to rebarcode every garment that's in service. So every garment that we have today has a barcode on it that indicates customer route number or where number. So the rebarcoding of that, I'll just give you a couple of numbers. 170,000 customer locations for legacy G&K with an average of about 10 wears, with 11 shirts and 11 pants, that's about 37.4 million garments that need to be rebarcoded. So it is quite the effort. And again, our team is doing a super job. And there are other areas that I could go through as well, but I just want to give you a little bit of a sense of the amount of detail as well as the amount of work that's included in each and every one of these consolidations. And I think we've been doing a great job at that. And I'll finish with one of the other things that we spent quite a bit of time on in this first quarter is doing a lot of mapping and creating a bridge from the legacy G&K system to our SAP system. And that is a big project. And in fact, we converted our first location to SAP yesterday, and we're certainly excited to see that happen. And as long as that continues to go well, we'll be ready to add or convert more and more of those locations that are going to remain open. So we're off to a really good start.  We're right in line with where we expected. Our partners have done a super job of executing. And we'll provide more detail quarter-to-quarter as we move from quarter-to-quarter."

We talked previously about that organic growth rate kind of bottoming out and that was kind of math associated with that ZEE acquisition. ZEE being 1/3 of the legacy business not growing, and yet, that legacy business was growing strongly. That kind of blended out at the bottom to about 3.3% organic growth rate, and we expected it to climb out to historical levels, and we're very pleased that it has. 11.9% is probably a little bit higher than we typically run. There's probably some easier comps benefiting us, but that's a business that we expect year in and year out to be growing high single digits. So in terms of the drivers, there's really no silver bullet, no one particular initiative. It's just a continued execution of the sales force and continuing to sell new programs penetrating the existing accounts, some of the ZEE customers as well will be part of that effort. And it's a very scalable business. There's a lot of capacity. So as we continue to grow that topline, if we can grow it organically given high single digit rate, it is going to continue to push those margins forward. And as I mentioned in the script, 170 basis points year-over-year, that's outstanding. That is the benefit of those ZEE synergies kicking in. But at the same time, growing 11.9%, there's a lot of incremental profit and falling to the bottom line pushing those margins."

I think as Paul mentioned, the last 2 quarters, we've seen a bit of an ease of the year-over-year oil and gas impact. And as we move forward from here, you can probably see from our guidance that we don't necessarily expect the 8% to continue but we still expect some pretty healthy organic growth as we move forward. Part of that reasoning is as that oil and gas year-over-year, let's call it, easier comps, go away as we go into the back part of the year. And the other thing is we've talked a little bit about the hurricane impact. And while it could have been a lot worse, it's still going to be about an impact of a headwind of about 30 basis points for the remaining 9 months of the year. So when we think about where we are today, yes, we did get off to a pretty good start a little better than we expected. The oil and gas year-over-year comp was a little bit easier. As we move into the final 3, a little bit tougher oil and gas comps as well as the hurricane impact."

But if we see employment trends pull back just a little bit, we have been in that environment during the last 7 years and we've been able to grow nicely. So we are -- we like where we are, we like our product line and our services. They can add value to almost every business in the U.S. We like our execution and our ability to reach those business opportunities, and so we're optimistic."

We just -- our goal is to reach more and more new business customers. And with 1 million customers in total and 16 million businesses in the U.S. and Canada, we think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to provide value. We look at that First Aid and Safety business, it's a great business because we sell it under the umbrellas of safety, compliance. And those are 2 important umbrellas that add a lot of breadths to the offerings that we have and we've been able to broaden our product offering. So things like training are big opportunities for us, continued sales of AEDs, continued sales of safety protection equipment, real nice opportunities. So we think we've got a lot of runway there. As it relates to the ZEE synergies, we think we're getting them, and I think the gross margin is a great sign of that. We are 1/3 larger than we were pre-ZEE. Our gross margin has exceeded where we were prior to ZEE. And we think that as we continue to grow, that SG&A will likely come down some more to get that overall profit level back into the mid-teens. So we are really excited about that business and the breadth of customer that, that can add value to."

If you remember, going back prior to fiscal '17, so fiscal '16 and beyond, we generally ran with an effective rate of somewhere in the neighborhood of 37%.

New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 8.1%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 11.9%. First quarter gross margin improved 40 basis points to 45.9% from 45.5% last year. This is our 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. We believe that this quarter's increase in gross margin over prior year is particularly noteworthy because it was realized despite the headwind of adding the G&K business at a considerably lower gross margin. The Cintas legacy gross margins continue to expand, and the G&K gross margins will, too, as we realize the acquisition synergies. 
Operating income for the first quarter of $249 million increased 22.1% from last year's first quarter. Fiscal '18 first quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $4 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition compared to about $3 million of such expenses in the first quarter of last year. Excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, operating income increased 22.4% to a margin of 15.7% versus 16.3% last year. The 60 basis point decrease in the operating margin is due to  an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Intangible asset amortization expense increased about 75 basis points over last year's first quarter due to the G&K acquisition. Another year-over-year impact is a 20 basis point increase in depreciation expense because of SAP. 
Net income and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '18 were $161 million and $1.45, respectively. EPS was negatively impacted by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $0.03 and $0.02 in the first quarters of fiscal '18 and fiscal '17, respectively. Excluding these expenses, EPS was $1.48 versus $1.26, a 17.5% increase. 
As a result of our first quarter results, we are increasing our annual guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $6,325,000,000 to $6,400,000,000, and fiscal '18 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.38. 
Our guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. The guidance does, however, include our preliminary estimates of the negative impact from the hurricanes. 
Based on our early assessment, we estimate fiscal '18 revenue to be reduced by approximately $10 million to $15 million, and EPS to be reduced by about $0.05 to $0.08. These estimates are subject to change as more information becomes available.  
Again, this EPS guidance does not include any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. However, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the remainder of fiscal '18 as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $65 million for the full fiscal year. 
As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in today's earnings press release, the integration of G&K continues to proceed as expected. We are pleased with our performance. We remain on track to meet the acquisition's financial and nonfinancial objectives. 
Our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business: revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $905 million compared to a prior year amount run rate of about $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.17. 
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional details."

First, please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within the fiscal year 2018 do differ, however, and are as follows: 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2,",1140,"Thank you, Mike. 
First, please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within the fiscal year 2018 do differ, however, and are as follows: 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. One less workday in a quarter has a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,311,000,000, an increase of 31.9% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 8.1%. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 46.1% for the first quarter, an increase of 10 basis points from 46.0% in last year's first quarter. 
As Mike touched upon earlier, there was more to the performance here than meets the eye. Last quarter, when we were still able to separate the performance of the G&K business from the legacy Cintas business, we noted that the G&K gross margin was 40.2%. Also, when excluding the G&K business, last quarter's legacy Cintas Uniform Rental and Facility Services business gross margin improved 100 basis points. Considering the fact that we have only just begun to recognize synergies from the acquisition and those synergies realized to date are mostly general and administrative in nature as opposed to benefiting gross margin, gross margin performance is similar in this first quarter as it was in the previous quarter, meaning, excluding the G&K business, there was healthy improvement year-over-year in the gross margin of the legacy Cintas Uniform Rental and Facility Services business. 
As previously stated, the G&K gross margin will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we realize the synergies from the acquisition. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a currently lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is much higher than the Cintas legacy business. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefits of reducing redundant capacity, will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin over time. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $140 million, which was 12.6% higher than last year's first quarter.  On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 11.9%. This segment's gross margin was 47.5% in the first quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 170 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of ZEE acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. 
In addition to the strong year-over-year performance, it is exciting to see the improvements to the gross margin percentage from pre-ZEE acquisition levels. In the quarter before the ZEE acquisition, the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2015, the segment's gross margin was 46.8%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the margin is 70 basis points higher. This is due not only to the realization of the ZEE acquisition synergies but also to continued strong execution in both sales and operations that ensures growth in both the top and bottom line. 
Our Fire Protection Services and uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $159 million, an increase of 7.9% compared to last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.3%. All Other gross margin was 42.5% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.1% for last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. 
Uniform Direct Sale business, by its nature, is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low single digit and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. 
Our Fire business, however, continues to grow at a rapid pace. The Fire business organic growth rate was just shy of 10%, and operating margins expanded. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.2% in the first quarter compared to 29.2% in last year's first quarter. About 75 of the 100 basis point increase is attributable to the amortization expense of the intangible assets established in the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. Also, SAP expense was up 20 basis points year-over-year. The prior year first quarter did not include any depreciation expense from SAP because the project was still in the pilot phase. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter was 26.5% compared to 28.2% for last year's first quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve billed and releases relating to discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be about 34%. 
Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $191 million, and we had $21 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities in the fiscal 2018 first quarter was $254 million, and free cash flow was $191 million. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $62 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $51 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $7 million in First Aid and Safety, and $4 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. 
As of August 31, total debt was $2,841,000,000, consisting of $307 million in short-term debt and $2,534,000,000 of long-term debt. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, $293 million of debt was repaid. At August 31, our leverage was 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. We expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0 to 2.2x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

The smaller amount in the first quarter is just simply because there's still a lot of heavy lifting to do as it relates to the integration, and I'll give you an example. While we've made some really good progress on reducing the former corporate headquarters, we're not fully out of that headquarter building yet and we're not able to impair that lease until we're fully out of it. So that's an example of while we've made quite a bit of progress, there will likely be an impairment charge coming, still, and there -- we have a number of similar examples.

The first quarter revenue was about $236 million. That was about a 3% decrease from the prior year for that block of business. As you know, we've talked a lot about that continuing to decrease through this year such that it will probably bottom out in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of fiscal '19. And so while we are seeing the revenue that we expected, we still believe that it's going to continue to decrease as we start to recover from the absence of new business. And that will -- again, that decreasing revenue will continue through this fiscal year as evidenced by the guidance that we're giving, $885 million to $905 million."

Our first quarter synergies were about $7 million. So that's $7 million out of the $50 million to $55 million. The activities that happened in that first quarter, and I'm not going to give you every single one, but generally speaking, we converted the payroll system as we talked about on our last call. We converted to the Cintas financial system. We have made progress on reducing the functions located at the former headquarters, and we have also converted or consolidated a few dozen branches into Cintas locations and 1 processing plant in 2 Cintas locations. So we have had some -- we've had a lot of activity, much of that coming towards the end of the first quarter where we'll start to see the synergies from those in the last 3 quarters of the year. I'm not ready to give you any number on how many we expect to eventually consolidate, but maybe I will give you a little bit of color on the integration activities. This is a -- it's a fairly complex process for us, and our partners are doing a great job of executing so far. But maybe I'll give you a couple of details of what goes on in one of these integration activities. It's about a 16-week process, and maybe I'll touch on a couple of areas starting with data. We need to -- for that location's information, we need to map every item and every product and service from a former product number in the legacy G&K system to the Cintas system. We need to set up every single G&K legacy customer into the Cintas system. That means everywhere, everywhere's garments sizes, the number and type of masks that they might have, all other items that they are getting serviced, the pricing related to each customer, wearer, mat, et cetera, any recent activity we need to bring over to know if we have new hires at a customer, if there are recent terminations or any other changes in the services. And then we've got to run parallel on invoicing data and other data to make sure that it has been loaded properly. So there's a lot of data work that needs to be done with each and every one of these. Next area is inventory. For example, we need to take every garment that we have from the G&K product line and map it or determine what we're going to do with that garment. Are we going to replace it with a Cintas product or are we going to continue to source that G&K product? So we've got to map all of those different products and services. We have to re-barcode every garment that is in service. So every garment that we have today has a barcode on it that indicates customer route number or wearer number. So the re-barcoding of that, I'll just give you a couple of numbers. 170,000 customer locations for legacy G&K, with an average of about 10 wearers, with 11 shirts and 11 pants, that's about 37.4 million garments that need to be re-barcoded. So it is quite the effort. And again, our team is doing a super job. And there are other areas that I could go through as well, but I just want to give you a little bit of a sense of the amount of detail as well as the amount of work that's included in each and every one of these consolidations. And I think we've been doing a great job at that. And I'll finish with -- one of the other things that we spent quite a bit of time on in this first quarter is doing a lot of mapping and creating a bridge from the legacy G&K system to our SAP system, and that is a big project. And in fact, we converted our first location to SAP yesterday, and we're certainly excited to see that happen. And as long as that continues to go well, we'll be ready to add or convert more and more of those locations that are going to remain open. So we're off to a really good start. We're right in line with where we expected. Our partners have done a super job of executing, and we'll provide more detail quarter-to-quarter as we move forward."

We talked previously about that organic growth rate kind of bottoming out, and that was kind of math associated with that ZEE acquisition. ZEE being 1/3 of the legacy business not growing, and yet, that legacy business was growing strongly. That kind of blended out at the bottom to about 3.3% organic growth rate, and we expected it to climb out to historic levels, and we're very pleased that it has. 11.9% is probably a little bit higher than we typically run. There's probably some easier comps benefiting us, but that's a business that we expect year in and year out to be growing high single digits. So in terms of the drivers, there's really no silver bullet, no one particular initiative. It's just a continued execution of the sales force and continuing to sell new programs, penetrating the existing accounts. Some of the ZEE customers as well will be part of that effort. And it's a very scalable business. There's a lot of capacity. So as we continue to grow that topline, if we can grow it organically at a high single digit rate, it is going to continue to push those margins forward. And as I mentioned in the script, 170 basis points year-over-year, that's outstanding. That is the benefit of those ZEE synergies kicking in, but at the same time, growing 11.9%.

I think as Paul mentioned, the last 2 quarters, we've seen a bit of an ease of the year-over-year oil and gas impact. And as we move forward from here, you can probably see from our guidance that we don't necessarily expect the 8% to continue but we still expect some pretty healthy organic growth as we move forward. Part of that reasoning is that oil and gas year-over-year, let's call it, easier comps, go away as we go into the back part of the year. And the other thing is we've talked a little bit about the hurricane impact. And while it could have been a lot worse, it's still going to be about an impact of a headwind of about 30 basis points for the remaining 9 months of the year. So when we think about where we are today, yes, we did get off to a pretty good start a little better than we expected. The oil and gas year-over-year comp was a little bit easier.

And the reason is because we have been able to have a very good and healthy new business effort, where 2/3 of our new business comes from what we call no programmers, in other words, those businesses that don't have uniform rental programs. And so in other words, we're able to get new businesses into our products and services even if they are not additive to employment. And that's been an important factor for us over the last 7 years coming out of the Great Recession. In addition to that new business effort, we've been able to penetrate existing customers as we have continued to come up with innovative products and services, and so that has been an important aspect. So as we look ahead, we do believe that we can continue to grow even with lessening employment because that's what we've done for the last 7 years or so. Now Mario, look, the more jobs that get added, the better. We're certainly all for it and that will only have a positive impact on us. But if we see employment trends pull back just a little bit, we have been in that environment during the last 7 years and we've been able to grow nicely. So we are -- we like where we are, we like our product line and our services. They can add value to almost every business in the U.S. We like our execution and our ability to reach those business opportunities, and so we're optimistic."

So things like training are big opportunities for us, continued sales of AEDs, continued sales of safety protection equipment, real nice opportunities. So we think we've got a lot of runway there. As it relates to the ZEE synergies, we think we're getting them, and I think the gross margin is a great sign of that. We are 1/3 larger than we were pre-ZEE, our gross margin has exceeded where we were prior to ZEE, and we think that as we continue to grow, that SG&A will likely come down some more to get that overall profit level back into the mid-teens.

And so while they may have 1 or 2 mats, we think that we have mats for even more situations. So anti-fatigue mats, kitchen-type mats, a logo mat, et cetera. So we've got a lot of opportunity with mats even if the penetration is not too far from ours. But the big opportunity that we did talk about was in that restroom hygiene area where G&K was about 3% of -- about 3% of their revenue was there and ours is quite a bit higher than that. So it provides a real nice penetration opportunity, and one that, as we continue to integrate and get on the same platforms, we will certainly be looking towards adding that kind of value to those legacy customers."

After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
Before getting into our financial results, I want to take this opportunity to recognize our employees, whom we call partners, impacted by the major hurricanes striking Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and surrounding areas. Many of our partners suffered significant losses in these natural disasters. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them. In addition, we thank them for their dedication to the company as they continue to tend to the business and needs of our customers despite the impact to their personal lives.  Finally, we are grateful to the many Cintas partners who have helped their fellow partners in need via donations of money, clothing, personal care and time. In true Cintas spirit, you were ready and eager to help. 
We are pleased to report that revenue for the first quarter, which ended August 31, was $1,611,000,000, an increase of 27.2% over last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 8.3%. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 8.1%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 11.9%. First quarter gross margin improved 40 basis points to 45.9% from 45.5% last year. This is our 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. We believe that this quarter's increase in gross margin over prior year is particularly noteworthy because it was realized despite the headwind of adding the G&K business at a considerably lower gross margin. The Cintas legacy gross margins continue to expand, and the G&K gross margins will, too, as we realize the acquisition synergies. 
Operating income for the first quarter of $249 million increased 22.1% from last year's first quarter. Fiscal '18 first quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $4 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition compared to about $3 million of such expenses in the first quarter of last year. Excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, operating income increased 22.4% to a margin of 15.7% versus 16.3% last year. The 60 basis point decrease in the operating margin is due to  an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Intangible asset amortization expense increased about 75 basis points over last year's first quarter due to the G&K acquisition. Another year-over-year impact is a 20 basis point increase in depreciation expense because of SAP. 
Net income and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '18 were $161 million and $1.45, respectively. EPS was negatively impacted by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $0.03 and $0.02 in the first quarters of fiscal '18 and fiscal '17, respectively. Excluding these expenses, EPS was $1.48 versus $1.26, a 17.5% increase. 
As a result of our first quarter results, we are increasing our annual guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $6,325,000,000 to $6,400,000,000, and fiscal '18 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.38. 
Our guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. The guidance does, however, include our preliminary estimates of the negative impact from the hurricanes. 
Based on our early assessment, we estimate fiscal '18 revenue to be reduced by approximately $10 million to $15 million, and EPS to be reduced by about $0.05 to $0.08. These estimates are subject to change as more information becomes available.  
Again, this EPS guidance does not include any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. However, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the remainder of fiscal '18 as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $65 million for the full fiscal year. 
As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in today's earnings press release, the integration of G&K continues to proceed as expected. We are pleased with our performance. We remain on track to meet the acquisition's financial and nonfinancial objectives. 
Our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business: revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $905 million compared to a prior year amount run rate of about $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.17. 
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional details."

First, please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within the fiscal year 2018 do differ, however, and are as follows: 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2,",1140,"Thank you, Mike. 
First, please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within the fiscal year 2018 do differ, however, and are as follows: 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. One less workday in a quarter has a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,311,000,000, an increase of 31.9% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 8.1%. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 46.1% for the first quarter, an increase of 10 basis points from 46.0% in last year's first quarter. 
As Mike touched upon earlier, there was more to the performance here than meets the eye. Last quarter, when we were still able to separate the performance of the G&K business from the legacy Cintas business, we noted that the G&K gross margin was 40.2%. Also, when excluding the G&K business, last quarter's legacy Cintas Uniform Rental and Facility Services business gross margin improved 100 basis points. Considering the fact that we have only just begun to recognize synergies from the acquisition and those synergies realized to date are mostly general and administrative in nature as opposed to benefiting gross margin, gross margin performance is similar in this first quarter as it was in the previous quarter, meaning, excluding the G&K business, there was healthy improvement year-over-year in the gross margin of the legacy Cintas Uniform Rental and Facility Services business. 
As previously stated, the G&K gross margin will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we realize the synergies from the acquisition. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a currently lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is much higher than the Cintas legacy business. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefits of reducing redundant capacity, will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin over time. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $140 million, which was 12.6% higher than last year's first quarter.  On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 11.9%. This segment's gross margin was 47.5% in the first quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 170 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of ZEE acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. 
In addition to the strong year-over-year performance, it is exciting to see the improvements to the gross margin percentage from pre-ZEE acquisition levels. In the quarter before the ZEE acquisition, the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2015, the segment's gross margin was 46.8%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the margin is 70 basis points higher. This is due not only to the realization of the ZEE acquisition synergies but also to continued strong execution in both sales and operations that ensures growth in both the top and bottom line. 
Our Fire Protection Services and uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $159 million, an increase of 7.9% compared to last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.3%. All Other gross margin was 42.5% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.1% for last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. 
Uniform Direct Sale business, by its nature, is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low single digit and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. 
Our Fire business, however, continues to grow at a rapid pace. The Fire business organic growth rate was just shy of 10%, and operating margins expanded. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.2% in the first quarter compared to 29.2% in last year's first quarter. About 75 of the 100 basis point increase is attributable to the amortization expense of the intangible assets established in the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. Also, SAP expense was up 20 basis points year-over-year. The prior year first quarter did not include any depreciation expense from SAP because the project was still in the pilot phase. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter was 26.5% compared to 28.2% for last year's first quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve billed and releases relating to discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be about 34%. 
Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $191 million, and we had $21 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities in the fiscal 2018 first quarter was $254 million, and free cash flow was $191 million. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $62 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $51 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $7 million in First Aid and Safety, and $4 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. 
As of August 31, total debt was $2,841,000,000, consisting of $307 million in short-term debt and $2,534,000,000 of long-term debt. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, $293 million of debt was repaid. At August 31, our leverage was 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. We expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0 to 2.2x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

The smaller amount in the first quarter is just simply because there's still a lot of heavy lifting to do as it relates to the integration, and I'll give you an example. While we've made some really good progress on reducing the former corporate headquarters, we're not fully out of that headquarter building yet and we're not able to impair that lease until we're fully out of it. So that's an example of while we've made quite a bit of progress, there will likely be an impairment charge coming, still, and there -- we have a number of similar examples. So I would say, we're still going to be somewhere in that range, certainly, given that it was only about $4 million in the first quarter.

The first quarter revenue was about $236 million. That was about a 3% decrease from the prior year for that block of business. As you know, we've talked a lot about that continuing to decrease through this year such that it will probably bottom out in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of fiscal '19. And so while we are seeing the revenue that we expected, we still believe that it's going to continue to decrease as we start to recover from the absence of new business. And that will -- again, that decreasing revenue will continue through this fiscal year as evidenced by the guidance that we're giving, $885 million to $905 million."

Our first quarter synergies were about $7 million. So that's $7 million out of the $50 million to $55 million. The activities that happened in that first quarter, and I'm not going to give you every single one, but generally speaking, we converted the payroll system as we talked about on our last call. We converted to the Cintas financial system. We have made progress on reducing the functions located at the former headquarters, and we have also converted or consolidated a few dozen branches into Cintas locations and 1 processing plant in 2 Cintas locations. So we have had some -- we've had a lot of activity, much of that coming towards the end of the first quarter where we'll start to see the synergies from those in the last 3 quarters of the year. I'm not ready to give you any number on how many we expect to eventually consolidate, but maybe I will give you a little bit of color on the integration activities. This is a -- it's a fairly complex process for us, and our partners are doing a great job of executing so far. But maybe I'll give you a couple of details of what goes on in one of these integration activities. It's about a 16-week process, and maybe I'll touch on a couple of areas starting with data. We need to -- for that location's information, we need to map every item and every product and service from a former product number in the legacy G&K system to the Cintas system. We need to set up every single G&K legacy customer into the Cintas system. That means everywhere, everywhere's garments sizes, the number and type of masks that they might have, all other items that they are getting serviced, the pricing related to each customer, wearer, mat, et cetera, any recent activity we need to bring over to know if we have new hires at a customer, if there are recent terminations or any other changes in the services. And then we've got to run parallel on invoicing data and other data to make sure that it has been loaded properly. So there's a lot of data work that needs to be done with each and every one of these. Next area is inventory. For example, we need to take every garment that we have from the G&K product line and map it or determine what we're going to do with that garment. Are we going to replace it with a Cintas product or are we going to continue to source that G&K product? So we've got to map all of those different products and services. We have to re-barcode every garment that is in service. So every garment that we have today has a barcode on it that indicates customer route number or wearer number. So the re-barcoding of that, I'll just give you a couple of numbers. 170,000 customer locations for legacy G&K, with an average of about 10 wearers, with 11 shirts and 11 pants, that's about 37.4 million garments that need to be re-barcoded. So it is quite the effort. And again, our team is doing a super job. And there are other areas that I could go through as well, but I just want to give you a little bit of a sense of the amount of detail as well as the amount of work that's included in each and every one of these consolidations. And I think we've been doing a great job at that. And I'll finish with -- one of the other things that we spent quite a bit of time on in this first quarter is doing a lot of mapping and creating a bridge from the legacy G&K system to our SAP system, and that is a big project. And in fact, we converted our first location to SAP yesterday, and we're certainly excited to see that happen. And as long as that continues to go well, we'll be ready to add or convert more and more of those locations that are going to remain open. So we're off to a really good start. We're right in line with where we expected. Our partners have done a super job of executing, and we'll provide more detail quarter-to-quarter as we move forward."

We talked previously about that organic growth rate kind of bottoming out, and that was kind of math associated with that ZEE acquisition. ZEE being 1/3 of the legacy business not growing, and yet, that legacy business was growing strongly. That kind of blended out at the bottom to about 3.3% organic growth rate, and we expected it to climb out to historic levels, and we're very pleased that it has. 11.9% is probably a little bit higher than we typically run. There's probably some easier comps benefiting us, but that's a business that we expect year in and year out to be growing high single digits. So in terms of the drivers, there's really no silver bullet, no one particular initiative. It's just a continued execution of the sales force and continuing to sell new programs, penetrating the existing accounts. Some of the ZEE customers as well will be part of that effort. And it's a very scalable business. There's a lot of capacity. So as we continue to grow that topline, if we can grow it organically at a high single digit rate, it is going to continue to push those margins forward. And as I mentioned in the script, 170 basis points year-over-year, that's outstanding. That is the benefit of those ZEE synergies kicking in, but at the same time, growing 11.9%. There's a lot of incremental profit falling to the bottom line pushing those margins."

And Shlomo, there's not really any one particular reason other than I think the economy is stable and conducive for us. I haven't seen much of a change, and our execution remains pretty good. I think as Paul mentioned, the last 2 quarters, we've seen a bit of an ease of the year-over-year oil and gas impact. And as we move forward from here, you can probably see from our guidance that we don't necessarily expect the 8% to continue but we still expect some pretty healthy organic growth as we move forward. Part of that reasoning is that oil and gas year-over-year, let's call it, easier comps, go away as we go into the back part of the year. And the other thing is we've talked a little bit about the hurricane impact. And while it could have been a lot worse, it's still going to be about an impact of a headwind of about 30 basis points for the remaining 9 months of the year. So when we think about where we are today, yes, we did get off to a pretty good start a little better than we expected. The oil and gas year-over-year comp was a little bit easier. As we move into the final 3, a little bit tougher oil and gas comps as well as the hurricane impact."

And the reason is because we have been able to have a very good and healthy new business effort, where 2/3 of our new business comes from what we call no programmers, in other words, those businesses that don't have uniform rental programs. And so in other words, we're able to get new businesses into our products and services even if they are not additive to employment. And that's been an important factor for us over the last 7 years coming out of the Great Recession. In addition to that new business effort, we've been able to penetrate existing customers as we have continued to come up with innovative products and services, and so that has been an important aspect. So as we look ahead, we do believe that we can continue to grow even with lessening employment because that's what we've done for the last 7 years or so. Now Mario, look, the more jobs that get added, the better. We're certainly all for it and that will only have a positive impact on us.

We were out of the pilot, felt really good about it, we're using the system, started depreciating it. So there's no change. Even though, as you mentioned and as Mike mentioned, we put our first G&K operation in SAP, it's just maybe a little a shift of, is it a Cintas legacy operation versus a G&K operation?

After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
Before getting into our financial results, I want to take this opportunity to recognize our employees, whom we call partners, impacted by the major hurricanes striking Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and surrounding areas. Many of our partners suffered significant losses in these natural disasters. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them. In addition, we thank them for their dedication to the company as they continue to tend to the business and needs of our customers despite the impact to their personal lives.  Finally, we are grateful to the many Cintas partners who have helped their fellow partners in need via donations of money, clothing, personal care and time. In true Cintas spirit, you were ready and eager to help. 
We are pleased to report that revenue for the first quarter, which ended August 31, was $1,611,000,000, an increase of 27.2% over last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 8.3%. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 8.1%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 11.9%. First quarter gross margin improved 40 basis points to 45.9% from 45.5% last year. This is our 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. We believe that this quarter's increase in gross margin over prior year is particularly noteworthy because it was realized despite the headwind of adding the G&K business at a considerably lower gross margin. The Cintas legacy gross margins continue to expand, and the G&K gross margins will, too, as we realize the acquisition synergies. 
Operating income for the first quarter of $249 million increased 22.1% from last year's first quarter. Fiscal '18 first quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $4 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition compared to about $3 million of such expenses in the first quarter of last year. Excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, operating income increased 22.4% to a margin of 15.7% versus 16.3% last year. The 60 basis point decrease in the operating margin is due to  an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Intangible asset amortization expense increased about 75 basis points over last year's first quarter due to the G&K acquisition. Another year-over-year impact is a 20 basis point increase in depreciation expense because of SAP. 
Net income and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '18 were $161 million and $1.45, respectively. EPS was negatively impacted by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $0.03 and $0.02 in the first quarters of fiscal '18 and fiscal '17, respectively. Excluding these expenses, EPS was $1.48 versus $1.26, a 17.5% increase. 
As a result of our first quarter results, we are increasing our annual guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $6,325,000,000 to $6,400,000,000, and fiscal '18 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.38. 
Our guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. The guidance does, however, include our preliminary estimates of the negative impact from the hurricanes. 
Based on our early assessment, we estimate fiscal '18 revenue to be reduced by approximately $10 million to $15 million, and EPS to be reduced by about $0.05 to $0.08. These estimates are subject to change as more information becomes available.  
Again, this EPS guidance does not include any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. However, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the remainder of fiscal '18 as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $65 million for the full fiscal year. 
As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in today's earnings press release, the integration of G&K continues to proceed as expected. We are pleased with our performance. We remain on track to meet the acquisition's financial and nonfinancial objectives. 
Our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business: revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $905 million compared to a prior year amount run rate of about $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.17. 
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional details."

First, please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within the fiscal year 2018 do differ, however, and are as follows: 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2,",1140,"Thank you, Mike. 
First, please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within the fiscal year 2018 do differ, however, and are as follows: 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. One less workday in a quarter has a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,311,000,000, an increase of 31.9% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 8.1%. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 46.1% for the first quarter, an increase of 10 basis points from 46.0% in last year's first quarter. 
As Mike touched upon earlier, there was more to the performance here than meets the eye. Last quarter, when we were still able to separate the performance of the G&K business from the legacy Cintas business, we noted that the G&K gross margin was 40.2%. Also, when excluding the G&K business, last quarter's legacy Cintas Uniform Rental and Facility Services business gross margin improved 100 basis points. Considering the fact that we have only just begun to recognize synergies from the acquisition and those synergies realized to date are mostly general and administrative in nature as opposed to benefiting gross margin, gross margin performance is similar in this first quarter as it was in the previous quarter, meaning, excluding the G&K business, there was healthy improvement year-over-year in the gross margin of the legacy Cintas Uniform Rental and Facility Services business. 
As previously stated, the G&K gross margin will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we realize the synergies from the acquisition. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a currently lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is much higher than the Cintas legacy business. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefits of reducing redundant capacity, will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin over time. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $140 million, which was 12.6% higher than last year's first quarter.  On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 11.9%. This segment's gross margin was 47.5% in the first quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 170 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of ZEE acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. 
In addition to the strong year-over-year performance, it is exciting to see the improvements to the gross margin percentage from pre-ZEE acquisition levels. In the quarter before the ZEE acquisition, the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2015, the segment's gross margin was 46.8%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the margin is 70 basis points higher. This is due not only to the realization of the ZEE acquisition synergies but also to continued strong execution in both sales and operations that ensures growth in both the top and bottom line. 
Our Fire Protection Services and uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $159 million, an increase of 7.9% compared to last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.3%. All Other gross margin was 42.5% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.1% for last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. 
Uniform Direct Sale business, by its nature, is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low single digit and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. 
Our Fire business, however, continues to grow at a rapid pace. The Fire business organic growth rate was just shy of 10%, and operating margins expanded. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.2% in the first quarter compared to 29.2% in last year's first quarter. About 75 of the 100 basis point increase is attributable to the amortization expense of the intangible assets established in the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. Also, SAP expense was up 20 basis points year-over-year. The prior year first quarter did not include any depreciation expense from SAP because the project was still in the pilot phase. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter was 26.5% compared to 28.2% for last year's first quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve billed and releases relating to discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be about 34%. 
Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $191 million, and we had $21 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities in the fiscal 2018 first quarter was $254 million, and free cash flow was $191 million. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $62 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $51 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $7 million in First Aid and Safety, and $4 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. 
As of August 31, total debt was $2,841,000,000, consisting of $307 million in short-term debt and $2,534,000,000 of long-term debt. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, $293 million of debt was repaid. At August 31, our leverage was 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. We expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0 to 2.2x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

I think we will be in that range. The smaller amount in the first quarter is just simply because there's still a lot of heavy lifting to do as it relates to the integration, and I'll give you an example. While we've made some really good progress on reducing the former corporate headquarters, we're not fully out of that headquarter building yet and we're not able to impair that lease until we're fully out of it. So that's an example of while we've made quite a bit of progress, there will likely be an impairment charge coming, still, and there -- we have a number of similar examples. So I would say, we're still going to be somewhere in that range, certainly, given that it was only about $4 million in the first quarter. It's going to pick up, and I would say that the back half of the year is going to see the bulk of that."

The first quarter revenue was about $236 million. That was about a 3% decrease from the prior year for that block of business. As you know, we've talked a lot about that continuing to decrease through this year such that it will probably bottom out in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of fiscal '19. And so while we are seeing the revenue that we expected, we still believe that it's going to continue to decrease as we start to recover from the absence of new business.

Our first quarter synergies were about $7 million. So that's $7 million out of the $50 million to $55 million. The activities that happened in that first quarter, and I'm not going to give you every single one, but generally speaking, we converted the payroll system as we talked about on our last call. We converted to the Cintas financial system. We have made progress on reducing the functions located at the former headquarters, and we have also converted or consolidated a few dozen branches into Cintas locations and 1 processing plant in 2 Cintas locations. So we have had some -- we've had a lot of activity, much of that coming towards the end of the first quarter where we'll start to see the synergies from those in the last 3 quarters of the year. I'm not ready to give you any number on how many we expect to eventually consolidate, but maybe I will give you a little bit of color on the integration activities. This is a -- it's a fairly complex process for us, and our partners are doing a great job of executing so far. But maybe I'll give you a couple of details of what goes on in one of these integration activities. It's about a 16-week process, and maybe I'll touch on a couple of areas starting with data. We need to -- for that location's information, we need to map every item and every product and service from a former product number in the legacy G&K system to the Cintas system. We need to set up every single G&K legacy customer into the Cintas system. That means everywhere, everywhere's garments sizes, the number and type of masks that they might have, all other items that they are getting serviced, the pricing related to each customer, wearer, mat, et cetera, any recent activity we need to bring over to know if we have new hires at a customer, if there are recent terminations or any other changes in the services. And then we've got to run parallel on invoicing data and other data to make sure that it has been loaded properly. So there's a lot of data work that needs to be done with each and every one of these. Next area is inventory. For example, we need to take every garment that we have from the G&K product line and map it or determine what we're going to do with that garment. Are we going to replace it with a Cintas product or are we going to continue to source that G&K product? So we've got to map all of those different products and services. We have to re-barcode every garment that is in service. So every garment that we have today has a barcode on it that indicates customer route number or wearer number. So the re-barcoding of that, I'll just give you a couple of numbers. 170,000 customer locations for legacy G&K, with an average of about 10 wearers, with 11 shirts and 11 pants, that's about 37.4 million garments that need to be re-barcoded. So it is quite the effort. And again, our team is doing a super job. And there are other areas that I could go through as well, but I just want to give you a little bit of a sense of the amount of detail as well as the amount of work that's included in each and every one of these consolidations. And I think we've been doing a great job at that. And I'll finish with -- one of the other things that we spent quite a bit of time on in this first quarter is doing a lot of mapping and creating a bridge from the legacy G&K system to our SAP system, and that is a big project. And in fact, we converted our first location to SAP yesterday, and we're certainly excited to see that happen. And as long as that continues to go well, we'll be ready to add or convert more and more of those locations that are going to remain open. So we're off to a really good start. We're right in line with where we expected. Our partners have done a super job of executing, and we'll provide more detail quarter-to-quarter as we move forward."

We talked previously about that organic growth rate kind of bottoming out, and that was kind of math associated with that ZEE acquisition. ZEE being 1/3 of the legacy business not growing, and yet, that legacy business was growing strongly. That kind of blended out at the bottom to about 3.3% organic growth rate, and we expected it to climb out to historic levels, and we're very pleased that it has. 11.9% is probably a little bit higher than we typically run. There's probably some easier comps benefiting us, but that's a business that we expect year in and year out to be growing high single digits. So in terms of the drivers, there's really no silver bullet, no one particular initiative. It's just a continued execution of the sales force and continuing to sell new programs, penetrating the existing accounts. Some of the ZEE customers as well will be part of that effort. And it's a very scalable business. There's a lot of capacity. So as we continue to grow that topline, if we can grow it organically at a high single digit rate, it is going to continue to push those margins forward. And as I mentioned in the script, 170 basis points year-over-year, that's outstanding. That is the benefit of those ZEE synergies kicking in, but at the same time, growing 11.9%. There's a lot of incremental profit falling to the bottom line pushing those margins."

And Shlomo, there's not really any one particular reason other than I think the economy is stable and conducive for us. I haven't seen much of a change, and our execution remains pretty good. I think as Paul mentioned, the last 2 quarters, we've seen a bit of an ease of the year-over-year oil and gas impact. And as we move forward from here, you can probably see from our guidance that we don't necessarily expect the 8% to continue but we still expect some pretty healthy organic growth as we move forward. Part of that reasoning is that oil and gas year-over-year, let's call it, easier comps, go away as we go into the back part of the year. And the other thing is we've talked a little bit about the hurricane impact. And while it could have been a lot worse, it's still going to be about an impact of a headwind of about 30 basis points for the remaining 9 months of the year. So when we think about where we are today, yes, we did get off to a pretty good start a little better than we expected. The oil and gas year-over-year comp was a little bit easier.

And the reason is because we have been able to have a very good and healthy new business effort, where 2/3 of our new business comes from what we call no programmers, in other words, those businesses that don't have uniform rental programs. And so in other words, we're able to get new businesses into our products and services even if they are not additive to employment.

Now Mario, look, the more jobs that get added, the better. We're certainly all for it and that will only have a positive impact on us. But if we see employment trends pull back just a little bit, we have been in that environment during the last 7 years and we've been able to grow nicely. So we are -- we like where we are, we like our product line and our services. They can add value to almost every business in the U.S. We like our execution and our ability to reach those business opportunities, and so we're optimistic."

We look at that First Aid and Safety business, it's a great business because it's -- we sell it under the umbrellas of safety, compliance. And those are 2 important umbrellas and add a lot of breadth to the offerings that we have, and we've been able to broaden our product offering. So things like training are big opportunities for us, continued sales of AEDs, continued sales of safety protection equipment, real nice opportunities. So we think we've got a lot of runway there. As it relates to the ZEE synergies, we think we're getting them, and I think the gross margin is a great sign of that. We are 1/3 larger than we were pre-ZEE, our gross margin has exceeded where we were prior to ZEE, and we think that as we continue to grow, that SG&A will likely come down some more to get that overall profit level back into the mid-teens.

If you remember, going back prior to fiscal '17, so fiscal '16 and beyond, we generally ran with an effective rate of somewhere in the neighborhood of 37%.

The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 7.3%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.8%. 
Operating income for the second quarter was $235 million compared to $200 million in last year's second quarter. Fiscal 2018 second quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $13 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition compared to about $3 million of such expenses in the second quarter of last year. Excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, operating income increased 21.8%. 
Operating income margin, excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses was 15.5% versus 16% last year. Current year second quarter operating margin was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. 
In addition, current year operating margin was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP.
Net income and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $137 million and $1.24, respectively. EPS was negatively impacted by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $0.07 and $0.02 in the second quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Excluding these expenses, EPS was $1.31 versus $1.14 last year, a 14.9% increase.
As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in today's press release, the integration of G&K continues to proceed as planned. Our pace of closing duplicate operations increased in the second quarter. We have now closed 50 operations. Also, 47% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This activity enabled us in the second quarter to realize about $14 million in synergies, almost twice the amount of synergies achieved in the first quarter, which is right in line with our expectations.
In addition, significant progress was made in our implementation of SAP, which remains on schedule. A total of 55 operations have been converted from the old operating system to the new SAP system.
Our second quarter was one of solid progress on 2 important investments: G&K and SAP. Meanwhile, strong execution on the day-to-day mission of profitable growth continued. The steadfast focus of our employees on helping our customers get Ready for the Workday is evidenced by the strong organic revenue and earnings per share growth rates.
As a result of our second quarter results, we are increasing our annual guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $6,365,000,000 to $6,430,000,000 and fiscal 2018 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.39 to $5.46. Our guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. It also assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%.
Note that our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business: Revenue of $895 million to $915 million compared to prior year amount of $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; and EPS contribution of about $0.17.
While the EPS guidance does not include any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred at the remainder of fiscal 2018 as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $60 million for the full fiscal year.
I want to comment on the impact to Cintas of U.S. tax reform. There will be significant benefits. As a profitable business with the vast majority of our earnings in the United States, we have historically paid a high tax rate. The reduction in the corporate tax rate will do Cintas earnings and increase cash. Also we expect many of our customers to benefit from tax reform and invest additional amounts of cash to grow their businesses. Healthy and growing customers are good, of course, for our our business. Tax reform will enable us to repay debt more quickly and have an additional cash on hand for our priorities, namely, investments, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases.
The signing of the legislation by the Presidents will be an accounting events for Cintas. We will need to revalue deferred tax liabilities. 
In addition, the lower corporate tax rate will be applied to January 1, resulting in a negative effective tax rate in our third quarter and a blended effective tax rate for the fiscal year. Our EPS guidance is based upon pretax reform effective tax rates of 31% to 30%, because we need more time to understand the new tax laws. 
However, we do want to provide you with the results in more preliminary analysis. Under the new tax laws, we expect the effective tax rate for this full fiscal year to be in the range of 8% to 12%. We will incorporate this lower fiscal year '18 rates into our guidance over the next several months. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and thereafter to generally be in the range of 23% to 26%.
Please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within fiscal year 2018 due differ, however, and are as follows: 66 in Q1 ,65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4. One less workday in a quarter has a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis.
We have 2 reportable operating segment: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,308,000,000, an increase of 30.8% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 7.3%.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points from 44.9% in last year's second quarter.
A slight year-over-year margin declined results from the inclusion in this year second quarter of a lower margin G&K business.
In time, the G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we further integrate this business, and we increasingly realize more synergies. For instance, one of the factors resulting in the lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is much higher in the Cintas legacy business. Total segment energy expense as a percent of revenue was 20 basis points greater than in last year's second quarter. Half of the increase was due to G&K. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive a significant improvements in G&K gross margin.
Our first day in Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $139 million, which was 11.5% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 10.8%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the second quarter compared to 46.1% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. While year-over-year improvements to gross margin driven by Zee acquisition synergies have largely been we still expect strong gross margin improvement as the business continues to grow.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Uniform Direct Sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our Fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $159 million, an increase of 8.9% compared to last year second quarter. The organic growth rate was 7.8%. All Other gross margin was 42.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 40.4% for last year's second quarter, an increase of 170 basis points.  Both businesses had healthy increases in gross margin.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% in the second quarter compared to 28.4% in last year's second quarter. Current year -- second quarter SG&A was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. 
In addition, current year SG&A was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to SAP depreciation and implementation costs. The prior year second quarter did not include any depreciation expense from SAP because the project was still in the pilot phase.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 33.3% compared to 34.9% for last year's second quarter. This equates to a $0.03 benefit to EPS year-over-year. Note that the effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve bills and releases relating to discrete items. As I stated earlier, our EPS guidance assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $236 million, and we had $22 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities in the first 6 months of fiscal 2018 was $379 million and free cash flow was $246 million.
Capital expenditures for the first half of the fiscal year were $132 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the 6-month period was as follows: $111 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $13 million in First Aid and Safety; and $8 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million.
As of November 30, total debt was $2,834,000,000, consisting of $300 million in short-term debt and $2,534,000,000 of long-term debt. At November 30, our leverage was 2.5x debt to EBITDA. Subsequent to quarter end on December 1, $300 million of fixed rate debt was a coupon of 6 and 18 matured. This debt was paid with cash on hand and from borrowings under our commercial paper program. 
On December 8, we paid a dividend of $1.62 per share, an increase of 21.8% over last year's dividend. We have increased this dividend for 34 consecutive years. It is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. 
Overall, our cash flow remain strong, and we continue to expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0 to 2.2x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

It's a little bit of nice performance in our legacy organic businesses, especially, our First Aid and Safety. And it's also a little bit of nice performance in the G&K revenue. I would that suggest that we're going to have another quarter of relatively normalized,  if you will, organic growth in the third.

We are pleased to report that revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,000,000,606, an increase of 26.4% over last year's second quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjust for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 7.7%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 7.3%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.8%. 
Operating income for the second quarter was $235 million compared to $200 million in last year's second quarter. Fiscal 2018 second quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $13 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition compared to about $3 million of such expenses in the second quarter of last year. Excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, operating income increased 21.8%. 
Operating income margin excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses was 15.5% versus 16% last year. Current year second quarter operating margin was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. 
In addition, current year operating margin was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP.
Net income and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $137 million and $1.24, respectively. EPS was negatively impacted by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $0.07 and $0.02 in the second quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Excluding these expenses, EPS was $1.31 versus $1.14 last year, a 14.9% increase.
As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in today's press release, the integration of G&K continues to proceed as planned. Our pace of closing duplicate operations increased in the second quarter. We have now closed 50 operations. Also, 47% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This activity enabled us in the second quarter to realize about $14 million in synergies, almost twice the amount of synergies achieved in the first quarter, which is right in line with our expectations.
In addition, significant progress was made in our implementation of SAP, which remains on schedule. A total of 55 operations have been converted from the old operating system to the new SAP system.
Our second quarter was one of solid progress on 2 important investments: G&K and SAP. Meanwhile, strong execution on the day-to-day mission of profitable growth continued. The steadfast focus of our employees on helping our customers get Ready for the Workday is evidenced by the strong organic revenue and earnings per share growth rates.
As a result of our second quarter results, we are increasing our annual guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $6,365,000,000 to $6,430,000,000 and fiscal 2018 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.39 to $5.46. Our guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. It also assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%.
Note that our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business: Revenue of $895 million to $915 million compared to prior year amount of $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; and EPS contribution of about $0.17.
While the EPS guidance does not include any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the remainder of fiscal 2018 as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $60 million for the full fiscal year.
I want to comment on the impact to Cintas of U.S. tax reform. There will be significant benefits. As a profitable business with the vast majority of our earnings in the United States, we have historically paid a high tax rate. The reduction in the corporate tax rate will boost Cintas earnings and increase cash. Also, we expect many of our customers to benefit from tax reform and invest additional amounts of cash to grow their businesses. Healthy and growing customers are good, of course, for our business. Tax reform will enable us to repay debt more quickly and then have additional cash on hand for our priorities, namely, investments, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases.
The signing of the legislation by the President will be an accounting event for Cintas. We will need to revalue deferred tax liabilities. 
In addition, the lower corporate tax rate will be applied January 1, resulting in a negative effective tax rate in our third quarter and a blended effective tax rate for the fiscal year. Our EPS guidance is based upon pretax reform effective tax rates of 31% to 33%, because we need more time to understand the new tax laws. 
However, we do want to provide you with the results of our preliminary analysis. Under the new tax laws, we expect the effective tax rate for this full fiscal year to be in the range of 8% to 12%. We will incorporate this lower fiscal year '18 rates into our guidance over the next several months. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and thereafter to generally be in the range of 23% to 26%.
Please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within fiscal year 2018 do differ, however, and are as follows: 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4. One less workday in a quarter has a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis.
We have 2 reportable operating segment: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,308,000,000, an increase of 30.8% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 7.3%.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points from 44.9% in last year's second quarter.
A slight year-over-year margin decline results from the inclusion in this year's second quarter of a lower margin G&K business.
In time, the G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is much higher than the Cintas legacy business. Total segment energy expense as a percent of revenue was 20 basis points greater than in last year's second quarter. Half of the increase was due to G&K. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $139 million, which was 11.5% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 10.8%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the second quarter compared to 46.1% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. While year-over-year improvements to gross margin driven by ZEE acquisition synergies have largely been lapped, we still expect strong gross margin improvements as the business continues to grow.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Uniform Direct Sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our Fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $159 million, an increase of 8.9% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 7.8%. All Other gross margin was 42.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 40.4% for last year's second quarter, an increase of 170 basis points. Both businesses had healthy increases in gross margin.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% in the second quarter compared to 28.4% in last year's second quarter. Current year second quarter SG&A was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. 
In addition, current year SG&A was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to SAP depreciation and implementation costs. The prior year second quarter did not include any depreciation expense from SAP because the project was still in the pilot phase.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 33.3% compared to 34.9% for last year's second quarter. This equates to a $0.03 benefit to EPS year-over-year. Note that the effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve bills and releases relating to discrete items. As stated earlier, our EPS guidance assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $236 million, and we had $22 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities in the first 6 months of fiscal 2018 was $379 million and free cash flow was $246 million.
Capital expenditures for the first half of the fiscal year were $132 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the 6-month period was as follows: $111 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $13 million in First Aid and Safety; and $8 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million.
As of November 30, total debt was $2,834,000,000, consisting of $300 million in short-term debt and $2,534,000,000 of long-term debt. At November 30, our leverage was 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Subsequent to quarter end on December 1, $300 million of fixed rate debt with a coupon of 6.18% matured. This debt was paid with cash on hand and from borrowings under our commercial paper program. 
On December 8, we paid a dividend of $1.62 per share, an increase of 21.8% over last year's dividend. We have increased this dividend for 34 consecutive years. It is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. 
Overall, our cash flow remain strong, and we continue to expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0 to 2.2x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018.

Andrew, when we think about organic growth, keep in mind, our third quarter will be the same kind of organic growth calculation that we've been under for the first 2 quarters, and the fourth quarter is going to be impacted by the G&K deal being lapped, right. So we are -- it's just simply a math problem. We are going to see organic growth drop in the fourth quarter. So to answer your question about the guidance, it's a little bit of both. It's a little bit of nice performance in our legacy organic businesses, especially, our First Aid and Safety. And it's also a little bit of nice performance in the G&K revenue. I would suggest that we're going to have another quarter of relatively normalized, if you will, organic growth in the third. It's going to come down in the fourth, just simply because we've lapped that and that's the way the math works. We then expect to see as we move in to '19, that organic growth begin to accelerate back to Cintas levels."

We are pleased to report that revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,606,000,000, an increase of 26.4% over last year's second quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.7%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 7.3%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.8%. 
Operating income for the second quarter was $235 million compared to $200 million in last year's second quarter. Fiscal 2018 second quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $13 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition compared to about $3 million of such expenses in the second quarter of last year. Excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, operating income increased 21.8%. 
Operating income margin, excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, was 15.5% versus 16% last year. Current year second quarter operating margin was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. 
In addition, current year operating margin was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP.
Net income and earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $137 million and $1.24, respectively. EPS was negatively impacted by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $0.07 and $0.02 in the second quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Excluding these expenses, EPS was $1.31 versus $1.14 last year, a 14.9% increase.
As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in today's press release, the integration of G&K continues to proceed as planned. Our pace of closing duplicate operations increased in the second quarter. We have now closed 50 operations. Also, 47% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This activity enabled us in the second quarter to realize about $14 million in synergies, almost twice the amount of synergies achieved in the first quarter, which is right in line with our expectations.
In addition, significant progress was made in our implementation of SAP, which remains on schedule. A total of 55 operations have been converted from the old operating system to the new SAP system.
Our second quarter was one of solid progress on 2 important investments: G&K and SAP. Meanwhile, strong execution on the day-to-day mission of profitable growth continued. The steadfast focus of our employees on helping our customers get Ready for the Workday is evidenced by the strong organic revenue and earnings per share growth rates.
As a result of our second quarter results, we are increasing our annual guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $6,365,000,000 to $6,430,000,000 and fiscal 2018 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.39 to $5.46. Our guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. It also assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%.
Note that our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business: Revenue of $895 million to $915 million compared to a prior year amount of $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; and EPS contribution of about $0.17.
While the EPS guidance does not include any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the remainder of fiscal 2018 as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $60 million for the full fiscal year.
I want to comment on the impact to Cintas of U.S. tax reform. There will be significant benefits. As a profitable business with the vast majority of our earnings in the United States, we have historically paid a high tax rate. The reduction in the corporate tax rate will boost Cintas' earnings and increase cash. Also, we expect many of our customers to benefit from tax reform and invest additional amounts of cash to grow their businesses. Healthy and growing customers are good, of course, for our business. Tax reform will enable us to repay debt more quickly and then have additional cash on hand for our priorities, namely, investments, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases.
The signing of the legislation by the President will be an accounting event for Cintas. We will need to revalue deferred tax liabilities. 
In addition, the lower corporate tax rate will be applied January 1, resulting in a negative effective tax rate in our third quarter and a blended effective tax rate for the fiscal year. Our EPS guidance is based upon pretax reform effective tax rates of 31% to 33%, because we need more time to understand the new tax laws. 
However, we do want to provide you with the results of our preliminary analysis. Under the new tax laws, we expect the effective tax rate for this full fiscal year to be in the range of 8% to 12%. We will incorporate this lower fiscal year '18 rates into our guidance over the next several months. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and thereafter to generally be in the range of 23% to 26%.
Please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within fiscal year 2018 do differ, however, and are as follows: 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4. One less workday in a quarter has a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis.
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,308,000,000, an increase of 30.8% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 7.3%.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points from 44.9% in last year's second quarter.
A slight year-over-year margin decline results from the inclusion in this year's second quarter of a lower margin G&K business.
In time, the G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas' legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is much higher than the Cintas legacy business. Total segment energy expense as a percent of revenue was 20 basis points greater than in last year's second quarter. Half of the increase was due to G&K. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $139 million, which was 11.5% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 10.8%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the second quarter compared to 46.1% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. While year-over-year improvements to gross margin driven by ZEE acquisition synergies have largely been lapped, we still expect strong gross margin improvements as the business continues to grow.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Uniform Direct Sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our Fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $159 million, an increase of 8.9% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 7.8%. All Other gross margin was 42.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 40.4% for last year's second quarter, an increase of 170 basis points. Both businesses had healthy increases in gross margin.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% in the second quarter compared to 28.4% in last year's second quarter. Current year second quarter SG&A was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. 
In addition, current year SG&A was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to SAP depreciation and implementation costs. The prior year second quarter did not include any depreciation expense from SAP because the project was still in the pilot phase.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 33.3% compared to 34.9% for last year's second quarter. This equates to a $0.03 benefit to EPS year-over-year. Note that the effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve bills and releases relating to discrete items. As stated earlier, our EPS guidance assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $236 million, and we had $22 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities in the first 6 months of fiscal 2018 was $379 million and free cash flow was $246 million.
Capital expenditures for the first half of the fiscal year were $132 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the 6-month period was as follows: $111 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $13 million in First Aid and Safety; and $8 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million.
As of November 30, total debt was $2,834,000,000, consisting of $300 million in short-term debt and $2,534,000,000 of long-term debt. At November 30, our leverage was 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Subsequent to quarter end on December 1, $300 million of fixed rate debt with a coupon of 6 1/8% matured. This debt was paid with cash on hand and from borrowings under our commercial paper program. 
On December 8, we paid a dividend of $1.62 per share, an increase of 21.8% over last year's dividend. We have increased this dividend for 34 consecutive years. It is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. 
Overall, our cash flow remain strong, and we continue to expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0 to 2.2x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

We are pleased to report that revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,606,000,000, an increase of 26.4% over last year's second quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.7%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 7.3%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.8%. 
Operating income for the second quarter was $235 million compared to $200 million in last year's second quarter. Fiscal 2018 second quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $13 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition compared to about $3 million of such expenses in the second quarter of last year. Excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, operating income increased 21.8%. 
Operating income margin, excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, was 15.5% versus 16% last year. Current year second quarter operating margin was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. 
In addition, current year operating margin was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP.
Net income and earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $137 million and $1.24, respectively. EPS was negatively impacted by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $0.07 and $0.02 in the second quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Excluding these expenses, EPS was $1.31 versus $1.14 last year, a 14.9% increase.
As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in today's press release, the integration of G&K continues to proceed as planned. Our pace of closing duplicate operations increased in the second quarter. We have now closed 50 operations. Also, 47% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This activity enabled us in the second quarter to realize about $14 million in synergies, almost twice the amount of synergies achieved in the first quarter, which is right in line with our expectations.
In addition, significant progress was made in our implementation of SAP, which remains on schedule. A total of 55 operations have been converted from the old operating system to the new SAP system.
Our second quarter was one of solid progress on 2 important investments: G&K and SAP. Meanwhile, strong execution on the day-to-day mission of profitable growth continued. The steadfast focus of our employees on helping our customers get Ready for the Workday is evidenced by the strong organic revenue and earnings per share growth rates.
As a result of our second quarter results, we are increasing our annual guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $6,365,000,000 to $6,430,000,000 and fiscal 2018 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.39 to $5.46. Our guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. It also assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%.
Note that our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business: Revenue of $895 million to $915 million compared to a prior year amount of $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; and EPS contribution of about $0.17.
While the EPS guidance does not include any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the remainder of fiscal 2018 as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $60 million for the full fiscal year.
I want to comment on the impact to Cintas of U.S. tax reform. There will be significant benefits. As a profitable business with the vast majority of our earnings in the United States, we have historically paid a high tax rate. The reduction in the corporate tax rate will boost Cintas' earnings and increase cash. Also, we expect many of our customers to benefit from tax reform and invest additional amounts of cash to grow their businesses. Healthy and growing customers are good, of course, for our business. Tax reform will enable us to repay debt more quickly and then have additional cash on hand for our priorities, namely, investments, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases.
The signing of the legislation by the President will be an accounting event for Cintas. We will need to revalue deferred tax liabilities. 
In addition, the lower corporate tax rate will be applied January 1, resulting in a negative effective tax rate in our third quarter and a blended effective tax rate for the fiscal year. Our EPS guidance is based upon pretax reform effective tax rates of 31% to 33%, because we need more time to understand the new tax laws. 
However, we do want to provide you with the results of our preliminary analysis. Under the new tax laws, we expect the effective tax rate for this full fiscal year to be in the range of 8% to 12%. We will incorporate this lower fiscal year '18 rates into our guidance over the next several months. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and thereafter to generally be in the range of 23% to 26%.
Please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within fiscal year 2018 do differ, however, and are as follows: 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4. One less workday in a quarter has a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis.
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,308,000,000, an increase of 30.8% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 7.3%.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points from 44.9% in last year's second quarter.
A slight year-over-year margin decline results from the inclusion in this year's second quarter of a lower margin G&K business.
In time, the G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas' legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is much higher than the Cintas legacy business. Total segment energy expense as a percent of revenue was 20 basis points greater than in last year's second quarter. Half of the increase was due to G&K. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $139 million, which was 11.5% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 10.8%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the second quarter compared to 46.1% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. While year-over-year improvements to gross margin driven by ZEE acquisition synergies have largely been lapped, we still expect strong gross margin improvements as the business continues to grow.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Uniform Direct Sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our Fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $159 million, an increase of 8.9% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 7.8%. All Other gross margin was 42.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 40.4% for last year's second quarter, an increase of 170 basis points. Both businesses had healthy increases in gross margin.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% in the second quarter compared to 28.4% in last year's second quarter. Current year second quarter SG&A was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. 
In addition, current year SG&A was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to SAP depreciation and implementation costs. The prior year second quarter did not include any depreciation expense from SAP because the project was still in the pilot phase.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 33.3% compared to 34.9% for last year's second quarter. This equates to a $0.03 benefit to EPS year-over-year. Note that the effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve bills and releases relating to discrete items. As stated earlier, our EPS guidance assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $236 million, and we had $22 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities in the first 6 months of fiscal 2018 was $379 million and free cash flow was $246 million.
Capital expenditures for the first half of the fiscal year were $132 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the 6-month period was as follows: $111 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $13 million in First Aid and Safety; and $8 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million.
As of November 30, total debt was $2,834,000,000, consisting of $300 million in short-term debt and $2,534,000,000 of long-term debt. At November 30, our leverage was 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Subsequent to quarter end on December 1, $300 million of fixed rate debt with a coupon of 6 1/8% matured. This debt was paid with cash on hand and from borrowings under our commercial paper program. 
On December 8, we paid a dividend of $1.62 per share, an increase of 21.8% over last year's dividend. We have increased this dividend for 34 consecutive years. It is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. 
Overall, our cash flow remain strong, and we continue to expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0 to 2.2x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

First of all, the revenue itself is going to bottom out, and that -- or that the decrease is going to stop, probably in our fourth quarter. But we have hired. We -- first of all, we brought on many legacy G&K salespeople for the open positions that they had. We have been hiring and training, and we saw some nice improvements in productivity from the first quarter to the second. And we like what we see so far. So -- and as you probably know, Gary, with our business, we sell many small accounts every single week and it takes a little bit of time for all of those small accounts to accumulate over time. And so as we think about fiscal '19, we will enter that fiscal year with a little bit better new business momentum from that block of salespeople. We will have seen the bottom of the trough in terms of the revenue overall. And then lastly, yes, we're going to start to see some benefits of cross-sell and penetration into those customers. I don't believe we'll see any impact in fiscal '18. But fiscal '19, we should start to see some impact. I think the biggest thing is really the new business effort, though, that will get back on track after about a year of those legacy G&K salespeople seeing a reverse momentum because of the announcement of the acquisition and then the retraining, et cetera."
