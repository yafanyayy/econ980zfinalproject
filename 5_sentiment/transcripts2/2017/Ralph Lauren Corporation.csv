As you saw in the release this morning, the company and I mutually agreed to part ways. And I want to take a brief moment to give you some context. Ralph and I both love and respect the DNA of this great brand and we recognize the need to evolve. However, we have found that we have different views on how to evolve the creative and consumer-facing parts of the business. I want everyone on the call, shareholders and analysts, to know that the board, Ralph and I, have over the last months, worked very hard to find common ground. After many serious conversations with one another, we mutually agreed to part ways. None of this changes how proud I am of all the progress we made against the goals we laid out in our Way Forward Plan in June. As I've shared then, the Way Forward Plan is about refocusing on the core of what made us iconic and evolving that core for today, to strengthen the brand and return the company to long-term profitable growth. Both Ralph and the board are committed to continued execution of our plan. We are on track to deliver on our commitments. A key driver to this is our strengthened management team and their ability to drive high-quality execution. Together, we have already created a strong foundation, one that puts us in a position to continue to deliver. Our progress includes the strengthening of the leadership team, refocusing on our core brands, starting to evolve our iconic products and marketing, matching inventory to demand, drastically reducing lead times, creating a more nimble organizational structure, beginning to rightsize the store fleet, achieving the initial cost reductions and as we learned from our recent global employee survey, we have substantially improved the employee engagement and understanding of the strategy. 
When Jane later in this call will speak about the progress we made in the third quarter, you will hear how these initiatives are starting to show up in the company's P&L. I remain very confident that the Way Forward framework has the ability to drive the company back to high performance. And I will stay on until May 1 to ensure the uninterrupted execution. Before I turn it over to Jane for her to review the progress we have made on the Way Forward Plan in the quarter, I want to say a few words about her. As I begin my transition, she will take charge of the execution of our plan. Jane and I have been copilots since she joined, and we will work closely together to make this transition successful. She has the credibility, the experience and the trust from Ralph and the board. I could not be more confident in her ability to deliver. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jane."

Before I review our performance and future outlook, I want to reiterate that our foundation is strong. As Stefan said, we worked very closely since I joined and we will continue that partnership through his extended transition period to ensure that our progress is uninterrupted. 
With the support of Ralph, the board and together with our leadership team, I am committed to leading our continued execution. We are as focused as we have ever been on delivering the Way Forward Plan, to strengthen the brand and drive sustainable profitable growth over the long term. 
Now on to our performance. First, let's review the progress we made this quarter in executing the Way Forward Plan, starting with products for Fall 2017. First, we refocused and evolved our iconic core product offering. We updated our color palettes, materials and fits, incorporating more consumer insights and marketplace intelligence into our decision making. 
Second, we improved our discipline in applying a systematic, repeatable way of building a stronger assortment. This means being very clear on what we are testing, what we are growing and what icons we are reinventing. This has enabled us to cut the long tail of unproductive styles, delivering a double-digit reduction in the number of SKUs we have designed for Fall 2017, resulting in a much more focused, productive assortment and lower development cost. 
Third, our improved discipline in the assortment creation is enabling us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments. Our premarket commitment for next fall is down significantly to last year. For Polo, we committed to only 15% of our buys premarket before our wholesale customers placed their orders. Last year, this figure was 60%. As a result, we are buying much more informed, which will significantly improve our ability to match inventory to demand. The initial feedback from our wholesale customers that have seen our fall product had been very positive. 
Fourth, we are well under way to build a best-in-class sourcing capability and the demand-driven supply chain. We remain on track to reach our goal of a 9-month lead time. We continue to expect to get halfway there by the end of this fiscal year and 90% there by the end of next fiscal year. This quarter, we achieved our goal of having all our core fabrics platformed for the upcoming Fall 2017 season, which enables us to make further progress in cutting our lead times. 
Moving on to marketing. We are making good progress in our search for a Chief Marketing Officer. In the meantime, we are preparing for our first cut through [ph] Polo marketing campaign for summer. For this past fall holiday season, we launched the Ralph Lauren Icons marketing campaign, which was built on our goal to refocus on and evolve our core iconic products in [ph] luxury. The campaign was very well received, and we will be launching the second part of the campaign later this month. 
Moving on to our financials for the quarter. We continued to deliver against our commitments. We increased our quality of sales by moderating discount levels, lowering our inventory to align supply with demand and reducing our lead times. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 12%, in line with guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 12.8%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating margin was up about 40 basis points to last year. Additionally, non-GAAP operating margin expanded in constant currency in both the retail and wholesale segments. The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in November, largely driven by gross margin and proactive expense management. Adjusted gross margin expanded by 140 basis points versus last year, driven by favorable geographic and channel mix and initiatives to improve quality of sales, including reduced promotional activity across our businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 100 basis points. 
Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other related charges, were down 7% compared to last year as a result of expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan, including streamlining the organization to reduce headcount, process changes in product development to reduce costs and closing unprofitable stores to improve the profitability of our fleet. 
In North America, across our businesses, the team started to execute against the plan we shared last quarter to come back to high performance. North America continues to be our most challenged market. Revenue declined 15% in the quarter, led by a planned [ph] decline in wholesale. We strengthened our foundation by strategically reducing shipments to better align with underlying demand and rightsize our inventory levels. In addition, we started to rebalance our distribution in our off-price wholesale business. We also executed these important quality of sales initiatives in our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business. These actions will continue to impact our results in the fourth quarter on our e-commerce site. E-commerce has been our most over promoted channel, and we are moving to harmonize pricing across channels and reduce promotion depth. These are the first steps in the execution of our plan to come back to high performance in North America. They are difficult but necessary actions to build a healthy base to grow from. We expect these actions to continue through the first half of fiscal 2018. 
In Europe, store comps improved in the third quarter despite lower markdowns as we continue to deliver on our quality of sales initiatives. Our Europe team continued to drive substantial improvement in both gross margin and operating margin in constant currency. Revenue was down 6% in constant currency and 12% on a reported basis. As expected, we shifted $18 million of wholesale shipments to the fourth quarter to better align with demand in our wholesale doors. Excluding this shift, revenue would have been close to flat in constant currency. 
In our retail business in Europe, we reduced promotion, drove up AURs and expanded gross margin significantly on a year-over-year basis in constant currency. Our team continues to focus on tighter inventory management and strengthening the assortment going forward. 
Similarly, in Asia, we drove significantly lower markdown rates in each channel and expanded margins. Revenue was down 1% in constant currency and up 4% on a reported basis. Comp growth was positive in Asia in the third quarter. Going forward, we are focused on returning to revenue growth in Asia as new distribution growth offsets closures. 
Moving to comparable store sales. On a global basis, comps decreased 4% in constant currency. As a reminder, the high volume week after Christmas was included in the company's third quarter this year versus the fourth quarter last year with a positive impact of approximately 2.5 percentage points, which will pressure comps in the fourth quarter. Additionally, Easter will shift into the first quarter of FY '18. The combined effect of these 2 calendar shifts will pressure fourth quarter comps approximately 3 percentage points. 
Moving to global e-commerce. Revenues declined 9% in constant currency. The e-commerce decline is driven by our initiatives in the U.S. that I just took you through. The impact of these actions will accelerate in the fourth quarter and continue to pressure the first half of fiscal 2018. 
Turning to our store fleet. We are on track to close approximately 50 stores this year. We closed 12 stores in the third quarter and 27 year-to-date. This puts us on track to achieve the savings that we identified from store closures of approximately $70 million. Importantly, we are also on track with our total savings target. At this time, restructuring charges are forecasted to be about $400 million and inventory charges about $150 million associated with the company's Way Forward Plan. 
In this quarter, we recorded $91 million in restructuring-related impairments and inventory charges. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our progress with the Way Forward Plan is reflected in our inventory position. At the end of the third quarter, inventory declined 23% to $984 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by both restructuring actions and our operating process initiatives, including a proactive pullback in receipts and moving towards a demand-driven supply chain. We ended the third quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $589 million of total debt. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal '17. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan and severance-related payments associated with the CEO departure announced today. 
For fiscal '17, we are maintaining our guidance. We continue to expect revenues to decrease at a low double-digit rate as we execute the Way Forward Plan. Based on our current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal '17. We also continue to expect operating margin for fiscal '17 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, infrastructure investments and fixed cost deleverage. The fiscal 2017 tax rate is estimated to be approximately 29%. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be down mid teens on a reported basis. This compares 13 weeks this year to 14 weeks last year. The 53rd week last year contributed approximately $72 million of net revenue, including $10 million in the wholesale segment and $62 million in the retail segment as well as $12 million of operating income. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and will pressure gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. 
Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 6% to 6.5%. Foreign currency is estimated to pressure operating margin by about 100 basis points. The fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. We now expect capital expenditures for fiscal '17 to be approximately $325 million, down $50 million from our previous guidance of $375 million as we increased our rigor and focus on return on investment. 
Regarding share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $100 million of our stock and we plan to execute another $100 million in the fourth quarter to reach $200 million for the full year, consistent with our communication in June. Our expectations for fiscal '18 are consistent with the outlook we provided at our Investor Day in June. We continue to expect the magnitude of revenue decline to stabilize and be less than the declines in fiscal '17. Currently, we are forecasting revenue in fiscal '18 to decline high single digits in constant currency. This includes 200 basis points of pressure from our actions in rightsizing our distribution in both wholesale and retail, and another 200 basis points from the previously announced closure of Denim & Supply. These actions will be taken in conjunction with our quality of sales and price harmonization initiatives. We expect our trend to improve in the second half of the year as we move forward in the execution of the Way Forward Plan. 
We expect operating margin to expand in fiscal '18 in constant currency, driven by both gross margin and operating cost improvement. We plan to provide more specific guidance for fiscal '18 on our fourth quarter call in May, as is our practice. 
In summary, we have created a strong foundation and we are delivering our Way Forward Plan commitments. As I look ahead, with the support of Ralph, the board and together with our leadership team, we have the key elements in place to ensure our continued progress. With the passion and commitment of over 25,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe, we will intensify our execution of the plan, which will strengthen our brand and return us to long-term profitable growth. With that, I want to turn the call back to Stefan for some closing remarks."

Our commitment is to get to profitable growth. It will be a combination of top line growth, and in the near term, gross margin expansion and leveraging a better and more efficient cost structure. So we do see gross margin expansion. You've seen, over the past several quarters, that we've had favorable trends in gross margin in this quarter. If you look at it on a constant currency basis, we expanded gross margin by 240 basis points. Obviously, we had 100 points of pressure from foreign currency, but we got a benefit from -- about half of the 140 points was a benefit from channel and geographic mix. I expect that to continue. And then importantly, a little less than half of our gross margin expansion came directly from our quality of sales initiatives where, across our businesses, we reduced promotions and discount levels, and we're able to pull that through in terms of gross margin. So I do see that as a durable tailwind for us as we move into the future."

As you look at our results and our trends on a year-to-date basis, the primary driver of what's happening in North America is a result of our strategic actions. First, if I just take this quarter, about half of the revenue decline was attributable to our efforts in the Way Forward Plan to really match our inventories to demand. In this quarter, that was about -- that attributed about half of the decline that we saw. The other component, about 30%, was a reduction that we took to lower excess inventory to the value channels in wholesale. So as we said, we think we're out of balance today and we are aggressively moving to right size that balance. So that's a part -- as you look at the trend, a great deal of that is attributable to what we've decided to do as a part of the Way Forward Plan. When we have a supply chain that is closer to market and closer to demand, when -- as we continue to improve our ability to buy informed, we believe we can get back to share growth in our wholesale channel, and that will be a propellant of growth for us as we move forward."

That said, there's not a lot of clarity right now on the various proposals, and specifically, the border adjustment proposal. And there's a lot of speculation. We are taking that very seriously and are closely monitoring any decisions made by the new administration. We're obviously looking across our supply chain and looking for opportunities to mitigate any impact that we might see. As a part of the retail community, we're playing a role in that community to put forth the impacts that this kind of action could have. So we are looking to -- as we look forward, of course, we will comply with any new legislation, as has been our practice, and move swiftly to mitigate any of those actions. But right now we are looking at scenarios and alternatives and waiting to see what legislation will actually be enacted."

Yes, we are anticipating more closures with our retail partners. In fact, as of the end of Q3, we have worked closely and collaboratively with our department store partners and have worked through about 70% alignment on that point of sale closures that we announced last quarter that would reduce our points of distribution in department stores by 20% to 25%. So we are well underway there. We're obviously working in partnership to -- with them to understand their future door plants so that we're fully aligned on that. And that's incorporated into our overall guidance. It's about between door closures and the wholesale closure, it's about 200 basis points of pressure. So I feel that we are aligned with our partners and we are modeling that into our guidance. In terms of the right balance with what I call off-price wholesale, what we know as it touchtone is we have to be where the consumer wants to shop. And so they're an important part of our distribution. But what we also know is that we are not in balance where that distribution should be. So what we've modeled is continued rebalancing of that channel through the balance of FY '18 and that we'll be down significantly double-digit as we move through FY '18."

As you saw in the release this morning, the company and I mutually agreed to part ways. And I want to take a brief moment to give you some context. Ralph and I both love and respect the DNA of this great brand and we recognize the need to evolve. However, we have found that we have different views on how to evolve the creative and consumer-facing parts of the business. I want everyone on the call, shareholders and analysts, to know that the board, Ralph and I, have over the last months, worked very hard to find common ground. After many serious conversations with one another, we mutually agreed to part ways. None of this changes how proud I am of all the progress we made against the goals we laid out in our Way Forward Plan in June. As I've shared then, the Way Forward Plan is about refocusing on the core of what made us iconic and evolving that core for today, to strengthen the brand and return the company to long-term profitable growth. Both Ralph and the board are committed to continued execution of our plan. We are on track to deliver on our commitments. A key driver to this is our strengthened management team and their ability to drive high-quality execution. Together, we have already created a strong foundation, one that puts us in a position to continue to deliver. Our progress includes the strengthening of the leadership team, refocusing on our core brands, starting to evolve our iconic products and marketing, matching inventory to demand, drastically reducing lead times, creating a more nimble organizational structure, beginning to rightsize the store fleet, achieving the initial cost reductions and as we learned from our recent global employee survey, we have substantially improved the employee engagement and understanding of the strategy. 
When Jane later in this call will speak about the progress we made in the third quarter, you will hear how these initiatives are starting to show up in the company's P&L. I remain very confident that the Way Forward framework has the ability to drive the company back to high performance. And I will stay on until May 1 to ensure the uninterrupted execution. Before I turn it over to Jane for her to review the progress we have made on the Way Forward Plan in the quarter, I want to say a few words about her. As I begin my transition, she will take charge of the execution of our plan. Jane and I have been copilots since she joined, and we will work closely together to make this transition successful. She has the credibility, the experience and the trust from Ralph and the board. I could not be more confident in her ability to deliver. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jane."

With the support of Ralph, the board and together with our leadership team, I am committed to leading our continued execution. We are as focused as we have ever been on delivering the Way Forward Plan, to strengthen the brand and drive sustainable profitable growth over the long term. 
Now on to our performance. First, let's review the progress we made this quarter in executing the Way Forward Plan, starting with products for Fall 2017. First, we refocused and evolved our iconic core product offering. We updated our color palettes, materials and fits, incorporating more consumer insights and marketplace intelligence into our decision making. 
Second, we improved our discipline in applying a systematic, repeatable way of building a stronger assortment. This means being very clear on what we are testing, what we are growing and what icons we are reinventing. This has enabled us to cut the long tail of unproductive styles, delivering a double-digit reduction in the number of SKUs we have designed for Fall 2017, resulting in a much more focused, productive assortment and lower development cost. 
Third, our improved discipline in the assortment creation is enabling us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments. Our premarket commitment for next fall is down significantly to last year. For Polo, we committed to only 15% of our buys premarket before our wholesale customers placed their orders. Last year, this figure was 60%. As a result, we are buying much more informed, which will significantly improve our ability to match inventory to demand. The initial feedback from our wholesale customers that have seen our fall product had been very positive. 
Fourth, we are well under way to build a best-in-class sourcing capability and the demand-driven supply chain. We remain on track to reach our goal of a 9-month lead time. We continue to expect to get halfway there by the end of this fiscal year and 90% there by the end of next fiscal year. This quarter, we achieved our goal of having all our core fabrics platformed for the upcoming Fall 2017 season, which enables us to make further progress in cutting our lead times. 
Moving on to marketing. We are making good progress in our search for a Chief Marketing Officer. In the meantime, we are preparing for our first cut-through Polo marketing campaign for summer. For this past fall holiday season, we launched the Ralph Lauren Icons marketing campaign, which was built on our goal to refocus on and evolve our core iconic products and luxury. The campaign was very well received, and we will be launching the second part of the campaign later this month. 
Moving on to our financials for the quarter. We continued to deliver against our commitments. We increased our quality of sales by moderating discount levels, lowering our inventory to align supply with demand and reducing our lead times. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 12%, in line with guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 12.8%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating margin was up about 40 basis points to last year. Additionally, non-GAAP operating margin expanded in constant currency in both the retail and wholesale segments. The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in November, largely driven by gross margin and proactive expense management. Adjusted gross margin expanded by 140 basis points versus last year, driven by favorable geographic and channel mix and initiatives to improve quality of sales, including reduced promotional activity across our businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 100 basis points. 
Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other related charges, were down 7% compared to last year as a result of expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan, including streamlining the organization to reduce headcount, process changes in product development to reduce costs and closing unprofitable stores to improve the profitability of our fleet. 
In North America, across our businesses, the team started to execute against the plan we shared last quarter to come back to high performance. North America continues to be our most challenged market. Revenue declined 15% in the quarter, led by a planned decline in wholesale. We strengthened our foundation by strategically reducing shipments to better align with underlying demand and rightsize our inventory levels. In addition, we started to rebalance our distribution in our off-price wholesale business. We also executed these important quality of sales initiatives in our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business. These actions will continue to impact our results in the fourth quarter on our e-commerce site. E-commerce has been our most over promoted channel, and we are moving to harmonize pricing across channels and reduce promotion depth. These are the first steps in the execution of our plan to come back to high performance in North America. They are difficult but necessary actions to build a healthy base to grow from. We expect these actions to continue through the first half of fiscal 2018. 
In Europe, store comps improved in the third quarter despite lower markdowns as we continue to deliver on our quality of sales initiatives. Our Europe team continued to drive substantial improvement in both gross margin and operating margin in constant currency. Revenue was down 6% in constant currency and 12% on a reported basis. As expected, we shifted $18 million of wholesale shipments to the fourth quarter to better align with demand in our wholesale doors. Excluding this shift, revenue would have been close to flat in constant currency. 
In our retail business in Europe, we reduced promotion, drove up AURs and expanded gross margin significantly on a year-over-year basis in constant currency. Our team continues to focus on tighter inventory management and strengthening the assortment going forward. 
Similarly, in Asia, we drove significantly lower markdown rates in each channel and expanded margins. Revenue was down 1% in constant currency and up 4% on a reported basis. Comp growth was positive in Asia in the third quarter. Going forward, we are focused on returning to revenue growth in Asia as new distribution growth offsets closures. 
Moving to comparable store sales. On a global basis, comps decreased 4% in constant currency. As a reminder, the high volume week after Christmas was included in the company's third quarter this year versus the fourth quarter last year with a positive impact of approximately 2.5 percentage points, which will pressure comps in the fourth quarter. Additionally, Easter will shift into the first quarter of FY '18. The combined effect of these 2 calendar shifts will pressure fourth quarter comps approximately 3 percentage points. 
Moving to global e-commerce. Revenues declined 9% in constant currency. The e-commerce decline is driven by our initiatives in the U.S. that I just took you through. The impact of these actions will accelerate in the fourth quarter and continue to pressure the first half of fiscal 2018. 
Turning to our store fleet. We are on track to close approximately 50 stores this year. We closed 12 stores in the third quarter and 27 year-to-date. This puts us on track to achieve the savings that we identified from store closures of approximately $70 million. Importantly, we are also on track with our total savings target. At this time, restructuring charges are forecasted to be about $400 million and inventory charges about $150 million associated with the company's Way Forward Plan. 
In this quarter, we recorded $91 million in restructuring-related impairments and inventory charges. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our progress with the Way Forward Plan is reflected in our inventory position. At the end of the third quarter, inventory declined 23% to $984 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by both restructuring actions and our operating process initiatives, including a proactive pullback in receipts and moving towards a demand-driven supply chain. We ended the third quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $589 million of total debt. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal '17. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan and severance-related payments associated with the CEO departure announced today. 
For fiscal '17, we are maintaining our guidance. We continue to expect revenues to decrease at a low double-digit rate as we execute the Way Forward Plan. Based on our current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal '17. We also continue to expect operating margin for fiscal '17 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, infrastructure investments and fixed cost deleverage. The fiscal 2017 tax rate is estimated to be approximately 29%. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be down mid teens on a reported basis. This compares 13 weeks this year to 14 weeks last year. The 53rd week last year contributed approximately $72 million of net revenue, including $10 million in the wholesale segment and $62 million in the retail segment as well as $12 million of operating income. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and will pressure gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. 
Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 6% to 6.5%. Foreign currency is estimated to pressure operating margin by about 100 basis points. The fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. We now expect capital expenditures for fiscal '17 to be approximately $325 million, down $50 million from our previous guidance of $375 million as we increased our rigor and focus on return on investment. 
Regarding share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $100 million of our stock and we plan to execute another $100 million in the fourth quarter to reach $200 million for the full year, consistent with our communication in June. Our expectations for fiscal '18 are consistent with the outlook we provided at our Investor Day in June. We continue to expect the magnitude of revenue decline to stabilize and be less than the declines in fiscal '17. Currently, we are forecasting revenue in fiscal '18 to decline high single digits in constant currency. This includes 200 basis points of pressure from our actions in rightsizing our distribution in both wholesale and retail, and another 200 basis points from the previously announced closure of Denim & Supply. These actions will be taken in conjunction with our quality of sales and price harmonization initiatives. We expect our trend to improve in the second half of the year as we move forward in the execution of the Way Forward Plan. 
We expect operating margin to expand in fiscal '18 in constant currency, driven by both gross margin and operating cost improvement. We plan to provide more specific guidance for fiscal '18 on our fourth quarter call in May, as is our practice. 
In summary, we have created a strong foundation and we are delivering our Way Forward Plan commitments. As I look ahead, with the support of Ralph, the board and together with our leadership team, we have the key elements in place to ensure our continued progress. With the passion and commitment of over 25,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe, we will intensify our execution of the plan, which will strengthen our brand and return us to long-term profitable growth. With that, I want to turn the call back to Stefan for some closing remarks."

Our commitment is to get to profitable growth. It will be a combination of top line growth, and in the near term, gross margin expansion and leveraging a better and more efficient cost structure. So we do see gross margin expansion. You've seen, over the past several quarters, that we've had favorable trends in gross margin in this quarter. If you look at it on a constant currency basis, we expanded gross margin by 240 basis points. Obviously, we had 100 points of pressure from foreign currency, but we got a benefit from -- about half of the 140 points was a benefit from channel and geographic mix. I expect that to continue. And then importantly, a little less than half of our gross margin expansion came directly from our quality of sales initiatives where, across our businesses, we reduced promotions and discount levels, and we're able to pull that through in terms of gross margin. So I do see that as a durable tailwind for us as we move into the future."

As you look at our results and our trends on a year-to-date basis, the primary driver of what's happening in North America is a result of our strategic actions. First, if I just take this quarter, about half of the revenue decline was attributable to our efforts in the Way Forward Plan to really match our inventories to demand. In this quarter, that was about -- that attributed about half of the decline that we saw. The other component, about 30%, was a reduction that we took to lower excess inventory to the value channels in wholesale. So as we said, we think we're out of balance today and we are aggressively moving to right size that balance. So that's a part -- as you look at the trend, a great deal of that is attributable to what we've decided to do as a part of the Way Forward Plan. When we have a supply chain that is closer to market and closer to demand, when -- as we continue to improve our ability to buy informed, we believe we can get back to share growth in our wholesale channel, and that will be a propellant of growth for us as we move forward."

Yes, we are anticipating door closures with our retail partners. In fact, as of -- as at the end of Q3, we have worked closely and collaboratively with our department store partners and have worked through about 70% alignment on the point of sale closures that we announced last quarter that would reduce our points of distribution in department stores by 20% to 25%. So we are well under way there. We're obviously working in partnership to -- with them to understand their future door plans so that we're fully aligned on that. And that's incorporated into our overall guidance. It's about -- between door closures and the wholesale closures, it's about 200 basis points of pressure. So I feel that we are aligned with our partners and we're modeling that into our guidance. In terms of the right balance with what I'll call off-price wholesale, what we know as a touchtone is that we have to be where the consumer wants to shop. And so they're an important part of our distribution. But what we also know is that we are not in balance where that distribution should be. So what we've modeled is continued rebalancing of that channel through the balance of FY '18 and that we'll be down significantly double digits as we move through FY '18."

As you saw in the release this morning, the company and I mutually agreed to part ways. And I want to take a brief moment to give you some context. Ralph and I both love and respect the DNA of this great brand and we recognize the need to evolve. However, we have found that we have different views on how to evolve the creative and consumer-facing parts of the business. I want everyone on the call, shareholders and analysts, to know that the board, Ralph and I, have over the last months, worked very hard to find common ground. After many serious conversations with one another, we mutually agreed to part ways. None of this changes how proud I am of all the progress we made against the goals we laid out in our Way Forward Plan in June. As I've shared then, the Way Forward Plan is about refocusing on the core of what made us iconic and evolving that core for today, to strengthen the brand and return the company to long-term profitable growth. Both Ralph and the board are committed to continued execution of our plan. We are on track to deliver on our commitments. A key driver to this is our strengthened management team and their ability to drive high-quality execution. Together, we have already created a strong foundation, one that puts us in a position to continue to deliver. Our progress includes the strengthening of the leadership team, refocusing on our core brands, starting to evolve our iconic products and marketing, matching inventory to demand, drastically reducing lead times, creating a more nimble organizational structure, beginning to rightsize the store fleet, achieving the initial cost reductions and as we learned from our recent global employee survey, we have substantially improved the employee engagement and understanding of the strategy. 
When Jane later in this call will speak about the progress we made in the third quarter, you will hear how these initiatives are starting to show up in the company's P&L. I remain very confident that the Way Forward framework has the ability to drive the company back to high performance. And I will stay on until May 1 to ensure the uninterrupted execution. Before I turn it over to Jane for her to review the progress we have made on the Way Forward Plan in the quarter, I want to say a few words about her. As I begin my transition, she will take charge of the execution of our plan. Jane and I have been copilots since she joined, and we will work closely together to make this transition successful. She has the credibility, the experience and the trust from Ralph and the board. I could not be more confident in her ability to deliver. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jane."

Before I review our performance and future outlook, I want to reiterate that our foundation is strong. As Stefan said, we worked very closely since I joined and we will continue that partnership through his extended transition period to ensure that our progress is uninterrupted. 
With the support of Ralph, the board and together with our leadership team, I am committed to leading our continued execution. We are as focused as we have ever been on delivering the Way Forward Plan, to strengthen the brand and drive sustainable profitable growth over the long term. 
Now on to our performance. First, let's review the progress we made this quarter in executing the Way Forward Plan, starting with product for Fall 2017. First, we refocused and evolved our iconic core product offering. We updated our color palettes, materials and fits, incorporating more consumer insights and marketplace intelligence into our decision making. 
Second, we improved our discipline in applying a systematic, repeatable way of building a stronger assortment. This means being very clear on what we are testing, what we are growing and what icons we are reinventing. This has enabled us to cut the long tail of unproductive styles, delivering a double-digit reduction in the number of SKUs we have designed for Fall 2017, resulting in a much more focused, productive assortment and lower development cost. 
Third, our improved discipline in the assortment creation is enabling us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments. Our premarket commitment for next fall is down significantly to last year. For Polo, we committed to only 15% of our buys premarket before our wholesale customers placed their orders. Last year, this figure was 60%. As a result, we are buying much more informed, which will significantly improve our ability to match inventory to demand. The initial feedback from our wholesale customers that have seen our fall product has been very positive. 
Fourth, we are well underway to build a best-in-class sourcing capability and a demand-driven supply chain. We remain on track to reach our goal of a 9-month lead time. We continue to expect to get halfway there by the end of this fiscal year and 90% there by the end of next fiscal year. This quarter, we achieved our goal of having all our core fabrics platformed for the upcoming Fall 2017 season, which enables us to make further progress in cutting our lead times. 
Moving on to marketing. We are making good progress in our search for a Chief Marketing Officer. In the meantime, we are preparing for our first cut-through Polo marketing campaign for summer. For this past fall holiday season, we launched the Ralph Lauren Icons marketing campaign, which was built on our goal to refocus on and evolve our core iconic products in luxury. The campaign was very well received, and we will be launching the second part of the campaign later this month. 
Moving on to our financials for the quarter. We continued to deliver against our commitments. We increased our quality of sales by moderating discount levels, lowering our inventory to align supply with demand and reducing our lead times. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 12%, in line with guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 12.8%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating margin was up about 40 basis points to last year. Additionally, non-GAAP operating margin expanded in constant currency in both the retail and wholesale segments. The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in November, largely driven by gross margin and proactive expense management. Adjusted gross margin expanded by 140 basis points versus last year, driven by favorable geographic and channel mix and initiatives to improve quality of sales, including reduced promotional activity across our businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 100 basis points. 
Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other related charges, were down 7% compared to last year as a result of expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan, including streamlining the organization to reduce headcount, process changes in product development to reduce costs and closing unprofitable stores to improve the profitability of our fleet. 
In North America, across our businesses, the team started to execute against the plan we shared last quarter to come back to high performance. North America continues to be our most challenged market. Revenue declined 15% in the quarter, led by a planned decline in wholesale. We strengthened our foundation by strategically reducing shipments to better align with underlying demand and rightsized our inventory levels. In addition, we started to rebalance our distribution in our off-price wholesale business. We also executed these important quality of sales initiatives in our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business. These actions will continue to impact our results in the fourth quarter on our e-commerce site. E-commerce has been our most over-promoted channel, and we are moving to harmonize pricing across channels and reduce promotion depth. These are the first steps in the execution of our plan to come back to high performance in North America. They are difficult but necessary actions to build a healthy base to grow from. We expect these actions to continue through the first half of fiscal 2018. 
In Europe, store comps improved in the third quarter despite lower markdowns as we continued to deliver on our quality of sales initiatives. Our Europe team continued to drive substantial improvement in both gross margin and operating margin in constant currency. Revenue was down 6% in constant currency and 12% on a reported basis. As expected, we shifted $18 million of wholesale shipments to the fourth quarter to better align with demand in our wholesale doors. Excluding this shift, revenue would have been close to flat in constant currency. 
In our retail business in Europe, we reduced promotion, drove up AURs and expanded gross margin significantly on a year-over-year basis in constant currency. Our team continues to focus on tighter inventory management and strengthening the assortment going forward. 
Similarly, in Asia, we drove significantly lower markdown rates in each channel and expanded margins. Revenue was down 1% in constant currency and up 4% on a reported basis. Comp growth was positive in Asia in the third quarter. Going forward, we are focused on returning to revenue growth in Asia as new distribution growth offsets closures. 
Moving to comparable store sales. On a global basis, comps decreased 4% in constant currency. As a reminder, the high volume week after Christmas was included in the company's third quarter this year versus the fourth quarter last year with a positive impact of approximately 2.5 percentage points, which will pressure comps in the fourth quarter. Additionally, Easter will shift into the first quarter of FY '18. The combined effect of these 2 calendar shifts will pressure fourth quarter comps approximately 3 percentage points. 
Moving to global e-commerce. Revenues declined 9% in constant currency. The e-commerce decline is driven by our initiatives in the U.S. that I just took you through. The impact of these actions will accelerate in the fourth quarter and continue to pressure the first half of fiscal 2018. 
Turning to our store fleet. We are on track to close approximately 50 stores this year. We closed 12 stores in the third quarter and 27 year-to-date. This puts us on track to achieve the savings that we identified from store closures of approximately $70 million. Importantly, we are also on track with our total savings targets. At this time, restructuring charges are forecasted to be about $400 million and inventory charges about $150 million associated with the company's Way Forward Plan. 
In this quarter, we recorded $91 million in restructuring-related impairment and inventory charges. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our progress with the Way Forward Plan is reflected in our inventory position. At the end of the third quarter, inventory declined 23% to $984 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by both restructuring actions and our operating process initiatives, including a proactive pullback in receipts and moving towards a demand-driven supply chain. We ended the third quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $589 million of total debt. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal '17. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan and severance-related payments associated with the CEO departure announced today. 
For fiscal '17, we are maintaining our guidance. We continue to expect revenues to decrease at a low double-digit rate as we execute the Way Forward Plan. Based on our current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal '17. We also continue to expect operating margin for fiscal '17 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, infrastructure investments and fixed cost deleverage. The fiscal 2017 tax rate is estimated to be approximately 29%. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be down mid teens on a reported basis. This compares 13 weeks this year to 14 weeks last year. The 53rd week last year contributed approximately $72 million of net revenue, including $10 million in the wholesale segment and $62 million in the retail segment as well as $12 million of operating income. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and will pressure gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. 
Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 6% to 6.5%. Foreign currency is estimated to pressure operating margin by about 100 basis points. The fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. We now expect capital expenditures for fiscal '17 to be approximately $325 million, down $50 million from our previous guidance of $375 million as we increased our rigor and focus on return on investment. 
Regarding share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $100 million of our stock and we plan to execute another $100 million in the fourth quarter to reach $200 million for the full year, consistent with our communication in June. Our expectations for fiscal '18 are consistent with the outlook we provided at our Investor Day in June. We continue to expect the magnitude of revenue declines to stabilize and be less than the declines in fiscal '17. Currently, we are forecasting revenue in fiscal '18 to decline high single digits in constant currency. This includes 200 basis points of pressure from our actions in rightsizing our distribution in both wholesale and retail, and another 200 basis points from the previously announced closure of Denim & Supply. These actions will be taken in conjunction with our quality of sales and price harmonization initiatives. We expect our trend to improve in the second half of the year as we move forward in the execution of the Way Forward Plan. 
We expect operating margin to expand in fiscal '18 in constant currency, driven by both gross margin and operating cost improvement. We plan to provide more specific guidance for fiscal '18 on our fourth quarter call in May, as is our practice. 
In summary, we have created a strong foundation and we are delivering our Way Forward Plan commitments. As I look ahead, with the support of Ralph, the board and together with our leadership team, we have the key elements in place to ensure our continued progress. With the passion and commitment of over 25,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe, we will intensify our execution of the plan, which will strengthen our brand and return us to long-term profitable growth. With that, I want to turn the call back to Stefan for some closing remarks."

Our commitment is to get to profitable growth. It will be a combination of top line growth, and in the near term, gross margin expansion and leveraging a better and more efficient cost structure. So we do see gross margin expansion. You've seen, over the past several quarters, that we've had favorable trends in gross margin, in this quarter, if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we expanded gross margin by 240 basis points. Obviously, we had 100 points of pressure from foreign currency, but we got a benefit from -- about half of the 140 points was a benefit from channel and geographic mix. I expect that to continue. And then importantly, a little less than half of our gross margin expansion came directly from our quality of sales initiatives where, across our businesses, we reduced promotions and discount levels, and were able to pull that through in terms of gross margin. So I do see that as a durable tailwind for us as we move into the future."

As you look at our results and our trends on a year-to-date basis, the primary driver of what's happening in North America is a result of our strategic actions. First, if I just take this quarter, about half of the revenue decline was attributable to our efforts in the Way Forward Plan to really match our inventories to demand. In this quarter, that was about -- that attributed about half of the decline that we saw. The other component, about 30%, was a reduction that we took to lower excess inventory to the value channels in wholesale. So as we said, we think we're out of balance today and we are aggressively moving to right-size that balance. So that's a part -- as you look at the trend, a great deal of that is attributable to what we've decided to do as a part of the Way Forward Plan. When we have a supply chain that is closer to market and closer to demand, when -- as we continue to improve our ability to buy informed, we believe we can get back to share growth in our wholesale channel, and that will be a propellant of growth for us as we move forward."

So it will be gradual improvement starting spring and going into fall, and then onwards from there."

Yes, we are anticipating door closures with our retail partners. In fact, as of -- as at the end of Q3, we have worked closely and collaboratively with our department store partners and have worked through about 70% alignment on the point of sale closures that we announced last quarter that would reduce our points of distribution in department stores by 20% to 25%. So we are well underway there. We're obviously working in partnership to -- with them to understand their future door plans so that we're fully aligned on that. And that's incorporated into our overall guidance. It's about -- between door closures and the wholesale closures, it's about 200 basis points of pressure. So I feel that we are aligned with our partners and we're modeling that into our guidance. In terms of the right balance with what I'll call off-price wholesale, what we know as a touchtone is that we have to be where the consumer wants to shop. And so they're an important part of our distribution. But what we also know is that we are not in balance where that distribution should be. So what we've modeled is continued rebalancing of that channel through the balance of FY '18 and that will be down significantly double digits as we move through FY '18."

As you saw in the release this morning, the company and I mutually agreed to part ways. And I want to take a brief moment to give you some context.

However, we have found that we have different views on how to evolve the creative and consumer-facing parts of the business. I want everyone on the call, shareholders and analysts, to know that the board, Ralph and I, have over the last months, worked very hard to find common ground. After many serious conversations with one another, we mutually agreed to part ways. None of this changes how proud I am of all the progress we made against the goals we laid out in our Way Forward Plan in June. As I've shared then, the Way Forward Plan is about refocusing on the core of what made us iconic and evolving that core for today, to strengthen the brand and return the company to long-term profitable growth. Both Ralph and the board are committed to continued execution of our plan. We are on track to deliver on our commitments. A key driver to this is our strengthened management team and their ability to drive high-quality execution. Together, we have already created a strong foundation, one that puts us in a position to continue to deliver. Our progress includes the strengthening of the leadership team, refocusing on our core brands, starting to evolve our iconic products and marketing, matching inventory to demand, drastically reducing lead times, creating a more nimble organizational structure, beginning to rightsize the store fleet, achieving the initial cost reductions and as we learned from our recent global employee survey, we have substantially improved the employee engagement and understanding of the strategy. 
When Jane later in this call will speak about the progress we made in the third quarter, you will hear how these initiatives are starting to show up in the company's P&L. I remain very confident that the Way Forward framework has the ability to drive the company back to high performance. And I will stay on until May 1 to ensure the uninterrupted execution. Before I turn it over to Jane for her to review the progress we have made on the Way Forward Plan in the quarter, I want to say a few words about her. As I begin my transition, she will take charge of the execution of our plan. Jane and I have been copilots since she joined, and we will work closely together to make this transition successful. She has the credibility, the experience and the trust from Ralph and the board. I could not be more confident in her ability to deliver. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jane."

With the support of Ralph, the board and together with our leadership team, I am committed to leading our continued execution. We are as focused as we have ever been on delivering the Way Forward Plan, to strengthen the brand and drive sustainable profitable growth over the long term. 
Now on to our performance. First, let's review the progress we made this quarter in executing the Way Forward Plan, starting with product for Fall 2017. First, we refocused and evolved our iconic core product offering. We updated our color palettes, materials and fits, incorporating more consumer insights and marketplace intelligence into our decision making. 
Second, we improved our discipline in applying a systematic, repeatable way of building a stronger assortment. This means being very clear on what we are testing, what we are growing and what icons we are reinventing. This has enabled us to cut the long tail of unproductive styles, delivering a double-digit reduction in the number of SKUs we have designed for Fall 2017, resulting in a much more focused, productive assortment and lower development cost. 
Third, our improved discipline in the assortment creation is enabling us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments. Our premarket commitment for next fall is down significantly to last year. For Polo, we committed to only 15% of our buys premarket before our wholesale customers placed their orders. Last year, this figure was 60%. As a result, we are buying much more informed, which will significantly improve our ability to match inventory to demand. The initial feedback from our wholesale customers that have seen our fall product has been very positive. 
Fourth, we are well underway to build a best-in-class sourcing capability and a demand-driven supply chain. We remain on track to reach our goal of a 9-month lead time. We continue to expect to get halfway there by the end of this fiscal year and 90% there by the end of next fiscal year. This quarter, we achieved our goal of having all our core fabrics platformed for the upcoming Fall 2017 season, which enables us to make further progress in cutting our lead times. 
Moving on to marketing. We are making good progress in our search for a Chief Marketing Officer. In the meantime, we are preparing for our first cut-through Polo marketing campaign for summer. For this past fall holiday season, we launched the Ralph Lauren Icons marketing campaign, which was built on our goal to refocus on and evolve our core iconic products in luxury. The campaign was very well received, and we will be launching the second part of the campaign later this month. 
Moving on to our financials for the quarter. We continued to deliver against our commitments. We increased our quality of sales by moderating discount levels, lowering our inventory to align supply with demand and reducing our lead times. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 12%, in line with guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 12.8%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating margin was up about 40 basis points to last year. Additionally, non-GAAP operating margin expanded in constant currency in both the retail and wholesale segments. The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in November, largely driven by gross margin and proactive expense management. Adjusted gross margin expanded by 140 basis points versus last year, driven by favorable geographic and channel mix and initiatives to improve quality of sales, including reduced promotional activity across our businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 100 basis points. 
Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other related charges, were down 7% compared to last year as a result of expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan, including streamlining the organization to reduce headcount, process changes in product development to reduce costs and closing unprofitable stores to improve the profitability of our fleet. 
In North America, across our businesses, the team started to execute against the plan we shared last quarter to come back to high performance. North America continues to be our most challenged market. Revenue declined 15% in the quarter, led by a planned decline in wholesale. We strengthened our foundation by strategically reducing shipments to better align with underlying demand and rightsized our inventory levels. In addition, we started to rebalance our distribution in our off-price wholesale business. We also executed these important quality of sales initiatives in our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business. These actions will continue to impact our results in the fourth quarter on our e-commerce site. E-commerce has been our most over-promoted channel, and we are moving to harmonize pricing across channels and reduce promotion depth. These are the first steps in the execution of our plan to come back to high performance in North America. They are difficult but necessary actions to build a healthy base to grow from. We expect these actions to continue through the first half of fiscal 2018. 
In Europe, store comps improved in the third quarter despite lower markdowns as we continued to deliver on our quality of sales initiatives. Our Europe team continued to drive substantial improvement in both gross margin and operating margin in constant currency. Revenue was down 6% in constant currency and 12% on a reported basis. As expected, we shifted $18 million of wholesale shipments to the fourth quarter to better align with demand in our wholesale doors. Excluding this shift, revenue would have been close to flat in constant currency. 
In our retail business in Europe, we reduced promotion, drove up AURs and expanded gross margin significantly on a year-over-year basis in constant currency. Our team continues to focus on tighter inventory management and strengthening the assortment going forward. 
Similarly, in Asia, we drove significantly lower markdown rates in each channel and expanded margins. Revenue was down 1% in constant currency and up 4% on a reported basis. Comp growth was positive in Asia in the third quarter. Going forward, we are focused on returning to revenue growth in Asia as new distribution growth offsets closures. 
Moving to comparable store sales. On a global basis, comps decreased 4% in constant currency. As a reminder, the high volume week after Christmas was included in the company's third quarter this year versus the fourth quarter last year with a positive impact of approximately 2.5 percentage points, which will pressure comps in the fourth quarter. Additionally, Easter will shift into the first quarter of FY '18. The combined effect of these 2 calendar shifts will pressure fourth quarter comps approximately 3 percentage points. 
Moving to global e-commerce. Revenues declined 9% in constant currency. The e-commerce decline is driven by our initiatives in the U.S. that I just took you through. The impact of these actions will accelerate in the fourth quarter and continue to pressure the first half of fiscal 2018. 
Turning to our store fleet. We are on track to close approximately 50 stores this year. We closed 12 stores in the third quarter and 27 year-to-date. This puts us on track to achieve the savings that we identified from store closures of approximately $70 million. Importantly, we are also on track with our total savings targets. At this time, restructuring charges are forecasted to be about $400 million and inventory charges about $150 million associated with the company's Way Forward Plan. 
In this quarter, we recorded $91 million in restructuring-related impairment and inventory charges. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our progress with the Way Forward Plan is reflected in our inventory position. At the end of the third quarter, inventory declined 23% to $984 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by both restructuring actions and our operating process initiatives, including a proactive pullback in receipts and moving towards a demand-driven supply chain. We ended the third quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $589 million of total debt. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal '17. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan and severance-related payments associated with the CEO departure announced today. 
For fiscal '17, we are maintaining our guidance. We continue to expect revenues to decrease at a low double-digit rate as we execute the Way Forward Plan. Based on our current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal '17. We also continue to expect operating margin for fiscal '17 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, infrastructure investments and fixed cost deleverage. The fiscal 2017 tax rate is estimated to be approximately 29%. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be down mid-teens on a reported basis. This compares 13 weeks this year to 14 weeks last year. The 53rd week last year contributed approximately $72 million of net revenue, including $10 million in the wholesale segment and $62 million in the retail segment as well as $12 million of operating income. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and will pressure gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. 
Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 6% to 6.5%. Foreign currency is estimated to pressure operating margin by about 100 basis points. The fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. We now expect capital expenditures for fiscal '17 to be approximately $325 million, down $50 million from our previous guidance of $375 million as we increased our rigor and focus on return on investment. 
Regarding share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $100 million of our stock and we plan to execute another $100 million in the fourth quarter to reach $200 million for the full year, consistent with our communication in June. Our expectations for fiscal '18 are consistent with the outlook we provided at our Investor Day in June. We continue to expect the magnitude of revenue declines to stabilize and be less than the declines in fiscal '17. Currently, we are forecasting revenue in fiscal '18 to decline high single digits in constant currency. This includes 200 basis points of pressure from our actions in rightsizing our distribution in both wholesale and retail, and another 200 basis points from the previously announced closure of Denim & Supply. These actions will be taken in conjunction with our quality of sales and price harmonization initiatives. We expect our trend to improve in the second half of the year as we move forward in the execution of the Way Forward Plan. 
We expect operating margin to expand in fiscal '18 in constant currency, driven by both gross margin and operating cost improvement. We plan to provide more specific guidance for fiscal '18 on our fourth quarter call in May, as is our practice. 
In summary, we have created a strong foundation and we are delivering our Way Forward Plan commitments. As I look ahead, with the support of Ralph, the board and together with our leadership team, we have the key elements in place to ensure our continued progress. With the passion and commitment of over 25,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe, we will intensify our execution of the plan, which will strengthen our brand and return us to long-term profitable growth. With that, I want to turn the call back to Stefan for some closing remarks."

Our commitment is to get to profitable growth. It will be a combination of top line growth, and in the near term, gross margin expansion and leveraging a better and more efficient cost structure. So we do see gross margin expansion. You've seen, over the past several quarters, that we've had favorable trends in gross margin in this quarter. If you look at it on a constant currency basis, we expanded gross margin by 240 basis points. Obviously, we had 100 points of pressure from foreign currency, but we got a benefit from -- about half of the 140 points was a benefit from channel and geographic mix. I expect that to continue. And then importantly, a little less than half of our gross margin expansion came directly from our quality of sales initiatives where, across our businesses, we reduced promotions and discount levels, and were able to pull that through in terms of gross margin. So I do see that as a durable tailwind for us as we move into the future."

As you look at our results and our trends on a year-to-date basis, the primary driver of what's happening in North America is a result of our strategic actions. First, if I just take this quarter, about half of the revenue decline was attributable to our efforts in the Way Forward Plan to really match our inventories to demand. In this quarter, that was about -- that attributed about half of the decline that we saw. The other component, about 30%, was a reduction that we took to lower excess inventory to the value channels in wholesale. So as we said, we think we're out of balance today and we are aggressively moving to right-size that balance. So that's a part -- as you look at the trend, a great deal of that is attributable to what we've decided to do as a part of the Way Forward Plan. When we have a supply chain that is closer to market and closer to demand, when -- as we continue to improve our ability to buy informed, we believe we can get back to share growth in our wholesale channel, and that will be a propellant of growth for us as we move forward."

Yes, we are anticipating door closures with our retail partners. In fact, as of -- as at the end of Q3, we have worked closely and collaboratively with our department store partners and have worked through about 70% alignment on the point of sale closures that we announced last quarter that would reduce our points of distribution in department stores by 20% to 25%. So we are well underway there. We're obviously working in partnership to -- with them to understand their future door plans so that we're fully aligned on that. And that's incorporated into our overall guidance. It's about -- between door closures and the wholesale closures, it's about 200 basis points of pressure. So I feel that we are aligned with our partners and we're modeling that into our guidance. In terms of the right balance with what I'll call off-price wholesale, what we know as a touchtone is that we have to be where the consumer wants to shop. And so they're an important part of our distribution. But what we also know is that we are not in balance where that distribution should be. So what we've modeled is continued rebalancing of that channel through the balance of FY '18 and that will be down significantly double digits as we move through FY '18."

I'm looking forward to reviewing our progress for the year in detail, but let me start with one of the most important developments, which I'm sure you all saw yesterday. We have appointed a new President and Chief Executive Officer, Patrice Louvet. Patrice is a highly seasoned and successful business leader. He most recently served as the Group President of Noble Beauty at Procter & Gamble and a have a strong track record of leading global businesses during his 25-plus year career at P&G. He has a deep understanding of consumers and brands, a collaborative leadership style and a passion to win in the marketplace. The team is ready to welcome him when he joins in July, and I am looking forward to partnering with him.
Now let me turn to our review of our performance and future outlook. 2017 was an important year as we strengthen the foundation of the company. We created operational efficiencies by improving our cost structure, increase the productivity of our assortment and improve quality of sales. Let me take you through some of the key achievements for the year. 
Starting with product. We improved the productivity and profitability level of our assortment by cutting the unproductive styles. For both Spring and Fall 2017, we reduced the number of SKUs by 20% and focused our investments on our core iconic products. 
Second, we reduced our lead times. 50% of our business is now on a 9-month lead time, and we are on track to get to 90% by the end of fiscal 2018. Importantly, we are driving improvements beyond the 9-month mark. For Spring 2018, approximately 35% of our business will be at lead times of 6 months or less. 
Third, we have aligned inventory to demand. Inventory is 30% below prior year, with improved turns. This has been achieved through both restructuring actions and a more effective buying process. In addition, since the start of our aggressive inventory management initiatives in Q2 '17, we reduced our warehouse base by 13%, with continued reductions planed for the first half of FY '18. 
Fourth, our distribution is healthier. We closed 50 underperforming doors in our retail suite, and we are well on track to close 20% to 25% of our U.S. wholesale points of distribution by the second half of FY '18. 
Fifth, our expense structure is more efficient. We reduced SG&A by $240 million in fiscal 2017. Our organization has reduced management layers from 9 to 6, with a 20% reduction in the executive population over the last 2 years. Additionally, we consolidated regional operations under a single international group to streamline cost and processes. This group will be led by Howard Smith, who recently served as President of the Asia Pacific region. Howard has a track record of elevating the brand, driving sales growth and improving operations during his 15-year career at Ralph Lauren. 
Lastly, we've recently added 2 key senior hires: Jonathan Bottomley, Chief Marketing Officer, who joins us from Vise Media; and Tom Mendenhall, brand president for menswear who joins us from Tom Ford International. Jonathan will report to Patrice, our new CEO, and Tom reports to Valerie Hermann, our President of Global Brands.
Now I'll turn to a quick review of our fourth quarter financials. This quarter, we continue to deliver against our strategy and commitments. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 16%, in line with guidance. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and on a 13-week to 13-week basis, revenues were down 12% to last year. 
Adjusted operating margin was 6.5%, 10 basis points above last year and in line with our guidance of 6% to 6.5%. Adjusted operating margin was up 150 basis points, excluding the impact of the 53rd week and foreign currency. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points, driven by improved quality of sales, reduced promotional activity, lower product costs and favorable geographic and channel mix. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 90 basis points. 
This quarter, operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other charges, were down 12% to last year on a like-for-like basis. Expense initiatives drove the decrease. These included: streamlining the organization to reduce headcount; changing product development processes to reduce cost; and closing unprofitable stores to improve the profitability of our fleet. 
The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27% on an adjusted basis, lower than our guidance for 30%. This was due to a geographic shift in expense mix, driven by changes in our e-commerce platform development.
Moving on to our view by geography. As we highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we are changing our reportable segments from wholesale, retail and licensing to North America, Europe and Asia, driven by significant organizational and operational changes we've implemented over the past 12 months. We will provide segment information under the new reportable segments for the past 8 quarters in an 8-K that will be filed later today. We will also continue to give visibility to wholesale and retail sales trends going forward.
All of our comments today will be consistent with the change in our reportable segments. 
In North America, revenue was down 21% in the fourth quarter as we executed important quality sales initiatives as a part of our work to come back to high performance. Operating margin was down 200 basis points.
In North America wholesale, we continue to strengthen our foundation by strategically reducing shipments to better align with underlying demand and to reduce inventory level that are wholesale partners, all targeted to improve full price selling. 
We continue to reduce our sales in the off-price channel as we look to scale back this channel across our geographies. These delivered actions, pulling back on excess inventories, lowering sales to the off-price channel, executing door closures and exiting brands, coupled with challenging trends, resulted in wholesale revenue down 23% in the quarter. 
In our directly operated e-commerce business in North America, we took further actions to harmonize pricing and reduce promotions. Comps were down 20% in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower inventory units, reduced SKU count and fewer promotional periods. While these initiatives created significant pressure on e-commerce revenue, they drove healthy gross margin expansion, and importantly, created greater price coherence in the region.
These are important first steps. However, more work remains through fiscal 2018 as we aggressively address our high level of promotion in this channel. This is an important component of a multifaceted program to both ensure promotional consistency across our channel and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience in our most important door.
Moving on to Europe. Revenue is down 3% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the 53rd week impact and calendar shift that negatively impacted retail comps. Operating margin in Europe improved approximately 500 basis points in constant currency, excluding restructuring charges. 
In Asia, revenue was down 11% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the 53rd week impact and store closures. Operating margin in Asia improved approximately 800 basis points versus prior year in constant currency, excluding restructuring charges. This was driven by an improved gross margin through lower discount rates and expense reduction initiatives.
Across our international groups, we have focused throughout the year on improving quality of distribution and quality of sales. The majority of this work is behind us, and we have a solid foundation in our international markets. We are also laying important groundwork for growth, including building on our relationships with digital pure play partners, like Town in Japan and Alonso and My Teresa in Europe. In the fourth quarter, we successfully launched an exclusive collection with a dedicated marketing campaign, and we've seen strong sell-through so far. In Asia, we launched with [indiscernible] and online in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to comparable store sales. In constant currency and on a like-for-like basis, comps were down 11%. Excluding calendar shifts related to both Christmas and Easter holidays, the underlying comp trend was down 8% in the fourth quarter, similar to the underlying trend of down 7% in the third quarter.
Global e-commerce comps declined 16% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, impacted by the previously mentioned initiatives in North America. As these actions continue through fiscal '18, we are forecasting a mid-teens decline in global e-commerce comps with lower discount rates and higher gross margins. 
As you saw in our announcement last month, we are moving to a more flexible platform for our directly operated e-commerce business to renew collaboration with Salesforce commerce cloud. This new solution will deliver a more brand enhancing and consistent experience for our consumers with a lower total operating cost than the platform we were internally developing. 
In concert with our actions in our directly operated e-commerce business, we continue to evolve our digital strategy to move with the consumer and drive growth through our online partners. Last year, global sales of our products across both our pure play and department store customers websites were approximately $500 million at retail, comparable to the sales volume of our directly operated e-commerce business. We expect continued growth with our digital partners in FY '18.
Turning to our store fleet. We achieved our goal and closed 54 underperforming doors in fiscal 2017, ending the year with 466 stand-alone stores and 619 concessions on a global basis. For fiscal 2018, we plan to open approximately 5 net new stores and 35 new concessions, driven by growth in Asia. 
Moving on to now balance sheet. Our progress with our plan is reflected in our inventory position. At the end of the fourth quarter, inventory declined 30% to $792 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by both restructuring actions and an improvement in our operating processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts and moving towards a demand-driven supply chain. 
We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $1.1 billion at the end of last year. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $588 million, down from $713 million last year. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal '17 where $284 million compared with $418 million in the prior year period. This was lower than guidance of $325 million, primarily due to a shift in several retail projects into FY '18 and an increased focus on return on investment. The year-over-year reduction is driven by lower IT and infrastructure investments.
Regarding share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We repurchased $100 million of our stock, bringing full year '17 repurchases to $200 million, consistent with our communication in June. 
Now let me review our restructuring activities. We are on track with our total savings targets from the initiatives we announced last June related to the Way Forward Plan. In addition, we recently announced a new restructuring plan with estimated charges of $370 million throughout fiscal '18, an associated savings of approximately $140 million. We've made good progress on these actions and are on track to deliver those savings by the end of fiscal '19. 
In the fourth quarter, we recognized $216 million of charges from this new plan. Total charges for the quarter were $370 million, of which about $120 million was cash. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal '18. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. Our work to strengthen the foundation of the business will continue in fiscal 2018 as we set the stage to bring demand back to the business. We expect revenue to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have approximately 150 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2018. 
Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half the decline, with quality of sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder. We expect the sales trend to improve as we move through the year.
We expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9% to 10.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure operating margin for fiscal 2018 by 50 to 75 basis points. Clearly, there are many variables in play as we enter FY '18. This guidance is grounded in that reality and reflects our decision to accelerate quality of sales initiatives while providing some flexibility to rollout products, marketing and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for growth and returns. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting up the company to return to growth. 
For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be down low double digits, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on currency exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 225 basis points in the first quarter. 
Operating margins for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be about 9.5% to 10%, excluding currency impacts. Foreign currency is expected to pressure operating margin by about 75 basis points.
Regarding tax rate. As noted in our press release this morning, we are adopting the new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09 or the accounting of employee share-based payments. This will affect our effective tax rate and increase its variability, with one of the key variables being the price of our stock. 
Based on a stock price of $75 per share, the adoption of this standard is expected to raise the fiscal 2018 tax rate to approximately 28% and the first quarter rate to 33%. Without this impact, the effective tax rate will be approximately 25% for the year. This impact is most significant in the first and second quarters due to the timing of vesting an exercise of certain stock compensation. 
Let me now review our priorities for cash and capital structure. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and to lay the foundation for future profitable growth. 
Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases.
Currently, we are planning no share repurchases in fiscal 2018 as we evaluate the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal '18 to be $300 million to $320 million, driven by new store openings, renovation of our retail environment and infrastructure investments. 
In closing, we are moving in the right direction. We are creating a strong foundation to evolve this iconic brand and our business in a challenging environment. We remain intensely focused on our execution as we build a pathway through sustainable growth. Ralph, the board and I are thrilled to welcome Patrice to the company, where he joins a passionate, committed team of over 23,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe.

It's shown up in our gross margin every quarter, and it's shown up in our results in FY '17. Just looking at this quarter, about half of our sales -- I'm sorry, about half of our gross margin improvement was a result of reduced promotions and better sell-through on higher-margin product. The other half was balanced between favorable geographic and challenged -- channel mix and better product costs. As we look at our efforts in quality of sales, we've been very effective, particularly in the second half of the year of really pulling back softly in partnership with our wholesale partners on receipts to ensure that our plan and our receipt flow was designed to flow in and reflects higher margin sell-through. So we purposely planned, pulled back, looked at the percentage of our business that was selling at a discount that we viewed as too heavy, pulled back on those receipts so that we can move in, in wholesale into higher margin sell-through. That's starting to happen. It had to be done plan fully because of the long lead times on inventory, but you're starting to see that. Equally, e-commerce, the fourth quarter, I think, shows our lean in to quality of sales in e-commerce. We work through the inventory that we had ordered almost a year ago, but we really pulled back on promotion frequency and promotion depth on some key icon styles, notably in our women's and children's business. You're going to see that continue as we move forward. We've planned our receipts to move into higher margin sell-through and to move forward on a reduced promotional cadence. So what I'm -- what we're starting to see is harmony across the market, notably in North America, and a real plan for pullback that continues quality of sales."

Let me just step back from the components of your question. As we move through the year, I expect sequential improvement in both our wholesale business as we start to overlap some of the quality of sales initiatives that we started and move into full price selling, so I expect that to improve much sequentially through the year. We do expect the fourth quarter in our businesses, largely in North America, to be better as we'll benefit from Easter in the fourth quarter of FY '18 and equally expect our retail comps and overall sales to move to be sequentially better as we move through the year. As I mentioned, most of our work in an international, you're going to the majority of our work, and I expect international overall to move -- to be moving into positive sales growth territory as we move through to the back of the year. E-commerce where we really did the bulk of our work in the fourth quarter and we have a significant amount of quality of sales work left to do in FY '18, will be a pressure point as we move through the year. And then just in terms of the comments on Denim & Supply, we are exiting Denim & Supply through the -- through all of 4 quarters of the year. As we announced, Denim & Supply, we did execute Spring shipments in FY '17. So that pressure will be through the 4 quarters of the year.

We haven't said we're exiting that channel, but we are rebalancing it. But we are rebalancing it both in terms of the amount of product that we so through that channel and the types of products that we sell-through with that channel. So you'll see a decline as a percentage of total wholesale business throughout FY '18.

Clearly, you've got a rapidly changing consumer environment that when we have some significant change internally. So we've chosen, #1, continue to work on building the foundation and rightsizing our business to a healthier base, notably, in e-commerce. We need to have a coherent price strategy across the region. We can be leading pricing down, and so we are leaning into that price coherency in our e-commerce business, notably in North America. With that said, we still have a consumer facing strategy that's still evolving. And we've left ourselves flexibility to roll out product, marketing and store concepts, notably in the second half, which would imply a wider range of guidance on overall SG&A growth, notably in the second half. Also, in the second half, we begin to lap some of the aggressive SG&A cuts that we took in FY '17 and that's part of that variability as you look through the year. So I would say, we've got overall -- we are leaning into some of the pullback in e-commerce that's causing some sales volatility relative to our previous guidance.

He has a deep understanding of consumers and brands, a collaborative leadership style and a passion to win in the marketplace. The team is ready to welcome him when he joins in July, and I am looking forward to partnering with him.
Now let me turn to our review of our performance and future outlook. 2017 was an important year as we strengthen the foundation of the company. We created operational efficiencies by improving our cost structure, increase the productivity of our assortment and improved quality of sales. Let me take you through some of the key achievements for the year. 
Starting with product. We improved the productivity and profitability level of our assortment by cutting the unproductive styles. For both Spring and Fall 2017, we reduced the number of SKUs by 20% and focused our investments on our core iconic products. 
Second, we reduced our lead times. 50% of our business is now on a 9-month lead time, and we are on track to get to 90% by the end of fiscal 2018. Importantly, we are driving improvements beyond the 9-month mark. For Spring 2018, approximately 35% of our business will be at lead times of 6 months or less. 
Third, we have aligned inventory to demand. Inventory is 30% below prior year, with improved turns. This has been achieved through both restructuring actions and a more effective buying process. In addition, since the start of our aggressive inventory management initiatives in Q2 '17, we reduced our warehouse space by 13%, with continued reductions planned for the first half of FY '18. 
Fourth, our distribution is healthier. We closed 50 underperforming doors in our retail fleet, and we are well on track to close 20% to 25% of our U.S. wholesale points of distribution by the second half of FY '18. 
Fifth, our expense structure is more efficient. We reduced SG&A by $240 million in fiscal 2017. Our organization has reduced management layers from 9 to 6, with a 20% reduction in the executive population over the last 2 years. Additionally, we consolidated regional operations under a single international group to streamline cost and processes. This group will be led by Howard Smith, who recently served as President of the Asia Pacific region. Howard has a track record of elevating the brand, driving sales growth and improving operations during his 15-year career at Ralph Lauren. 
Lastly, we've recently added 2 key senior hires: Jonathan Bottomley, Chief Marketing Officer, who joins us from Vice Media; and Tom Mendenhall, Brand President for Menswear who joins us from Tom Ford International. Jonathan will report to Patrice, our new CEO, and Tom reports to Valérie Hermann, our President of Global Brands.
Now I'll turn to a quick review of our fourth quarter financials. This quarter, we continued to deliver against our strategy and commitments. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 16%, in line with guidance. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and on a 13 week-to-13 week basis, revenues were down 12% to last year. 
Adjusted operating margin was 6.5%, 10 basis points above last year and in line with our guidance of 6% to 6.5%. Adjusted operating margin was up 150 basis points, excluding the impact of the 53rd week and foreign currency. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points, driven by improved quality of sales, reduced promotional activity, lower product costs and favorable geographic and channel mix. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 90 basis points. 
This quarter, operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other charges, were down 12% to last year on a like-for-like basis. Expense initiatives drove the decrease. These included streamlining the organization to reduce headcount, changing product development processes to reduce costs and closing unprofitable stores to improve the profitability of our fleet. 
The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27% on an adjusted basis, lower than our guidance for 30%. This was due to a geographic shift in expense mix, driven by changes in our e-commerce platform development.
Moving on to our view by geography. As we highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we are changing our reportable segments from wholesale, retail and licensing to North America, Europe and Asia, driven by significant organizational and operational changes we've implemented over the past 12 months. We will provide segment information under the new reportable segments for the past 8 quarters in an 8-K that will be filed later today. We will also continue to give visibility to wholesale and retail sales trends going forward. All of our comments today will be consistent with the change in our reportable segments. 
In North America, revenue was down 21% in the fourth quarter as we executed important quality-of-sales initiatives as a part of our work to come back to high performance. Operating margin was down 200 basis points. 
In North America wholesale, we continue to strengthen our foundation by strategically reducing shipments to better align with underlying demand and to reduce inventory levels at our wholesale partners, all targeted to improve full-price selling. 
We continued to reduce our sales in the off-price channel as we looked to scale back this channel across our geographies. These delivered actions, pulling back on excess inventories, lowering sales to the off-price channel, executing door closures and exiting brands, coupled with challenging trends, resulted in wholesale revenue down 23% in the quarter. 
In our directly operated e-commerce business in North America, we took further actions to harmonize pricing and reduce promotions. Comps were down 20% in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower inventory units, reduced SKU count and fewer promotional periods. While these initiatives created significant pressure on e-commerce revenue, they drove healthy gross margin expansion and, importantly, created greater price coherence in the region.
These are important first steps. However, more work remains through fiscal 2018 as we aggressively address our high level of promotion in this channel. This is an important component of a multifaceted program to both ensure promotional consistency across our channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience in our most important door.
Moving on to Europe. Revenue was down 3% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the 53rd week impact and calendar shift that negatively impacted retail comps. Operating margin in Europe improved approximately 500 basis points in constant currency, excluding restructuring charges. 
In Asia, revenue was down 11% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the 53rd week impact and store closures. Operating margin in Asia improved approximately 800 basis points versus prior year in constant currency, excluding restructuring charges. This was driven by an improved gross margin through lower discount rates and expense reduction initiatives.
Across our international groups, we have focused throughout the year on improving quality of distribution and quality of sales. The majority of this work is behind us, and we have a solid foundation in our international markets. We are also laying important groundwork for growth, including building on our relationships with digital pure-play partners, like ZOZOTOWN in Japan; and Zalando, ASOS and MyTheresa in Europe. In the fourth quarter, we successfully launched an exclusive collection with Zalando with a dedicated marketing campaign, and we've seen strong sell-through so far. In Asia, we launched with Shinsegae and Hyundai online in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to comparable store sales. In constant currency and on a like-for-like basis, comps were down 11%. Excluding calendar shifts related to both Christmas and Easter holidays, the underlying comp trend was down 8% in the fourth quarter, similar to the underlying trend of down 7% in the third quarter.
Global e-commerce comps declined 16% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, impacted by the previously mentioned initiatives in North America. As these actions continue through fiscal '18, we are forecasting a mid-teens decline in global e-commerce comps, with lower discount rates and higher gross margins. 
As you saw in our announcement last month, we are moving to a more flexible platform for our directly operated e-commerce business to renew collaboration with Salesforce Commerce Cloud. This new solution will deliver a more brand-enhancing and consistent experience for our consumers, with a lower total operating cost than the platform we were internally developing. 
In concert with our actions in our directly operated e-commerce business, we continue to evolve our digital strategy to move with the consumer and drive growth through our online partners. Last year, global sales of our products across both our pure-play and department-store customers' websites were approximately $500 million at retail, comparable to the sales volume of our directly operated e-commerce business. We expect continued growth with our digital partners in FY '18.
Turning to our store fleet. We achieved our goal and closed 54 underperforming doors in fiscal 2017, ending the year with 466 stand-alone stores and 619 concessions on a global basis. For fiscal 2018, we plan to open approximately 5 net new stores and 35 new concessions, driven by growth in Asia. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our progress with our plan is reflected in our inventory position. At the end of the fourth quarter, inventory declined 30% to $792 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by both restructuring actions and an improvement in our operating processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts and moving toward a demand-driven supply chain. 
We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $1.1 billion at the end of last year. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $588 million, down from $713 million last year. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal '17 were $284 million compared with $418 million in the prior year period. This was lower than guidance of $325 million, primarily due to a shift in several retail projects into FY '18 and an increased focus on return on investment. The year-over-year reduction is driven by lower IT and infrastructure investments.
Regarding share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We repurchased $100 million of our stock, bringing full year '17 repurchases to $200 million, consistent with our communication in June. 
Now let me review our restructuring activities. We are on track with our total savings targets from the initiatives we announced last June related to the Way Forward Plan. In addition, we recently announced a new restructuring plan with estimated charges of $370 million throughout fiscal '18, an associated savings of approximately $140 million. We've made good progress on these actions and are on track to deliver those savings by the end of fiscal '19. In the fourth quarter, we recognized $216 million of charges from this new plan. Total charges for the quarter were $370 million, of which about $120 million was cash. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal '18. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. Our work to strengthen the foundation of the business will continue in fiscal 2018 as we set the stage to bring demand back to the business. We expect revenue to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have approximately 150 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2018. 
Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half the decline, with quality-of-sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder. We expect the sales trend to improve as we move through the year.
We expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9% to 10.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure operating margin for fiscal 2018 by 50 to 75 basis points. 
Clearly, there are many variables in play as we enter FY '18. This guidance is grounded in that reality and reflects our decision to accelerate quality-of-sales initiatives while providing some flexibility to roll out products, marketing and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for growth and returns. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting up the company to return to growth. 
For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be down low double digits, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on currency exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 225 basis points in the first quarter. 
Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be about 9.5% to 10%, excluding currency impacts. Foreign currency is expected to pressure operating margin by about 75 basis points.
Regarding tax rates. As noted in our press release this morning, we are adopting the new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09, for the accounting of employee share-based payments. This will affect our effective tax rate and increase its variability, with one of the key variables being the price of our stock. Based on a stock price of $75 per share, the adoption of this standard is expected to raise the fiscal 2018 tax rate to approximately 28% and the first quarter rate to 33%. Without this impact, the effective tax rate would be approximately 25% for the year. This impact is most significant in the first and second quarters due to the timing of vesting and exercise of certain stock compensation. 
Let me now review our priorities for cash and capital structure. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and to lay the foundation for future profitable growth. 
Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases.
Currently, we are planning no share repurchases in fiscal 2018 as we evaluate the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal '18 to be $300 million to $320 million, driven by new store openings, renovation of our retail environment and infrastructure investments. 
In closing, we are moving in the right direction. We are creating a strong foundation to evolve this iconic brand and our business in a challenging environment. We remain intensely focused on our execution as we build a pathway to sustainable growth. Ralph, the board and I are thrilled to welcome Patrice to the company, where he joins a passionate, committed team of over 23,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe.
With that, let's open it up for your questions."

Well, as you saw in the announcement yesterday, Patrice has a proven track record of leading major global consumer brands.

He's a global citizen and has a diverse experience across distribution channels, from e-commerce to wholesalers to retail. So he really has had a breadth of experience. And probably most importantly, he really has a collaborative leadership style who can work in partnership with Ralph and the senior team to ensure that we can move forward on the front-facing part of our plan to get demand back to our business. And so we're all excited to welcome him. I think Patrice knows well and appreciates the steps that we've taken over the last year as a part of the plan to improve our business.

So as I step back and look at FY '17, I think one of the things that we are very proud of is the work that we've done on quality of sales. It's shown up in our gross margin every quarter, and it's shown up in our results in FY '17. Just looking at this quarter, about half of our sales -- I'm sorry, about half of our gross margin improvement was a result of reduced promotions and better sell-through on higher-margin product. The other half was balanced between favorable geographic and challenged -- and channel mix and better product costs. As we look at our efforts in quality of sales, we've been very effective, particularly in the second half of the year, of really pulling back softly in partnership with our wholesale partners on receipts to ensure that our plan and our receipt flow was designed to flow in and reflect higher margin sell-through. So we purposely planned, pulled back, looked at the percentage of our business that was selling at a discount that we viewed as too heavy, pulled back on those receipts so that we can move in, in wholesale into higher-margin sell-through. That's starting to happen. It had to be done planfully because of the long lead times on inventory, but you're starting to see that. Equally, e-commerce, the fourth quarter, I think, shows our lean in to quality of sales in e-commerce. We worked through the inventory that we had ordered almost a year ago, but we really pulled back on promotion frequency and promotion depth on some key icon styles, notably in our women's and children's business. You're going to see that continue as we move forward. We've planned our receipts to move into higher-margin sell-through and to move forward on a reduced promotional cadence. So what I'm -- what we're starting to see is real harmony across the market, notably in North America, and a real planful pullback that continues quality of sales."

Let me just -- let me step back from the components of your question. As we move through the year, I expect sequential improvement in both our wholesale business as we start to overlap some of the quality-of-sales initiatives that we started and move into full-price selling. So I expect that to improve pretty much sequentially through the year. I do expect the fourth quarter in our businesses, largely in North America, to be better as we'll benefit from Easter in the fourth quarter of FY '18 and equally expect our retail comps and overall sales to move to be sequentially better as we move through the year. As I mentioned, most of our work in international, we've gone through the majority of our work, and I expect international overall to move -- to be moving into positive sales growth territory as they -- as we move through to the back of the year. E-commerce, where we really did the bulk of our work in the fourth quarter, and we have a significant amount of quality-of-sales work left to do in FY '18, will be a pressure point as we move through the year. And then just in terms of the comment on Denim & Supply, we are exiting Denim & Supply through the -- through all 4 quarters of the year. As we announced, Denim & Supply, we did execute spring shipments in FY '17. So that pressure will be through the 4 quarters of the year, and it is about 200 basis points of pressure overall for FY '18."

And I know there's some noise from adjustments in the prior year. If you wouldn't mind helping us just to fine-tune approximately where you think the gross margin versus the SG&A lands in our guidance, and I apologize again if I did miss that. And then secondly, you've spoken a little bit about the off-price channel and continuing to pull back on it. But as you kind of just step back and say, there aren't many clear channels of transaction growth in the U.S. right now. One of them is obviously the Amazons of the world and the e-tail, mainly the e-tailers. But also, off-price is going to continue with building stores here. I mean, you've given us a lot of detail about how you're pulling back kind of because you thought you were over what would be an equilibrium point. But how do you think, I guess, strategically about what the right amount of product is to have in that channel going forward versus having too little exposure there to growth that a lot of consumers consider to be a primary channel of retail? I guess that would be my questions."

Let me answer the last part of your question first, and then I'll give you some clarity on Q1. We do view -- value wholesale as a channel that is -- that serves a certain segment of consumers that they're excited about the treasure hunt aspect of that channel, and we recognize that. We haven't said we're exiting that channel, but we are rebalancing it. And we're rebalancing it both in terms of the amount of product that we sell through that channel and the types of product that we sell through that channel. So you will see it decline as a percentage of our total wholesale business throughout FY '18. Going forward -- and then moving forward, you'll see a slightly different mix of product, but you'll still see us serving that consumer base but on a less penetrated basis. And then your question in terms of overall gross profit. We do expect margin expansion -- gross margin expansion in FY '18 in the first quarter. We haven't given specific guidance, but I would expect that the overall margin expansion should be about similar to what you saw as we exited the fourth quarter, similar to slightly better."

Clearly, we've got a rapidly changing consumer environment, and we have some significant change internally. So we've chosen, number one, to continue to work on building the foundation and rightsizing our business to a healthier base, notably in e-commerce. We need to have a coherent price strategy across the region. We can't lead -- be leading pricing down, and so we are leaning in to that price coherency in our e-commerce business, notably in North America. With that said, we still have a consumer-facing strategy that's still evolving. And we've left ourselves some flexibility to roll out product, marketing and store concepts, notably in the second half, which would imply a wider range of guidance on overall SG&A growth, notably in the second half. Also, in the second half, we begin to lap some of the aggressive SG&A cuts that we took in FY '17, and that's part of that variability as you look through the year. So I'd say, we've got -- overall, we are leaning in to some of the pullback in e-commerce, that's causing some sales volatility relative to our previous guidance, and we are leaving ourselves the flexibility on the SG&A line to plant important investment seeds for growth. Those are the 2 areas that give us a guidance range for FY '18."

I'm looking forward to reviewing our progress for the year in detail, but let me start with one of the most important developments, which I'm sure you all saw yesterday. We have appointed a new President and Chief Executive Officer, Patrice Louvet. Patrice is a highly seasoned and successful business leader. He most recently served as the Group President of Global Beauty at Procter & Gamble and has a strong track record of leading global businesses during his 25-plus-year career at P&G. He has a deep understanding of consumers and brands, a collaborative leadership style and a passion to win in the marketplace. The team is ready to welcome him when he joins in July, and I am looking forward to partnering with him.
Now let me turn to our review of our performance and future outlook. 2017 was an important year as we strengthened the foundation of the company. We created operational efficiencies by improving our cost structure, increased the productivity of our assortment and improved quality of sales. Let me take you through some of the key achievements for the year. 
Starting with product. We improved the productivity and profitability level of our assortment by cutting the unproductive styles. For both Spring and Fall 2017, we reduced the number of SKUs by 20% and focused our investments on our core iconic products. 
Second, we reduced our lead times. 50% of our business is now on a 9-month lead time, and we are on track to get to 90% by the end of fiscal 2018. Importantly, we are driving improvements beyond the 9-month mark. For Spring 2018, approximately 35% of our business will be at lead times of 6 months or less. 
Third, we have aligned inventory to demand. Inventory is 30% below prior year, with improved turns. This has been achieved through both restructuring actions and a more effective buying process. In addition, since the start of our aggressive inventory management initiatives in Q2 '17, we reduced our warehouse space by 13%, with continued reductions planned for the first half of FY '18. 
Fourth, our distribution is healthier. We closed 50 underperforming doors in our retail fleet, and we are well on track to close 20% to 25% of our U.S. wholesale points of distribution by the second half of FY '18. 
Fifth, our expense structure is more efficient. We reduced SG&A by $240 million in fiscal 2017. Our organization has reduced management layers from 9 to 6, with a 20% reduction in the executive population over the last 2 years. Additionally, we consolidated regional operations under a single international group to streamline cost and processes. This group will be led by Howard Smith, who recently served as President of the Asia Pacific region. Howard has a track record of elevating the brand, driving sales growth and improving operations during his 15-year career at Ralph Lauren. 
Lastly, we've recently added 2 key senior hires: Jonathan Bottomley, Chief Marketing Officer, who joins us from Vice Media; and Tom Mendenhall, Brand President for Menswear, who joins us from Tom Ford International. Jonathan will report to Patrice, our new CEO, and Tom reports to Valérie Hermann, our President of Global Brands.
Now I'll turn to a quick review of our fourth quarter financials. This quarter, we continued to deliver against our strategy and commitments. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 16%, in line with guidance. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and on a 13 week-to-13 week basis, revenues were down 12% to last year. 
Adjusted operating margin was 6.5%, 10 basis points above last year and in line with our guidance of 6% to 6.5%. Adjusted operating margin was up 150 basis points, excluding the impact of the 53rd week and foreign currency. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points, driven by improved quality of sales, reduced promotional activity, lower product costs and favorable geographic and channel mix. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 90 basis points. 
This quarter, operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other charges, were down 12% to last year on a like-for-like basis. Expense initiatives drove the decrease. These included streamlining the organization to reduce headcount, changing product development processes to reduce costs and closing unprofitable stores to improve the profitability of our fleet. 
The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27% on an adjusted basis, lower than our guidance for 30%. This was due to a geographic shift in expense mix, driven by changes in our e-commerce platform development.
Moving on to our view by geography. As we highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we are changing our reportable segments from wholesale, retail and licensing to North America, Europe and Asia, driven by significant organizational and operational changes we've implemented over the past 12 months. We will provide segment information under the new reportable segments for the past 8 quarters in an 8-K that will be filed later today. We will also continue to give visibility to wholesale and retail sales trends going forward. All of our comments today will be consistent with the change in our reportable segments. 
In North America, revenue was down 21% in the fourth quarter as we executed important quality-of-sales initiatives as a part of our work to come back to high performance. Operating margin was down 200 basis points. 
In North America wholesale, we continued to strengthen our foundation by strategically reducing shipments to better align with underlying demand and to reduce inventory levels at our wholesale partners, all targeted to improve full-price selling. 
We continued to reduce our sales in the off-price channel as we look to scale back this channel across our geographies. These deliberate actions, pulling back on excess inventories, lowering sales to the off-price channel, executing door closures and exiting brands, coupled with challenging trends, resulted in wholesale revenue down 23% in the quarter. 
In our directly operated e-commerce business in North America, we took further actions to harmonize pricing and reduce promotions. Comps were down 20% in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower inventory units, reduced SKU count and fewer promotional periods. While these initiatives created significant pressure on e-commerce revenue, they drove healthy gross margin expansion and, importantly, created greater price coherence in the region.
These are important first steps. However, more work remains through fiscal 2018 as we aggressively address our high level of promotion in this channel. This is an important component of a multifaceted program to both ensure promotional consistency across our channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience in our most important door.
Moving on to Europe. Revenue was down 3% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the 53rd week impact and calendar shift that negatively impacted retail comps. Operating margin in Europe improved approximately 500 basis points in constant currency, excluding restructuring charges. 
In Asia, revenue was down 11% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the 53rd week impact and store closures. Operating margin in Asia improved approximately 800 basis points versus prior year in constant currency, excluding restructuring charges. This was driven by an improved gross margin through lower discount rates and expense reduction initiatives.
Across our international groups, we have focused throughout the year on improving quality of distribution and quality of sales. The majority of this work is behind us, and we have a solid foundation in our international markets. We are also laying important groundwork for growth, including building on our relationships with digital pure-play partners, like ZOZOTOWN in Japan; and Zalando, ASOS and MyTheresa in Europe. In the fourth quarter, we successfully launched an exclusive collection with Zalando with a dedicated marketing campaign, and we've seen strong sell-through so far. In Asia, we launched with Shinsegae and Hyundai online in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to comparable store sales. In constant currency and on a like-for-like basis, comps were down 11%. Excluding calendar shifts related to both Christmas and Easter holidays, the underlying comp trend was down 8% in the fourth quarter, similar to the underlying trend of down 7% in the third quarter.
Global e-commerce comps declined 16% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, impacted by the previously mentioned initiatives in North America. As these actions continue through fiscal '18, we are forecasting a mid-teens decline in global e-commerce comps, with lower discount rates and higher gross margins. 
As you saw in our announcement last month, we are moving to a more flexible platform for our directly operated e-commerce business to renew collaboration with Salesforce Commerce Cloud. This new solution will deliver a more brand-enhancing and consistent experience for our consumers, with a lower total operating cost than the platform we were internally developing. 
In concert with our actions in our directly operated e-commerce business, we continue to evolve our digital strategy to move with the consumer and drive growth through our online partners. Last year, global sales of our products across both our pure-play and department-store customers' websites were approximately $500 million at retail, comparable to the sales volume of our directly operated e-commerce business. We expect continued growth with our digital partners in FY '18.
Turning to our store fleet. We achieved our goal and closed 54 underperforming doors in fiscal 2017, ending the year with 466 stand-alone stores and 619 concessions on a global basis. For fiscal 2018, we plan to open approximately 5 net new stores and 35 new concessions, driven by growth in Asia. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our progress with our plan is reflected in our inventory position. At the end of the fourth quarter, inventory declined 30% to $792 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by both restructuring actions and an improvement in our operating processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts and moving toward a demand-driven supply chain. 
We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $1.1 billion at the end of last year. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $588 million, down from $713 million last year. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal '17 were $284 million compared with $418 million in the prior year period. This was lower than guidance of $325 million, primarily due to a shift in several retail projects into FY '18 and an increased focus on return on investment. The year-over-year reduction is driven by lower IT and infrastructure investments.
Regarding share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We repurchased $100 million of our stock, bringing full year '17 repurchases to $200 million, consistent with our communication in June. 
Now let me review our restructuring activities. We are on track with our total savings targets from the initiatives we announced last June related to the Way Forward Plan. In addition, we recently announced a new restructuring plan with estimated charges of $370 million throughout fiscal '18, an associated savings of approximately $140 million. We've made good progress on these actions and are on track to deliver those savings by the end of fiscal '19. In the fourth quarter, we recognized $216 million of charges from this new plan. Total charges for the quarter were $370 million, of which about $120 million was cash. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal '18. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. Our work to strengthen the foundation of the business will continue in fiscal 2018 as we set the stage to bring demand back to the business. We expect revenue to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have approximately 150 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2018. 
Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half the decline, with quality-of-sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder. We expect the sales trend to improve as we move through the year.
We expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9% to 10.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure operating margin for fiscal 2018 by 50 to 75 basis points. 
Clearly, there are many variables in play as we enter FY '18. This guidance is grounded in that reality and reflects our decision to accelerate quality-of-sales initiatives while providing some flexibility to roll out products, marketing and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for growth and returns. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting up the company to return to growth. 
For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be down low double digits, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on currency exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 225 basis points in the first quarter. 
Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be about 9.5% to 10%, excluding currency impacts. Foreign currency is expected to pressure operating margin by about 75 basis points.
Regarding tax rates. As noted in our press release this morning, we are adopting the new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09, for the accounting of employee share-based payments. This will affect our effective tax rate and increase its variability, with one of the key variables being the price of our stock. Based on a stock price of $75 per share, the adoption of this standard is expected to raise the fiscal 2018 tax rate to approximately 28% and the first quarter rate to 33%. Without this impact, the effective tax rate would be approximately 25% for the year. This impact is most significant in the first and second quarters due to the timing of vesting and exercise of certain stock compensation. 
Let me now review our priorities for cash and capital structure. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and to lay the foundation for future profitable growth. 
Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases.
Currently, we are planning no share repurchases in fiscal 2018 as we evaluate the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal '18 to be $300 million to $320 million, driven by new store openings, renovation of our retail environment and infrastructure investments. 
In closing, we are moving in the right direction. We are creating a strong foundation to evolve this iconic brand and our business in a challenging environment. We remain intensely focused on our execution as we build a pathway to sustainable growth. Ralph, the board and I are thrilled to welcome Patrice to the company, where he joins a passionate, committed team of over 23,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe.
With that, let's open it up for your questions."

Well, as you saw in the announcement yesterday, Patrice has a proven track record of leading major global consumer brands. And he's really an operator who has had a career that's focused on efficiency and effectiveness in the organizations he's run. He has transformed and grown brands like Olay and Pantene, with a real focus on leveraging consumer insights. He's a global citizen and has a diverse experience across distribution channels, from e-commerce to wholesalers to retail. So he really has had a breadth of experience. And probably most importantly, he really has a collaborative leadership style who can work in partnership with Ralph and the senior team to ensure that we can move forward on the front-facing part of our plan to get demand back to our business. And so we're all excited to welcome him. I think Patrice knows well and appreciates the steps that we've taken over the last year as a part of the plan to improve our business. And he's fully supportive in continuing that work to create an effective business, to continue to focus on our value-creating engines and to pivot to the consumer-facing side of our business, in partnership with Ralph."

So as I step back and look at FY '17, I think one of the things that we are very proud of is the work that we've done on quality of sales. It's shown up in our gross margin every quarter, and it's shown up in our results in FY '17. Just looking at this quarter, about half of our sales -- I'm sorry, about half of our gross margin improvement was a result of reduced promotions and better sell-through on higher-margin product. The other half was balanced between favorable geographic and challenged -- and channel mix and better product costs. As we look at our efforts in quality of sales, we've been very effective, particularly in the second half of the year, of really pulling back softly in partnership with our wholesale partners on receipts to ensure that our plan and our receipt flow was designed to flow in and reflect higher margin sell-through. So we purposely planned, pulled back, looked at the percentage of our business that was selling at a discount that we viewed as too heavy, pulled back on those receipts so that we can move in, in wholesale into higher-margin sell-through. That's starting to happen. It had to be done planfully because of the long lead times on inventory, but you're starting to see that. Equally, e-commerce, the fourth quarter, I think, shows our lean in to quality of sales in e-commerce. We worked through the inventory that we had ordered almost a year ago, but we really pulled back on promotion frequency and promotion depth on some key icon styles, notably in our women's and children's business. You're going to see that continue as we move forward. We've planned our receipts to move into higher-margin sell-through and to move forward on a reduced promotional cadence. So what I'm -- what we're starting to see is real harmony across the market, notably in North America, and a real planful pullback that continues quality of sales."

Let me just -- let me step back from the components of your question. As we move through the year, I expect sequential improvement in both our wholesale business as we start to overlap some of the quality-of-sales initiatives that we started and move into full-price selling. So I expect that to improve pretty much sequentially through the year. I do expect the fourth quarter in our businesses, largely in North America, to be better as we'll benefit from Easter in the fourth quarter of FY '18 and equally expect our retail comps and overall sales to move to be sequentially better as we move through the year. As I mentioned, most of our work in international, we've gone through the majority of our work, and I expect international overall to move -- to be moving into positive sales growth territory as they -- as we move through to the back of the year. E-commerce, where we really did the bulk of our work in the fourth quarter, and we have a significant amount of quality-of-sales work left to do in FY '18, will be a pressure point as we move through the year. And then just in terms of the comment on Denim & Supply, we are exiting Denim & Supply through the -- through all 4 quarters of the year. As we announced, Denim & Supply, we did execute spring shipments in FY '17. So that pressure will be through the 4 quarters of the year, and it is about 200 basis points of pressure overall for FY '18."

And then secondly, you've spoken a little bit about the off-price channel and continuing to pull back on it. But as you kind of just step back and say, there aren't many clear channels of transaction growth in the U.S. right now. One of them is obviously the Amazons of the world and the e-tail, mainly the e-tailers. But also, off-price is going to continue to be building stores here. I mean, you've given us a lot of detail about how you're pulling back kind of because you thought you were over what would be an equilibrium point. But how do you think, I guess, strategically about what the right amount of product is to have in that channel going forward versus having too little exposure there to growth that a lot of consumers consider to be a primary channel of retail? I guess that would be my questions."

Let me answer the last part of your question first, and then I'll give you some clarity on Q1. We do view -- value wholesale as a channel that is -- that serves a certain segment of consumers that they're excited about the treasure hunt aspect of that channel, and we recognize that. We haven't said we're exiting that channel, but we are rebalancing it. And we're rebalancing it both in terms of the amount of product that we sell through that channel and the types of product that we sell through that channel. So you will see it decline as a percentage of our total wholesale business throughout FY '18. Going forward -- and then moving forward, you'll see a slightly different mix of product, but you'll still see us serving that consumer base but on a less penetrated basis. And then your question in terms of overall gross profit. We do expect margin expansion -- gross margin expansion in FY '18 in the first quarter.

Clearly, we've got a rapidly changing consumer environment, and we have some significant change internally. So we've chosen, number one, to continue to work on building the foundation and rightsizing our business to a healthier base, notably in e-commerce. We need to have a coherent price strategy across the region. We can't lead -- be leading pricing down, and so we are leaning in to that price coherency in our e-commerce business, notably in North America. With that said, we still have a consumer-facing strategy that's still evolving. And we've left ourselves some flexibility to roll out product, marketing and store concepts, notably in the second half, which would imply a wider range of guidance on overall SG&A growth, notably in the second half. Also, in the second half, we begin to lap some of the aggressive SG&A cuts that we took in FY '17, and that's part of that variability as you look through the year. So I'd say, we've got -- overall, we are leaning in to some of the pullback in e-commerce; that's causing some sales volatility relative to our previous guidance, and we are leaving ourselves the flexibility on the SG&A line to plant important investment seeds for growth.

Clearly, improving operating margin and getting to a mid-teens operating margin is still our goal, and we are working tirelessly on that. I think given the change that we have in the environment and the changes that are occurring internally, the big question for us is timing. I think it's a question for everyone. But certainly, getting back to higher operating margin and doing that as quickly as possible is Patrice's goal, it's my goal, and it's the goal of the company. And so we'll give you more visibility in timing as we move through and as we look through these initiatives and see their performance. And then the first part of your question in terms of Amazon and other pure players, this is a dynamic marketplace. The consumer is changing. The digital ecosystem is changing. And as you've seen with our efforts that have been very successful on sites like Zalando, we're looking at all opportunities. And that'll be a big part of what Patrice will do when he comes in, in concert with the senior team. So we're open, we're looking, but these are big strategic issues, and we'll want to do them in partnership with our new Chief Executive Officer.

I'm looking forward to reviewing our progress for the year in detail, but let me start with one of the most important developments, which I'm sure you all saw yesterday. We have appointed a new President and Chief Executive Officer, Patrice Louvet. Patrice is a highly seasoned and successful business leader. He most recently served as the Group President of Global Beauty at Procter & Gamble and has a strong track record of leading global businesses during his 25-plus-year career at P&G. He has a deep understanding of consumers and brands, a collaborative leadership style and a passion to win in the marketplace. The team is ready to welcome him when he joins in July, and I am looking forward to partnering with him.
Now let me turn to our review of our performance and future outlook. 2017 was an important year as we strengthened the foundation of the company. We created operational efficiencies by improving our cost structure, increased the productivity of our assortment and improved quality of sales. Let me take you through some of the key achievements for the year. 
Starting with product. We improved the productivity and profitability level of our assortment by cutting the unproductive styles. For both Spring and Fall 2017, we reduced the number of SKUs by 20% and focused our investments on our core iconic products. 
Second, we reduced our lead times. 50% of our business is now on a 9-month lead time, and we are on track to get to 90% by the end of fiscal 2018. Importantly, we are driving improvements beyond the 9-month mark. For Spring 2018, approximately 35% of our business will be at lead times of 6 months or less. 
Third, we have aligned inventory to demand. Inventory is 30% below prior year, with improved turns. This has been achieved through both restructuring actions and a more effective buying process. In addition, since the start of our aggressive inventory management initiatives in Q2 '17, we reduced our warehouse space by 13%, with continued reductions planned for the first half of FY '18. 
Fourth, our distribution is healthier. We closed 50 underperforming doors in our retail fleet, and we are well on track to close 20% to 25% of our U.S. wholesale points of distribution by the second half of FY '18. 
Fifth, our expense structure is more efficient. We reduced SG&A by $240 million in fiscal 2017. Our organization has reduced management layers from 9 to 6, with a 20% reduction in the executive population over the last 2 years. Additionally, we consolidated regional operations under a single international group to streamline cost and processes. This group will be led by Howard Smith, who recently served as President of the Asia Pacific region. Howard has a track record of elevating the brand, driving sales growth and improving operations during his 15-year career at Ralph Lauren. 
Lastly, we've recently added 2 key senior hires: Jonathan Bottomley, Chief Marketing Officer, who joins us from Vice Media; and Tom Mendenhall, Brand President for Menswear, who joins us from Tom Ford International. Jonathan will report to Patrice, our new CEO, and Tom reports to Valérie Hermann, our President of Global Brands.
Now I'll turn to a quick review of our fourth quarter financials. This quarter, we continued to deliver against our strategy and commitments. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 16%, in line with guidance. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and on a 13 week-to-13 week basis, revenues were down 12% to last year. 
Adjusted operating margin was 6.5%, 10 basis points above last year and in line with our guidance of 6% to 6.5%. Adjusted operating margin was up 150 basis points, excluding the impact of the 53rd week and foreign currency. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points, driven by improved quality of sales, reduced promotional activity, lower product costs and favorable geographic and channel mix. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 90 basis points. 
This quarter, operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other charges, were down 12% to last year on a like-for-like basis. Expense initiatives drove the decrease. These included streamlining the organization to reduce headcount, changing product development processes to reduce costs and closing unprofitable stores to improve the profitability of our fleet. 
The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27% on an adjusted basis, lower than our guidance for 30%. This was due to a geographic shift in expense mix, driven by changes in our e-commerce platform development.
Moving on to our view by geography. As we highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we are changing our reportable segments from wholesale, retail and licensing to North America, Europe and Asia, driven by significant organizational and operational changes we've implemented over the past 12 months. We will provide segment information under the new reportable segments for the past 8 quarters in an 8-K that will be filed later today. We will also continue to give visibility to wholesale and retail sales trends going forward. All of our comments today will be consistent with the change in our reportable segments. 
In North America, revenue was down 21% in the fourth quarter as we executed important quality-of-sales initiatives as a part of our work to come back to high performance. Operating margin was down 200 basis points. 
In North America wholesale, we continued to strengthen our foundation by strategically reducing shipments to better align with underlying demand and to reduce inventory levels at our wholesale partners, all targeted to improve full-price selling. 
We continued to reduce our sales in the off-price channel as we look to scale back this channel across our geographies. These deliberate actions, pulling back on excess inventories, lowering sales to the off-price channel, executing door closures and exiting brands, coupled with challenging trends, resulted in wholesale revenue down 23% in the quarter. 
In our directly operated e-commerce business in North America, we took further actions to harmonize pricing and reduce promotions. Comps were down 20% in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower inventory units, reduced SKU count and fewer promotional periods. While these initiatives created significant pressure on e-commerce revenue, they drove healthy gross margin expansion and, importantly, created greater price coherence in the region.
These are important first steps. However, more work remains through fiscal 2018 as we aggressively address our high level of promotion in this channel. This is an important component of a multifaceted program to both ensure promotional consistency across our channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience in our most important door.
Moving on to Europe. Revenue was down 3% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the 53rd week impact and calendar shift that negatively impacted retail comps. Operating margin in Europe improved approximately 500 basis points in constant currency, excluding restructuring charges. 
In Asia, revenue was down 11% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the 53rd week impact and store closures. Operating margin in Asia improved approximately 800 basis points versus prior year in constant currency, excluding restructuring charges. This was driven by an improved gross margin through lower discount rates and expense reduction initiatives.
Across our international groups, we have focused throughout the year on improving quality of distribution and quality of sales. The majority of this work is behind us, and we have a solid foundation in our international markets. We are also laying important groundwork for growth, including building on our relationships with digital pure-play partners, like ZOZOTOWN in Japan; and Zalando, ASOS and MyTheresa in Europe. In the fourth quarter, we successfully launched an exclusive collection with Zalando with a dedicated marketing campaign, and we've seen strong sell-through so far. In Asia, we launched with Shinsegae and Hyundai online in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to comparable store sales. In constant currency and on a like-for-like basis, comps were down 11%. Excluding calendar shifts related to both Christmas and Easter holidays, the underlying comp trend was down 8% in the fourth quarter, similar to the underlying trend of down 7% in the third quarter.
Global e-commerce comps declined 16% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, impacted by the previously mentioned initiatives in North America. As these actions continue through fiscal '18, we are forecasting a mid-teens decline in global e-commerce comps, with lower discount rates and higher gross margins. 
As you saw in our announcement last month, we are moving to a more flexible platform for our directly operated e-commerce business to renew collaboration with Salesforce Commerce Cloud. This new solution will deliver a more brand-enhancing and consistent experience for our consumers, with a lower total operating cost than the platform we were internally developing. 
In concert with our actions in our directly operated e-commerce business, we continue to evolve our digital strategy to move with the consumer and drive growth through our online partners. Last year, global sales of our products across both our pure-play and department-store customers' websites were approximately $500 million at retail, comparable to the sales volume of our directly operated e-commerce business. We expect continued growth with our digital partners in FY '18.
Turning to our store fleet. We achieved our goal and closed 54 underperforming doors in fiscal 2017, ending the year with 466 stand-alone stores and 619 concessions on a global basis. For fiscal 2018, we plan to open approximately 5 net new stores and 35 new concessions, driven by growth in Asia. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our progress with our plan is reflected in our inventory position. At the end of the fourth quarter, inventory declined 30% to $792 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by both restructuring actions and an improvement in our operating processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts and moving toward a demand-driven supply chain. 
We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $1.1 billion at the end of last year. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $588 million, down from $713 million last year. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal '17 were $284 million compared with $418 million in the prior year period. This was lower than guidance of $325 million, primarily due to a shift in several retail projects into FY '18 and an increased focus on return on investment. The year-over-year reduction is driven by lower IT and infrastructure investments.
Regarding share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We repurchased $100 million of our stock, bringing full year '17 repurchases to $200 million, consistent with our communication in June. 
Now let me review our restructuring activities. We are on track with our total savings targets from the initiatives we announced last June related to the Way Forward Plan. In addition, we recently announced a new restructuring plan with estimated charges of $370 million throughout fiscal '18, an associated savings of approximately $140 million. We've made good progress on these actions and are on track to deliver those savings by the end of fiscal '19. In the fourth quarter, we recognized $216 million of charges from this new plan. Total charges for the quarter were $370 million, of which about $120 million was cash. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal '18. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. Our work to strengthen the foundation of the business will continue in fiscal 2018 as we set the stage to bring demand back to the business. We expect revenue to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have approximately 150 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2018. 
Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half the decline, with quality-of-sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder. We expect the sales trend to improve as we move through the year.
We expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9% to 10.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure operating margin for fiscal 2018 by 50 to 75 basis points. 
Clearly, there are many variables in play as we enter FY '18. This guidance is grounded in that reality and reflects our decision to accelerate quality-of-sales initiatives while providing some flexibility to roll out products, marketing and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for growth and returns. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting up the company to return to growth. 
For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be down low double digits, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on currency exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 225 basis points in the first quarter. 
Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be about 9.5% to 10%, excluding currency impacts. Foreign currency is expected to pressure operating margin by about 75 basis points.
Regarding tax rates. As noted in our press release this morning, we are adopting the new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09, for the accounting of employee share-based payments. This will affect our effective tax rate and increase its variability, with one of the key variables being the price of our stock. Based on a stock price of $75 per share, the adoption of this standard is expected to raise the fiscal 2018 tax rate to approximately 28% and the first quarter rate to 33%. Without this impact, the effective tax rate would be approximately 25% for the year. This impact is most significant in the first and second quarters due to the timing of vesting and exercise of certain stock compensation. 
Let me now review our priorities for cash and capital structure. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and to lay the foundation for future profitable growth. 
Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases.
Currently, we are planning no share repurchases in fiscal 2018 as we evaluate the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal '18 to be $300 million to $320 million, driven by new store openings, renovation of our retail environment and infrastructure investments. 
In closing, we are moving in the right direction. We are creating a strong foundation to evolve this iconic brand and our business in a challenging environment. We remain intensely focused on our execution as we build a pathway to sustainable growth. Ralph, the board and I are thrilled to welcome Patrice to the company, where he joins a passionate, committed team of over 23,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe.
With that, let's open it up for your questions."

So as I step back and look at FY '17, I think one of the things that we are very proud of is the work that we've done on quality of sales.

So as I step back and look at FY '17, I think one of the things that we are very proud of is the work that we've done on quality of sales. It's shown up in our gross margin every quarter, and it's shown up in our results in FY '17. Just looking at this quarter, about half of our sales -- I'm sorry, about half of our gross margin improvement was a result of reduced promotions and better sell-through on higher-margin product. The other half was balanced between favorable geographic and challenged -- and channel mix and better product costs. As we look at our efforts in quality of sales, we've been very effective, particularly in the second half of the year, of really pulling back softly in partnership with our wholesale partners on receipts to ensure that our plan and our receipt flow was designed to flow in and reflect higher margin sell-through. So we purposely planned, pulled back, looked at the percentage of our business that was selling at a discount that we viewed as too heavy, pulled back on those receipts so that we can move in, in wholesale into higher-margin sell-through. That's starting to happen. It had to be done planfully because of the long lead times on inventory, but you're starting to see that. Equally, e-commerce, the fourth quarter, I think, shows our lean in to quality of sales in e-commerce. We worked through the inventory that we had ordered almost a year ago, but we really pulled back on promotion frequency and promotion depth on some key icon styles, notably in our women's and children's business. You're going to see that continue as we move forward. We've planned our receipts to move into higher-margin sell-through and to move forward on a reduced promotional cadence. So what I'm -- what we're starting to see is real harmony across the market, notably in North America, and a real planful pullback that continues quality of sales."

Let me just -- let me step back from the components of your question. As we move through the year, I expect sequential improvement in both our wholesale business as we start to overlap some of the quality-of-sales initiatives that we started and move into full-price selling. So I expect that to improve pretty much sequentially through the year. I do expect the fourth quarter in our businesses, largely in North America, to be better as we'll benefit from Easter in the fourth quarter of FY '18 and equally expect our retail comps and overall sales to move to be sequentially better as we move through the year. As I mentioned, most of our work in international, we've gone through the majority of our work, and I expect international overall to move -- to be moving into positive sales growth territory as they -- as we move through to the back of the year. E-commerce, where we really did the bulk of our work in the fourth quarter, and we have a significant amount of quality-of-sales work left to do in FY '18, will be a pressure point as we move through the year. And then just in terms of the comment on Denim & Supply, we are exiting Denim & Supply through the -- through all 4 quarters of the year.

And then secondly, you've spoken a little bit about the off-price channel and continuing to pull back on it. But as you kind of just step back and say, there aren't many clear channels of transaction growth in the U.S. right now. One of them is obviously the Amazons of the world and the e-tail, mainly the e-tailers. But also, off-price is going to continue to be building stores here. I mean, you've given us a lot of detail about how you're pulling back kind of because you thought you were over what would be an equilibrium point.

I guess that would be my questions."

Let me answer the last part of your question first, and then I'll give you some clarity on Q1. We do view -- value wholesale as a channel that is -- that serves a certain segment of consumers that they're excited about the treasure hunt aspect of that channel, and we recognize that. We haven't said we're exiting that channel, but we are rebalancing it. And we're rebalancing it both in terms of the amount of product that we sell through that channel and the types of product that we sell through that channel. So you will see it decline as a percentage of our total wholesale business throughout FY '18. Going forward -- and then moving forward, you'll see a slightly different mix of product, but you'll still see us serving that consumer base but on a less penetrated basis. And then your question in terms of overall gross profit. We do expect margin expansion -- gross margin expansion in FY '18 in the first quarter.

Clearly, we've got a rapidly changing consumer environment, and we have some significant change internally. So we've chosen, number one, to continue to work on building the foundation and rightsizing our business to a healthier base, notably in e-commerce. We need to have a coherent price strategy across the region. We can't lead -- be leading pricing down, and so we are leaning in to that price coherency in our e-commerce business, notably in North America. With that said, we still have a consumer-facing strategy that's still evolving. And we've left ourselves some flexibility to roll out product, marketing and store concepts, notably in the second half, which would imply a wider range of guidance on overall SG&A growth, notably in the second half. Also, in the second half, we begin to lap some of the aggressive SG&A cuts that we took in FY '17, and that's part of that variability as you look through the year. So I'd say, we've got -- overall, we are leaning in to some of the pullback in e-commerce; that's causing some sales volatility relative to our previous guidance, and we are leaving ourselves the flexibility on the SG&A line to plant important investment seeds for growth. Those are the 2 areas that give us a guidance range for FY '18."

It's going to be at the company in part with Ralph and the entire team. The last few weeks has been exciting for me as I spent time in the marketplace and had the chance to meet with many of our team members as well as our consumers, wholesale partners and key industry opinion leaders. 
What is clear to me is that we have an iconic brand, a passionate team and a lot of opportunity ahead. Seizing our opportunity requires us to evolve how our iconic brand is experienced and expressed to win the hearts and minds of consumers globally. It's something Ralph and I are deeply committed to. 
As you can see in this quarter's results, we're making good progress with setting a strong foundation for future growth. The team continues to deliver on our commitments to improve quality of sales and distribution with increased efficiency. On my first call with you, I thought it would be valuable to share what motivated me to join the company, my observations to date and our areas of focus to get back to growth and value creation. Then I'll turn it over to Jane to walk through the details of the quarter and our guidance. At the end, we'll take your questions together. 
To start, I've long admired Ralph and I am honored to partner with him. We are both committed to preserving the essence of our brand while actively evolving it to renew long-term growth, profitability and returns. To achieve that, Ralph and I are clear on how we will partner together. Ralph is the Chief Creative Officer in charge of the creative brand aesthetic decisions. As CEO, I will lead the company's strategy, execution and business results. 
Ralph has already been a great partner, and I could not be more enthusiastic about our collaboration. I appreciate the confidence and latitude he has given me in leading this company forward. 
During this time of transformation for our industry in our business, I am confident we will accomplish a great deal together. Our opportunity is to take an iconic brand and advance it in ways that drive new growth and value in an industry that is undergoing unprecedented change. Our experiences and expertise will be a powerful and winning combination. 
People who know me well describe as a builder of both friends and teams, building up people and teams to accomplish amazing things motivates me. I believe this is one reason Ralph and I click. He was looking for somebody to come in, understand what makes this place so unique and special, and build boldly from that point.
I am also committed to objectively evaluating the business and identifying both the strengths on which we can build and the areas that need focused attention and improvement. I am passionate about building brands that consumers love. To do that, we must understand the target consumer, his or her interest and motivations, clearly define what the brand stands for in today's world and then most importantly, connected to in a way in which the brand becomes irresistible. 
To say the retail industry is at an inflection point would be an understatement. Technology has transformed the way consumers shop and connect with retail brands. Retail store closures are near 20-year high as the fundamental shift to e-commerce continues. To stand out and compete in this environment, consumers expect an omnichannel shopping experience that's unlike anything they've seen before. While not easy, I see it as our job to redefine the shopping experience of the future. 
All of these changes are creating challenges, but they're also creating opportunity. The Ralph Lauren brand was built on a belief that we all dream of living a fulfilling life, a life that makes you feel good. I think that is a universally aspirational ideal. It's an idea that transcends boundaries and generations. And it is relevant today as it has ever been. Our role is to make it feel vivid and exciting today for consumers everywhere, from Boston to Barcelona to Beijing.
We are starting with a great foundation. Our brand is iconic and the underlying fundamentals of our business are solid. I am focused on continuing to execute on the operational improvements that were part of the Way Forward plan, and the team is making good progress in driving efficiencies and improving the quality of our sales by reducing excess discounts, excess inventory, supply chain lead times, unproductive distribution and SKUs as well as aligning our creative more closely with the consumer. Further, I've been incredibly impressed by the caliber and dedication of the people here at Ralph Lauren. We have a team of talented and hard-working employees who are eager to get back to winning. And with their enthusiastic support, we will push ahead to create more value for our shareholders. 
It is too early to talk about the evolution of our strategy. However, as I start to work with the team, we have a strong focus on growth that creates value. We are focused on exploring our opportunities in becoming more digital and more global, as well as how we evolve and elevate the offerings and experiences we provide to consumers in order to drive growth.
It is important to note that we will balance driving growth with improving efficiencies. We aim to increase our productivity by continuing to simplify and streamline our operations company-wide so we can invest in growth. With the consumer's our touchstone, we're also going to focus on how we work as an organization. So our employees are more empowered, more connected and more energized. 
Getting culture right is critical for us. In closing, as I shared earlier, we are eager to evolve how the brand is experienced and expressed to win the hearts and minds of consumers globally. While our transformation is in its early days, we are progressively strengthening our position to create new value and renew long-term growth. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to walk you through the details of the quarter and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Thank you,"

As we started this fiscal year, we are encouraged by the progress in the first quarter and are confident that our efforts are the right ones to lay the groundwork for our future growth initiatives.
Let me take you through the key strategic and financial highlights of the first quarter. This quarter, we continue to deliver against our strategy to drive quality of sales and elevate our brand. Key areas of operational focus were: Aligning receipts to underlying demand, reducing promotion frequency and depth, optimizing our distribution and improving our inventory position with increased productivity. 
Our financial results were consistent with this focused execution. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 13%, in line with guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 10.2%, 200 basis points above last year and above our guidance of 9.5% to 10% in constant currency.
Gross margin also reflected this work and was up 210 basis points to last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the gross margin was 260 basis points better than last year. Importantly, we are delivering both average unit retail increases and discount rate reductions. Across our global retail network, discounted rates were down and AUR was up almost 4%.
Gross margin also benefited from favorable geographic and channel mix as our high gross margin international and retail businesses represented a large percentage of sales compared to last year. We expect these factors to drive gross margin expansion for the remainder of the year. 
This work has come in conjunction with continued progress on rightsizing our cost structure. Operating expenses were down 13% to last year in the first quarter. This was driven by: One, streamlining the organization to reduce headcount; two, closing unprofitable stores; and three, changing product development processes through SKU optimization. We are on track with our expense savings targets for the year, and this will allow us to invest some of the savings into product, marketing and distribution renovations to drive future sales growth and improve the customer experience. 
Our current and upcoming product marketing initiatives highlight our iconic core products, emphasize the core values of the brand while adding interest and newness. As an example, last month, we launched our new limited-edition Polo shirt collection. We are releasing a new shirt every month through November, each inspired by one of our signature design motifs. The launch is supported by social media as we collaborate with influencers on Instagram. Our goal for this program is to position our Polo shirt as an item to covet, reach new consumer and garner fashion editorial coverage of our icon.
We also recently introduced our new fragrance, Ralph Lauren Woman. The face of this new fragrance is 2-time Oscar-nominated actress, Jessica Chastain. Digital and social media support for the launch started in July and the product is available this month. 
In September, we will launch our new global family marketing campaign with strong outdoor and digital component. This, too, highlights Ralph Lauren's core value that our brand is built on. 
Moving on to our segment highlights. As you know, we are now reporting under our new segments, North America, Europe and Asia. This offers increased visibility into our sales and profitability by region and increased transparency into the development of our business and the progress of our initiatives around the globe.
In North America, we continue to execute our plan to come back to profitable growth. Revenue was down 17% in the first quarter and reflected important progress across our quality-of-sales initiatives. As a result, we expanded gross margin and prudently reduce expenses, delivering 110 basis points of expansion in adjusted operating margin. 
In North America wholesale, we continued our work to right size our business for the long-term health of the brand. We strategically reduced shipments to better align with underlying demand, exited brands, lowered our sales to the off-price channel and closed underperforming doors. We are on track to close 20% to 25% of our U.S. department store points of distribution by the second half of FY '18. We are about halfway through these closures as of the end of the first quarter.
These deliberate actions accounted for almost 20 points of the 27% decline in U.S. wholesale in the quarter. Consumer demand and channel dynamics remained a challenge as well. To address this and improve the positioning of our brand, we are investing in refreshing our wholesale store environments to improve the consumer experience and we are evolving our product and marketing to turn around this trend. 
The sweet spot of U.S. wholesale is their growing digital business. Our retail sales on our U.S. department store customer's websites continue to post positive growth versus last year and as a percentage of our total department store business. We will continue to drive growth to our online partners in FY '18 and evolve our digital strategy to move with the consumer where, how and when they choose to shop.
Moving on to our directly operated e-commerce business in North America. We are aggressively addressing our high level of promotion activity to both ensure price coherency across our channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience in this our most important door. These actions in North America drove strong gross margin expansion of 220 basis points to last year. However, they put significant pressure on revenue. North America e-commerce comps were down 22% in the first quarter, reflecting lower levels of promotion activity. 
To improve the consumer experience online and move beyond promotiona lead sales, one of our key digital initiatives is the transition our platform to a cloud-based solution. With our new consumer interface, we will continue to directly operate and fulfill our e-commerce business with reduced transaction friction for our consumers, improve the ability to execute dynamic changes and enhance omni channel capabilities. We are on track to launch by the second half of fiscal 2018. This solution will deliver a more brand enhancing and consistent experience for customers and provide a more flexible and nimble solution for us. 
Moving on to our international regions. In Europe, in constant currency, revenue was down 10% in the first quarter. However, adjusted operating margin was up 90 basis points. Wholesale revenue in Europe was down 28% in the first quarter. About half of this decline was due to a shift in timing of shipments to bring delivery closer to demand. Brand exits and reduced off-price sales accounted for the remainder of the decline. 
Excluding these factors, the underlying trend of the Europe wholesale business is flattish. In Europe, retail sales were flat to last year in constant currency with comps down 8% as we continued our work with quality-of-sales initiatives. 
While this ongoing work impacted comp growth negatively in the first quarter, it drove an 8% increase in AUR, 500 basis point decline in discount rate and 500 basis points of gross margin improvement across our retail network. This contributed to the improvement in operating margin for Europe and we will continue this strategy for the remainder of the year. 
In Asia, in constant currency, revenue was up 1% in the first quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 610 basis points. As we mentioned on previous calls, we have been focused on improving quality of sales in Asia over the past 12 to 18 months. We are beginning to see comp stabilize in the region. And in the first quarter, they were up 2% in constant currency, driven by increased traffic. 
Quality of sales metrics continued to be strong as well. Average unit retails were up. Discount rates were down and gross margin was up significantly in Asia. We expect continued comp growth as we upgrade our distribution network and continue our marketing initiatives to amplify the brand, specifically by increasing engagement with celebrities and influencers in Asia.
Turning to our store fleet. We continue to improve our retail network in the first quarter through closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. We opened 6 and closed 5 stand-alone stores. And in concessions, we opened 9 and closed 4 doors, ending the quarter with 467 stand-alone stores and 624 concessions on a global basis.
At year-end, we expect our standalone network of doors to be about flat to last year and have a net increase of 35 to 40 concessions, primarily in Asia. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our progress with our plan is reflected in our strength in inventory and cash positions. At the end of the first quarter, inventory declined 31% to $860 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by prior year restructuring actions and more effective buying processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand. 
We ended the first quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and short and long-term investments, up from $1.2 billion at the end of last year's first quarter. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $590 million. Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the second quarter of fiscal '18.
As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. We are reiterating our guidance for fiscal '18. We continue to expect revenues to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half the decline with quality-of-sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder. We expect the sales trend to improve as we move through the year.
Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2018. This is more favorable than our previous guidance of 150 basis points of negative impact. As you know, over the last several months, the euro has strengthened against the U.S. dollar. While clearly volatile, we are now assuming a euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate to be 1 14 versus our previous assumption of 1 06. The change in our euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate assumptions is much more impactful on our sales growth than on our gross and operating margines. This is a result of our approach to hedging. 
We hedge our transaction risk, but not our translation risk. Our hedging programs for our inventory purchases enables us to have less volatility for our margin from exchange rate movements. We continue to expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9% to 10.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to pressure operating margin for fiscal 2018 by approximately 40 to 50 basis points, less than the 50 to 75 basis points we guided to in May.
For the second quarter, we expect revenues to be down 9% to 10%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, the foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 40 basis points in the second quarter. 
Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Foreign currency is estimated to pressure operating margin by approximately 40 basis points. 
As we move through FY '18, we expect SG&A declines to moderate as we begin to lap last year's reductions and start to invest in growth initiatives around products, marketing and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for returns. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting up the company to return to growth.
In addition, our SG&A rate is affected by sales mix shifts. Similar to gross margin, as retail becomes a larger percentage of our mix, it pressures our SG&A rate because retail has a much higher SG&A rate than wholesale. As a reminder, we record all our store occupancy and payroll expenses in our SG&A line. It is also worth noting that FX is becoming less of a tailwind and in fact, is turning into a headwind for SG&A.
In terms of restructuring and other charges, we continue to expect approximately $200 million for the year. We recognize $47 million of the charges in the first quarter. Regarding tax rates. As a reminder, the adoption of the new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09 for the accounting of employees share-based payments affects our effective tax rate and increases its variability with one of the key variables being the price of our stock. 
Our tax rate guidance assumes a stock price of $78 per share for the remainder of the year. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '18 to be approximately 24% to 25% and for the second quarter to be approximately 24%, including ASU.
The guidance for fiscal '18 tax rate is lower than previously forecasted. This is due to recent favorable movements in foreign exchange rates as we now expect to generate a larger portion of our earnings from jurisdictions where our earnings are taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. In addition, there was some modest favorable adjustments to our tax reserves that resulted in a net benefit to full year forecasted effective tax rate.
Let's me finish by reviewing our priorities for cash and capital structure. In times of dynamic change, a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and lay the foundation for future profitable growth. Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases. 
We are not planning share repurchases for fiscal 2018. We make this determination based on the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and with consideration for the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal '18 to be approximately $300 million, driven by select new store openings, renovation of our retail environment and infrastructure investment. 
In closing, we are moving in the right direction, and I am incredibly proud of our team of 23,000 committed, passionate and dedicated Ralph Lauren employees around the globe. Together, we are committed to creating a strong foundation to evolve this iconic brand consistent with Ralph's enduring vision. With Patrice's leadership, we will continue to intensely focus on execution as we, together, create a pathway towards sustainable growth. 
With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Listen, I think the Way Forward plan is an operationally sound way to run the business. So we remain fully committed to it and trust that we're not going to miss a beat when it comes to executing both the operations and the efficiency interventions that we've called out. I'm actually very proud of the team's progress with setting a strong foundation for future growth, whether that's the work on improving the quality of sales or distribution, whether that's the reduction in excess inventory and SKUs and also, the progress that you've seen on efficiencies. Now we also know that if we look at the future, we're going to have the balance progress on productivity with revenue growth. And so moving forward, while we'll continue to drive the operational and efficiency elements of the Way Forward plan, we're going to put more emphasis on the revenue growth dimension of our program moving forward. And specifically here, I'll call out a few things. One is we're exploring our opportunities to become more digital. We're also looking at our opportunities to be more global because this brand obviously has incredible relevance around the world. And then Ralph and I are very committed to make sure that we evolve how this iconic brand is expressed, how it's experienced to really win the hearts and minds of consumers around the world. So that's kind of the focus on the growth pieces early thoughts. We will obviously continue to drive productivity, and focus here will be on continuing to simplify and streamline our operations company-wide. And then the focus on how we work is also important to me and to Ralph and also, to the leaders of this company. So you'll also see us put more emphasis on new ways of working. Initial thoughts are going to be around making sure our teams are more connected, our teams are more empowered and ultimately, we increase the level of energy we have across all 23,000 employees of the company."

I know you said SG&A will, year-over-year SG&A improvement will moderate through the year. Maybe just a little bit more on are you leaving room in the back half due to some kind of uncertainties on the topline? Or is it truly that we expect to accelerate the investments for growth? And then, secondly, you guys talked a lot about how you're thinking about the net revenue outlook for the year and moving towards quality-of-sale initiatives, reducing levels of discounting. But maybe I think most people are wondering when you think at this point revenues could return your growth. Are you seeing anything at your conversations as you start to look out on the spring and fall of next year? Are you starting to get some traction with product where you consider yourself, look, there's a point in the horizon where we think all this work we're doing is out of the way and we could return to revenue growth."

But certainly, as I look near in for the balance of this year, as I said, we're very comfortable with our guidance. As we look at the top line, there's no change to the topline, we do see gross margin as we move through the second half of the year that will have at least 100 basis point of gross margin expansion. Now with the guidance that we've given in terms of what SG&A will be down in the second quarter, we see operating margin expansion coming out of that. As we move into the second half, we'll have that continued 100 basis points of gross margin. But we expect that our SG&A will be flattish. And with that, that brings us to our overall guidance that you will see some compression on a constant currency basis in operating margin. As we look longer-term, I think you heard Patrice very, very clearly and passionately state, we are looking to balance efficiency with getting back to growth. But it has to be sustainable, profitable growth. And at this time, we are not ready to call the inflection point precisely. That is the question. We do think that we're building a plan that will return us to growth, and we'll come back and give you more specifics on the timing as we move forward."

Let me maybe just step back on how we look at e-commerce and online brand building and hopefully, that will address both of your questions. So first of all, the way we look at the e-commerce opportunities is really through 3 lenses. The first one is our own site, and I'll come back to that in a second. The second one is our retailer sites and then the third 1 are the pure plays. So if you look at the plan on our own site, I think this has been talked in the past, but we're in the process of completely transforming our RalphLauren.com site, and we expect by the end of the fiscal year to have something that we're excited about, both in terms of brand building and in terms of e-commerce, right? The expectation really for the team is this site needs to be our flagship. It's the kind of flagship store of the future, and hasn't been that in the past. So there's an important pivot there. And obviously, we needed to be an e-commerce machine. As far as our retailers.com operations are concerned, I've had the chance with my first couple of weeks on the business to actually meet with CEOs of a number of our top retail partners. And it's actually been exciting to see the focus they're putting on e-commerce. And some of the numbers, some of them are posting, right, which is actually quite strong. So we want to make sure we're taking advantage of that momentum and working very closely with our retail partners on the way the brand shows up, both again from the brand building standpoint, our storystelling and from a e-commerce than point. Then the third area is pure plays, which is obviously growing significantly. And we're starting to participate in that. We just really a few weeks ago. And you can expect this to extend our presence among the pure players, both here and North America and around the world. Then we double-click on social media. You heard in our remarks that Ralph and I are really committed to evolving how the brand is expressed and experienced. And obviously, social media, Omar, you're absolutely right, it's got to be a key part of that. We have a new CMO, a new global CMO that came in a few months ago, who's -- that's focused on understanding the landscape, getting super clear in which consumers we really go want to after and then leveraging all the social media platforms that you can think of, both here and around the world because this is how we will further modernize the brand and really make it even more relevant to the younger populations coming into the market."

That's an important part of our digital ecosphere, if you will, and it's growing in the first quarter, it has been growing. So very positive trend there. As we look at our own e-commerce site, I think we've been really clear about 2 things. One is job one this entire year is reducing the promotions on the site. You're going to see that -- you saw that in the first quarter. You'll see that through the year in terms of the pressure that will have on sales growth. It's critical to deliver price Korean see as a market. It's critical from a pricing architecture standpoint, so we are committed to doing that for the year. The growth is going to come as we launch, as we move out of this fiscal year and into the next year and we right size that pricing architecture and that promotion base. And that will be enhanced by our new e-commerce platform, where we're going to have a better consumer experience and better digital assets and story telling on the site.

And we would say that entrepreneurship, creativity, stylish living and authenticity, and all that is coupled with a very rich heritage of real storytelling. All of that is timeless, right? If you think through the values that are relevant to today's consumer, millennials would raise their hand and say that makes lot of sense to them. The second thing I would say is as we look at the millennial consumer, is they are looking for meaning in brands. Again, they're not just buying a product, they're buying to a world, they're buying into a set of values. And they place a lot of emphasis on where do you come from? What do you stand for? What's your story? What are your values? Are you giving back to the world? I think, again, the Ralph Lauren brand is incredibly well-positioned on this whole meaning space. So the challenge for us is, okay, with these strong value foundations, with this sensitive meaning, how do we translate it today for that consumer group, right? And that's the work Ralph and I and the team are committed to that's why we talk about evolving and elevating the way the brand is expressed and experienced because we know we are going to have some changes in terms of how we engage the consumer, where we engage the consumer, go back to the earlier conversation we're having on social media, back the early discussion we're having with driving digital number because a number of the millennial consumers are not interested in going into brick-and-mortar.

It's great to be at the company and partner with Ralph and the entire team. The last few weeks have been exciting for me as I spent time in the marketplace and had the chance to meet with many of our team members as well as our consumers, wholesale partners and key industry opinion leaders. 
What is clear to me is that we have an iconic brand, a passionate team and a lot of opportunity ahead. Seizing our opportunity requires us to evolve how our iconic brand is experienced and expressed to win the hearts and minds of consumers globally. It's something Ralph and I are deeply committed to. 
As you can see in this quarter's results, we're making good progress with setting a strong foundation for future growth. The team continues to deliver on our commitments to improve quality of sales and distribution with increased efficiency. On my first call with you, I thought it would be valuable to share what motivated me to join the company, my observations to date and our areas of focus to get back to growth and value creation. Then I'll turn it over to Jane to walk through the details of the quarter and our guidance. At the end, we'll take your questions together. 
To start, I've long admired Ralph and I am honored to partner with him. We are both committed to preserving the essence of our brand while actively evolving it to renew long-term growth, profitability and returns. To achieve that, Ralph and I are clear on how we will partner together. Ralph is the Chief Creative Officer in charge of the creative brand aesthetic decisions. As CEO, I will lead the company's strategy, execution and business results. 
Ralph has already been a great partner, and I could not be more enthusiastic about our collaboration. I appreciate the confidence and latitude he has given me in leading this company forward. 
During this time of transformation for our industry in our business, I am confident we will accomplish a great deal together. Our opportunity is to take an iconic brand and advance it in ways that drive new growth and value in an industry that is undergoing unprecedented change. Our experiences and expertise will be a powerful and winning combination. 
People who know me well describe me as a builder of both brands and teams. Building up people and teams to accomplish amazing things motivates me. I believe this is one reason Ralph and I click. He was looking for somebody to come in, understand what makes this place so unique and special and build boldly from that point.
I am also committed to objectively evaluating the business and identifying both the strengths on which we can build and the areas that need focused attention and improvement. I am passionate about building brands that consumers love. To do that, we must understand the target consumer, his or her interests and motivations, clearly define what the brand stands for in today's world, and then most importantly, connected to in a way in which the brand becomes irresistible. 
To say the retail industry is at an inflection point would be an understatement. Technology has transformed the way consumers shop and connect with retail brands. Retail store closures are near 20-year high as the fundamental shift to e-commerce continues. To stand out and compete in this environment, consumers expect an omnichannel shopping experience that's unlike anything they've seen before. While not easy, I see it as our job to redefine the shopping experience of the future. 
All of these changes are creating challenges, but they're also creating opportunity. The Ralph Lauren brand was built on a belief that we all dream of living a fulfilling life, a life that makes you feel good. I think that is a universally aspirational idea. It's an idea that transcends boundaries and generations. And it is relevant today as it has ever been. Our role is to make it feel vivid and exciting today for consumers everywhere, from Boston to Barcelona to Beijing.
We are starting with a great foundation. Our brand is iconic and the underlying fundamentals of our business are solid. I am focused on continuing to execute on the operational improvements that were part of the Way Forward Plan, and the team is making good progress in driving efficiencies and improving the quality of our sales by reducing excess discounts, excess inventory, supply chain lead times, unproductive distribution and SKUs as well as aligning our creative more closely with the consumer. Further, I've been incredibly impressed by the caliber and dedication of the people here at Ralph Lauren. We have a team of talented and hard-working employees who are eager to get back to winning. And with their enthusiastic support, we will push ahead to create more value for our shareholders. 
It is too early to talk about the evolution of our strategy. However, as I start to work with the team, we have a strong focus on growth that creates value. We are focused on exploring our opportunities in becoming more digital and more global, as well as how we evolve and elevate the offerings and experiences we provide to consumers in order to drive growth.
It is important to note that we will balance driving growth with improving efficiencies. We aim to increase our productivity by continuing to simplify and streamline our operations company-wide so we can invest in growth. With the consumer as our touchstone, we're also going to focus on how we work as an organization so our employees are more empowered, more connected and more energized. 
Getting culture right is critical for us. 
In closing, as I shared earlier, we are eager to evolve how the brand is experienced and expressed to win the hearts and minds of consumers globally. While our transformation is in its early days, we are progressively strengthening our position to create new value and renew long-term growth. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to walk you through the details of the quarter, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Thank you."

I'd like to start by saying that our entire team is thrilled to welcome Patrice to the company. He joins at a critical moment when we are executing on initiatives to strengthen the foundation of our business that will allow us to position for future growth. 
Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong and continued progress we are making in this area. As you know, last year, we started the important work of enhancing our operational efficiencies by improving our cost structure, evolving towards a demand driven sell-through culture and improving our quality of sales and distribution. As we started this fiscal year, we are encouraged by the progress in the first quarter and are confident that our efforts are the right ones to lay the groundwork for our future growth initiatives.
Let me take you through the key strategic and financial highlights of the first quarter. This quarter, we continue to deliver against our strategy to drive quality of sales and elevate our brand. Key areas of operational focus were: aligning receipts to underlying demand, reducing promotion frequency and depth, optimizing our distribution and improving our inventory position with increased productivity. 
Our financial results were consistent with this focused execution. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 13%, in line with guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 10.2%, 200 basis points above last year and above our guidance of 9.5% to 10% in constant currency.
Gross margin also reflected this work and was up 210 basis points to last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the gross margin was 260 basis points better than last year. Importantly, we are delivering both average unit retail increases and discount rate reductions. Across our global retail network, discount rates were down and AUR was up almost 4%.
Gross margin also benefited from favorable geographic and channel mix as our high gross margin international and retail businesses represented a large percentage of sales compared to last year. We expect these factors to drive gross margin expansion for the remainder of the year. 
This work has come in conjunction with continued progress on rightsizing our cost structure. Operating expenses were down 13% to last year in the first quarter. This was driven by: one, streamlining the organization to reduce headcount; two, closing unprofitable stores; and three, changing product development processes through SKU optimization. We are on track with our expense savings targets for the year, and this will allow us to invest some of the savings into product, marketing and distribution renovations to drive future sales growth and improve the customer experience. 
Our current and upcoming product marketing initiatives highlight our iconic core products, emphasize the core values of the brand while adding interest and newness. As an example, last month, we launched our new limited-edition Polo shirt collection. We are releasing a new shirt every month through November, each inspired by one of our signature design motifs. The launch is supported by social media as we collaborate with influencers on Instagram. Our goal for this program is to position our Polo shirt as an item to covet, reach a new consumer and garner fashion editorial coverage of our icon.
We also recently introduced our new fragrance, Ralph Lauren Woman. The face of this new fragrance is two-time Oscar-nominated actress, Jessica Chastain. Digital and social media support for the launch started in July and the product is available this month. 
In September, we will launch our new global family marketing campaign with strong outdoor and digital component. This, too, highlights Ralph Lauren's core values that our brand is built on. 
Moving on to our segment highlights. As you know, we are now reporting under our new segments: North America, Europe and Asia. This offers increased visibility into our sales and profitability by region and increased transparency into the development of our business and the progress of our initiatives around the globe.
In North America, we continue to execute our plan to come back to profitable growth. Revenue was down 17% in the first quarter and reflected important progress across our quality-of-sales initiatives. As a result, we expanded gross margin and prudently reduce expenses, delivering 110 basis points of expansion in adjusted operating margin. 
In North America wholesale, we continued our work to right size our business for the long-term health of the brand. We strategically reduced shipments to better align with underlying demand, exited brands, lowered our sales to the off-price channel and closed underperforming doors. We are on track to close 20% to 25% of our U.S. department store points of distribution by the second half of FY '18. We are about halfway through these closures as of the end of the first quarter.
These deliberate actions accounted for almost 20 points of the 27% decline in U.S. wholesale in the quarter. Consumer demand and channel dynamics remained a challenge as well. To address this and improve the positioning of our brand, we are investing in refreshing our wholesale store environments to improve the consumer experience, and we are evolving our product and marketing to turn around this trend. 
The sweet spot of U.S. wholesale is their growing digital business. Our retail sales on our U.S. department store customer's websites continue to post positive growth versus last year and as a percentage of our total department store business. We will continue to drive growth to our online partners in FY '18 and evolve our digital strategy to move with the consumer where, how and when they choose to shop.
Moving on to our directly operated e-commerce business in North America. We are aggressively addressing our high level of promotion activity to both ensure price coherency across our channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience in this our most important door. These actions in North America drove strong gross margin expansion of 220 basis points to last year. However, they put significant pressure on revenue. North America e-commerce comps were down 22% in the first quarter, reflecting lower levels of promotion activity. 
To improve the consumer experience online and move beyond promotion-lead sales, one of our key digital initiatives is the transition of our platform to a cloud-based solution. With our new consumer interface, we will continue to directly operate and fulfill our e-commerce business with reduced transaction friction for our consumers, improve the ability to execute dynamic changes and enhance omnichannel capabilities. We are on track to launch by the second half of fiscal 2018. This solution will deliver a more brand enhancing and consistent experience for customers and provide a more flexible and nimble solution for us. 
Moving on to our international regions. In Europe, in constant currency, revenue was down 10% in the first quarter. However, adjusted operating margin was up 90 basis points. Wholesale revenue in Europe was down 28% in the first quarter. About half of this decline was due to a shift in timing of shipments to bring delivery closer to demand. Brand exits and reduced off-price sales accounted for the remainder of the decline.  Excluding these factors, the underlying trend of the Europe wholesale business is flattish. In Europe, retail sales were flat to last year in constant currency with comps down 8% as we continued our work with quality-of-sales initiatives.  While this ongoing work impacted comp growth negatively in the first quarter, it drove an 8% increase in AUR, 500 basis point decline in discount rate and 500 basis points of gross margin improvement across our retail network. This contributed to the improvement in operating margin for Europe, and we will continue this strategy for the remainder of the year. 
In Asia, in constant currency, revenue was up 1% in the first quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 610 basis points. As we mentioned on previous calls, we have been focused on improving quality of sales in Asia over the past 12 to 18 months. We are beginning to see comp stabilize in the region. And in the first quarter, they were up 2% in constant currency, driven by increased traffic.  Quality of sales metrics continued to be strong as well. Average unit retails were up, discount rates were down and gross margin was up significantly in Asia. We expect continued comp growth as we upgrade our distribution network and continue our marketing initiatives to amplify the brand, specifically by increasing engagement with celebrities and influencers in Asia.
Turning to our store fleet. We continued to improve our retail network in the first quarter through a closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. We opened 6 and closed 5 stand-alone stores. And in concessions, we opened 9 and closed 4 doors, ending the quarter with 467 stand-alone stores and 624 concessions on a global basis.  At year-end, we expect our stand-alone network of doors to be about flat to last year and have a net increase of 35 to 40 concessions, primarily in Asia. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our progress with our plan is reflected in our strength in inventory and cash positions. At the end of the first quarter, inventory declined 31% to $860 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by prior year restructuring actions and more effective buying processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand.  We ended the first quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and short and long-term investments, up from $1.2 billion at the end of last year's first quarter. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $590 million. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the second quarter of fiscal '18.  As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. We are reiterating our guidance for fiscal '18. We continue to expect revenues to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half the decline with quality-of-sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder. We expect the sales trend to improve as we move through the year.
Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2018. This is more favorable than our previous guidance of 150 basis points of negative impact. As you know, over the last several months, the euro has strengthened against the U.S. dollar. While clearly volatile, we are now assuming a euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate to be $1.14 versus our previous assumption of $1.06. The change in our euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate assumptions is much more impactful on our sales growth than on our gross and operating margins. This is a result of our approach to hedging. 
We hedge our transaction risk, but not our translation risk. Our hedging programs for our inventory purchases enables us to have less volatility for our margin from exchange rate movements. We continue to expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9% to 10.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to pressure operating margin for fiscal 2018 by approximately 40 to 50 basis points, less than the 50 to 75 basis points we guided to in May.
For the second quarter, we expect revenues to be down 9% to 10%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, the foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 40 basis points in the second quarter. 
Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Foreign currency is estimated to pressure operating margin by approximately 40 basis points. 
As we move through FY '18, we expect SG&A declines to moderate as we begin to lap last year's reductions and start to invest in growth initiatives around products, marketing and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for returns. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting up the company to return to growth.
In addition, our SG&A rate is affected by sales mix shifts. Similar to gross margin, as retail becomes a larger percentage of our mix, it pressures our SG&A rate because retail has a much higher SG&A rate than wholesale. As a reminder, we record all our store occupancy and payroll expenses in our SG&A line. It is also worth noting that FX is becoming less of a tailwind and in fact, is turning into a headwind for SG&A.
In terms of restructuring and other charges, we continue to expect approximately $200 million for the year. We recognize $47 million of the charges in the first quarter. Regarding tax rates. As a reminder, the adoption of the new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09 for the accounting of employees share-based payments affects our effective tax rate and increases its variability, with one of the key variables being the price of our stock. 
Our tax rate guidance assumes a stock price of $78 per share for the remainder of the year. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '18 to be approximately 24% to 25% and for the second quarter to be approximately 24%, including ASU.
The guidance for fiscal '18 tax rate is lower than previously forecasted. This is due to recent favorable movements in foreign exchange rates as we now expect to generate a larger portion of our earnings from jurisdictions where our earnings are taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. In addition, there was some modest favorable adjustments to our tax reserves that resulted in a net benefit to full year forecasted effective tax rate.
Let's me finish by reviewing our priorities for cash and capital structure. In times of dynamic change, a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and lay the foundation for future profitable growth. Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases.  We are not planning share repurchases for fiscal 2018. We make this determination based on the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and with consideration for the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal '18 to be approximately $300 million, driven by select new store openings, renovation of our retail environment and infrastructure investment. 
In closing, we are moving in the right direction, and I am incredibly proud of our team of 23,000 committed, passionate and dedicated Ralph Lauren employees around the globe. Together, we are committed to creating a strong foundation to evolve this iconic brand consistent with Ralph's enduring vision. With Patrice's leadership, we will continue to intensely focus on execution as we, together, create a pathway towards sustainable growth. 
With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Listen, I think the Way Forward Plan is an operationally sound way to run the business. So we remain fully committed to it and trust that we're not going to miss a beat when it comes to executing both the operations and the efficiency interventions that we've called out. I'm actually very proud of the team's progress with setting a strong foundation for future growth, whether that's the work on improving the quality of sales or distribution, whether that's the reduction in excess inventory and SKUs and also, the progress that you've seen on efficiencies. Now we also know that if we look at the future, we're going to have the balance progress on productivity with revenue growth. And so moving forward, while we'll continue to drive the operational and efficiency elements of the Way Forward Plan, we're going to put more emphasis on the revenue growth dimension of our program moving forward. And specifically here, I'll call out a few things. One is we're exploring our opportunities to become more digital. We're also looking at our opportunities to be more global because this brand obviously has incredible relevance around the world. And then Ralph and I are very committed to make sure that we evolve how this iconic brand is expressed, how it's experienced to really win the hearts and minds of consumers around the world. So that's kind of the focus on the growth pieces early thoughts. We will obviously continue to drive productivity, and the focus here will be on continuing to simplify and streamline our operations company-wide. And then the focus on how we work is also important to me and to Ralph and also to the leaders of this company. So you'll also see us put more emphasis on new ways of working. Initial thoughts are going to be around making sure our teams are more connected, our teams are more empowered and ultimately, we increase the level of energy that we have across all 23,000 employees of the company."

I know you said SG&A will -- year-over-year SG&A improvement will moderate through the year. Maybe just a little bit more on are you leaving room in the back half due to some kind of uncertainties on the top line? Or is it truly that we expect to accelerate the investments for growth? And then secondly is, you guys talked a lot about how you're thinking about the net level of revenue outlook for the year and moving towards quality-of-sale initiatives, reducing levels of discounting. But maybe -- I think most people are wondering when you think at this point revenues could return to growth? Are you seeing anything in your conversations as you start to look out into the spring and fall of next year? Or you're starting to get some traction with the product where you consider yourself, ""Look, there's a point in the horizon where we think all this work we're doing is out of the way, and we could return to revenue growth."""

But certainly, as I look near in for the balance of this year, as I said, we're very comfortable with our guidance. As we look at the top line, there's no change to the top line, we do see gross margin as we move through the second half of the year that will have at least 100 basis point of gross margin expansion. Now with the guidance that we've given in terms of what SG&A will be down in the second quarter, we see operating margin expansion coming out of that. As we move into the second half, we'll have that continued 100 basis points of gross margin. But we expect that our SG&A will be flattish. And with that, that brings us to our overall guidance that you will see some compression on a constant currency basis in operating margin. As we look longer term, I think you've heard Patrice very, very clearly and passionately state, we are looking to balance efficiency with getting back to growth. But it has to be sustainable, profitable growth. And at this time, we are not ready to call the inflection point precisely. That is the question. We do think that we're building a plan that will return us to growth, and we'll come back and give you more specifics on the timing as we move forward."

Let me maybe just step back on how we look at e-commerce and online brand building and hopefully, that will address both of your questions. So first of all, the way we look at the e-commerce opportunities is really through 3 lenses. The first one is our own site, and I'll come back to that in a second. The second one is our retailer sites and then the third one are the pure plays. So if you look at the plan on our own site, I think this has been talked in the past, but we're in the process of completely transforming our RalphLauren.com site, and we expect by the end of the fiscal year to have something that we're excited about, both in terms of brand building and in terms of e-commerce, right? The expectation really for the team is this site needs to be our flagship. It's the kind of flagship store of the future, and it hasn't been that in the past. So there's an important pivot there. And then obviously, we need it to be an e-commerce machine. As far as our retailers.com operations are concerned, I've had the chance with my first couple of weeks on the business to actually meet with CEOs of a number of our top retail partners. And it's actually been exciting to see the focus they're putting on e-commerce. And some of the numbers, some of them are posting, right, which is actually quite strong. So we want to make sure we're taking advantage of that momentum and working very closely with our retail partners on the way the brand shows up, both again from the brand building standpoint or storytelling end from e-commerce at that point. Then the third area is pure plays, which is obviously growing significantly. And we're starting to participate in that. We just signed with [ Lily ] a few weeks ago. And you can expect this to expand our presence among the pure players, both here and North America and around the world. Then if -- we double click on social media. You heard in our remarks that Ralph and I are really committed to evolving how the brand is expressed and experienced. And obviously, social media, Omar, you're absolutely right, it's got to be a key part of that. We have a new CMO, a new global CMO that came in a few months ago, who's -- that's focused on understanding the landscape, getting super clear in which consumers we really go want to after and then leveraging all the social media platforms that you can think of, both here and around the world because this is how we will further modernize the brand and really make it even more relevant to the younger populations coming into the market."

That's an important part of our digital ecosphere, if you will. And it's growing in the first quarter, and it has been growing. So very positive trend there. As we look at our own e-commerce site, I think we've been really clear about 2 things. One is, job one this entire year is reducing the promotions on the site. You're going to see that -- you saw that in the first quarter. You'll see that through the year in terms of the pressure that will have on sales growth. It's critical to deliver price coherency in the market. It's critical from a pricing architecture standpoint, so we are committed to doing that through the year. The growth is going to come as we launch, as we move out of this fiscal year and into the next year and we right size that pricing architecture and that promotion base. And that will be enhanced by our new e-commerce platform, where we're going to have a better consumer experience and better digital assets and story telling on the site. And you'll see that as we move through the second half of the year. So I think we are very excited about this space. We are putting resources on it for both our wholesale partners and for ourselves.

And of course, the ultimate lever is comp growth, which will leverage our fixed costs infrastructure. But that's where I see the longer-term opportunities."

Well, I kind of step back, and Ralph and I had actually had a number of conversations on this that says, okay, what are the core values of the Ralph Lauren brand, all right? And we would say they are entrepreneurship, creativity, stylish living and authenticity. And all that is coupled with a very rich heritage of real storytelling. All of that is timeless, right? If you think through the values that are relevant to today's consumer, millennials would raise their hand and say that makes lot of sense to them. The second thing I would say is as we look at the millennial consumer, is that they are looking for meaning in brands. Again, they're not just buying a product, they're buying into a world, they're buying into a set of values. And they place a lot of emphasis on: Where do you come from? What do you stand for? What's your story? What are your values? Are you giving back to the world? I think again, the Ralph Lauren brand is incredibly well positioned on this whole meaning space. So the challenge for us is, okay, with these strong value foundations, with this sensitive meaning, how do we translate it today for that consumer group, right? And that's the work Ralph and I and the team are committed to. That's why we talk about evolving and elevating the way the brand is expressed and experienced because we know we are going to have some changes in terms of how we engage to the consumer, where we engage the consumer, go back to the earlier conversation we're having on social media, back to the earlier discussion we're having on driving digital harder because a number of the millennial consumers are not interested in going into brick-and-mortar. But I feel very confident coming in with the foundations of this brand. And now the challenge and the task for us, and I'm very confident we can do this well, is to translate it in a way that connects with today's consumers and the millennial population coming up."

It's great to be at the company and partner with Ralph and the entire team. The last few weeks have been exciting for me as I spent time in the marketplace and had the chance to meet with many of our team members as well as our consumers, wholesale partners and key industry opinion leaders. 
What is clear to me is that we have an iconic brand, a passionate team and a lot of opportunity ahead. Seizing our opportunity requires us to evolve how our iconic brand is experienced and expressed to win the hearts and minds of consumers globally. It's something Ralph and I are deeply committed to. 
As you can see in this quarter's results, we're making good progress with setting a strong foundation for future growth. The team continues to deliver on our commitments to improve quality of sales and distribution with increased efficiency. On my first call with you, I thought it would be valuable to share what motivated me to join the company, my observations to date and our areas of focus to get back to growth and value creation. Then I'll turn it over to Jane to walk through the details of the quarter and our guidance. At the end, we'll take your questions together. 
To start, I've long admired Ralph and I am honored to partner with him. We are both committed to preserving the essence of our brand while actively evolving it to renew long-term growth, profitability and returns. To achieve that, Ralph and I are clear on how we will partner together. Ralph is the Chief Creative Officer in charge of the creative brand aesthetic decisions. As CEO, I will lead the company's strategy, execution and business results. 
Ralph has already been a great partner, and I could not be more enthusiastic about our collaboration. I appreciate the confidence and latitude he has given me in leading this company forward. 
During this time of transformation for our industry and our business, I am confident we will accomplish a great deal together. Our opportunity is to take an iconic brand and advance it in ways that drive new growth and value in an industry that is undergoing unprecedented change. Our experiences and expertise will be a powerful and winning combination. 
People who know me well describe me as a builder of both brands and teams. Building up people and teams to accomplish amazing things motivates me. I believe this is one reason Ralph and I click. He was looking for somebody to come in, understand what makes this place so unique and special and build boldly from that point.
I am also committed to objectively evaluating the business and identifying both the strengths on which we can build and the areas that need focused attention and improvement. I am passionate about building brands that consumers love. To do that, we must understand the target consumer, his or her interests and motivations, clearly define what the brand stands for in today's world, and then most importantly, connect it to in a way in which the brand becomes irresistible. 
To say the retail industry is at an inflection point would be an understatement. Technology has transformed the way consumers shop and connect with retail brands. Retail store closures are near a 20-year high as the fundamental shift to e-commerce continues. To stand out and compete in this environment, consumers expect an omnichannel shopping experience that's unlike anything they've seen before. While not easy, I see it as our job to redefine the shopping experience of the future. 
All of these changes are creating challenges, but they're also creating opportunity. The Ralph Lauren brand was built on a belief that we all dream of living a fulfilling life, a life that makes you feel good. I think that is a universally aspirational idea. It's an idea that transcends boundaries and generations. And it's as relevant today as it has ever been. Our role is to make it feel vivid and exciting today for consumers everywhere, from Boston to Barcelona to Beijing.
We are starting with a great foundation. Our brand is iconic and the underlying fundamentals of our business are solid. I am focused on continuing to execute on the operational improvements that were part of the Way Forward Plan, and the team is making good progress in driving efficiencies and improving the quality of our sales by reducing excess discounts, excess inventory, supply chain lead times, unproductive distribution and SKUs as well as aligning our creative more closely with the consumer. Further, I've been incredibly impressed by the caliber and dedication of the people here at Ralph Lauren. We have a team of talented and hard-working employees who are eager to get back to winning. And with their enthusiastic support, we will push ahead to create more value for our shareholders. 
It is too early to talk about the evolution of our strategy. However, as I start to work with the team, we have a strong focus on growth that creates value. We are focused on exploring our opportunities in becoming more digital and more global, as well as how we evolve and elevate the offerings and experiences we provide to consumers in order to drive growth.
It is important to note that we will balance driving growth with improving efficiencies. We aim to increase our productivity by continuing to simplify and streamline our operations company-wide so we can invest in growth. With the consumer as our touchstone, we're also going to focus on how we work as an organization so our employees are more empowered, more connected and more energized. 
Getting culture right is critical for us. 
In closing, as I shared earlier, we are eager to evolve how the brand is experienced and expressed to win the hearts and minds of consumers globally. While our transformation is in its early days, we are progressively strengthening our position to create new value and renew long-term growth. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to walk you through the details of the quarter, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Thank you."

I'd like to start by saying that our entire team is thrilled to welcome Patrice to the company. He joins at a critical moment when we are executing on initiatives to strengthen the foundation of our business that will allow us to position for future growth. 
Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong and continued progress we are making in this area. As you know, last year, we started the important work of enhancing our operational efficiencies by improving our cost structure, evolving towards a demand driven sell-through culture and improving our quality of sales and distribution. As we started this fiscal year, we are encouraged by the progress in the first quarter and are confident that our efforts are the right ones to lay the groundwork for our future growth initiatives.
Let me take you through the key strategic and financial highlights of the first quarter. This quarter, we continue to deliver against our strategy to drive quality of sales and elevate our brand. Key areas of operational focus were: aligning receipts to underlying demand, reducing promotion frequency and depth, optimizing our distribution and improving our inventory position with increased productivity. 
Our financial results were consistent with this focused execution. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 13%, in line with guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 10.2%, 200 basis points above last year and above our guidance of 9.5% to 10% in constant currency.
Gross margin also reflected this work and was up 210 basis points to last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the gross margin was 260 basis points better than last year. Importantly, we are delivering both average unit retail increases and discount rate reductions. Across our global retail network, discount rates were down and AUR was up almost 4%.
Gross margin also benefited from favorable geographic and channel mix as our high gross margin international and retail businesses represented a large percentage of sales compared to last year. We expect these factors to drive gross margin expansion for the remainder of the year. 
This work has come in conjunction with continued progress on rightsizing our cost structure. Operating expenses were down 13% to last year in the first quarter. This was driven by: one, streamlining the organization to reduce headcount; two, closing unprofitable stores; and three, changing product development processes through SKU optimization. We are on track with our expense savings targets for the year, and this will allow us to invest some of the savings into product, marketing and distribution renovations to drive future sales growth and improve the customer experience. 
Our current and upcoming product marketing initiatives highlight our iconic core products, emphasize the core values of the brand while adding interest and newness. As an example, last month, we launched our new limited-edition Polo shirt collection. We are releasing a new shirt every month through November, each inspired by one of our signature design motifs. The launch is supported by social media as we collaborate with influencers on Instagram. Our goal for this program is to position our Polo shirt as an item to covet, reach a new consumer and garner fashion editorial coverage of our icon.
We also recently introduced our new fragrance, Ralph Lauren Woman. The face of this new fragrance is two-time Oscar-nominated actress, Jessica Chastain. Digital and social media support for the launch started in July and the product is available this month. 
In September, we will launch our new global family marketing campaign with strong outdoor and digital components. This, too, highlights Ralph Lauren's core values that our brand is built on. 
Moving on to our segment highlights. As you know, we are now reporting under our new segments: North America, Europe and Asia. This offers increased visibility into our sales and profitability by region and increased transparency into the development of our business and the progress of our initiatives around the globe.
In North America, we continue to execute our plan to come back to profitable growth. Revenue was down 17% in the first quarter and reflected important progress across our quality-of-sales initiatives. As a result, we expanded gross margin and prudently reduced expenses, delivering 110 basis points of expansion in adjusted operating margin. 
In North America wholesale, we continued our work to right size our business for the long-term health of the brand. We strategically reduced shipments to better align with underlying demand, exited brands, lowered our sales to the off-price channel and closed underperforming doors. We are on track to close 20% to 25% of our U.S. department store points of distribution by the second half of FY '18. We are about halfway through these closures as of the end of the first quarter.
These deliberate actions accounted for almost 20 points of the 27% decline in U.S. wholesale in the quarter. Consumer demand and channel dynamics remained a challenge as well. To address this and improve the positioning of our brand, we are investing in refreshing our wholesale store environments to improve the consumer experience, and we are evolving our product and marketing to turn around this trend. 
The sweet spot of U.S. wholesale is their growing digital business. Our retail sales on our U.S. department store customer's websites continue to post positive growth versus last year and as a percentage of our total department store business. We will continue to drive growth to our online partners in FY '18 and evolve our digital strategy to move with the consumer where, how and when they choose to shop.
Moving on to our directly operated e-commerce business in North America. We are aggressively addressing our high level of promotion activity to both ensure price coherency across our channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience in this our most important door. These actions in North America drove strong gross margin expansion of 220 basis points to last year. However, they put significant pressure on revenue. North America e-commerce comps were down 22% in the first quarter, reflecting lower levels of promotion activity. 
To improve the consumer experience online and move beyond promotion-lead sales, one of our key digital initiatives is the transition of our platform to a cloud-based solution. With our new consumer interface, we will continue to directly operate and fulfill our e-commerce business with reduced transaction friction for our consumers, improve the ability to execute dynamic changes and enhance omnichannel capabilities. We are on track to launch by the second half of fiscal 2018. This solution will deliver a more brand enhancing and consistent experience for customers and provide a more flexible and nimble solution for us. 
Moving on to our international regions. In Europe, in constant currency, revenue was down 10% in the first quarter. However, adjusted operating margin was up 90 basis points. Wholesale revenue in Europe was down 28% in the first quarter. About half of this decline was due to a shift in timing of shipments to bring delivery closer to demand. Brand exits and reduced off-price sales accounted for the remainder of the decline.  Excluding these factors, the underlying trend of the Europe wholesale business is flattish. In Europe, retail sales were flat to last year in constant currency with comps down 8% as we continued our work with quality-of-sales initiatives.  While this ongoing work impacted comp growth negatively in the first quarter, it drove an 8% increase in AUR, 500 basis point decline in discount rate and 500 basis points of gross margin improvement across our retail network. This contributed to the improvement in operating margin for Europe, and we will continue this strategy for the remainder of the year. 
In Asia, in constant currency, revenue was up 1% in the first quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 610 basis points. As we mentioned on previous calls, we have been focused on improving quality of sales in Asia over the past 12 to 18 months. We are beginning to see comps stabilize in the region. And in the first quarter, they were up 2% in constant currency, driven by increased traffic.  Quality of sales metrics continued to be strong as well. Average unit retails were up, discount rates were down and gross margin was up significantly in Asia. We expect continued comp growth as we upgrade our distribution network and continue our marketing initiatives to amplify the brand, specifically by increasing engagement with celebrities and influencers in Asia.
Turning to our store fleet. We continued to improve our retail network in the first quarter through a closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. We opened 6 and closed 5 stand-alone stores. And in concessions, we opened 9 and closed 4 doors, ending the quarter with 467 stand-alone stores and 624 concessions on a global basis.  At year-end, we expect our stand-alone network of doors to be about flat to last year and have a net increase of 35 to 40 concessions, primarily in Asia. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our progress with our plan is reflected in our strength in inventory and cash positions. At the end of the first quarter, inventory declined 31% to $860 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by prior year restructuring actions and more effective buying processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand.  We ended the first quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and short and long-term investments, up from $1.2 billion at the end of last year's first quarter. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $590 million. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the second quarter of fiscal '18.  As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. We are reiterating our guidance for fiscal '18. We continue to expect revenues to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half the decline with quality-of-sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder. We expect the sales trend to improve as we move through the year.
Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2018. This is more favorable than our previous guidance of 150 basis points of negative impact. As you know, over the last several months, the euro has strengthened against the U.S. dollar. While clearly volatile, we are now assuming a euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate to be $1.14 versus our previous assumption of $1.06. The change in our euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate assumptions is much more impactful on our sales growth than on our gross and operating margins. This is a result of our approach to hedging. 
We hedge our transaction risk, but not our translation risk. Our hedging programs for our inventory purchases enables us to have less volatility for our margin from exchange rate movements. We continue to expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9% to 10.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to pressure operating margin for fiscal 2018 by approximately 40 to 50 basis points, less than the 50 to 75 basis points we guided to in May.
For the second quarter, we expect revenues to be down 9% to 10%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, the foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 40 basis points in the second quarter. 
Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Foreign currency is estimated to pressure operating margin by approximately 40 basis points. 
As we move through FY '18, we expect SG&A declines to moderate as we begin to lap last year's reductions and start to invest in growth initiatives around products, marketing and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for returns. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting up the company to return to growth.
In addition, our SG&A rate is affected by sales mix shifts. Similar to gross margin, as retail becomes a larger percentage of our mix, it pressures our SG&A rate because retail has a much higher SG&A rate than wholesale. As a reminder, we record all our store occupancy and payroll expenses in our SG&A line. It is also worth noting that FX is becoming less of a tailwind and in fact, is turning into a headwind for SG&A.
In terms of restructuring and other charges, we continue to expect approximately $200 million for the year. We recognize $47 million of the charges in the first quarter. Regarding tax rates. As a reminder, the adoption of the new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09 for the accounting of employees share-based payments affects our effective tax rate and increases its variability, with one of the key variables being the price of our stock. 
Our tax rate guidance assumes a stock price of $78 per share for the remainder of the year. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '18 to be approximately 24% to 25% and for the second quarter to be approximately 24%, including ASU.
The guidance for fiscal '18 tax rate is lower than previously forecasted. This is due to recent favorable movements in foreign exchange rates as we now expect to generate a larger portion of our earnings from jurisdictions where our earnings are taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. In addition, there was some modest favorable adjustments to our tax reserves that resulted in a net benefit to full year forecasted effective tax rate.
Let me finish by reviewing our priorities for cash and capital structure. In times of dynamic change, a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and lay the foundation for future profitable growth. Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases.  We are not planning share repurchases for fiscal 2018. We make this determination based on the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and with consideration for the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal '18 to be approximately $300 million, driven by select new store openings, renovation of our retail environment and infrastructure investment. 
In closing, we are moving in the right direction, and I am incredibly proud of our team of 23,000 committed, passionate and dedicated Ralph Lauren employees around the globe. Together, we are committed to creating a strong foundation to evolve this iconic brand consistent with Ralph's enduring vision. With Patrice's leadership, we will continue to intensely focus on execution as we, together, create a pathway towards sustainable growth. 
With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Listen, I think the Way Forward Plan is an operationally sound way to run the business. So we remain fully committed to it and trust that we're not going to miss a beat when it comes to executing both the operations and the efficiency interventions that we've called out. I'm actually very proud of the team's progress with setting a strong foundation for future growth, whether that's the work on improving the quality of sales or distribution, whether that's the reduction in excess inventory and SKUs and also, the progress that you've seen on efficiencies. Now we also know that if we look at the future, we're going to have the balance progress on productivity with revenue growth. And so moving forward, while we'll continue to drive the operational and efficiency elements of the Way Forward Plan, we're going to put more emphasis on the revenue growth dimension of our program moving forward. And specifically here, I'll call out a few things. One is we're exploring our opportunities to become more digital. We're also looking at our opportunities to be more global because this brand obviously has incredible relevance around the world. And then Ralph and I are very committed to make sure that we evolve how this iconic brand is expressed, how it's experienced to really win the hearts and minds of consumers around the world. So that's kind of the focus on the growth pieces early thoughts. We will obviously continue to drive productivity, and the focus here will be on continuing to simplify and streamline our operations company-wide. And then the focus on how we work is also important to me and to Ralph and also to the leaders of this company. So you'll also see us put more emphasis on new ways of working. Initial thoughts are going to be around making sure our teams are more connected, our teams are more empowered and ultimately, we increase the level of energy that we have across all 23,000 employees of the company."

It looks like the -- with the second quarter, the EBIT margins are going to be up about 80 to 100 if we ignore currency. But then if we just back out the second half from the year, it looks like the guidance, it shows the margins be down quite significantly in the back half. I know you said SG&A will -- year-over-year SG&A improvement will moderate through the year. Maybe just a little bit more on are you leaving room in the back half due to some kind of uncertainties on the top line? Or is it truly that we expect to accelerate the investments for growth? And then secondly is, you guys talked a lot about how you're thinking about the net level of revenue outlook for the year and moving towards quality-of-sale initiatives, reducing levels of discounting. But maybe -- I think most people are wondering when you think at this point revenues could return to growth? Are you seeing anything in your conversations as you start to look out into the spring and fall of next year? Or you're starting to get some traction with the product where you consider yourself, ""Look, there's a point in the horizon where we think all this work we're doing is out of the way, and we could return to revenue growth."""

But certainly, as I look near in for the balance of this year, as I said, we're very comfortable with our guidance. As we look at the top line, there's no change to the top line, we do see gross margin as we move through the second half of the year that will have at least 100 basis point of gross margin expansion. Now with the guidance that we've given in terms of what SG&A will be down in the second quarter, we see operating margin expansion coming out of that. As we move into the second half, we'll have that continued 100 basis points of gross margin. But we expect that our SG&A will be flattish. And with that, that brings us to our overall guidance that you will see some compression on a constant currency basis in operating margin. As we look longer term, I think you've heard Patrice very, very clearly and passionately state, we are looking to balance efficiency with getting back to growth. But it has to be sustainable, profitable growth. And at this time, we are not ready to call the inflection point precisely. That is the question. We do think that we're building a plan that will return us to growth, and we'll come back and give you more specifics on the timing as we move forward."

Let me maybe just step back on how we look at e-commerce and online brand building and hopefully, that will address both of your questions. So first of all, the way we look at the e-commerce opportunities is really through 3 lenses. The first one is our own site, and I'll come back to that in a second. The second one is our retailer sites and then the third one are the pure plays. So if you look at the plan on our own site, I think this has been talked in the past, but we're in the process of completely transforming our RalphLauren.com site, and we expect by the end of the fiscal year to have something that we're excited about, both in terms of brand building and in terms of e-commerce, right? The expectation really for the team is this site needs to be our flagship. It's the kind of flagship store of the future, and it hasn't been that in the past. So there's an important pivot there. And then obviously, we need it to be an e-commerce machine. As far as our retailers' .com operations are concerned, I've had the chance with my first couple of weeks on the business to actually meet with the CEOs of a number of our top retail partners. And it's actually been exciting to see the focus they're putting on e-commerce. And some of the numbers some of them are posting, right, which is actually quite strong. So we want to make sure we're taking advantage of that momentum and working very closely with our retail partners on the way the brand shows up, both again from the brand building standpoint or storytelling end from e-commerce at that point. Then the third area is pure plays, which is obviously growing significantly. And we're starting to participate in that. We just signed with Zulily a few weeks ago. And you can expect this to expand our presence among the pure players, both here and North America and around the world. Then if -- we double click on social media. You heard in our remarks that Ralph and I are really committed to evolving how the brand is expressed and experienced. And obviously, social media, Omar, you're absolutely right, it's got to be a key part of that. We have a new CMO, a new global CMO that came in a few months ago, who's -- that's focused on understanding the landscape, getting super clear in which consumers we really go want to after and then leveraging all the social media platforms that you can think of, both here and around the world because this is how we will further modernize the brand and really make it even more relevant to the younger populations coming into the market."

That's an important part of our digital ecosphere, if you will. And it's growing in the first quarter, and it has been growing. So very positive trend there. As we look at our own e-commerce site, I think we've been really clear about 2 things. One is, job one this entire year is reducing the promotions on the site. You're going to see that -- you saw that in the first quarter. You'll see that through the year in terms of the pressure that will have on sales growth. It's critical to deliver price coherency in the market. It's critical from a pricing architecture standpoint, so we are committed to doing that through the year. The growth is going to come as we launch, as we move out of this fiscal year and into the next year and we right size that pricing architecture and that promotion base. And that will be enhanced by our new e-commerce platform, where we're going to have a better consumer experience and better digital assets and story telling on the site. And you'll see that as we move through the second half of the year. So I think we are very excited about this space. We are putting resources on it for both our wholesale partners and for ourselves. But it's really going to be FY '19 when you'll start to see that show up in the top line numbers. You will see it show up in improved margins as you're seeing."

Our own stores, whether it's our factory stores or our full price stores and then, obviously, e-commerce, as we were just talking in the context of Omar's question. So -- and then, there is a role for off-price to play within our overall strategy. So I expect this to continue to drive across these channels.

And we would say they are entrepreneurship, creativity, stylish living and authenticity. And all that is coupled with a very rich heritage of real storytelling. All of that is timeless, right? If you think through the values that are relevant to today's consumer, millennials would raise their hand and say that makes lot of sense to them. The second thing I would say is as we look at the millennial consumer, is that they are looking for meaning in brands. Again, they're not just buying a product, they're buying into a world, they're buying into a set of values. And they place a lot of emphasis on: Where do you come from? What do you stand for? What's your story? What are your values? Are you giving back to the world? I think again, the Ralph Lauren brand is incredibly well positioned on this whole meaning space. So the challenge for us is, okay, with these strong value foundations, with this sensitive meaning, how do we translate it today for that consumer group, right? And that's the work Ralph and I and the team are committed to. That's why we talk about evolving and elevating the way the brand is expressed and experienced because we know we are going to have some changes in terms of how we engage to the consumer, where we engage the consumer, go back to the earlier conversation we were having on social media, back to the earlier discussion we were having on driving digital harder because a number of the millennial consumers are not interested in going into brick-and-mortar. But I feel very confident coming in with the foundations of this brand. And now the challenge and the task for us, and I'm very confident we can do this well, is to translate it in a way that connects with today's consumers and the millennial population coming up."

It's great to be at the company and partner with Ralph and the entire team. The last few weeks have been exciting for me as I spent time in the marketplace and had the chance to meet with many of our team members as well as our consumers, wholesale partners and key industry opinion leaders. 
What is clear to me is that we have an iconic brand, a passionate team and a lot of opportunity ahead. Seizing our opportunity requires us to evolve how our iconic brand is experienced and expressed to win the hearts and minds of consumers globally. It's something Ralph and I are deeply committed to. 
As you can see in this quarter's results, we're making good progress with setting a strong foundation for future growth. The team continues to deliver on our commitments to improve quality of sales and distribution with increased efficiency. On my first call with you, I thought it would be valuable to share what motivated me to join the company, my observations to date and our areas of focus to get back to growth and value creation. Then I'll turn it over to Jane to walk through the details of the quarter and our guidance. At the end, we'll take your questions together. 
To start, I've long admired Ralph and I am honored to partner with him. We are both committed to preserving the essence of our brand while actively evolving it to renew long-term growth, profitability and returns. To achieve that, Ralph and I are clear on how we will partner together. Ralph is the Chief Creative Officer in charge of the creative brand aesthetic decisions. As CEO, I will lead the company's strategy, execution and business results. 
Ralph has already been a great partner, and I could not be more enthusiastic about our collaboration. I appreciate the confidence and latitude he has given me in leading this company forward. 
During this time of transformation for our industry and our business, I am confident we will accomplish a great deal together. Our opportunity is to take an iconic brand and advance it in ways that drive new growth and value in an industry that is undergoing unprecedented change. Our experiences and expertise will be a powerful and winning combination. 
People who know me well describe me as a builder of both brands and teams. Building up people and teams to accomplish amazing things motivates me. I believe this is one reason Ralph and I click. He was looking for somebody to come in, understand what makes this place so unique and special and build boldly from that point.
I am also committed to objectively evaluating the business and identifying both the strengths on which we can build and the areas that need focused attention and improvement. I am passionate about building brands that consumers love. To do that, we must understand the target consumer, his or her interests and motivations, clearly define what the brand stands for in today's world, and then most importantly, connect it to in a way in which the brand becomes irresistible. 
To say the retail industry is at an inflection point would be an understatement. Technology has transformed the way consumers shop and connect with retail brands. Retail store closures are near a 20-year high as the fundamental shift to e-commerce continues. To stand out and compete in this environment, consumers expect an omnichannel shopping experience that's unlike anything they've seen before. While not easy, I see it as our job to redefine the shopping experience of the future. 
All of these changes are creating challenges, but they're also creating opportunity. The Ralph Lauren brand was built on a belief that we all dream of living a fulfilling life, a life that makes you feel good. I think that is a universally aspirational idea. It's an idea that transcends boundaries and generations. And it's as relevant today as it has ever been. Our role is to make it feel vivid and exciting today for consumers everywhere, from Boston to Barcelona to Beijing.
We are starting with a great foundation. Our brand is iconic and the underlying fundamentals of our business are solid. I am focused on continuing to execute on the operational improvements that were part of the Way Forward Plan, and the team is making good progress in driving efficiencies and improving the quality of our sales by reducing excess discounts, excess inventory, supply chain lead times, unproductive distribution and SKUs as well as aligning our creative more closely with the consumer. Further, I've been incredibly impressed by the caliber and dedication of the people here at Ralph Lauren. We have a team of talented and hard-working employees who are eager to get back to winning. And with their enthusiastic support, we will push ahead to create more value for our shareholders. 
It is too early to talk about the evolution of our strategy. However, as I start to work with the team, we have a strong focus on growth that creates value. We are focused on exploring our opportunities in becoming more digital and more global, as well as how we evolve and elevate the offerings and experiences we provide to consumers in order to drive growth.
It is important to note that we will balance driving growth with improving efficiencies. We aim to increase our productivity by continuing to simplify and streamline our operations company-wide so we can invest in growth. With the consumer as our touchstone, we're also going to focus on how we work as an organization so our employees are more empowered, more connected and more energized. 
Getting culture right is critical for us. 
In closing, as I shared earlier, we are eager to evolve how the brand is experienced and expressed to win the hearts and minds of consumers globally. While our transformation is in its early days, we are progressively strengthening our position to create new value and renew long-term growth. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to walk you through the details of the quarter, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Thank you."

I'd like to start by saying that our entire team is thrilled to welcome Patrice to the company. He joins at a critical moment when we are executing on initiatives to strengthen the foundation of our business that will allow us to position for future growth. 
Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong and continued progress we are making in this area. As you know, last year, we started the important work of enhancing our operational efficiencies by improving our cost structure, evolving towards a demand driven sell-through culture and improving our quality of sales and distribution. As we started this fiscal year, we are encouraged by the progress in the first quarter and are confident that our efforts are the right ones to lay the groundwork for our future growth initiatives.
Let me take you through the key strategic and financial highlights of the first quarter. This quarter, we continue to deliver against our strategy to drive quality of sales and elevate our brand. Key areas of operational focus were: aligning receipts to underlying demand, reducing promotion frequency and depth, optimizing our distribution and improving our inventory position with increased productivity. 
Our financial results were consistent with this focused execution. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 13%, in line with guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 10.2%, 200 basis points above last year and above our guidance of 9.5% to 10% in constant currency.
Gross margin also reflected this work and was up 210 basis points to last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the gross margin was 260 basis points better than last year. Importantly, we are delivering both average unit retail increases and discount rate reductions. Across our global retail network, discount rates were down and AUR was up almost 4%.
Gross margin also benefited from favorable geographic and channel mix as our high gross margin international and retail businesses represented a large percentage of sales compared to last year. We expect these factors to drive gross margin expansion for the remainder of the year. 
This work has come in conjunction with continued progress on rightsizing our cost structure. Operating expenses were down 13% to last year in the first quarter. This was driven by: one, streamlining the organization to reduce headcount; two, closing unprofitable stores; and three, changing product development processes through SKU optimization. We are on track with our expense savings targets for the year, and this will allow us to invest some of the savings into product, marketing and distribution renovations to drive future sales growth and improve the customer experience. 
Our current and upcoming product marketing initiatives highlight our iconic core products, emphasize the core values of the brand while adding interest and newness. As an example, last month, we launched our new limited-edition Polo shirt collection. We are releasing a new shirt every month through November, each inspired by one of our signature design motifs. The launch is supported by social media as we collaborate with influencers on Instagram. Our goal for this program is to position our Polo shirt as an item to covet, reach a new consumer and garner fashion editorial coverage of our icon.
We also recently introduced our new fragrance, Ralph Lauren Woman. The face of this new fragrance is two-time Oscar-nominated actress, Jessica Chastain. Digital and social media support for the launch started in July and the product is available this month. 
In September, we will launch our new global family marketing campaign with strong outdoor and digital components. This, too, highlights Ralph Lauren's core values that our brand is built on. 
Moving on to our segment highlights. As you know, we are now reporting under our new segments: North America, Europe and Asia. This offers increased visibility into our sales and profitability by region and increased transparency into the development of our business and the progress of our initiatives around the globe.
In North America, we continue to execute our plan to come back to profitable growth. Revenue was down 17% in the first quarter and reflected important progress across our quality-of-sales initiatives. As a result, we expanded gross margin and prudently reduced expenses, delivering 110 basis points of expansion in adjusted operating margin. 
In North America wholesale, we continued our work to right size our business for the long-term health of the brand. We strategically reduced shipments to better align with underlying demand, exited brands, lowered our sales to the off-price channel and closed underperforming doors. We are on track to close 20% to 25% of our U.S. department store points of distribution by the second half of FY '18. We are about halfway through these closures as of the end of the first quarter.
These deliberate actions accounted for almost 20 points of the 27% decline in U.S. wholesale in the quarter. Consumer demand and channel dynamics remained a challenge as well. To address this and improve the positioning of our brand, we are investing in refreshing our wholesale store environments to improve the consumer experience, and we are evolving our product and marketing to turn around this trend. 
The sweet spot of U.S. wholesale is their growing digital business. Our retail sales on our U.S. department store customer's websites continue to post positive growth versus last year and as a percentage of our total department store business. We will continue to drive growth to our online partners in FY '18 and evolve our digital strategy to move with the consumer where, how and when they choose to shop.
Moving on to our directly operated e-commerce business in North America. We are aggressively addressing our high level of promotion activity to both ensure price coherency across our channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience in this our most important door. These actions in North America drove strong gross margin expansion of 220 basis points to last year. However, they put significant pressure on revenue. North America e-commerce comps were down 22% in the first quarter, reflecting lower levels of promotion activity. 
To improve the consumer experience online and move beyond promotion-lead sales, one of our key digital initiatives is the transition of our platform to a cloud-based solution. With our new consumer interface, we will continue to directly operate and fulfill our e-commerce business with reduced transaction friction for our consumers, improve the ability to execute dynamic changes and enhance omnichannel capabilities. We are on track to launch by the second half of fiscal 2018. This solution will deliver a more brand enhancing and consistent experience for customers and provide a more flexible and nimble solution for us. 
Moving on to our international regions. In Europe, in constant currency, revenue was down 10% in the first quarter. However, adjusted operating margin was up 90 basis points. Wholesale revenue in Europe was down 28% in the first quarter. About half of this decline was due to a shift in timing of shipments to bring delivery closer to demand. Brand exits and reduced off-price sales accounted for the remainder of the decline.  Excluding these factors, the underlying trend of the Europe wholesale business is flattish. In Europe, retail sales were flat to last year in constant currency with comps down 8% as we continued our work with quality-of-sales initiatives.  While this ongoing work impacted comp growth negatively in the first quarter, it drove an 8% increase in AUR, 500 basis point decline in discount rate and 500 basis points of gross margin improvement across our retail network. This contributed to the improvement in operating margin for Europe, and we will continue this strategy for the remainder of the year. 
In Asia, in constant currency, revenue was up 1% in the first quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 610 basis points. As we mentioned on previous calls, we have been focused on improving quality of sales in Asia over the past 12 to 18 months. We are beginning to see comps stabilize in the region. And in the first quarter, they were up 2% in constant currency, driven by increased traffic.  Quality of sales metrics continued to be strong as well. Average unit retails were up, discount rates were down and gross margin was up significantly in Asia. We expect continued comp growth as we upgrade our distribution network and continue our marketing initiatives to amplify the brand, specifically by increasing engagement with celebrities and influencers in Asia.
Turning to our store fleet. We continued to improve our retail network in the first quarter through a closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. We opened 6 and closed 5 stand-alone stores. And in concessions, we opened 9 and closed 4 doors, ending the quarter with 467 stand-alone stores and 624 concessions on a global basis.  At year-end, we expect our stand-alone network of doors to be about flat to last year and have a net increase of 35 to 40 concessions, primarily in Asia. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our progress with our plan is reflected in our strength in inventory and cash positions. At the end of the first quarter, inventory declined 31% to $860 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by prior year restructuring actions and more effective buying processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand.  We ended the first quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and short and long-term investments, up from $1.2 billion at the end of last year's first quarter. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $590 million. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the second quarter of fiscal '18.  As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. We are reiterating our guidance for fiscal '18. We continue to expect revenues to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half the decline with quality-of-sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder. We expect the sales trend to improve as we move through the year.
Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2018. This is more favorable than our previous guidance of 150 basis points of negative impact. As you know, over the last several months, the euro has strengthened against the U.S. dollar. While clearly volatile, we are now assuming a euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate to be $1.14 versus our previous assumption of $1.06. The change in our euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate assumptions is much more impactful on our sales growth than on our gross and operating margins. This is a result of our approach to hedging. 
We hedge our transaction risk, but not our translation risk. Our hedging programs for our inventory purchases enables us to have less volatility for our margin from exchange rate movements. We continue to expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9% to 10.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to pressure operating margin for fiscal 2018 by approximately 40 to 50 basis points, less than the 50 to 75 basis points we guided to in May.
For the second quarter, we expect revenues to be down 9% to 10%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, the foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 40 basis points in the second quarter. 
Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Foreign currency is estimated to pressure operating margin by approximately 40 basis points. 
As we move through FY '18, we expect SG&A declines to moderate as we begin to lap last year's reductions and start to invest in growth initiatives around products, marketing and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for returns. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting up the company to return to growth.
In addition, our SG&A rate is affected by sales mix shifts. Similar to gross margin, as retail becomes a larger percentage of our mix, it pressures our SG&A rate because retail has a much higher SG&A rate than wholesale. As a reminder, we record all our store occupancy and payroll expenses in our SG&A line. It is also worth noting that FX is becoming less of a tailwind and in fact, is turning into a headwind for SG&A.
In terms of restructuring and other charges, we continue to expect approximately $200 million for the year. We recognize $47 million of the charges in the first quarter. Regarding tax rates. As a reminder, the adoption of the new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09 for the accounting of employees share-based payments affects our effective tax rate and increases its variability, with one of the key variables being the price of our stock. 
Our tax rate guidance assumes a stock price of $78 per share for the remainder of the year. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '18 to be approximately 24% to 25% and for the second quarter to be approximately 24%, including ASU.
The guidance for fiscal '18 tax rate is lower than previously forecasted. This is due to recent favorable movements in foreign exchange rates as we now expect to generate a larger portion of our earnings from jurisdictions where our earnings are taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. In addition, there was some modest favorable adjustments to our tax reserves that resulted in a net benefit to full year forecasted effective tax rate.
Let me finish by reviewing our priorities for cash and capital structure. In times of dynamic change, a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and lay the foundation for future profitable growth. Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases.  We are not planning share repurchases for fiscal 2018. We make this determination based on the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and with consideration for the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal '18 to be approximately $300 million, driven by select new store openings, renovation of our retail environment and infrastructure investment. 
In closing, we are moving in the right direction, and I am incredibly proud of our team of 23,000 committed, passionate and dedicated Ralph Lauren employees around the globe. Together, we are committed to creating a strong foundation to evolve this iconic brand consistent with Ralph's enduring vision. With Patrice's leadership, we will continue to intensely focus on execution as we, together, create a pathway towards sustainable growth. 
With that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Now we also know that if we look at the future, we're going to have the balance progress on productivity with revenue growth. And so moving forward, while we'll continue to drive the operational and efficiency elements of the Way Forward Plan, we're going to put more emphasis on the revenue growth dimension of our program moving forward.

It looks like the -- with the second quarter, the EBIT margins are going to be up about 80 to 100 if we ignore currency. But then if we just back out the second half from the year, it looks like the guidance, it shows the margins be down quite significantly in the back half. I know you said SG&A will -- year-over-year SG&A improvement will moderate through the year. Maybe just a little bit more on are you leaving room in the back half due to some kind of uncertainties on the top line? Or is it truly that we expect to accelerate the investments for growth? And then secondly is, you guys talked a lot about how you're thinking about the net level of revenue outlook for the year and moving towards quality-of-sale initiatives, reducing levels of discounting. But maybe -- I think most people are wondering when you think at this point revenues could return to growth? Are you seeing anything in your conversations as you start to look out into the spring and fall of next year? Or you're starting to get some traction with the product where you consider yourself, ""Look, there's a point in the horizon where we think all this work we're doing is out of the way, and we could return to revenue growth."""

But certainly, as I look near in for the balance of this year, as I said, we're very comfortable with our guidance. As we look at the top line, there's no change to the top line, we do see gross margin as we move through the second half of the year that will have at least 100 basis point of gross margin expansion. Now with the guidance that we've given in terms of what SG&A will be down in the second quarter, we see operating margin expansion coming out of that. As we move into the second half, we'll have that continued 100 basis points of gross margin. But we expect that our SG&A will be flattish. And with that, that brings us to our overall guidance that you will see some compression on a constant currency basis in operating margin. As we look longer term, I think you've heard Patrice very, very clearly and passionately state, we are looking to balance efficiency with getting back to growth. But it has to be sustainable, profitable growth. And at this time, we are not ready to call the inflection point precisely. That is the question. We do think that we're building a plan that will return us to growth, and we'll come back and give you more specifics on the timing as we move forward."

Let me maybe just step back on how we look at e-commerce and online brand building and hopefully, that will address both of your questions. So first of all, the way we look at the e-commerce opportunities is really through 3 lenses. The first one is our own site, and I'll come back to that in a second. The second one is our retailer sites and then the third one are the pure plays. So if you look at the plan on our own site, I think this has been talked in the past, but we're in the process of completely transforming our RalphLauren.com site, and we expect by the end of the fiscal year to have something that we're excited about, both in terms of brand building and in terms of e-commerce, right? The expectation really for the team is this site needs to be our flagship. It's the kind of flagship store of the future, and it hasn't been that in the past. So there's an important pivot there. And then obviously, we need it to be an e-commerce machine. As far as our retailers' .com operations are concerned, I've had the chance with my first couple of weeks on the business to actually meet with the CEOs of a number of our top retail partners. And it's actually been exciting to see the focus they're putting on e-commerce. And some of the numbers some of them are posting, right, which is actually quite strong. 
So we want to make sure we're taking advantage of that momentum and working very closely with our retail partners on the way the brand shows up, both again from the brand building standpoint or storytelling end from e-commerce at that point. Then the third area is pure plays, which is obviously growing significantly. And we're starting to participate in that. We just signed with Zulily a few weeks ago. And you can expect this to expand our presence among the pure players, both here and North America and around the world. Then if -- we double click on social media. You heard in our remarks that Ralph and I are really committed to evolving how the brand is expressed and experienced. And obviously, social media, Omar, you're absolutely right, it's got to be a key part of that. We have a new CMO, a new global CMO that came in a few months ago, who's -- that's focused on understanding the landscape, getting super clear in which consumers we really go want to after and then leveraging all the social media platforms that you can think of, both here and around the world because this is how we will further modernize the brand and really make it even more relevant to the younger populations coming into the market."

That's an important part of our digital ecosphere, if you will. And it's growing in the first quarter, and it has been growing. So very positive trend there. As we look at our own e-commerce site, I think we've been really clear about 2 things. One is, job one this entire year is reducing the promotions on the site. You're going to see that -- you saw that in the first quarter. You'll see that through the year in terms of the pressure that will have on sales growth. It's critical to deliver price coherency in the market. It's critical from a pricing architecture standpoint, so we are committed to doing that through the year. The growth is going to come as we launch, as we move out of this fiscal year and into the next year and we right size that pricing architecture and that promotion base. And that will be enhanced by our new e-commerce platform, where we're going to have a better consumer experience and better digital assets and story telling on the site. And you'll see that as we move through the second half of the year. So I think we are very excited about this space. We are putting resources on it for both our wholesale partners and for ourselves. But it's really going to be FY '19 when you'll start to see that show up in the top line numbers. You will see it show up in improved margins as you're seeing."

If you think through the values that are relevant to today's consumer, millennials would raise their hand and say that makes lot of sense to them. The second thing I would say is as we look at the millennial consumer, is that they are looking for meaning in brands. Again, they're not just buying a product, they're buying into a world, they're buying into a set of values. And they place a lot of emphasis on: Where do you come from? What do you stand for? What's your story? What are your values? Are you giving back to the world? I think again, the Ralph Lauren brand is incredibly well positioned on this whole meaning space. So the challenge for us is, okay, with these strong value foundations, with this sensitive meaning, how do we translate it today for that consumer group, right? And that's the work Ralph and I and the team are committed to. That's why we talk about evolving and elevating the way the brand is expressed and experienced because we know we are going to have some changes in terms of how we engage to the consumer, where we engage the consumer, go back to the earlier conversation we were having on social media, back to the earlier discussion we were having on driving digital harder because a number of the millennial consumers are not interested in going into brick-and-mortar.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute on our plan to drive efficiencies and set a strong foundation for future growth. While we're certainly not where we want to be yet, we are encouraged that second quarter revenue was at the high end of our guidance and we outperformed on operating margin as our quality-of-sales initiatives over delivered our expectations. This focus will continue through the rest of the year, and we are on track to deliver our full year targets.
Over the past several months, I've met with many of our key suppliers and customers and thousands of our employees all over the world. These interactions have reaffirmed my excitement about the opportunity for our brand globally, I'm incredibly inspired by the passion and commitment of our teams and confident in their capabilities. I've also spent a lot of time with Ralph, and we have developed a very close and productive partnership. I'm particularly excited by some of the early progress we're making together to drive the business forward. 
Moving ahead, we are focused on reigniting quality growth while continuing to drive productivity. This balance of growth and productivity will translate into value creation for all of our stakeholders. Our key initiatives include: first, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution; second, evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; third, expanding our digital and international presence; and fourth, working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. 
While there's still a lot of work to be done, I'd like to take you through some of the early signs of progress across each of these initiatives. First, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution. In the second quarter, we continued to reduce our discount rates and increase our average unit retail, which was up 5% across the company's direct-to-consumer network. Gross margin was up 300 basis points to last year. We continue to close unproductive distribution in retail and wholesale and significantly reduced off-price shipments. 
Second, evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers. Within product, we are driving a much more disciplined assortment, focusing on our icons, renewing our core items to make them relevant to today's consumer and developing limited editions to inject energy and excitement into our brand. The result of this work is most evident in the improving sell-out trend we're seeing in Polo with Fall seasonal product. While it is still early in the season, we are seeing increased full price sell-through with higher AURs and gross margins versus last year in both men's and women's apparel. 
Within Polo Fall seasonal products, some of the bestsellers are our icons and updated core items, including the varsity jacket, the American flag in polar bear sweaters, the denim trucker jacket, embellished military-inspired styles and novelty with color clocking. This renewed icons are especially resonating with millennials. 
We're also seeing success in the denim category with updated fits, washes, lighter weights and incorporating stretch into the majority of the overall offering. 
In addition, we're beginning to offer limited-edition products on a regular basis to create more reasons for consumers to engage with us. These launches are across product, digital media and our sales channels to create a consistent experience for the consumer. In spite of this, we launched the Stadium collection in September. The original Stadium collection was introduced to celebrate the 1992 Summer Olympics, and many pieces became iconic collector's items. We released both replicas and modern interpretations at select Ralph Lauren and third-party stores around the world. We sold out several million dollars worth within hours. Importantly, 78% of the people who purchased Stadium at a Ralph Lauren store in North America were new consumers to the brand. 
Another example of limited-edition is our monthly Polo shirt launches, including the collegiate, Eldridge and jacket. Each has achieved strong full price sell-through worldwide. We will continue limited-edition series in the future. 
In marketing, we are leveraging new channels and partnerships, especially in digital and social media that will help the brand reach and acquire new consumers. For example, I'm sure many of you saw our terrific show in September where Ralph and the team created a truly unique experience in his garage in Bedford. We leverage our fashion show as a media event with a specific focus on Instagram, Facebook, T-mall, WeChat, and RalphLauren.com. The show generated over 1 billion social media impressions, more than double our February show through an expanded list of global social live stream hosts and 24 hours of Instagram stories. 
We also had many celebrity dressing moments that increased our social media impact, including Blake Lively, Woodley, Elle Fanning, [indiscernible] Bella hadid and Kendall Jenner, both of whom walked our September show, and Romeo Beckham, and among others. As well as the face of our new fragrance and brand ambassador, Jessica Chastain. 
In addition, in the U.S. alone, we have 3 major magazine covers over the past couple of months featuring our collection dresses. These included Angelina Jolie on the cover of Harper's Bazaar 150th anniversary issue, Jennifer Lawrence on the cover of Vogue for its 125th  September anniversary issue, and J. Lo on the cover of Vanity Fair this month. 
Our sports marketing also had a good summer. Based on an outstanding season, 24-year-old Polo golf ambassador, Justin Thomas, was voted PGA Tour Player of the Year, generating tremendous media exposure, including 520 million impressions at the PGA championship. 
And our sponsorship of the U.S. open tennis tournament featured our successful create-your-own customization initiative with on-site printers that drove significant traffic to our shops. 
In addition, the special edition court sneaker, worn by on-court tournament staff, was completely sold out and attracted new consumers to our brand. 
Moving onto our third initiative, expanding our digital and international presence. We have significant growth potential in Asia, specifically in China, which represents our greatest graphic growth opportunity for the company. Over the past 2 years, we've elevated the brand in Asia and built a strong foundation for the business by improving quality of sales and overall profitability. We are now beginning to pivot to quality growth while continuing our productivity work. 
As you know, we are underrepresented in Asia, with only 13% of our business in the region. In the second quarter, constant currency revenue grew 4% in Asia and comparable store sales were up 3%. We expect this trend to continue in the balance of the year. 
A key driver of our Asia growth going forward will be Mainland China, where we have very low levels of penetration but strong brand awareness. In fiscal '17, we generated approximately $50 million of revenue on Mainland China, which represents less than 1% of our total company revenue. Based on Millward Brown data, we know that Polo's aided brand awareness in Mainland China is 83%. This is a significantly higher figure than many of our competitors which have greater penetration than us in China. We will drive growth through both increased marketing and distribution, both online and with physical stores. 
Within marketing, we have increased our digital efforts and engagement with local influencers. We are tailoring social content to the Chinese consumer and dressing many Chinese celebrities with social followings nearing 1 billion total. In September, we had over 12 million Chinese views of our fashion show. We're also ramping up our presence on digital platforms. And in the second quarter, we successfully launched on T-mall and JD.com, and with commerce on WeChat. 
On these sites, we are creating digital shop-in-shop environments with a consistent brand experience, tailored product stories and an assortment that is carefully curated by our merchants. 
On WeChat, we sold out the limited-edition Polo shirt within 48 hours. We are offering many omnichannel features to Chinese consumers, including free in-store tailoring and returns and an innovative mobile-based product authentication process using WeChat to recognize QR codes. 
Complementing this digital presence in China, the team is successfully expanding our fleet of physical stores while also improving the profitability of the portfolio. Importantly, we have a harmonized pricing architecture across channels. We've opened 15 smaller format stores year-to-date in Mainland China, and by the end of fiscal '18, we expect to have a total of 60 stores on the Mainland. We have a much more rigorous approach to site selection, and these stores are generating strong sales productivity and returns that are accretive to our overall business. 
The average age of our customer in these stores is 34 years old, with a 50-50 male-female mix. We're seeing clear demand for our higher-priced more fashion-forward merchandise and a higher accessories penetration rate in China compared to other geographies, which shows opportunity. These achievements provide strong proof points for our accelerated growth strategy in Mainland China. Taken together with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, our goal for Greater China is to reach almost $0.5 billion of revenue in 5 years from about $170 million in fiscal '17, driven by both comp growth and new distribution guidance. 
We will continue to act with rigor in this market and are committed to elevating the brand and delivering sustainable, profitable growth. 
In closing, we are moving in the right direction with a clear focus on creating value for all our stakeholders by continuing to drive productivity and reigniting quality growth. Ralph and I have the same vision for the brand and the same goal, which is to get our great company back to winning. He and I are deeply committed to evolving how our iconic brand is experienced and expressed to win over consumers. We will continue to build on our early progress by driving the 4 key initiatives I outlined: elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution; evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; expanding our digital and international presence; and working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."
362220,540472951,1329428,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results showed strong progress on resetting the business to a healthier base. Our quality of sales improvements are delivering higher AURs, lower discounts, expanded gross margins, higher",2004,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results showed strong progress on resetting the business to a healthier base. Our quality of sales improvements are delivering higher AURs, lower discounts, expanded gross margins, higher inventory turns and significant growth in free cash flow. Our performance this quarter was achieved despite meaningful impact from the tragic hurricanes that affected Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. 
In total, we experienced about 1 point of comp pressure in North America as a result of the hurricanes. But our results do not tell the full story, and I am incredibly proud of our teams for their swift and tireless actions to ensure that all our employees were safe, to bring relief their communities and to reopen our stores quickly following these devastating events. 
Let me now turn to our results. Second quarter revenues declined 9% on both a reported basis and in constant currency, which was at the high end of our guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 13.4%, 100 basis points above last year on a reported basis and 70 points higher in constant currency. Gross margin in the second quarter was up 300 basis points to last year and up 290 basis points in constant currency, driven by both average unit retail increases and discount rate reductions. 
Consistent with previous quarters, approximately half of the increase was driven by reduced promotional activity and half by favorable geographic and channel mix. We also remain contract with our target expense savings for the year. 
Operating expenses were down 5% to last year in the second quarter, driven by rightsizing our cost structure, closing unprofitable distribution and changing product development processes through SKU optimization. This productivity allows us to fund our early growth initiatives while delivering our performance commitments for the year. 
Moving on to our segment performance. Starting with North America. We continue to execute our plan to come back to profitable growth. Revenue was down 16% in the second quarter, reflecting substantial progress on quality-of-sales initiatives. Despite the challenging top line, our team was able to expand adjusted operating margin 150 basis points. 
In North America wholesale, we continue to take deliberate actions to ensure the health of our brand and to set us up for long-term success. Execution progress this quarter focused on distribution closures, brand exits, off-price reductions, receipt fullbacks and lower promotional level. These actions accounted for approximately 70% of the 22% decline in the U.S. wholesale revenue this quarter. Our pullback in the off-price channel drove lower penetration within our North America wholesale business. This will continue through the remainder of the year.
Consumer demand and channel dynamics remained challenging in North America wholesale and contributed to comp declines estimated in the mid- to high single digits. However, our digital wholesale business continued to be a highlight and posted growth to last year.
We are addressing the the underlying demand by evolving our product and marketing and by investing in our wholesale store environments to improve the consumer experience. As an example, as part of our Stadium launch in September, we dropped a special capsule of knitwear items with the famous P wing logo in select Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores with customers lining up for the product overnight. As Patrice highlighted, early reads on Fall product performance in Polo has shown an improving trend, which is promising. 
In our directly operated e-commerce business in North America, comps were down 18% in the quarter, as expected, but gross margin expanded significantly as we continued our strategy to aggressively reduce promotional activity to both ensure price coherency across our channel and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience for our digital flagship consumer.
Following our decision to shift to a cloud-based e-commerce platform, our digital and IT teams moved with urgency and outstanding dedication to implement the platform switch in time for the upcoming holiday season. As a result of their work, 2 weeks ago, we went live with our new cloud-based platform for RalphLauren.com in North America. Now that our new infrastructure platform is in place, we will grow the digital flagship experience for our customers by adding functionality and evolving the creative to the second half of this year. As the new site develops, it will help us create a more brand-enhancing and consistent experience for consumers and better insights and functionality for us.
Moving on to Europe. Revenue increased 4% on a reported basis and was relatively flat with prior year in constant currency in the second quarter. Our teams in Europe delivered adjusted operating profit growth with margins up 350 basis points to last year and up 370 basis points in constant currency, driven by gross margin expansion. Wholesale revenue in Europe decreased 1% in constant currency. The negative impact of brand exits and significant reductions in off-price liquidation was partially offset by a shift in shipment timing from the first quarter that benefited the second quarter. The underlying trend of the full price wholesale business is about flat to last year. 
In the retail channel, constant currency comps were down 6% in Europe as we continued quality of sales work to rebalance pricing levels across channels. While this impacted comp growth negatively in the second quarter, gross margin and AUR were both up and the discount rate was down diffidently. Going forward, we will continue this focus in Europe, which will negatively impact comps. 
This is similar to the strategy we pursued in Asia, and they are now delivering positive comps. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue was flat to last year on a reported basis and up 4% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was up 750 basis points and up 580 basis points in constant currency. Our team is reigniting growth in the Asia region while continuing to focus on productivity. 
This was the second quarter of positive comps, which increased 3% in constant currency. Comp growth was driven by increased traffic and conversion and were keyed in the context of strong quality-of-sales initiatives. We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we upgrade our distribution network and continue our marketing initiatives to amplify the brand. 
Turning to our store fleet. We continued to improve our retail network through the closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. In the second quarter, we opened 14 stand-alone stores and 34 concessions. We closed 12 stand-alone stores and 37 concessions, ending this quarter with 469 stand-alone stores and 622 concessions on a global basis. 
At year-end, we expect our stand-alone count to be up slightly to last year and our concession network to have a net increase of 20 locations, primarily in Asia.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet is significantly stronger than last year and is a reflection of the operational progress we are making. At the end of the second quarter, inventory declined 26% to $865 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by prior year restructuring actions and more effective buying processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand.
We ended the second quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and short- and long-term investments, up from $1.1 billion at the end of last year's second quarter. 
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $590 million versus $692 million last year.
We generated $362 million of free cash flow in the second quarter, up from $67 million in the prior year period.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the third quarter of fiscal '18. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. We are maintaining our constant currency revenue guidance for fiscal '18 and raising the low end of our operating margin guidance. 
We continue to expect revenues to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half of the decline, with quality-of-sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder, partially offset by new distribution and product and marketing initiatives.
Foreign currency is now expected to have approximately 80 basis points of benefit to revenue growth in fiscal 2018 versus previous guidance of minimal impact, given the recent movements in foreign exchange rates. Based on performance in the first half and targeted investments in the fourth quarter, we now expect operating margin for fiscal '18 to be 9.5% to 10.5% in constant currency, up from our previous guidance of 9% to 10.5%. Foreign currency is now expected to have minimal impact on operating margin for fiscal '18 versus previous guidance of 40 to 50 basis points of pressure. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be down 6% to 8% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to have approximately 160 to 170 basis points of benefit to revenue growth. 
Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be down 50 to 70 basis points in constant currency. While we expect gross margin to continue to expand into the third quarter, SG&A rate will create some pressure as we start the lap last year's expense reductions and invest in growth initiatives around marketing, product and stores.
Foreign currency is estimated to benefit operating margin by approximately 10 to 20 basis points in the third quarter. 
Looking towards the fourth quarter, revenue will continue to be pressured for 2 reasons: first, we expect to shift in wholesale shipments that benefit Q3 and pressure Q4; second, a large portion of the March quarter is driven by clearance sales post holiday. To support our quality-of-sales initiatives, we have planned for less clearance inventory, which will limit the clearance sales volumes this year year-over-year. This will offset some of the benefits from the Easter shift in Q4.
Also for the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A expenses to grow versus last year as we accelerate our marketing initiatives and grow our marketing investments double digits in the second half. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting the company up to return to growth.
In terms of restructuring charges, we continue to expect approximately $200 million for the year. In the second quarter, we recognized $30 million of restructuring and other charges. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '18 to be approximately 25% and for the third quarter to be approximately 23%.
Let me finish by reviewing our priorities for cash and capital structure. In times of dynamic change, a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to the capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and lay the foundation for future profitable growth. 
Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases. We are not planning share repurchases for fiscal '18. We make this determination based on the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and with consideration for the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal '18 are estimated at $225 million, down from the previous guidance of $300 million. We want to shift capital investments behind consumer-facing initiatives that have a demonstrated proof of concept and healthy rate of return. 
In closing, we continue to make strong progress on our operational efficiencies. We are elevating our brand and have strengthened our balance sheet and improved our cash flow so that we have the resources to fuel future profitable growth. This, combined with Ralph's enduring vision and the commitment of our teams around the world, puts us in a strong position to drive value for all our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to open it up for your questions."

First, elevating the brand through quality of sales and distribution. I think as you've heard, we've made a very good progress on improving the quality of our distribution, shutting down stores, exiting brands like den",920,"Matt, so let's take them one by one. First, elevating the brand through quality of sales and distribution. I think as you've heard, we've made a very good progress on improving the quality of our distribution, shutting down stores, exiting brands like denim and supply, pulling back in wholesale both in terms of points of distribution. You know we're down 20% to 25% points of distribution in department stores. And also, as Jane just mentioned, significantly reducing shipments to the off-price channel's. So if you use a baseball analogy, which is very topical, this morning, I'd say probably seventh inning when it comes to quality of distribution. On the progress for quality of sales, I'd say, on this one, we're making good progress. You've seen us reduce the discounts and that's very visible through the 5% increase in AUR this past quarter. I struggle to provide an inning on this one because this is a game that never stops, right. We want to continuously reduce our level of discounting and improve our quality of sales. So that's on the first one. On the second one, our product and marketing. I'd say early days on products, so probably the first inning. We're beginning to see the benefits of the work that started many months ago, starting to appear in-store now. You heard some of the examples of we I think what we're seeing is a more discipline assortment. We're seeing fewer SKUs, we're seeing the beginning of our limited additions. So very -- again, I think probably first inning there. I'd say probably first inning on marketing. You've seen the support behind the show. We're getting more influencers to come into the brand, but a lot of our programs actually are going to start to kick in more in Q3, Q4 and beyond. So I'd say very, very early days on this one as well, with a lot more to come. On the third one, which is expanding our digital and our international presence, likewise here, I think we're early earnings on digital. We're very clear, that's going to be a good vector of growth for us in the future both in North America and globally. I think as we talked altogether a few weeks back, we really look at digital through 3 lenses: our own site, wholesale.com and pure players. Our own sites or RalphLauren.com, just talk about we just relaunched our platform and so now, it's about creating amazing experience for consumers. That's going to happen over the next few months, so I'd say probably first inning on that one as well. Wholesale.com is something we're really keen to win in, so not just play, but play to enrichments we're going to share that we have really good partnerships across the various regions on that. Couple encouraging data points for this past quarter, we actually grew share in wholesale.com in Europe in Q2, and we grew share in wholesale.com in the U.S. on men's apparel and women's apparel. So we're encouraged by not always a lot more to be done in a key factor of growth for us in the future as well. And then finally, on pure players, it's early days as well because if you look obviously, we have a Garo good partners of incidental in Europe and very happy with how that's playing out. We just signed up with the model, JD.com and WeChat, so it's been weeks so a lot more to be done on that front. But excited about what we can do and where we can go. On international, and what's exciting on international is there's no lack of opportunity. When you look at how our business today international in North America, we have significant growth potential in our international. You've heard is called out China and Mainland China as our number 1 priority internationally. We -- the team on the ground done a lot to get the fundamentals right over the past couple of years, so not now, it's really about accelerating our growth. So I'd say early innings in terms of the growth. We're opening stores, we're expanding our digital footprint, we're being more active in terms of marketing with the Chinese consumer. And then finally, the -- our fourth initiative, which is working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. So as you've seen I think through the numbers, the team is that I think a very good job on productivity. And this is one where I can't innings either because this game never stops, productivity is going to be something we're going to do nonstop in addition to regulating growth. We know we have areas of cost that we can do better job on and everyone's really focused on being as effective and efficient as we can be across the entire business. And then on agility, which is to winning in today's context, I'd say early innings as well. We're putting a lot of emphasis culturally on empowerment and enablement and driving a sense of urgency, putting decisions on the clock so that we just move with pace because that's what the consumers and the retailer landscape demands if we're going to get back to winning. So overall, as I can of summarize the game, some phases are kind of midway through the game towards the later  end of the game, assuming the game ends in 9 innings. And others were at the very beginning, which I think is quite exciting for what's possible moving forward for us."

Specifically, I think as we look at wholesale, the areas we're focused on there is getting the foundations healthy, right. As I mentioned earlier, the challenging our distribution, make sure we have the right product that we show up in the right way in department stores and then we have the right marketing that goes with it. But we do expect abutment stores continue to play an important role for us moving forward. I want to double-click on the wholesale.com part because that's an important growth factor for us in the future, as I mentioned earlier. Off-price also has a role to play for us moving forward, but we actually want to deemphasize the role of off-price in our total business. We believe you've kind of a bit of our ahead of our in this channel, and so what it has a role to play the our consumers there anyone to appeal to. We are pulling back on off-price and we'll continue to do that for the rest of the overtime."

And certainly, we have an opportunity once we rightsized wholesale to get back to share growth. So those are sort of how we think about the total ecosystem. As I think about revenue growth following quality-of-sales initiatives, we absolutely believe that after we get through our rightsizing and quality-of-sales initiatives, quality of sales is going to be an ongoing scene I think it will be about balance and -- but following the reset that we would get back to growth and obviously, as said, in June, we're going to come back and play out the initiatives in more detail and to give you a better road map for the timing of our financial metrics and our come back to growth."

So if I kind of we want to take celibate, we've come through 3 phases. The early phase was through licensees, which ended up building distribution that I think in wasn't the right distribution for us. So when the company took over the license in 2010, rather distribution was shut down and then there was an put on luxury with the expectation than establishing the brand at the high end would be the right way to enter the market, which I think strategically was spot on, because that is the type of equity we want to build for the brand in all new markets, particularly in a market like China. But obviously, we ended up being challenged in the overall economic model of being able to support a business that was exclusively focused on luxury. So that did not play out I think as we originally intended. So we now have the benefit of all those learnings for this third phase where we are going to focus really on this publishing Polo as the core of the business. We will obviously drive our luxury business as well to drive the overall image. but the heart of the business for us in China will be Polo. We're also very clear in terms of how we want to show up relative to the ecosystem, the go-to-market ecosystem I was referring to earlier, with a almost digital first mindset. And you've heard us talk about how we're now on WeChat, JD.com and T-mall and also opening different store format that we have historically there. So slightly smaller stores, more focused on Polo and the early results that we're seeing are quite encouraging. We're also our marketing to the Chinese consumers. So I think you heard us share some examples of celebrities that we're working with in China, and we actually have a long list of terrific partners in that market. That's really resonating with the Chinese consumer and then likewise, on product, we're looking at this through the lens of the local consumer, what is the local consumer excited about, what they're looking for and how do we ensure we serve them in a very unique way. We just spent couple of weeks in Asia actually, Jane and I, including a lot of timing in China. And what was exciting to hear from our teams and the stores is the demand there is for our higher priced products on Polo, with consumers really looking for more elevated products and accessories. So we're actually feeling pretty good about where the demand is for our brands there. And you heard me talk earlier, and I'll stop there and turn it over to Jane about average age of our consumer in China is also gives us a lot of hope for the future, our average age is 34 years old, which is really in the sweet spot of where we want to be, good 50-50 male-female mix. So I think we're well for success of there. So as we've also called out in the remarks, we will proceed cautiously and we'll be very rigorous in the way we approach our investments moving forward in China."

As you can see in our segment reporting, just 3 years ago, we were not profitable in the Asia region. And specifically, in China. And the team is done tremendous work as you've seen notably in this quarter in Asia to really expand operating margin. So that now, China and Asia growth is accretive over all ralph Lauren growth. And so from a profitability standpoint and a healthy base standpoint, we're on solid footing. The brand is in great shape. We've cleaned up our distribution, which is an effort that we're continuing, and we are opening doors in a way that makes sense. We've got flagships that build the brand, we've got Polo doors that are smaller footprint that have excellent 4-wall profitability that we're building out. And as you can see, we're building out a system of concessions that get us reach with our Chinese consumers and also provide a very healthy ROI. The gross margin in Asia is the highest that we have in the company. And so building and scaling in the Asia market is an opportunity to continue to expand operating margin but to really be a significant factor of growth for us. The time is certainly right, and we have the right team and we are in the right position to do so now."

So clearly, exciting potential for us moving forward. We just talk about Asia has been paying this penetrated market, and obviously, our primary growth driver there will be Mainland China. Looking at Europe, right? Now we're implementing an enhanced focus on quality of sales and distribution where I think, again, we get ahead of our on distribution in some parts of Europe and we have to that back. We're also working on getting the right level of discounting in that market. So that's going to create some pressure on the number of transactions and comps in the short term. However, in the long term, we -- to your point, I think, have significant growth opportunities both from a distribution and comp growth standpoint. We actually Jane and I have been traveling quite a bit we were in Europe 10 days ago, the Germany France where we spent a lot of time in the market understanding where we are and what the opportunities are. One interesting data point is across Europe, we only have I think the precise number is 19 full price stores across the entire region, which is an indication of the upside potential that we have there look at our store footprint. We also have very promising progress on digital, I mentioned Zalando earlier and many other partners that we're working with but also indicated significant upside there. And then finally, as we a number of our wholesale partners, we know we can do a better job with our wholesale partners in Europe. So I think across all these vectors, once we've completed the work quality of sales, which is critical, we have significant growth opportunity across the region. For example, we don't have a store, dedicated store in Spain, which is relatively sizable market. So we will get the balance right between Asia and Europe, but we're certainly looking at both regions as growth vectors for us in the future."

The first one, which is going to sound pretty basic was actually critical. It's really driving a more disciplined assortment. Having more discipline and understanding the role of this that we're introducing, eliminating the unproductive styles, better balancing offering across categories across price points, to have good, better, best positions across the categories that matter. The second point is there's a critical timelessness to this brand, and we have phenomenal icons and I think we've all come to the conclusion that we can do more with our Icons and put emphasis on our Icons by that as part of what we -- the early progress we are seeing this Fall season is actually driven by what's happening with our Icons. The third area is the renewal of our -- and again, that's a very important  part of our business. On this area, we are looking at fits, we're looking at styles, we're looking at materials from our looking at colors. And you can imagine, I've been very impressed by the design team that we have in-house and have had a number of conversations with them, they're very in touch with what's going on in the market, both here and around the world, and really making sure that our propositions moving forward they get into account, we also staying true to who we are. So we're not going to be jerked around by all the fashion trends out there in the market and lose kind of the fundamental of this brand stands for and the timelessness of it. We will be in touch with the trends while staying true to who we are, and obviously, making sure that what the offer is exciting relevant for the consumers that we want to serve. You heard me talk about the limited editions and we've been excited about the reactions, the stadium and see the long lines, the night before outside stores were people waiting to buy it. So we're going to continue to drive that, we're going look at partnerships moving forward as well, which I think will bring in more interest and excitement today brand. And then the final point, which is less about trends and style, it's more about strategic choices. There are categories where we should be playing more actively, where we are underdeveloped and where I believe we have a basis to win. So that will also be another vector of growth as we look at overall product offering."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute on our plan to drive efficiencies and set a strong foundation for future growth. While we're certainly not where we want to be yet, we are encouraged that second quarter revenue was at the high end of our guidance and we outperformed on operating margin as our quality-of-sales initiatives overdelivered our expectations. This focus will continue through the rest of the year, and we are on track to deliver our full year targets.
Over the past several months, I've met with many of our key suppliers and customers and thousands of our employees all over the world. These interactions have reaffirmed my excitement about the opportunity for our brand globally. I am incredibly inspired by the passion and commitment of our teams and confident in their capabilities. 
I've also spent a lot of time with Ralph, and we have developed a very close and productive partnership. I'm particularly excited by some of the early progress we're making together to drive the business forward. 
Moving ahead, we are focused on reigniting quality growth while continuing to drive productivity. This balance of growth and productivity will translate into value creation for all of our stakeholders. Our key initiatives include: First, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution; second, evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; third, expanding our digital and international presence; and fourth, working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. While there's still a lot of work to be done, I'd like to take you through some of the early signs of progress across each of these initiatives. 
First, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution. In the second quarter, we continued to reduce our discount rates and increase our average unit retail, which was up 5% across the company's direct-to-consumer network. Gross margin was up 300 basis points to last year. We continue to close unproductive distribution in retail and wholesale and significantly reduced off-price shipments. 
Second, evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers. Within product, we are driving a much more disciplined assortment, focusing on our Icons, renewing our core items to make them relevant to today's consumer and developing limited editions to inject energy and excitement into our brand. The result of this work is most evident in the improving sell-out trend we're seeing in Polo with Fall seasonal product. While it is still early in the season, we are seeing increased full price sell-through with higher AURs and gross margins versus last year in both men's and women's apparel. 
Within Polo Fall seasonal products, some of the bestsellers are our Icons and updated core items, including the varsity jacket, the American flag and polar bear sweaters, the denim trucker jacket, embellished military-inspired styles and novelty knits with color blocking. These renewed Icons are especially resonating with millennials. We're also seeing success in the denim category with updated fits, washes, lighter weights and incorporating stretch into the majority of the overall offering. 
In addition, we're beginning to offer limited-edition products on a regular basis to create more reasons for consumers to engage with us. These launches are integrated across product, digital media and our sales channels to create a consistent experience for the consumer. 
As part of this, we launched the Stadium collection in September. The original Stadium collection was introduced to celebrate the 1992 Summer Olympics, and many pieces became iconic collector's items. We released both replicas and modern interpretations at select Ralph Lauren and third-party stores around the world. We sold out several million dollars worth within hours. Importantly, 78% of the people who purchased Stadium at a Ralph Lauren store in North America were new consumers to the brand. 
Another example of limited edition is our monthly Polo shirt launches, including the Collegiate, Elk Ridge and Tour Jacket. Each has achieved strong full price sell-through worldwide. We will continue limited edition series in the future. 
In marketing, we are leveraging new channels and partnerships, especially in digital and social media, that will help the brand reach and acquire new consumers. For example, I'm sure many of you saw our terrific show in September where Ralph and the team created a truly unique experience at his garage in Bedford. We leveraged our fashion show as a media event with a specific focus on Instagram, Facebook, Tmall, WeChat, Youku and RalphLauren.com. The show generated over 1 billion social media impressions, more than double our February show, through an expanded list of global social live stream hosts and 24 hours of Instagram stories. 
We also had many celebrity dressing moments that increased our social media impact, including: Blake Lively; Shailene Woodley; Elle Fanning; Chance the Rapper; Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner, both of whom walked our September show; Brooklyn and Romeo Beckham; Li Bingbing and Yao Chen, among others; as well as the face of our new fragrance and brand ambassador, Jessica Chastain. 
In addition, in the U.S. alone, we had 3 major magazine covers over the past couple of months featuring our collection dresses. These included: Angelina Jolie on the cover of Harper's Bazaar 150th anniversary issue, Jennifer Lawrence on the cover of Vogue for its 125th  September anniversary issue, and J.Lo on the cover of Vanity Fair this month. 
Our sports marketing also had a good summer. Based on an outstanding season, 24-year-old Polo golf ambassador, Justin Thomas, was voted PGA Tour Player of the Year, generating tremendous media exposure, including 520 million estimated impressions at the PGA Championship. And our sponsorship of the US Open tennis tournament featured our successful create-your-own customization initiative with on-site printers that drove significant traffic to our shops. In addition, the special edition court sneaker, worn by on-court tournament staff, was completely sold out and attracted new consumers to our brand. 
Moving onto our third initiative: Expanding our digital and international presence. We have significant growth potential in Asia, specifically in China, which represents our greatest geographic growth opportunity for the company. Over the past 2 years, we've elevated the brand in Asia and built a strong foundation for the business by improving quality of sales and overall profitability. We are now beginning to pivot to quality growth while continuing our productivity work. 
As you know, we are underrepresented in Asia, with only 13% of our business in the region. In the second quarter, constant currency revenue grew 4% in Asia and comparable store sales were up 3%. We expect this trend to continue in the balance of the year. 
A key driver of our Asia growth going forward will be Mainland China, where we have very low levels of penetration but strong brand awareness. In fiscal '17, we generated approximately $50 million of revenue on Mainland China, which represents less than 1% of our total company revenue. Based on Millward Brown Vermeer data, we know that Polo's aided brand awareness in Mainland China is 83%. This is a significantly higher figure than many of our competitors which have greater penetration than us in China. We will drive growth through both increased marketing and distribution, both online and with physical stores. 
Within marketing, we have increased our digital efforts and engagement with local influencers. We are tailoring social content to the Chinese consumer and dressing many Chinese celebrities with social followings nearing 1 billion total. In September, we had over 12 million Chinese views of our fashion show. We're also ramping up our presence on digital platforms. And in the second quarter, we successfully launched on Tmall and JD.com and with social commerce on WeChat. On these sites, we are creating digital shop-in-shop environments with a consistent brand experience, tailored product stories and an assortment that is carefully curated by our merchants. 
On WeChat, we sold out the limited-edition Polo shirts within 48 hours. We are offering many omnichannel features to Chinese consumers, including free in-store tailoring and returns and an innovative mobile-based product authentication process using WeChat to recognize QR codes. 
Complementing this digital presence in China, the team is successfully expanding our fleet of physical stores while also improving the profitability of the portfolio. Importantly, we have a harmonized pricing architecture across channels. We've opened 15 smaller-format stores year-to-date in Mainland China, and by the end of fiscal '18, we expect to have a total of 60 stores on the Mainland. We have a much more rigorous approach to site selection, and these stores are generating strong sales productivity and returns that are accretive to our overall business. 
The average age of our customer in these stores is 34 years old with a 50-50 male-female mix. We're seeing clear demand for our higher-priced, more fashion-forward merchandise and a higher accessories penetration rate in China compared to other geographies, which shows opportunity. These achievements provide strong proof points for our accelerated growth strategy in Mainland China. Taken together with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, our goal for Greater China is to reach almost $0.5 billion of revenue in 5 years from about $170 million in fiscal '17, driven by both comp growth and new distribution [indiscernible] China. We will continue to act with rigor in this market and are committed to elevating the brand and delivering sustainable, profitable growth. 
In closing, we are moving in the right direction with a clear focus on creating value for all of our stakeholders by continuing to drive productivity and reigniting quality growth. Ralph and I have the same vision for the brand and the same goal, which is to get our great company back to winning. He and I are deeply committed to evolving how our iconic brand is experienced and expressed to win over consumers. We will continue to build on our early progress by driving the 4 key initiatives I outlined: Elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution; evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; expanding our digital and international presence; and working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."
362220,540472951,1329625,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results showed strong progress on resetting the business to a healthier base. Our quality-of-sales improvements are delivering higher AURs, lower discounts, expanded gross margins, higher",2000,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results showed strong progress on resetting the business to a healthier base. Our quality-of-sales improvements are delivering higher AURs, lower discounts, expanded gross margins, higher inventory turns and significant growth in free cash flow. 
Our performance this quarter was achieved despite meaningful impact from the tragic hurricanes that affected Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. In total, we experienced about 1 point of comp pressure in North America as a result of the hurricanes. But our results do not tell the full story, and I am incredibly proud of our teams for their swift and tireless actions to ensure that all our employees were safe, to bring relief to their communities and to reopen our stores quickly following these devastating events. 
Let me now turn to our results. Second quarter revenues declined 9% on both a reported basis and in constant currency, which was at the high end of our guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 13.4%, 100 basis points above last year on a reported basis and 70 points higher in constant currency. Gross margin in the second quarter was up 300 basis points to last year and up 290 basis points in constant currency, driven by both average unit retail increases and discount rate reductions. Consistent with previous quarters, approximately half of the increase was driven by reduced promotional activity and half by favorable geographic and channel mix. 
We also remain on track with our target expense savings for the year. Operating expenses were down 5% to last year in the second quarter, driven by rightsizing our cost structure, closing unprofitable distribution and changing product development processes through SKU optimization. This productivity allows us to fund our early growth initiatives while delivering our performance commitments for the year. 
Moving on to our segment performance, starting with North America. We continue to execute our plan to come back to profitable growth. Revenue was down 16% in the second quarter, reflecting substantial progress on quality-of-sales initiatives. Despite the challenging top line, our team was able to expand adjusted operating margin 150 basis points. 
In North America wholesale, we continue to take deliberate actions to ensure the health of our brand and to set us up for long-term success. Execution progress this quarter focused on distribution closures, brand exits, off-price reductions, receipt pullbacks and lower promotional levels. These actions accounted for approximately 70% of the 22% decline in the U.S. wholesale revenue this quarter. Our pullback in the off-price channel drove lower penetration within our North America wholesale business. This will continue through the remainder of the year.
Consumer demand and channel dynamics remained challenging in North America wholesale and contributed to comp declines estimated in the mid- to high single digits. However, our digital wholesale business continued to be a highlight and posted growth to last year.
We are addressing the weak underlying demand by evolving our product and marketing and by investing in our wholesale store environments to improve the consumer experience. As an example, as part of our Stadium launch in September, we dropped a special capsule of knitwear items with the famous P-Wing logo in select Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores, with customers lining up for the product overnight. As Patrice highlighted, early reads on Fall product performance in Polo has shown an improving trend, which is promising. 
In our directly operated e-commerce business in North America, comps were down 18% in the quarter, as expected, but gross margin expanded significantly as we continued our strategy to aggressively reduce promotional activity to both ensure price coherency across our channel and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience for our digital flagship consumer.
Following our decision to shift to a cloud-based e-commerce platform, our digital and IT teams moved with urgency and outstanding dedication to implement the platform switch in time for the upcoming holiday season. As a result of their work, 2 weeks ago, we went live with our new cloud-based platform for RalphLauren.com in North America. 
Now that our new infrastructure platform is in place, we will build a digital flagship experience for our customers by adding functionality and evolving the creative through the second half of this year. As the new site develops, it will help us create a more brand-enhancing and consistent experience for consumers and better insights and functionality for us.
Moving on to Europe. Revenue increased 4% on a reported basis and was relatively flat with prior year in constant currency in the second quarter. Our teams in Europe delivered adjusted operating profit growth with margins up 350 basis points to last year and up 370 basis points in constant currency, driven by gross margin expansion. 
Wholesale revenue in Europe decreased 1% in constant currency. The negative impact of brand exits and significant reductions in off-price liquidation was partially offset by a shift in shipment timing from the first quarter that benefited the second quarter. The underlying trend of the full price wholesale business is about flat to last year. 
In the retail channel, constant currency comps were down 6% in Europe as we continued quality-of-sales work to rebalance pricing levels across channels. While this impacted comp growth negatively in the second quarter, gross margin and AUR were both up and the discount rate was down significantly. Going forward, we will continue this focus in Europe, which will negatively impact comps. This is similar to the strategy we pursued in Asia, and they are now delivering positive comps. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue was flat to last year on a reported basis and up 4% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was up 750 basis points and up 580 basis points in constant currency. Our team is reigniting growth in the Asia region while continuing to focus on productivity. 
This was the second quarter of positive comps, which increased 3% in constant currency. Comp growth was driven by increased traffic and conversion and were achieved in the context of strong quality-of-sales initiatives. We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we upgrade our distribution network and continue our marketing initiatives to amplify the brand. 
Turning to our store fleet. We continued to improve our retail network through the closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. In the second quarter, we opened 14 stand-alone stores and 34 concessions. We closed 12 stand-alone stores and 37 concessions, ending this quarter with 469 stand-alone stores and 622 concessions on a global basis. At year-end, we expect our stand-alone count to be up slightly to last year and our concession network to have a net increase of 20 locations, primarily in Asia.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet is significantly stronger than last year and is a reflection of the operational progress we are making. At the end of the second quarter, inventory declined 26% to $865 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by prior year restructuring actions and more effective buying processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand.
We ended the second quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and short- and long-term investments, up from $1.1 billion at the end of last year's second quarter. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $590 million versus $692 million last year. We generated $362 million of free cash flow in the second quarter, up from $67 million in the prior year period.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the third quarter of fiscal '18. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. 
We are maintaining our constant currency revenue guidance for fiscal '18 and raising the low end of our operating margin guidance. 
We continue to expect revenues to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half of the decline, with quality-of-sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder, partially offset by new distribution and product and marketing initiatives.
Foreign currency is now expected to have approximately 80 basis points of benefit to revenue growth in fiscal 2018 versus previous guidance of minimal impact, given the recent movements in foreign exchange rates. 
Based on performance in the first half and targeted investments in the fourth quarter, we now expect operating margin for fiscal '18 to be 9.5% to 10.5% in constant currency, up from our previous guidance of 9% to 10.5%. Foreign currency is now expected to have minimal impact on operating margin for fiscal '18 versus previous guidance of 40 to 50 basis points of pressure. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be down 6% to 8% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to have approximately 160 to 170 basis points of benefit to revenue growth. 
Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be down 50 to 70 basis points in constant currency. While we expect gross margin to continue to expand into the third quarter, SG&A rate will create some pressure as we start to lap last year's expense reductions and invest in growth initiatives around marketing, product and stores. Foreign currency is estimated to benefit operating margin by approximately 10 to 20 basis points in the third quarter. 
Looking towards the fourth quarter, revenue will continue to be pressured for 2 reasons: First, we expect a shift in wholesale shipments that benefit Q3 and pressure Q4; second, a large portion of the March quarter is driven by clearance sales post-holiday. To support our quality-of-sales initiatives, we have planned for less clearance inventory, which will limit the clearance sales volumes this year year-over-year. This will offset some of the benefit from the Easter shift in Q4.
Also for the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A expenses to grow versus last year as we accelerate our marketing initiatives and grow our marketing investments double digits in the second half. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting the company up to return to growth.
In terms of restructuring charges, we continue to expect approximately $200 million for the year. In the second quarter, we recognized $30 million of restructuring and other charges. 
We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '18 to be approximately 25% and for the third quarter to be approximately 23%.
Let me finish by reviewing our priorities for cash and capital structure. In times of dynamic change, a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to the capital markets. 
Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and lay the foundation for future profitable growth. Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases. We are not planning share repurchases for fiscal '18. We make this determination based on the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and with consideration for the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal '18 are estimated at $225 million, down from the previous guidance of $300 million. We want to shift capital investments behind consumer-facing initiatives that have a demonstrated proof of concept and healthy rate of return. 
In closing, we continue to make strong progress on our operational efficiencies. We are elevating our brand and have strengthened our balance sheet and improved our cash flow so that we have the resources to fuel future profitable growth. This, combined with Ralph's enduring vision and the commitment of our teams around the world, puts us in a strong position to drive value for all our stakeholders. 
With that, I'd like to open it up for your questions."

First, elevating the brand through quality of sales and distribution. I think as you've heard, we've made very good progress on improving the quality of our distribution, shutting down stores, exiting brands like Denim",955,"Matt, so let's take them one by one. First, elevating the brand through quality of sales and distribution. I think as you've heard, we've made very good progress on improving the quality of our distribution, shutting down stores, exiting brands like Denim & Supply, pulling back in wholesale, both in terms of points of distribution, you know we're down 20 to 25 percent points of distribution in department stores, and also as Jane just mentioned, significantly reducing shipments to the off-price channel's. So if we use a baseball analogy, which is very topical, this morning, I'd say probably seventh inning when it comes to quality of distribution. On the progress for quality of sales, I'd say on this one, we're making good progress. You've seen us reduce the discounts and that's very visible through the 5% increase in AUR this past quarter. I struggle to provide an inning on this one because this is a game that never stops, right? We want to continuously reduce our level of discounting and improve our quality of sales. So that's on the first one. On the second one, evolving product and marketing. I'd say early days on product, so probably the first inning. We're beginning to see the benefits of the work that started many months ago, starting to appear in store now. You heard some of the examples that we quoted. Think what we're seeing is a more disciplined assortment. We're seeing fewer SKUs. We're seeing the beginning of our limited editions. So very -- again, I think probably first inning there. I'd also say probably first inning on marketing. You've seen the support behind the show. We're getting more influencers to come into the brand, but a lot of our programs actually are going to start to kick in more in Q3, Q4 and beyond. So I'd say very, very early days on this one as well, with a lot more to come. On the third one, which is expanding our digital and our international presence, likewise here, I think we're early earnings on digital. We're very clear that's going to be a good vector of growth for us in the future, both in North America and globally. I think as we talked -- we were all together a few weeks back, we really look at digital through 3 lenses: Our own site, wholesale dot com and pure players. Our own sites, or RalphLauren.com, you heard Jane talk about the fact that we've just relaunched our platform. And so now it's about creating an amazing shopping experience for consumers. That's going to happen over the next few months, so I'd say probably first inning on that one as well. Wholesale dot com is something we're really keen to win in, so not just play, but play to win, which means growing share. We have really good partnerships across the various regions on that. A couple encouraging data points for this past quarter, we actually grew share in wholesale dot com in Europe in Q2, and we grew share in wholesale dot com in the U.S. on men's apparel and women's apparel. So we're encouraged by that. Obviously a lot more to be done, but a key vector of growth for us in the future as well. And then finally, on pure players, it's early days as well because if you look -- obviously, we have a very good partnership with Zalando in Europe and very happy with how that's playing out. We just signed up with the Tmall, JD.com and WeChat, so it's been weeks. So a lot more to be done on that front, but excited about what we can do and where we can go. On international, I mean, what's exciting on international is there's no lack of opportunity. When you look at how our business splits today, international in North America, we have significant growth potential in our international. You heard us called out China, Mainland China as our #1 priority internationally. We -- the team on the ground has done a lot of work to get the fundamentals right over the past couple of years, so now it's really about accelerating our growth. So I'd say early innings in terms of accelerating the growth. We're opening stores, we're expanding our digital footprint, we're being more -- becoming more active in terms of marketing with the Chinese consumer. And then finally, the -- our fourth initiative, which is working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. So as you've seen, I think, through the numbers, the team had done, I think, a very good job on productivity. And this is one where I can't quote innings either because this game never stops, right? Productivity is going to be something we're going to do nonstop in addition to reigniting growth. We know we have areas of cost that we can do a better job on, and everyone's really focused on being as effective and efficient as we can be across the entire business. And then on agility, which is critical to winning in today's context, I'd say early innings as well. We're putting a lot of emphasis culturally on empowerment and enablement and driving a sense of urgency, putting decisions on the clock so that we just move with pace because that's what the consumers and the retail landscape demands, if we're going to get back to winning. So overall, as you kind of summarize the game, some phases are kind of midway through the game; towards the later -- latter end of the game, assuming the game ends in 9 innings; and others, it's we're at the very beginning, which I think is quite exciting for what's possible, moving forward, for us."

Specifically, I think as we look at wholesale, the areas we're focused on there is getting the foundations healthy, right? So I mentioned earlier, the challenging our distribution, make sure that we have the right product, that we show up in the right way in department stores and that we have the right marketing that goes with it. But we do expect department stores continue to play an important role for us moving forward. I want to double-click on the wholesale dot com part because that's an important growth vector for us in the future, as I mentioned earlier. Off-price also has a role to play for us moving forward, but we actually want to deemphasize the role of off-price in our total business. We believe we've kind of gone a bit ahead of our skis in this channel. So while it has a role to play, there are consumers there that we want to appeal to. We are pulling back on off-price, and we'll continue to do that progressively over time."

And certainly, we have an opportunity, once we've rightsized wholesale, to get back to share growth. So those are sort of how we think about the total ecosystem. As I think about revenue growth following quality-of-sales initiatives, we absolutely believe that after we get through our rightsizing and quality-of-sales initiatives -- quality of sales is going to be an ongoing theme. I think it will be about balance. And -- but following the reset, that we would get back to growth. And obviously, as Patrice said, in June, we're going to come back and lay out the initiatives in more detail and give you a better road map for the timing of our financial metrics and our comeback to growth."

So if I kind of rewind the tapes a little bit, we've come through 3 phases. The early phase was through licensees, which ended up building distribution that, I think in hindsight, wasn't the right distribution for us. So when the company took over the license in 2010, a lot of that distribution was shut down, and then there was an emphasis put on luxury with the expectation that establishing the brand at the high end would be the right way to enter the market, which I think strategically, was spot on because that is the type of equity we want to build for the brand in all new markets, particularly in a market like China. But obviously, we ended up being challenged in the overall economic model of being able to support a business that was exclusively focused on luxury. So that did not play out, I think, as the way it was originally intended. So we now have the benefit of all those learnings for this third phase, where we are going to focus really on establishing Polo as the core of the business. We will obviously drive our luxury business as well to drive overall image, but the heart of the business for us in China will be Polo. We're also very clear in terms of how we want to show up relative to the ecosystem, the go-to-market ecosystem I was referring to earlier, with almost a digital-first mindsets, right? And you heard us talk about how we're now on WeChat, JD.com and Tmall. And then also opening different store format than we have historically there. So slightly smaller stores, more focused on Polo. And the early results that we're seeing are quite encouraging. We're also tailoring our marketing to the Chinese consumers. So I think you heard us share some examples of celebrities that we're working with in China. And we actually have a long list of terrific partners in that market. That's really resonating with the Chinese consumer. And then likewise on product, we're really looking at this through the lens of the local consumer. What is the local consumer excited about? What are they looking for? And how do we ensure we serve them in a very unique way? We just spent a couple of weeks in Asia, actually, Jane and I, including a lot of time in China. And what was exciting to hear from our teams in the stores is the demand there is for our higher-priced products on Polo, with consumers really looking for more elevated products and accessories. So we're actually feeling very good about where the demand is for our brand there. And you heard me talk earlier, and I'll stop there and turn it over to Jane, but -- about the average age of our consumer in China, which also gives us a lot of hope for the future. Our average age, 34 years old, right, which is really in the sweet spot of where we want to be, good 50-50 male-female mix. So I think we're well set up for success there. But as we've also called out in the remarks, we will proceed cautiously and we'll be very rigorous in the way we approach our investments moving forward in China."

As you can see in our segment reporting, just 3 years ago, we were not profitable in the Asia region and specifically in China. And the team has done tremendous work, as you've seen notably in this quarter in Asia, to really expand operating margin. So that now, China and Asia growth is accretive to overall ralph Lauren growth. And so from a profitability standpoint and a healthy base standpoint, we're on solid footing. The brand is in great shape. We've cleaned up our distribution, which is an effort that we're continuing. And we are opening doors in a way that makes sense. We've got flagships that build the brand. We've got Polo doors that are smaller-footprint, that have excellent 4-wall profitabilities that we're building out. And as you can see, we're building out a system of concessions that get us reach with our Chinese consumers and also provide a very healthy ROI. The gross margin in Asia is the highest that we have in the company. And so building and scaling in the Asia market is an opportunity to continue to expand operating margin but to really be a significant vector of growth for us. The time is certainly right, and we have the right team and we're in the right position to do so now."

I mean, internationally, we have both distribution growth opportunities as well as comp growth opportunities. So clearly, exciting potential for us moving forward. We just talked about Asia as being our least-penetrated market. And obviously, our -- the primary growth driver there will be Mainland China. Looking at Europe, right now, we're implementing an enhanced focus on quality of sales and distribution, where I think, again, we got ahead of our skis on distribution in some parts of Europe and we have to reel that back. We're also working on getting the right level of discounting in that market. So that's going to create some pressure on the number of transactions and comps in the short term. However, in the long term, we -- to your point, I think, have significant growth opportunities, both from a distribution and comp growth standpoint. Actually, so Jane and I have been traveling quite a bit. We were in Europe 10 days ago, U.K., Germany, France, where we spent a lot of time in the market understanding where we are and what the opportunities are. One interesting data point is, across Europe, we only have, I think, the precise number is 19 full-price stores across the entire region, which is an indication of the upside potential that we have there, if you just look at our store footprint. We also have very promising progress on digital. I mentioned Zalando earlier, and there are many other partners that we're working with that also indicate that there's significant upside there. And then finally as we toured a number of our wholesale partners, we know we can do a better job with our wholesale partners in Europe. So I think across all these vectors, once we've completed the work of quality of sales, which is critical, we have significant growth opportunity across the region. For example, we don't have a store, dedicated store, in Spain, right, which is a relatively sizable market. So we will get the balance right between Asia and Europe, but we certainly looking at both regions as growth vectors for us in the future."

The first one, which is going to sound pretty basic but is actually critical is really driving a more disciplined assortment, right? Having more discipline and understanding the role of the SKU that we're introducing, eliminating the unproductive styles, better balancing our offering across categories, across price points, to have good, better, best propositions across all of the key -- all the categories that matter. The second point is there's a critical timelessness to this brand, right? And we have phenomenal Icons. And I think we've all come to the conclusion that we can do more with our Icons and put greater emphasis on our Icons, and that is part of what -- the early progress we're seeing this Fall season is actually driven by what's happening with our Icons. The third area is the renewal of our [Audio Gap]. And again, this is a very important part of our business. And on this -- in this area, we are looking at fits, we're looking at styles, we're looking at materials, we're looking at colors. And you can imagine, I mean, I've been very impressed by the design team that we have in-house and have had a number of conversations with them. They're very in touch with what's going on in the market, both here and around the world, and really making sure that our proposition moving forward take that into account while also staying true to who we are, right? So we're not going to be jerked around by all the fashion trends out there in the market by -- and lose kind of the fundamental of what this brand stands for and the timelessness of it. We will be in touch with the trends while staying true to who we are, and obviously, making sure that what the offer is exciting and relevant for the consumers that we want to serve. Then you heard me talk about the limited editions, and we've been excited about the reaction to Stadium. And it was actually pretty neat to see long lines the night before outside stores, with people waiting to buy it. So we're going to continue to drive that, we're going look at partnerships moving forward as well, which I think will bring in more interest and excitement to the brand. And then the final point, which is less about trends and style, it's more about strategic choices. There are e-categories where we should be playing more actively; where we are underdeveloped; and where, I believe, we have a basis to win. So that will also be another vector of growth as we look at overall product offering."

So capital will be shifting to the China market as we build out.

In North America, what the focus in capital will be is more refurbishments: How do we refresh our store environment?

And specifically for North America, as we said, we expect that we'll see wholesale end the year in about the same range that you saw us in Q2. So we were down about 22% Q2, I expect the full year will look about similar as our cleanup continues through the third and fourth quarter. We are encouraged by what we see as progress on execution. Our underlying comp rate, as we view it, is in the mid- to high single digit. And we know what, we have product and marketing that we need to focus on, as well as the store refreshments, to change that trend as we move into FY '19. So about similar for the year to what you saw this quarter, but I think that a pretty stable underlying comp trend that we are looking to address as we look at all the vectors: Product, marketing and stores."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute on our plan to drive efficiencies and set a strong foundation for future growth. While we're certainly not where we want to be yet, we are encouraged that second quarter revenue was at the high end of our guidance and we outperformed on operating margin as our quality-of-sales initiatives overdelivered our expectations. This focus will continue through the rest of the year, and we are on track to deliver our full year targets.
Over the past several months, I've met with many of our key suppliers and customers and thousands of our employees all over the world. These interactions have reaffirmed my excitement about the opportunity for our brand globally. I am incredibly inspired by the passion and commitment of our teams and confident in their capabilities. 
I've also spent a lot of time with Ralph, and we have developed a very close and productive partnership. I'm particularly excited by some of the early progress we're making together to drive the business forward. 
Moving ahead, we are focused on reigniting quality growth while continuing to drive productivity. This balance of growth and productivity will translate into value creation for all of our stakeholders. Our key initiatives include: first, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution; second, evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; third, expanding our digital and international presence; and fourth, working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. While there's still a lot of work to be done, I'd like to take you through some of the early signs of progress across each of these initiatives. 
First, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution. In the second quarter, we continued to reduce our discount rates and increase our average unit retail, which was up 5% across the company's direct-to-consumer network. Gross margin was up 300 basis points to last year. We continue to close unproductive distribution in retail and wholesale and significantly reduced off-price shipments. 
Second, evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers. Within product, we are driving a much more disciplined assortment, focusing on our Icons, renewing our core items to make them relevant to today's consumer and developing limited editions to inject energy and excitement into our brand. The result of this work is most evident in the improving sell-out trend we're seeing in Polo with Fall seasonal product. While it is still early in the season, we are seeing increased full-price sell-through with higher AURs and gross margins versus last year in both men's and women's apparel. 
Within Polo Fall seasonal products, some of the bestsellers are our Icons and updated core items, including the varsity jacket, the American flag and polar bear sweaters, the denim trucker jacket, embellished military-inspired styles and novelty knits with color blocking. These renewed Icons are especially resonating with millennials. We're also seeing success in the denim category, with updated fits, washes, lighter weights and incorporating stretch into the majority of the overall offering. 
In addition, we're beginning to offer limited-edition products on a regular basis to create more reasons for consumers to engage with us. These launches are integrated across product, digital media and our sales channels to create a consistent experience for the consumer. 
As part of this, we launched the Stadium collection in September. The original Stadium collection was introduced to celebrate the 1992 Summer Olympics, and many pieces became iconic collector's items. We released both replicas and modern interpretations at select Ralph Lauren and third-party stores around the world. We sold out several million dollars' worth within hours. Importantly, 78% of the people who purchased Stadium at a Ralph Lauren store in North America were new consumers to the brand. 
Another example of limited edition is our monthly Polo shirt launches, including the Collegiate, Elk Ridge and Tour Jacket. Each has achieved strong full-price sell-through worldwide. We will continue limited edition series in the future. 
In marketing, we are leveraging new channels and partnerships, especially in digital and social media, that will help the brand reach and acquire new consumers. For example, I'm sure many of you saw our terrific show in September, where Ralph and the team created a truly unique experience at his garage in Bedford. We leveraged our fashion show as a media event with a specific focus on Instagram, Facebook, Tmall, WeChat, Youku and RalphLauren.com. The show generated over 1 billion social media impressions, more than double our February show, through an expanded list of global social live stream hosts and 24 hours of Instagram stories. 
We also had many celebrity dressing moments that increased our social media impact, including: Blake Lively; Shailene Woodley; Elle Fanning; Chance the Rapper; Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner, both of whom walked our September show; Brooklyn and Romeo Beckham; Li Bingbing and Yao Chen, among others; as well as the face of our new fragrance and brand ambassador, Jessica Chastain. 
In addition, in the U.S. alone, we had 3 major magazine covers over the past couple of months featuring our collection dresses. These included: Angelina Jolie on the cover of Harper's Bazaar 150th anniversary issue, Jennifer Lawrence on the cover of Vogue for its 125th September anniversary issue, and J.Lo on the cover of Vanity Fair this month. 
Our sports marketing also had a good summer. Based on an outstanding season, 24-year-old Polo golf ambassador, Justin Thomas, was voted PGA Tour Player of the Year, generating tremendous media exposure, including 520 million estimated impressions at the PGA Championship. And our sponsorship of the US Open tennis tournament featured our successful create-your-own customization initiative with on-site printers that drove significant traffic to our shops. In addition, the special edition court sneaker, worn by on-court tournament staff, was completely sold out and attracted new consumers to our brand. 
Moving on to our third initiative: Expanding our digital and international presence. We have significant growth potential in Asia, specifically in China, which represents our greatest geographic growth opportunity for the company. Over the past 2 years, we've elevated the brand in Asia and built a strong foundation for the business by improving quality of sales and overall profitability. We are now beginning to pivot to quality growth while continuing our productivity work. 
As you know, we are underrepresented in Asia, with only 13% of our business in the region. In the second quarter, constant currency revenue grew 4% in Asia and comparable store sales were up 3%. We expect this trend to continue in the balance of the year. 
A key driver of our Asia growth going forward will be Mainland China, where we have very low levels of penetration but strong brand awareness. In fiscal '17, we generated approximately $50 million of revenue on Mainland China, which represents less than 1% of our total company revenue. Based on Millward Brown Vermeer data, we know that Polo's aided brand awareness in Mainland China is 83%. This is a significantly higher figure than many of our competitors which have greater penetration than us in China. We will drive growth through both increased marketing and distribution, both online and with physical stores. 
Within marketing, we have increased our digital efforts and engagement with local influencers. We are tailoring social content to the Chinese consumer and dressing many Chinese celebrities with social followings nearing 1 billion in total. In September, we had over 12 million Chinese views of our fashion show. We're also ramping up our presence on digital platforms. And in the second quarter, we successfully launched on Tmall and JD.com and with social commerce on WeChat. On these sites, we are creating digital shop-in-shop environments with a consistent brand experience, tailored product stories and an assortment that is carefully curated by our merchants. 
On WeChat, we sold out the limited-edition Polo shirts within 48 hours. We are offering many omnichannel features to Chinese consumers, including free in-store tailoring and returns and an innovative mobile-based product authentication process using WeChat to recognize QR codes. 
Complementing this digital presence in China, the team is successfully expanding our fleet of physical stores while also improving the profitability of the portfolio. Importantly, we have a harmonized pricing architecture across channels. We've opened 15 smaller-format stores year-to-date in Mainland China, and by the end of fiscal '18, we expect to have a total of 60 stores on the Mainland. We have a much more rigorous approach to site selection, and these stores are generating strong sales productivity and returns that are accretive to our overall business. 
The average age of our customer in these stores is 34 years old, with a 50-50 male-female mix. We're seeing clear demand for our higher-priced, more fashion-forward merchandise and a higher accessories penetration rate in China compared to other geographies, which shows opportunity. These achievements provide strong proof points for our accelerated growth strategy in Mainland China. Taken together with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, our goal for Greater China is to reach almost $0.5 billion of revenue in 5 years from about $170 million in fiscal '17, driven by both comp growth and new distribution [indiscernible] in China. We will continue to act with rigor in this market and are committed to elevating the brand and delivering sustainable, profitable growth. 
In closing, we are moving in the right direction, with a clear focus on creating value for all of our stakeholders by continuing to drive productivity and reigniting quality growth. Ralph and I have the same vision for the brand and the same goal, which is to get our great company back to winning. He and I are deeply committed to evolving how our iconic brand is experienced and expressed to win over consumers. We will continue to build on our early progress by driving the 4 key initiatives I outlined: elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution; evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; expanding our digital and international presence; and working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."

Our second quarter results showed strong progress on resetting the business to a healthier base. Our quality-of-sales improvements are delivering higher AURs, lower discounts, expanded gross margins, higher",1999,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results showed strong progress on resetting the business to a healthier base. Our quality-of-sales improvements are delivering higher AURs, lower discounts, expanded gross margins, higher inventory turns and significant growth in free cash flow. 
Our performance this quarter was achieved despite meaningful impact from the tragic hurricanes that affected Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. In total, we experienced about 1 point of comp pressure in North America as a result of the hurricanes. But our results do not tell the full story, and I am incredibly proud of our teams for their swift and tireless actions to ensure that all our employees were safe, to bring relief to their communities and to reopen our stores quickly following these devastating events. 
Let me now turn to our results. Second quarter revenues declined 9% on both a reported basis and in constant currency, which was at the high end of our guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 13.4%, 100 basis points above last year on a reported basis and 70 points higher in constant currency. Gross margin in the second quarter was up 300 basis points to last year and up 290 basis points in constant currency, driven by both average unit retail increases and discount rate reductions. Consistent with previous quarters, approximately half of the increase was driven by reduced promotional activity and half by favorable geographic and channel mix. 
We also remain on track with our target expense savings for the year. Operating expenses were down 5% to last year in the second quarter, driven by rightsizing our cost structure, closing unprofitable distribution and changing product development processes through SKU optimization. This productivity allows us to fund our early growth initiatives while delivering our performance commitments for the year. 
Moving on to our segment performance, starting with North America. We continue to execute our plan to come back to profitable growth. Revenue was down 16% in the second quarter, reflecting substantial progress on quality-of-sales initiatives. Despite the challenging top line, our team was able to expand adjusted operating margin 150 basis points. 
In North America wholesale, we continue to take deliberate actions to ensure the health of our brand and to set us up for long-term success. Execution progress this quarter focused on distribution closures, brand exits, off-price reductions, receipt pullbacks and lower promotional levels. These actions accounted for approximately 70% of the 22% decline in the U.S. wholesale revenue this quarter. Our pullback in the off-price channel drove lower penetration within our North America wholesale business. This will continue through the remainder of the year.
Consumer demand and channel dynamics remained challenging in North America wholesale and contributed to comp declines estimated in the mid- to high single digits. However, our digital wholesale business continued to be a highlight and posted growth to last year.
We are addressing the weak underlying demand by evolving our product and marketing and by investing in our wholesale store environments to improve the consumer experience. As an example, as part of our Stadium launch in September, we dropped a special capsule of knitwear items with the famous P-Wing logo in select Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores, with customers lining up for the product overnight. As Patrice highlighted, early reads on Fall product performance in Polo has shown an improving trend, which is promising. 
In our directly operated e-commerce business in North America, comps were down 18% in the quarter, as expected, but gross margin expanded significantly as we continued our strategy to aggressively reduce promotional activity to both ensure price coherency across our channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience for our digital flagship consumer.
Following our decision to shift to a cloud-based e-commerce platform, our digital and IT teams moved with urgency and outstanding dedication to implement the platform switch in time for the upcoming holiday season. As a result of their work, 2 weeks ago, we went live with our new cloud-based platform for RalphLauren.com in North America. 
Now that our new infrastructure platform is in place, we will build a digital flagship experience for our customers by adding functionality and evolving the creative through the second half of this year. As the new site develops, it will help us create a more brand-enhancing and consistent experience for consumers and better insights in functionality for us.
Moving on to Europe. Revenue increased 4% on a reported basis and was relatively flat with prior year in constant currency in the second quarter. Our teams in Europe delivered adjusted operating profit growth, with margins up 350 basis points to last year and up 370 basis points in constant currency, driven by gross margin expansion. 
Wholesale revenue in Europe decreased 1% in constant currency. The negative impact of brand exits and significant reductions in off-price liquidation was partially offset by a shift in shipment timing from the first quarter that benefited the second quarter. The underlying trend of the full-price wholesale business is about flat to last year. 
In the retail channel, constant currency comps were down 6% in Europe as we continued quality-of-sales work to rebalance pricing levels across channels. While this impacted comp growth negatively in the second quarter, gross margin and AUR were both up and the discount rate was down significantly. Going forward, we will continue this focus in Europe, which will negatively impact comps. This is similar to the strategy we pursued in Asia, and they are now delivering positive comps. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue was flat to last year on a reported basis and up 4% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was up 750 basis points and up 580 basis points in constant currency. Our team is reigniting growth in the Asia region while continuing to focus on productivity. 
This was the second quarter of positive comps, which increased 3% in constant currency. Comp growth was driven by increased traffic and conversion and were achieved in the context of strong quality-of-sales initiatives. We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we upgrade our distribution network and continue our marketing initiatives to amplify the brand. 
Turning to our store fleet. We continued to improve our retail network through the closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. In the second quarter, we opened 14 stand-alone stores and 34 concessions. We closed 12 stand-alone stores and 37 concessions, ending this quarter with 469 stand-alone stores and 622 concessions on a global basis. At year-end, we expect our stand-alone count to be up slightly to last year and our concession network to have a net increase of 20 locations, primarily in Asia.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet is significantly stronger than last year and is a reflection of the operational progress we are making. At the end of the second quarter, inventory declined 26% to $865 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by prior year restructuring actions and more effective buying processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand.
We ended the second quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and short- and long-term investments, up from $1.1 billion at the end of last year's second quarter. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $590 million versus $692 million last year. We generated $362 million of free cash flow in the second quarter, up from $67 million in the prior year period.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the third quarter of fiscal '18. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. 
We are maintaining our constant currency revenue guidance for fiscal '18 and raising the low end of our operating margin guidance. 
We continue to expect revenues to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half of the decline, with quality-of-sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder, partially offset by new distribution and product and marketing initiatives.
Foreign currency is now expected to have approximately 80 basis points of benefit to revenue growth in fiscal 2018 versus previous guidance of minimal impact, given the recent movements in foreign exchange rates. 
Based on performance in the first half and targeted investments in the fourth quarter, we now expect operating margin for fiscal '18 to be 9.5% to 10.5% in constant currency, up from our previous guidance of 9% to 10.5%. Foreign currency is now expected to have minimal impact on operating margin for fiscal '18 versus previous guidance of 40 to 50 basis points of pressure. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be down 6% to 8% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to have approximately 160 to 170 basis points of benefit to revenue growth. 
Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be down 50 to 70 basis points in constant currency. While we expect gross margin to continue to expand into the third quarter, SG&A rate will create some pressure as we start to lap last year's expense reductions and invest in growth initiatives around marketing, product and stores. Foreign currency is estimated to benefit operating margin by approximately 10 to 20 basis points in the third quarter. 
Looking towards the fourth quarter, revenue will continue to be pressured for 2 reasons: First, we expect a shift in wholesale shipments that benefit Q3 and pressure Q4; second, a large portion of the March quarter is driven by clearance sales post-holiday. To support our quality-of-sales initiatives, we have planned for less clearance inventory, which will limit the clearance sales volumes this year year-over-year. This will offset some of the benefits from the Easter shift in Q4.
Also for the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A expenses to grow versus last year as we accelerate our marketing initiatives and grow our marketing investments double digits in the second half. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting the company up to return to growth.
In terms of restructuring charges, we continue to expect approximately $200 million for the year. In the second quarter, we recognized $30 million of restructuring and other charges. 
We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '18 to be approximately 25% and for the third quarter to be approximately 23%.
Let me finish by reviewing our priorities for cash and capital structure. In times of dynamic change, a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to the capital markets. 
Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and lay the foundation for future profitable growth. Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases. We are not planning share repurchases for fiscal '18. We make this determination based on the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and with consideration for the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal '18 are estimated at $225 million, down from the previous guidance of $300 million. We want to shift capital investments behind consumer-facing initiatives that have a demonstrated proof of concept and healthy rate of return. 
In closing, we continue to make strong progress on our operational efficiencies. We are elevating our brand and have strengthened our balance sheet and improved our cash flow so that we have the resources to fuel future profitable growth. This, combined with Ralph's enduring vision and the commitment of our teams around the world, puts us in a strong position to drive value for all our stakeholders. 
With that, I'd like to open it up for your questions."

First, elevating the brand through quality of sales and distribution. I think as you've heard, we've made very good progress on improving the quality of our distribution, shutting down stores, exiting brands like Denim",956,"Matt, so let's take them one by one. First, elevating the brand through quality of sales and distribution. I think as you've heard, we've made very good progress on improving the quality of our distribution, shutting down stores, exiting brands like Denim & Supply, pulling back in wholesale, both in terms of points of distribution, you know we're down 20 to 25 percent points of distribution in department stores, and also, as Jane just mentioned, significantly reducing shipments to the off-price channel's. So if we use a baseball analogy, which is very topical, this morning, I'd say probably seventh inning when it comes to quality of distribution. On the progress for quality of sales, I'd say on this one, we're making good progress. You've seen us reduce the discounts, and that's very visible through the 5% increase in AUR this past quarter. I struggle to provide an inning on this one because this is a game that never stops, right? We want to continuously reduce our level of discounting and improve our quality of sales. So that's on the first one. On the second one, evolving product and marketing. I'd say early days on product, so probably the first inning. We're beginning to see the benefits of the work that started many months ago starting to appear in store now. You heard some of the examples that we quoted. I think what we're seeing is a more disciplined assortment. We're seeing fewer SKUs. We're seeing the beginning of our limited editions. So very -- again, I think probably first inning there. I'd also say probably first inning on marketing. You've seen the support behind the show. We're getting more influencers to come into the brand, but a lot of our programs actually are going to start to kick in more in Q3, Q4 and beyond. So I'd say very, very early days on this one as well, with a lot more to come. On the third one, which is expanding our digital and our international presence, likewise here, I think we're early earnings on digital. We're very clear that's going to be a good vector of growth for us in the future, both in North America and globally. I think as we talked -- we were all together a few weeks back, we really look at digital through 3 lenses: Our own site, wholesale dot com and pure players. Our own sites, or RalphLauren.com, you heard Jane talk about the fact that we've just relaunched our platform. And so now it's about creating an amazing shopping experience for consumers. That's going to happen over the next few months, so I'd say probably first inning on that one as well. Wholesale dot com is something we're really keen to win in, so not just play, but play to win, which means growing share, and we have really good partnerships across the various regions on that. A couple encouraging data points for this past quarter, we actually grew share in wholesale dot com in Europe in Q2, and we grew share in wholesale dot com in the U.S. on men's apparel and women's apparel. So we're encouraged by that. Obviously a lot more to be done, but a key vector of growth for us in the future as well. And then finally, on pure players, it's early days as well, because if you look, obviously, we have a very good partnership with Zalando in Europe and very happy with how that's playing out. We just signed up with the Tmall, JD.com and WeChat, so it's been weeks. So a lot more to be done on that front, but excited about what we can do and where we can go. On international, I mean, what's exciting on international is there's no lack of opportunity. When you look at how our business splits today, international in North America, we have significant growth potential in our international. You heard us call out China, Mainland China as our #1 priority internationally. We -- the team on the ground has done a lot of work to get the fundamentals right over the past couple years, so now it's really about accelerating our growth. So I'd say early innings in terms of accelerating the growth. We're opening stores, we're expanding our digital footprint, we're being more -- becoming more active in terms of marketing with the Chinese consumer. And then finally, the -- our fourth initiative, which is working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. So as you've seen, I think, through the numbers, the team has done, I think, a very good job on productivity. And this is one where I can't quote innings either, because this game never stops, right? Productivity is going to be something we're going to do nonstop in addition to reigniting growth. We know we have areas of cost that we can do a better job on, and everyone's really focused on being as effective and efficient as we can be across the entire business. And then on agility, which is critical to win in today's context, I'd say early innings as well. We're putting a lot of emphasis culturally on empowerment and enablement and driving a sense of urgency, putting decisions on the clock so that we just move with pace, because that's what the consumers and the retail landscape demands if we're going to get back to winning. So overall, as you kind of summarize the game, some phases are kind of midway through the game; towards the later -- latter end of the game, assuming the game ends in 9 innings; and others, it's -- we're at the very beginning, which I think is quite exciting for what's possible, moving forward, for us."

Maybe Patrice can talk about how he envisions maybe the North America channel mix, particularly maybe in wholesale. What do you think the right mix of the department stores versus off-price or digital wholesale should look like over the next couple of years? And then as we think about revenue growth maybe in the next year or 2, should we be thinking about that stabilization next year? Is there a chance to grow once we get beyond sort of this pullback in distribution in quality of sales?"

So we really look at the whole ecosystem ranging -- or go-to-market ecosystem, ranging from flagships all the way to off-price. And all the channels have a role to play for us in the future, obviously, including wholesale. Specifically, I think as we look at wholesale, the areas we're focused on there is getting the foundations healthy, right? So I mentioned earlier the challenging our distribution, make sure that we have the right product, that we show up in the right way in department stores and that we have the right marketing that goes with it. But we do expect department stores to continue to play an important role for us moving forward. I want to double-click on the wholesale dot com part because that's an important growth vector for us in the future, as I mentioned earlier. Off-price also has a role to play for us moving forward, but we actually want to deemphasize the role of off-price in our total business. We believe we've kind of gotten a bit ahead of our skis in this channel. So while it has a role to play, there are consumers there that we want to appeal to. We are pulling back on off-price, and we'll continue to do that progressively over time."

And certainly, we have an opportunity, once we've rightsized wholesale, to get back to share growth. So, those are sort of how we think about the total ecosystem. As I think about revenue growth following quality-of-sales initiatives, we absolutely believe that after we get through our rightsizing and quality-of-sales initiatives -- quality of sales is going to be an ongoing theme. I think it will be about balance. And -- but following the reset, that we would get back to growth.

So if I kind of rewind the tapes a little bit, we've come through 3 phases. The early phase was through licensees, which ended up building distribution that, I think in hindsight, wasn't the right distribution for us. So when the company took over the license in 2010, a lot of that distribution was shut down, and then there was an emphasis put on luxury with the expectation that establishing the brand at the high end would be the right way to enter the market, which I think strategically, was spot on because that is the type of equity we want to build for the brand in all new markets, particularly in a market like China. But obviously, we ended up being challenged in the overall economic model of being able to support a business that was exclusively focused on luxury. So, that did not play out, I think, as the way it was originally intended. So we now have the benefit of all those learnings for this third phase, where we are going to focus really on establishing Polo as the core of the business. We will obviously drive our luxury business as well to drive overall image, but the heart of the business for us in China will be Polo. We're also very clear in terms of how we want to show up relative to the ecosystem, the go-to-market ecosystem I was referring to earlier, with almost a digital-first mindset, right? And you heard us talk about how we're now on WeChat, JD.com and Tmall. And then also opening different store formats than we have historically there. So slightly smaller stores, more focused on Polo, and the early results that we're seeing are quite encouraging. We're also tailoring our marketing to the Chinese consumers. So I think you heard us share some examples of celebrities that we're working with in China. And we actually have a long list of terrific partners in that market. That's really resonating with the Chinese consumer. And then likewise on product, we're really looking at this through the lens of the local consumer. What is the local consumer excited about? What are they looking for? And how do we ensure we serve them in a very unique way? We just spent a couple of weeks in Asia, actually, Jane and I, including a lot of time in China. And what was exciting to hear from our teams in the stores is the demand there is for our higher-priced products on Polo, with consumers really looking for more elevated products and accessories. So, we're actually feeling very good about where the demand is for our brand there. And you heard me talk earlier, and I'll stop there and turn it over to Jane, but -- about the average age of our consumer in China, which also gives us a lot of hope for the future. Our average age, 34 years old, right, which is really in the sweet spot of where we want to be, good 50-50 male-female mix. So I think we're well set up for success there. But as we've also called out in the remarks, we will proceed cautiously and we'll be very rigorous in the way we approach our investments moving forward in China."

As you can see in our segment reporting, just 3 years ago, we were not profitable in the Asia region and specifically in China. And the team has done tremendous work, as you've seen notably in this quarter in Asia, to really expand operating margin. So that now, China and Asia growth is accretive to overall Ralph Lauren growth. And so from a profitability standpoint and a healthy base standpoint, we're on solid footing. The brand is in great shape. We've cleaned up our distribution, which is an effort that we're continuing. And we are opening doors in a way that makes sense. We've got flagships that build the brand. We've got Polo doors that are smaller footprint, that have excellent 4-wall profitabilities that we're building out. And as you can see, we're building out a system of concessions that get us reach with our Chinese consumers and also provide a very healthy ROI. The gross margin in Asia is the highest that we have in the company. And so, building and scaling in the Asia market is an opportunity to continue to expand operating margin but to really be a significant vector of growth for us. The time is certainly right, and we have the right team and we're in the right position to do so now."

I mean, internationally, we have both distribution growth opportunities as well as comp growth opportunities. So clearly, exciting potential for us moving forward. We just talked about Asia as being our least-penetrated market. And obviously, our -- the primary growth driver there will be Mainland China. Looking at Europe, right now, we're implementing an enhanced focus on quality of sales and distribution, where I think, again, we got ahead of our skis on distribution in some parts of Europe and we have to reel that back. We're also working on getting the right level of discounting in that market. So that's going to create some pressure on the number of transactions and comps in the short term. However, in the long term, we -- to your point, I think, have significant growth opportunities, both from a distribution and comp growth standpoint. Actually, so Jane and I have been traveling quite a bit. We were in Europe 10 days ago, the U.K., Germany, France, where we spent a lot of time in the market understanding where we are and what the opportunities are. One interesting data point is, across Europe, we only have, I think the precise number is 19 full-price stores across the entire region, which is an indication of the upside potential that we have there, if you just look at our store footprint. We also have very promising progress on digital. I mentioned Zalando earlier, and there are many other partners that we're working with that also indicate that there's significant upside there. And then finally as we toured a number of our wholesale partners, we know we can do a better job with our wholesale partners in Europe. So I think across all these vectors, once we've completed the work of quality of sales, which is critical, we have significant growth opportunity across the region. For example, we don't have a store, dedicated store, in Spain, right, which is a relatively sizable market. So we will get the balance right between Asia and Europe, but we're certainly looking at both regions as growth vectors for us in the future."

The first one, which is going to sound pretty basic but is actually critical, is really driving a more disciplined assortment, right? Having more discipline and understanding the role of the SKU that we're introducing, eliminating the unproductive styles, better balancing our offering across categories, across price points to have good, better, best propositions across all of the key -- all the categories that matter. The second point is there's a critical timelessness to this brand, right? And we have phenomenal Icons. And I think we've all come to the conclusion that we can do more with our Icons and put greater emphasis on our Icons, and that is part of what -- the early progress we're seeing this Fall season is actually driven by what's happening with our Icons. The third area is the renewal of our [Audio Gap]. And again, this is in very important parts of our business. And on this -- in this area, we are looking at fits, we're looking at styles, we're looking at materials, we're looking at colors. And you can imagine, I mean, I've been very impressed by the design team that we have in-house and have had a number of conversations with them. They're very in touch with what's going on in the market, both here and around the world, and really making sure that our proposition's moving forward take that into account while also staying true to who we are, right? So we're not going to be jerked around by all the fashion trends out there in the market by -- and lose kind of the fundamental of what this brand stands for and the timelessness of it. We will be in touch with the trends while staying true to who we are and, obviously, making sure that what the offer is exciting and relevant for the consumers that we want to serve. Then you heard me talk about the limited editions, and we've been excited about the reaction to Stadium. And it was actually pretty neat to see long lines the night before outside of the stores, with people waiting to buy it. So we're going to continue to drive that, we're going look at partnerships moving forward as well, which I think will bring in more interest and excitement to the brand. And then the final point, which is less about trends and style, it's more about strategic choices. There are e-categories where we should be playing more actively; where we are underdeveloped; and where, I believe, we have a basis to win. So that will also be another vector of growth as we look at overall product offering."

Also as we've called out in our store profile, most of the new doors that are being opened are being opened in Asia, and most of the concessions that we're opening this year will be opened in Asia. So, capital will be shifting to the China market as we build out. You'll also see capital going into Europe as we realize the opportunity for some greater store penetration in Europe, as well as some marketing. In North America, what the focus in capital will be is more refurbishments: How do we refresh our store environment? We're fully penetrated, although there'll be some close a store here, open one there. But really, our opportunity is to show up really well in North America and give some of our stores the love that they deserve in terms of refurbishment.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute on our plan to drive efficiencies and set a strong foundation for future growth. While we're certainly not where we want to be yet, we are encouraged that second quarter revenue was at the high end of our guidance and we outperformed on operating margin as our quality-of-sales initiatives overdelivered our expectations. This focus will continue through the rest of the year, and we are on track to deliver our full year targets.
Over the past several months, I've met with many of our key suppliers and customers and thousands of our employees all over the world. These interactions have reaffirmed my excitement about the opportunity for our brand globally. I am incredibly inspired by the passion and commitment of our teams and confident in their capabilities. 
I've also spent a lot of time with Ralph, and we have developed a very close and productive partnership. I'm particularly excited by some of the early progress we're making together to drive the business forward. 
Moving ahead, we are focused on reigniting quality growth while continuing to drive productivity. This balance of growth and productivity will translate into value creation for all of our stakeholders. Our key initiatives include: first, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution; second, evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; third, expanding our digital and international presence; and fourth, working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. While there's still a lot of work to be done, I'd like to take you through some of the early signs of progress across each of these initiatives. 
First, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution. In the second quarter, we continued to reduce our discount rates and increase our average unit retail, which was up 5% across the company's direct-to-consumer network. Gross margin was up 300 basis points to last year. We continue to close unproductive distribution in retail and wholesale and significantly reduced off-price shipments. 
Second, evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers. Within product, we are driving a much more disciplined assortment, focusing on our Icons, renewing our core items to make them relevant to today's consumer and developing limited editions to inject energy and excitement into our brand. The result of this work is most evident in the improving sell-out trend we're seeing in Polo with Fall seasonal product. While it is still early in the season, we are seeing increased full-price sell-through with higher AURs and gross margins versus last year in both men's and women's apparel. 
Within Polo Fall seasonal products, some of the bestsellers are our Icons and updated core items, including the varsity jacket, the American flag and polar bear sweaters, the denim trucker jacket, embellished military-inspired styles and novelty knits with color blocking. These renewed Icons are especially resonating with millennials. We're also seeing success in the denim category, with updated fits, washes, lighter weights and incorporating stretch into the majority of the overall offering. 
In addition, we're beginning to offer limited-edition products on a regular basis to create more reasons for consumers to engage with us. These launches are integrated across product, digital media and our sales channels to create a consistent experience for the consumer. 
As part of this, we launched the Stadium collection in September. The original Stadium collection was introduced to celebrate the 1992 Summer Olympics, and many pieces became iconic collector's items. We released both replicas and modern interpretations at select Ralph Lauren and third-party stores around the world. We sold out several million dollars' worth within hours. Importantly, 78% of the people who purchased Stadium at a Ralph Lauren store in North America were new consumers to the brand. 
Another example of limited edition is our monthly Polo shirt launches, including the Collegiate, Elk Ridge and Tour Jacket. Each has achieved strong full-price sell-through worldwide. We will continue limited edition series in the future. 
In marketing, we are leveraging new channels and partnerships, especially in digital and social media, that will help the brand reach and acquire new consumers. For example, I'm sure many of you saw our terrific show in September, where Ralph and the team created a truly unique experience at his garage in Bedford. We leveraged our fashion show as a media event with a specific focus on Instagram, Facebook, Tmall, WeChat, Youku and RalphLauren.com. The show generated over 1 billion social media impressions, more than double our February show, through an expanded list of global social live stream hosts and 24 hours of Instagram stories. 
We also had many celebrity dressing moments that increased our social media impact, including: Blake Lively; Shailene Woodley; Elle Fanning; Chance the Rapper; Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner, both of whom walked our September show; Brooklyn and Romeo Beckham; Li Bingbing and Yao Chen, among others; as well as the face of our new fragrance and brand ambassador, Jessica Chastain. 
In addition, in the U.S. alone, we had 3 major magazine covers over the past couple of months featuring our collection dresses. These included: Angelina Jolie on the cover of Harper's Bazaar 150th anniversary issue, Jennifer Lawrence on the cover of Vogue for its 125th September anniversary issue, and J.Lo on the cover of Vanity Fair this month. 
Our sports marketing also had a good summer. Based on an outstanding season, 24-year-old Polo golf ambassador, Justin Thomas, was voted PGA Tour Player of the Year, generating tremendous media exposure, including 520 million estimated impressions at the PGA Championship. And our sponsorship of the US Open tennis tournament featured our successful create-your-own customization initiative with on-site printers that drove significant traffic to our shops. In addition, the special edition court sneaker, worn by on-court tournament staff, was completely sold out and attracted new consumers to our brand. 
Moving on to our third initiative: Expanding our digital and international presence. We have significant growth potential in Asia, specifically in China, which represents our greatest geographic growth opportunity for the company. Over the past 2 years, we've elevated the brand in Asia and built a strong foundation for the business by improving quality of sales and overall profitability. We are now beginning to pivot to quality growth while continuing our productivity work. 
As you know, we are underrepresented in Asia, with only 13% of our business in the region. In the second quarter, constant currency revenue grew 4% in Asia and comparable store sales were up 3%. We expect this trend to continue in the balance of the year. 
A key driver of our Asia growth going forward will be Mainland China, where we have very low levels of penetration but strong brand awareness. In fiscal '17, we generated approximately $50 million of revenue on Mainland China, which represents less than 1% of our total company revenue. Based on Millward Brown Vermeer data, we know that Polo's aided brand awareness in Mainland China is 83%. This is a significantly higher figure than many of our competitors which have greater penetration than us in China. We will drive growth through both increased marketing and distribution, both online and with physical stores. 
Within marketing, we have increased our digital efforts and engagement with local influencers. We are tailoring social content to the Chinese consumer and dressing many Chinese celebrities with social followings nearing 1 billion in total. In September, we had over 12 million Chinese views of our fashion show. We're also ramping up our presence on digital platforms. And in the second quarter, we successfully launched on Tmall and JD.com and with social commerce on WeChat. On these sites, we are creating digital shop-in-shop environments with a consistent brand experience, tailored product stories and an assortment that is carefully curated by our merchants. 
On WeChat, we sold out the limited-edition Polo shirts within 48 hours. We are offering many omnichannel features to Chinese consumers, including free in-store tailoring and returns and an innovative mobile-based product authentication process using WeChat to recognize QR codes. 
Complementing this digital presence in China, the team is successfully expanding our fleet of physical stores while also improving the profitability of the portfolio. Importantly, we have a harmonized pricing architecture across channels. We've opened 15 smaller-format stores year-to-date in Mainland China, and by the end of fiscal '18, we expect to have a total of 60 stores on the Mainland. We have a much more rigorous approach to site selection, and these stores are generating strong sales productivity and returns that are accretive to our overall business. 
The average age of our customer in these stores is 34 years old, with a 50-50 male-female mix. We're seeing clear demand for our higher-priced, more fashion-forward merchandise and a higher accessories penetration rate in China compared to other geographies, which shows opportunity. These achievements provide strong proof points for our accelerated growth strategy in Mainland China. Taken together with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, our goal for Greater China is to reach almost $0.5 billion of revenue in 5 years from about $170 million in fiscal '17, driven by both comp growth and new distribution [indiscernible] in China. We will continue to act with rigor in this market and are committed to elevating the brand and delivering sustainable, profitable growth. 
In closing, we are moving in the right direction, with a clear focus on creating value for all of our stakeholders by continuing to drive productivity and reigniting quality growth. Ralph and I have the same vision for the brand and the same goal, which is to get our great company back to winning. He and I are deeply committed to evolving how our iconic brand is experienced and expressed to win over consumers. We will continue to build on our early progress by driving the 4 key initiatives I outlined: elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution; evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; expanding our digital and international presence; and working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."
362220,540472951,1332856,"Ralph Lauren Corporation, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Ralph Lauren Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results showed strong progress on resetting the business to a healthier base. Our quality-of-sales improvements are delivering higher AURs, lower discounts, expanded gross margins, higher",1999,"Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results showed strong progress on resetting the business to a healthier base. Our quality-of-sales improvements are delivering higher AURs, lower discounts, expanded gross margins, higher inventory turns and significant growth in free cash flow. 
Our performance this quarter was achieved despite meaningful impact from the tragic hurricanes that affected Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. In total, we experienced about 1 point of comp pressure in North America as a result of the hurricanes. But our results do not tell the full story, and I am incredibly proud of our teams for their swift and tireless actions to ensure that all our employees were safe, to bring relief to their communities and to reopen our stores quickly following these devastating events. 
Let me now turn to our results. Second quarter revenues declined 9% on both a reported basis and in constant currency, which was at the high end of our guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 13.4%, 100 basis points above last year on a reported basis and 70 points higher in constant currency. Gross margin in the second quarter was up 300 basis points to last year and up 290 basis points in constant currency, driven by both average unit retail increases and discount rate reductions. Consistent with previous quarters, approximately half of the increase was driven by reduced promotional activity and half by favorable geographic and channel mix. 
We also remain on track with our target expense savings for the year. Operating expenses were down 5% to last year in the second quarter, driven by rightsizing our cost structure, closing unprofitable distribution and changing product development processes through SKU optimization. This productivity allows us to fund our early growth initiatives while delivering our performance commitments for the year. 
Moving on to our segment performance, starting with North America. We continue to execute our plan to come back to profitable growth. Revenue was down 16% in the second quarter, reflecting substantial progress on quality-of-sales initiatives. Despite the challenging top line, our team was able to expand adjusted operating margin 150 basis points. 
In North America wholesale, we continue to take deliberate actions to ensure the health of our brand and to set us up for long-term success. Execution progress this quarter focused on distribution closures, brand exits, off-price reductions, receipt pullbacks and lower promotional levels. These actions accounted for approximately 70% of the 22% decline in the U.S. wholesale revenue this quarter. Our pullback in the off-price channel drove lower penetration within our North America wholesale business. This will continue through the remainder of the year.
Consumer demand and channel dynamics remained challenging in North America wholesale and contributed to comp declines estimated in the mid- to high single digits. However, our digital wholesale business continued to be a highlight and posted growth to last year.
We are addressing the weak underlying demand by evolving our product and marketing and by investing in our wholesale store environments to improve the consumer experience. As an example, as part of our Stadium launch in September, we dropped a special capsule of knitwear items with the famous P-Wing logo in select Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores, with customers lining up for the product overnight. As Patrice highlighted, early reads on Fall product performance in Polo has shown an improving trend, which is promising. 
In our directly operated e-commerce business in North America, comps were down 18% in the quarter, as expected, but gross margin expanded significantly as we continued our strategy to aggressively reduce promotional activity to both ensure price coherency across our channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience for our digital flagship consumer.
Following our decision to shift to a cloud-based e-commerce platform, our digital and IT teams moved with urgency and outstanding dedication to implement the platform switch in time for the upcoming holiday season. As a result of their work, 2 weeks ago, we went live with our new cloud-based platform for RalphLauren.com in North America. 
Now that our new infrastructure platform is in place, we will build a digital flagship experience for our customers by adding functionality and evolving the creative through the second half of this year. As the new site develops, it will help us create a more brand-enhancing and consistent experience for consumers and better insights in functionality for us.
Moving on to Europe. Revenue increased 4% on a reported basis and was relatively flat with prior year in constant currency in the second quarter. Our teams in Europe delivered adjusted operating profit growth, with margins up 350 basis points to last year and up 370 basis points in constant currency, driven by gross margin expansion. 
Wholesale revenue in Europe decreased 1% in constant currency. The negative impact of brand exits and significant reductions in off-price liquidation was partially offset by a shift in shipment timing from the first quarter that benefited the second quarter. The underlying trend of the full-price wholesale business is about flat to last year. 
In the retail channel, constant currency comps were down 6% in Europe as we continued quality-of-sales work to rebalance pricing levels across channels. While this impacted comp growth negatively in the second quarter, gross margin and AUR were both up and the discount rate was down significantly. Going forward, we will continue this focus in Europe, which will negatively impact comps. This is similar to the strategy we pursued in Asia, and they are now delivering positive comps. 
Turning to Asia. Revenue was flat to last year on a reported basis and up 4% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was up 750 basis points and up 580 basis points in constant currency. Our team is reigniting growth in the Asia region while continuing to focus on productivity. 
This was the second quarter of positive comps, which increased 3% in constant currency. Comp growth was driven by increased traffic and conversion and were achieved in the context of strong quality-of-sales initiatives. We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we upgrade our distribution network and continue our marketing initiatives to amplify the brand. 
Turning to our store fleet. We continued to improve our retail network through the closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. In the second quarter, we opened 14 stand-alone stores and 34 concessions. We closed 12 stand-alone stores and 37 concessions, ending this quarter with 469 stand-alone stores and 622 concessions on a global basis. At year-end, we expect our stand-alone count to be up slightly to last year and our concession network to have a net increase of 20 locations, primarily in Asia.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet is significantly stronger than last year and is a reflection of the operational progress we are making. At the end of the second quarter, inventory declined 26% to $865 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by prior year restructuring actions and more effective buying processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand.
We ended the second quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and short- and long-term investments, up from $1.1 billion at the end of last year's second quarter. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $590 million versus $692 million last year. We generated $362 million of free cash flow in the second quarter, up from $67 million in the prior year period.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the third quarter of fiscal '18. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. 
We are maintaining our constant currency revenue guidance for fiscal '18 and raising the low end of our operating margin guidance. 
We continue to expect revenues to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half of the decline, with quality-of-sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder, partially offset by new distribution and product and marketing initiatives.
Foreign currency is now expected to have approximately 80 basis points of benefit to revenue growth in fiscal 2018 versus previous guidance of minimal impact, given the recent movements in foreign exchange rates. 
Based on performance in the first half and targeted investments in the fourth quarter, we now expect operating margin for fiscal '18 to be 9.5% to 10.5% in constant currency, up from our previous guidance of 9% to 10.5%. Foreign currency is now expected to have minimal impact on operating margin for fiscal '18 versus previous guidance of 40 to 50 basis points of pressure. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be down 6% to 8% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to have approximately 160 to 170 basis points of benefit to revenue growth. 
Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be down 50 to 70 basis points in constant currency. While we expect gross margin to continue to expand into the third quarter, SG&A rate will create some pressure as we start to lap last year's expense reductions and invest in growth initiatives around marketing, product and stores. Foreign currency is estimated to benefit operating margin by approximately 10 to 20 basis points in the third quarter. 
Looking towards the fourth quarter, revenue will continue to be pressured for 2 reasons: First, we expect a shift in wholesale shipments that benefit Q3 and pressure Q4; second, a large portion of the March quarter is driven by clearance sales post-holiday. To support our quality-of-sales initiatives, we have planned for less clearance inventory, which will limit the clearance sales volumes this year year-over-year. This will offset some of the benefits from the Easter shift in Q4.
Also for the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A expenses to grow versus last year as we accelerate our marketing initiatives and grow our marketing investments double digits in the second half. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting the company up to return to growth.
In terms of restructuring charges, we continue to expect approximately $200 million for the year. In the second quarter, we recognized $30 million of restructuring and other charges. 
We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '18 to be approximately 25% and for the third quarter to be approximately 23%.
Let me finish by reviewing our priorities for cash and capital structure. In times of dynamic change, a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to the capital markets. 
Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and lay the foundation for future profitable growth. Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases. We are not planning share repurchases for fiscal '18. We make this determination based on the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and with consideration for the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. 
Capital expenditures for fiscal '18 are estimated at $225 million, down from the previous guidance of $300 million. We want to shift capital investments behind consumer-facing initiatives that have a demonstrated proof of concept and healthy rate of return. 
In closing, we continue to make strong progress on our operational efficiencies. We are elevating our brand and have strengthened our balance sheet and improved our cash flow so that we have the resources to fuel future profitable growth. This, combined with Ralph's enduring vision and the commitment of our teams around the world, puts us in a strong position to drive value for all our stakeholders. 
With that, I'd like to open it up for your questions."

First, elevating the brand through quality of sales and distribution. I think as you've heard, we've made very good progress on improving the quality of our distribution, shutting down stores, exiting brands like Denim",956,"Matt, so let's take them one by one. First, elevating the brand through quality of sales and distribution. I think as you've heard, we've made very good progress on improving the quality of our distribution, shutting down stores, exiting brands like Denim & Supply, pulling back in wholesale, both in terms of points of distribution, you know we're down 20 to 25 percent points of distribution in department stores, and also, as Jane just mentioned, significantly reducing shipments to the off-price channel's. So if we use a baseball analogy, which is very topical, this morning, I'd say probably seventh inning when it comes to quality of distribution. On the progress for quality of sales, I'd say on this one, we're making good progress. You've seen us reduce the discounts, and that's very visible through the 5% increase in AUR this past quarter. I struggle to provide an inning on this one because this is a game that never stops, right? We want to continuously reduce our level of discounting and improve our quality of sales. So that's on the first one. 
On the second one, evolving product and marketing. I'd say early days on product, so probably the first inning. We're beginning to see the benefits of the work that started many months ago starting to appear in store now. You heard some of the examples that we quoted. I think what we're seeing is a more disciplined assortment. We're seeing fewer SKUs. We're seeing the beginning of our limited editions. So very -- again, I think probably first inning there. I'd also say probably first inning on marketing. You've seen the support behind the show. We're getting more influencers to come into the brand, but a lot of our programs actually are going to start to kick in more in Q3, Q4 and beyond. So I'd say very, very early days on this one as well, with a lot more to come. On the third one, which is expanding our digital and our international presence, likewise here, I think we're early earnings on digital. We're very clear that's going to be a good vector of growth for us in the future, both in North America and globally. I think as we talked -- we were all together a few weeks back, we really look at digital through 3 lenses: Our own site, wholesale dot com and pure players. 
Our own sites, or RalphLauren.com, you heard Jane talk about the fact that we've just relaunched our platform. And so now it's about creating an amazing shopping experience for consumers. That's going to happen over the next few months, so I'd say probably first inning on that one as well. Wholesale dot com is something we're really keen to win in, so not just play, but play to win, which means growing share, and we have really good partnerships across the various regions on that. A couple encouraging data points for this past quarter, we actually grew share in wholesale dot com in Europe in Q2, and we grew share in wholesale dot com in the U.S. on men's apparel and women's apparel. So we're encouraged by that. Obviously a lot more to be done, but a key vector of growth for us in the future as well. And then finally, on pure players, it's early days as well, because if you look, obviously, we have a very good partnership with Zalando in Europe and very happy with how that's playing out. We just signed up with the Tmall, JD.com and WeChat, so it's been weeks. So a lot more to be done on that front, but excited about what we can do and where we can go. On international, I mean, what's exciting on international is there's no lack of opportunity. 
When you look at how our business splits today, international in North America, we have significant growth potential in our international. You heard us call out China, Mainland China as our #1 priority internationally. We -- the team on the ground has done a lot of work to get the fundamentals right over the past couple years, so now it's really about accelerating our growth. So I'd say early innings in terms of accelerating the growth. We're opening stores, we're expanding our digital footprint, we're being more -- becoming more active in terms of marketing with the Chinese consumer. And then finally, the -- our fourth initiative, which is working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. So as you've seen, I think, through the numbers, the team has done, I think, a very good job on productivity. And this is one where I can't quote innings either, because this game never stops, right? Productivity is going to be something we're going to do nonstop in addition to reigniting growth. We know we have areas of cost that we can do a better job on, and everyone's really focused on being as effective and efficient as we can be across the entire business. And then on agility, which is critical to win in today's context, I'd say early innings as well. We're putting a lot of emphasis culturally on empowerment and enablement and driving a sense of urgency, putting decisions on the clock so that we just move with pace, because that's what the consumers and the retail landscape demands if we're going to get back to winning. So overall, as you kind of summarize the game, some phases are kind of midway through the game; towards the later -- latter end of the game, assuming the game ends in 9 innings; and others, it's -- we're at the very beginning, which I think is quite exciting for what's possible, moving forward, for us."

What do you think the right mix of the department stores versus off-price or digital wholesale should look like over the next couple of years?

So we really look at the whole ecosystem ranging -- or go-to-market ecosystem, ranging from flagships all the way to off-price. And all the channels have a role to play for us in the future, obviously, including wholesale. Specifically, I think as we look at wholesale, the areas we're focused on there is getting the foundations healthy, right? So I mentioned earlier the challenging our distribution, make sure that we have the right product, that we show up in the right way in department stores and that we have the right marketing that goes with it. But we do expect department stores to continue to play an important role for us moving forward. I want to double-click on the wholesale dot com part because that's an important growth vector for us in the future, as I mentioned earlier. Off-price also has a role to play for us moving forward, but we actually want to deemphasize the role of off-price in our total business. We believe we've kind of gotten a bit ahead of our skis in this channel. So while it has a role to play, there are consumers there that we want to appeal to. We are pulling back on off-price, and we'll continue to do that progressively over time."

I think it will be about balance. And -- but following the reset, that we would get back to growth.

So if I kind of rewind the tapes a little bit, we've come through 3 phases. The early phase was through licensees, which ended up building distribution that, I think in hindsight, wasn't the right distribution for us. So when the company took over the license in 2010, a lot of that distribution was shut down, and then there was an emphasis put on luxury with the expectation that establishing the brand at the high end would be the right way to enter the market, which I think strategically, was spot on because that is the type of equity we want to build for the brand in all new markets, particularly in a market like China. But obviously, we ended up being challenged in the overall economic model of being able to support a business that was exclusively focused on luxury. So, that did not play out, I think, as the way it was originally intended. So we now have the benefit of all those learnings for this third phase, where we are going to focus really on establishing Polo as the core of the business. We will obviously drive our luxury business as well to drive overall image, but the heart of the business for us in China will be Polo. We're also very clear in terms of how we want to show up relative to the ecosystem, the go-to-market ecosystem I was referring to earlier, with almost a digital-first mindset, right? And you heard us talk about how we're now on WeChat, JD.com and Tmall. And then also opening different store formats than we have historically there. 
So slightly smaller stores, more focused on Polo, and the early results that we're seeing are quite encouraging. We're also tailoring our marketing to the Chinese consumers. So I think you heard us share some examples of celebrities that we're working with in China. And we actually have a long list of terrific partners in that market. That's really resonating with the Chinese consumer. And then likewise on product, we're really looking at this through the lens of the local consumer. What is the local consumer excited about? What are they looking for? And how do we ensure we serve them in a very unique way? We just spent a couple of weeks in Asia, actually, Jane and I, including a lot of time in China. And what was exciting to hear from our teams in the stores is the demand there is for our higher-priced products on Polo, with consumers really looking for more elevated products and accessories. So, we're actually feeling very good about where the demand is for our brand there. And you heard me talk earlier, and I'll stop there and turn it over to Jane, but -- about the average age of our consumer in China, which also gives us a lot of hope for the future. Our average age, 34 years old, right, which is really in the sweet spot of where we want to be, good 50-50 male-female mix. So I think we're well set up for success there. But as we've also called out in the remarks, we will proceed cautiously and we'll be very rigorous in the way we approach our investments moving forward in China."

As you can see in our segment reporting, just 3 years ago, we were not profitable in the Asia region and specifically in China. And the team has done tremendous work, as you've seen notably in this quarter in Asia, to really expand operating margin. So that now, China and Asia growth is accretive to overall Ralph Lauren growth. And so from a profitability standpoint and a healthy base standpoint, we're on solid footing. The brand is in great shape. We've cleaned up our distribution, which is an effort that we're continuing. And we are opening doors in a way that makes sense. We've got flagships that build the brand. We've got Polo doors that are smaller footprint, that have excellent 4-wall profitabilities that we're building out. And as you can see, we're building out a system of concessions that get us reach with our Chinese consumers and also provide a very healthy ROI. The gross margin in Asia is the highest that we have in the company. And so, building and scaling in the Asia market is an opportunity to continue to expand operating margin but to really be a significant vector of growth for us. The time is certainly right, and we have the right team and we're in the right position to do so now."

I mean, internationally, we have both distribution growth opportunities as well as comp growth opportunities. So clearly, exciting potential for us moving forward. We just talked about Asia as being our least-penetrated market. And obviously, our -- the primary growth driver there will be Mainland China. Looking at Europe, right now, we're implementing an enhanced focus on quality of sales and distribution, where I think, again, we got ahead of our skis on distribution in some parts of Europe and we have to reel that back. We're also working on getting the right level of discounting in that market. So that's going to create some pressure on the number of transactions and comps in the short term. However, in the long term, we -- to your point, I think, have significant growth opportunities, both from a distribution and comp growth standpoint. Actually, so Jane and I have been traveling quite a bit. We were in Europe 10 days ago, the U.K., Germany, France, where we spent a lot of time in the market understanding where we are and what the opportunities are. One interesting data point is, across Europe, we only have, I think the precise number is 19 full-price stores across the entire region, which is an indication of the upside potential that we have there, if you just look at our store footprint. We also have very promising progress on digital. I mentioned Zalando earlier, and there are many other partners that we're working with that also indicate that there's significant upside there. And then finally as we toured a number of our wholesale partners, we know we can do a better job with our wholesale partners in Europe. So I think across all these vectors, once we've completed the work of quality of sales, which is critical, we have significant growth opportunity across the region. For example, we don't have a store, dedicated store, in Spain, right, which is a relatively sizable market. So we will get the balance right between Asia and Europe, but we're certainly looking at both regions as growth vectors for us in the future."

The first one, which is going to sound pretty basic but is actually critical, is really driving a more disciplined assortment, right? Having more discipline and understanding the role of the SKU that we're introducing, eliminating the unproductive styles, better balancing our offering across categories, across price points to have good, better, best propositions across all of the key -- all the categories that matter. The second point is there's a critical timelessness to this brand, right? And we have phenomenal Icons. And I think we've all come to the conclusion that we can do more with our Icons and put greater emphasis on our Icons, and that is part of what -- the early progress we're seeing this Fall season is actually driven by what's happening with our Icons. The third area is the renewal of our [Audio Gap]. And again, this is in very important parts of our business. And on this -- in this area, we are looking at fits, we're looking at styles, we're looking at materials, we're looking at colors. And you can imagine, I mean, I've been very impressed by the design team that we have in-house and have had a number of conversations with them. They're very in touch with what's going on in the market, both here and around the world, and really making sure that our proposition's moving forward take that into account while also staying true to who we are, right? So we're not going to be jerked around by all the fashion trends out there in the market by -- and lose kind of the fundamental of what this brand stands for and the timelessness of it. We will be in touch with the trends while staying true to who we are and, obviously, making sure that what the offer is exciting and relevant for the consumers that we want to serve. Then you heard me talk about the limited editions, and we've been excited about the reaction to Stadium. And it was actually pretty neat to see long lines the night before outside of the stores, with people waiting to buy it. So we're going to continue to drive that, we're going look at partnerships moving forward as well, which I think will bring in more interest and excitement to the brand. And then the final point, which is less about trends and style, it's more about strategic choices. There are e-categories where we should be playing more actively; where we are underdeveloped; and where, I believe, we have a basis to win. So that will also be another vector of growth as we look at overall product offering."

Also as we've called out in our store profile, most of the new doors that are being opened are being opened in Asia, and most of the concessions that we're opening this year will be opened in Asia. So, capital will be shifting to the China market as we build out. You'll also see capital going into Europe as we realize the opportunity for some greater store penetration in Europe, as well as some marketing. In North America, what the focus in capital will be is more refurbishments: How do we refresh our store environment? We're fully penetrated, although there'll be some close a store here, open one there. But really, our opportunity is to show up really well in North America and give some of our stores the love that they deserve in terms of refurbishment.

As I mentioned earlier, so e-commerce, very clearly, critical for our future growth. This is going to be the way for us to reach the consumers where they are in the most effective way to drive -- to build the brand and to drive the business. I talked about the 3 buckets that we have: our own site, wholesale dot com and pure players. When we look at pure players, the model we really like is actually the Tmall model, where we manage our own shop in the -- on their marketplace, right, and we have a digital storefront for the brand. That's the model we're excited about. So we continue to evaluate all online partners, including the one you just quoted. And so we want to make sure we win in this channel, but we're also keen to do it in a way that we can build the brand and that we can show up the way the brand is intended to show up. So, nothing new to report on Amazon in particular."

And specifically for North America, as we said, we expect that we'll see wholesale end the year in about the same range that you saw us in Q2. So, we were down about 22% Q2. I expect the full year will look about similar as our cleanup continues through the third and fourth quarter. We are encouraged by what we see as progress on execution. Our underlying comp rate, as we view it, is in the mid- to high single digit. And we know what, we have product and marketing that we need to focus on, as well as the store refreshments, to change that trend as we move into FY '19. So, about similar for the year to what you saw this quarter, but I think that a pretty stable underlying comp trend that we are looking to address as we look at all the vectors: product, marketing and stores."
