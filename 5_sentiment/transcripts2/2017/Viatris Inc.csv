Mylan's first quarter results mark the start of what we believe will be another great year of performance for our company. 
On the top line, we generated total revenues of more than $2.7 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24%. And on the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $500 million or $0.93 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 22%. 
Not only is this a strong performance as the quarter goes, it also once again demonstrates the resiliency of the global platform we've built and our ability people absorb both our industry's natural volatility as well as additional headwinds related to particular products and/or markets. 
Over the past few years, our strategic acquisitions and ability to truly integrate Mylan have allowed us to transform ourselves into a highly differentiated and diversified organization as evidenced by our geographical reach, our broad portfolio, our extensive pipeline and our ability to expand the world's access to high-quality products. This organization enables our unique go-to-market approach in country, optimizing our brand, branded generic, generic [indiscernible] products. In fact, it's precisely this unique profile and approach of how -- to how we now run and drive our businesses that lead us to change our reporting from products-focused segments to geography-focused segments. For these reasons, we remain confident in our ability to meet our full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55, which is not dependent on any one product. 
Our strong first quarter results are set against the backdrop of the global debate regarding health care, and to a degree, President here in the U.S. The current debate continues to focus both on how health care is delivered as well as its price. And we're encouraged by the recent multiple actions at play across multiple industries to help reduce the burden to patients. 
As a leading generics company, Mylan has a 55-year history of providing assets and serving as part of the backbone of health care systems around the world to help supply affordable medicine, and we fully intend to keep doing our part of delivering health for a better world. 
I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to serving all of our stakeholders around the world. 
In addition, we continue to build our bench strength, and I'd would like to welcome Dan Gallagher, who joined Mylan last month as our Chief Legal Officer. His extensive experience in regulatory matters, financial markets and corporate legal affairs and governance makes him an excellent addition to our senior leadership team and further depth to our already strong legal organization. He will prove invaluable as we maximize our many opportunities. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

Before I begin, I too would like to thank our employees around the world for their continued dedication and hard work [indiscernible] unwavering focus on our mission and business objectives. It is this focus from each and every one of them that allowed us to again deliver strong performance around the world. 
Let's turn to the first quarter results, where we have reported according to our new regional segments. I'll provide an overview of our top line performance and then we'll get into segment profitability. 
Overall, our total business delivered revenue of approximately $2.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of 24% compared to the prior year. This performance is once again driven by the strength, diversity and the resilience of the assets we have assembled and successfully integrated. The global pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance. Tony will elaborate on this topic shortly. 
In North America, our business grew approximately 5% to more than $1.2 billion. This increase was primarily due to net sales from the acquisitions of Meda and Renaissance Topicals Business. These increases were partially offset by the net impact of lower net sales from new products and existing products. 
As anticipated, sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector declined in the current quarter as a result of increased competition and the impact of lower-priced authorized generic. Excluding the impact of EpiPen, our North American business would have been up approximately 20%. 
This year, EpiPen will represent less than 5% of global revenues and less than 10% of sales in North America. In Europe, sales totaled about $900 million, a year-over-year increase of 53%. The increase was primarily the result of net sales from acquisition of Meda. 
We continue to grow our leadership position in key European markets such as Italy, where we recently became the generics market leader, and France. We also continue to experience sustained growth in our key products across the region. 
In Rest of World, sales totaled about $580 million, a year-over-year increase of 34%. This increase was primarily driven by acquisition of Meda. In addition, net sales from existing products increased as higher volumes offset lower pricing [ 2 ] [indiscernible] segment. We were especially pleased to see a return to strong growth in our ARV franchise with double digits year-over-year growth. We look forward to continued opportunities for growth in ARV with the launch of our [indiscernible] [ 400 ] product in the developing world. 
We continue to make good progress in the integration of Mylan and are on track to realizing our synergy targets, as evidenced by the decrease in our SG&A spend on a percentage basis year-over-year. We also continue to leverage revenues and opportunities by creating as One Mylan. 
With now 3 quarters under our belt, these acquisitions are exceeding our expectations, and we are well-positioned to leverage these assets and see continued benefits from these assets. 
As regards our operating platform, Mylan has always had a deep and unwavering commitment to quality everything we operate. FDA standards for our industry continue to evolve, and this continues to raise the bar for every player in our industry, which is something we very much welcome. 
For Mylan's part, we are dedicated to continually enhancing our systems and processes, with a deliberate and thorough approach to ensure sustainable quality across our entire network of facilities, working closely with FDA to resolve any issues that come our way. As you're aware, we recently received a warning letter at our site in India. We are working closely with the FDA to respond to and address the issues raised in the letter as comprehensively and expeditiously as possible. Production from site continues uninterrupted, and we anticipate no material impact to Mylan's overall business as a result of this warning letter. 
At the same time, we have successfully completed remediation efforts at the 3 sites acquired from that were under FDA warning letter. The warning letter had been lifted at both FFF and SPD sites and we are pleased with our progress at site, which also was very recently inspected by FDA. 
I note that during the quarter we are shifting inspections by various global regulators across our 50 facilities. In fact, the site is in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and MHRA, which inspected the site following FDA and issued a GMP-compliant certificate. 
Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs. With regards our biosimilar portfolio, we continue to make good progress in our application and are working closely with the various health authorities on their reviews and the result of the TCP and GMP inspection of our facilities. We remain on track with all key programs, including insulin glargine. 
As a reminder, during the quarter, we announced that we agreed to the terms of a global settlement with Genentech and Roche in relation to patents from Herceptin, which provides Mylan with global licenses for our trastuzumab product, excluding Japan and Mexico. This global license will provide a clear pathway for Mylan to commercialize its product in various markets around the world, commencing on the license effective date. 
As of this quarter, we now have approvals for our trastuzumab biosimilar in 15 developing markets. 
On the respiratory front, we received a complete response letter from FDA regarding our ANDA for generic. We have carefully accessed the PRL, which represents the full review of the NDA from all FDA disciplines. Although it's designated as a major CRL, we have a difference of opinion with the agency on certain items in the CRL. We believe that the resolution of some of these points based on our previously agreed upon protocols with FDA can potentially change this major designation of the CRL. In any event, the agency has again expressly confirmed that they consider this application a high priority. 
For these reasons, it's important for us to have this interaction with FDA before we can commence further upon the potential impact of this CRL. Regardless of the timing, we remain confident that there will be a significant market opportunity for a substitutable generic 2 Advair, and the demand for this product will be strong. 
I would also like to note that we are ready from both manufacturing and commercial perspective to launch upon approval. It's important to note that our facility was inspected by FDA in June of 2015, and we have been informed that this facility is in good standing. 
Turning to Copaxone. We have a target action date for both the 20-milligram and 40-milligram for next month. We see no reason that these dates cannot be met. We believe the all questions have been resolved to FDA's satisfaction, and we also believe that there are no facility GMP issues that should be a barrier to approval of this NDA. 
Generally speaking, we believe that the process for approving complex generics continues to be an area that requires greater focus and clarity, and we believe that FDA's committed to enhancing its capabilities and approach in this area. We are encouraged by the comments of the new FDA commissioner that this process will be a priority for him as he assumes his new office. 
We remain very committed to investing in complex products through our robust R&D efforts. Mylan is distinguished from many of our competitors as a result of our willingness to make the substantial investments required over the long term to continue to bring these needed products to the patients. Although we will continue to see this some variability in our quarterly R&D spending due to timing of program spent, there is no change to our overall commitment to investment in R&D. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on commercial landscape. Thank you."

As Rajiv noted, we continue to see growth across all of our regions, with very strong double-digit growth in Europe and Rest of World and solid performance in North America. We also continue to see growth from our global key brands around the world. 
As in previous recent quarters, the pricing environment remain the topic of much discussion throughout our industry. We are pleased that as a result of our diversity from a product, channel and geographic perspective, our expectations for the global pricing environment are unchanged. And we are still predicting mid-single-digit price erosion globally for the year. 
This quarter, we actually saw price erosion in the low single digits on a global basis while price erosion in our U.S. generics business was in the mid-single digits. 
Looking ahead in the U.S., we have several meaningful first-to-market products that launched in 2016 that have come off their exclusivity period, which would cause fluctuations and skew year-over-year comparisons in the coming quarters. This being said, excluding these products from our future outlook, we expect that our U.S.-based business will continue to maintain annualized erosion in the mid-single digits. 
Let me reiterate again that we continue to believe we will see mid-single-digit price erosion for our global business for the remainder of the year, including all products. 
With respect to EpiPen, the authorized generic continues to gain traction and now represents almost 40% of the epinephrine auto-injector market. Additionally, we have seen market growth pick up to more than 10% year-over-year for the category. The AG also continues to have the lowest wholesale acquisition cost of any epinephrine auto-injector on the market. 
That said, competitive activity in this space continues to be robust, and our overall share declined from last year. You are aware of the worldwide recall of [ 20 ] [indiscernible] of EpiPen by the manufacturer, Pfizer Medical Technologies. We quickly implemented a voucher program for patients to replace any impacted product and successfully been executing on this program. We, in partnership with our customers, continue to communicate to impacted patients and replaced their products as efficiently as possible while ensuring these patients have no additional out-of-pocket costs. 
We also note that Meridian Medical Technologies is responsible for the recall costs. We continue to be very pleased with the contribution from the assets we have acquired, which have even further strengthened our broad portfolio offering for our customers. 
For example, during the first quarter, we completed our acquisition of Cold-EEZE as we continue to expand our OTC business. Cold-EEZE is now Mylan's largest U.S. consumer health care brand, and we look forward to serving this loyal customer base and supporting this well-known brand. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."

First quarter revenues grew to $2.7 billion, and that's an increase of 24% over the first quarter of last year. This increase included growth in third-party net sales of 5% in our North America segment, 53% in our Europe segment and 34% in our Rest of World segment. The key drivers to these increases for a net sales from acquisitions of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business, which totaled approximately $607 million in the quarter. 
These increases were partially offset by an $86 million net decrease in the combination of sales, driven by the impact of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products. For the quarter, we continue to experience global generic price deflation in the low single digits. 
As Rajiv mentioned, net sales from our North America segment reached $1.2 billion and grew by 5%, up approximately 20% excluding EpiPen Auto-Injector. Net sales from acquisitions contributed approximately $182 million of the sales growth, and partially offsetting this increase was a net decrease in sales from the combination of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products. In addition, segment profitability increased 3%. 
Net sales in our Europe segment increased by approximately $308 million or 53%. The acquisition of Meda contributed approximately $338 million of the sales growth, and this increase was partially offset by a net decrease in sales from the combination of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 4%. Segment profitability in Europe increased approximately 88% year-over-year. 
Net sales from our Rest of World segment increased by approximately $146 million or 34%. This increase was driven largely by an acquisition of Meda, which totaled approximately $87 million. In addition, higher volume from existing products, primarily in our antiretroviral franchise, plus an increase in new products more than offset ongoing pricing headwinds. Net sales in this segment were favorably impacted by approximately 3% due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Segment profitability in Rest of World increased approximately 159% in the quarter. 
Adjusted gross margins for the first quarter of 2017 were 53%. That's down less than 60 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to the impact from the launch of the EpiPen Auto-Injector authorized generic, as well as additional competition and partially offset by the contributions from prior year acquisitions. 
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D declined to $151 million, equating to approximately 6% of revenues, which was in line with our expectations. SG&A expense also on an adjusted basis increased to $592 million, primarily as a result of selling and marketing costs from the acquired businesses. However, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues declined by 1.3 percentage points to approximately 22% of sales as increased revenues from the acquired businesses and benefits of Mylan integration were realized on the quarter. 
Our adjusted tax rate was 17.5% for the first quarter of 2017, which was also in line with our expectations. Adjusted net earnings increased by $114 million to $500 million in the quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.93 compared to $0.76 in the prior year quarter. 
Turning to cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong at $536 million for the first 3 months of the year compared to $202 million for the prior year. The increase in the current quarter was mostly driven by favorable timing of working capital, including receivables due to the December launch of the EpiPen authorized generic. 
We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivables securitization or revolving credit facility. At the end of Q1 2017, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio declined to approximately 3.7x as compared to 3.8X at the end of 2016. 
On a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, we were at 3.5x at the end of the first quarter. We're fully committed to our investment-grade rating and reducing our debt, as evidenced by our voluntary prepayment of $550 million on our 2016 term loans during the first quarter. 
We have no significant near-term debt maturities, and we remain committed to moving towards our long-term average target leverage ratio of approximately 3x EBITDA. We have the financial flexibility to achieve this goal while still deploying capital for strategic acquisitions. 
As you can see, we started off the year strong, and we're very pleased with our operational and financial results for the first 3 months of the year. We remain committed to our previously communicated full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55, which keeps us on track to realizing our $6 adjusted EPS goal in 2018. 
In terms of phasing, we continue to see the relative percentage contribution from the first half of 2017 to be consistent with the percentage contribution of the first half of 2016. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

I guess specifically with respect to the evolving consortium dynamics, and particularly the Walmart collaboration, a lot of small to midsize manufacturers have pointed to this dynamic as having a significant negative impact on their business or at least created the potential significant negative impact on their business. I'm just wondering sort of what Mylan's position is on the evolution of that particular consortium, whether or not you're actually seeing a current impact? Or is this something you think is going to play out over the next couple of quarters?

Given our portfolio, our breadth and our geographical reach, our ability to not only supply the level of demand that is needed to be able to do so on a global basis. And I think what we've seen is continued strength as these customers have consolidated our ability to really leverage our entire portfolio as well as our pipeline. We got have important projects coming, and what I would say is I can appreciate some of the players that are in one country or geographically landlocked or from a product perspective, not being able to meet some of the supply and demand need on a global basis.

I think you talked about $850 million in new product sales at your Analyst Day. So obviously some things work, some things not work, but if you could comment on that math, would appreciate it."

As we've said, many of us have had many discussions, and I personally said that look, I want to continue to try to give the right visibility into this business because that's what we're here to do. We've got a lot of moving pieces and parts. We're trying to be reflective of how we're running and driving this business, which is completely leveraging all of these channels from generics brands and branded generics and OTCs and how we're leveraging in country. So I really appreciate your recognition of that, and we're going to continue to do so. And the one thing on EpiPen, and then I'll let Ken get into some of the financials is that as we said on Investor Day, Jami, we anticipated a big change in EpiPen, and we knew that it would continue to be a mix of between the AG and the brand, and we continue to see that conversion. That the reality is people had a very strong loyalty to the brand EpiPen and is continue to be an education to let them know that same product. But what I will say about EpiPen is what we expected, and obviously, that continues to be in to the guidance that we reiterated this morning."

W",269,"Yes, I will say thank you for the comment because we are truly the way we put the release together and including providing you a number for North America excluding EpiPen was to allow you to have that visibility into what's going on with EpiPen product. With that number, you've done the math, you can model it, you're kind of right in the ballpark. As far as projecting out the year, we don't give any quarterly kind of run rate on EpiPen. But as Heather said, what happened in the quarter was very consistent with what we expected. The recall did occur, we disclosed both in the Q and in our commentary that the cost of the recall is recoverable. That has driven a little bit of change in trend in some of the sales number but nothing of significance. But to reiterate, we said at Investor Day that year-over-year EpiPen profitability of the operating profit level will be down $400 million year-over-year, a huge number. $500 million at the gross profit level, offset by some reduction in spending in sales and marketing. And that's exactly where we're moving through right now. So you've done the math, you're right in the right ballpark, and everything is exactly how we expected it. As far as new products, we said we have about $850 million contribution this year-over-year for new products, and at this point in time, we work towards that road map. It's a long list of products and whether it be at the lower end, the mid, we're generating those new product launches in order to drive $850 million."

I know that Teva I think at one point was excluding price declines associated with competition after first-to-file products face competition for example, and also I've heard that some generic companies exclude it when they have to discontinue a product due to price decline. They exclude that from their price calculation. So if you could just educate us on how you calculate U.S. price declines, that would be helpful. Second, with respect to Biocon, could you please review of economics how Mylan books revenue and profits associated with Biocon products? And I'm guessing that may differ by geography. And then finally, you disclosed the both Meda and Renaissance revenue of $606 million. Now last year, we had run rates and I thought these were provided by the company or I'm not sure where I got these from but we had a total revenue run rate of about $650 million from the 2 that was $555 million from Meda and $95 million from Renaissance.

What I can tell you obviously, is we have a very important partnership with Biocon and continue to be very happy with the performance, both in the products that are already approved and marketing and those that are in the pipeline. So that continues to be a very important partnership. And as far as price decline, I think Tony laid it out. I don't know if there's any other visibility. But I think that's why we try to give the dynamics around the fact that where you have a first-to-market opportunity and your the only plan to market and there's 5 or 6 players in the market overnight, that can drive a little bit of anomaly in volatility as you look at the year or comparison year-over-year, which is the point we're trying to make.

You talked about the importance of the differentiation of your scale, but that does mean different conversation than some of the smaller players have.

I think what we've continued to show is that the assets that we pull together in a global basis have allowed us to drive not only a different conversation but a reliable supply chain. Our commitment to generics over the past 55 years and certainly the investment we've made in important generics like generic Advair and biosimilars was one of the largest pipeline in the industry. So not only do our customers see us as valuable to be able to have a global partnership, but certainly our pipeline drives much of that conversation and relationship and the importance that we are to each other. So I absolutely cannot underscore enough about how the platform and our differentiation is absolutely allowing us have very different conversations than if we were just in one country with a niche portfolio."

Mylan's first quarter results mark the start of what we believe will be another great year of performance for our company. 
On the top line, we generated total revenues of more than $2.7 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24%. And on the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $500 million or $0.93 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 22%. 
Not only is this a strong performance as the quarter goes, it also once again demonstrates the resiliency of the global platform we've built and our ability to absorb both our industry's natural volatility as well as additional headwinds related to particular products and/or markets.
Over the past few years, our strategic acquisitions and ability to truly integrate Mylan have allowed us to transform ourselves into a highly differentiated and diversified organization, as evidenced by our geographical reach, our broad portfolio, our extensive pipeline and our ability to expand the world's access to high-quality products. This organization enables our unique go-to-market approach in country, optimizing our brand, branded generic, generic and OTC products. In fact, it's precisely this unique profile and approach of how -- to how we now run and drive our businesses that led us to change our reporting from product-focused segments to geography-focused segments. For these reasons, we remain confident in our ability to meet our full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55, which is not dependent on any one product. 
Our strong first quarter results are set against the backdrop of a global debate regarding health care, and to a degree, unprecedented here in the U.S. The current debate continues to focus both on how health care is delivered as well as its price. And we're encouraged by the recent multiple actions of players across multiple industries to help reduce the burden to patients. 
As a leading generics company, Mylan has a 55-year history of providing assets and serving as part of the backbone of health care systems around the world to help supply affordable medicine, and we fully intend to keep doing our part to deliver health for a better world. 
I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team to thank all of our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to serving all of our stakeholders around the world. 
In addition, we continue to build our bench strength, and I'd like to welcome Dan Gallagher, who joined Mylan last month as our Chief Legal Officer. His extensive experience in regulatory matters, financial markets and corporate legal affairs and governance makes him an excellent addition to our senior leadership team and further depth to our already strong legal organization. He will prove invaluable as we maximize our many opportunities.

Before I begin, I too would like to thank our employees around the world for their continued dedication and hard work as well as their unwavering focus on our mission and business objectives. It is this focus from each and every one of them that allowed us to again deliver strong performance around the world. 
Let's turn to the first quarter results, where we have reported according to our new regional segments. I'll provide an overview of our top line performance and then we'll get into segment profitability. 
Overall, our total business delivered revenue of approximately $2.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of 24% compared to the prior year. This performance is once again driven by the strength, diversity and the resilience of the assets we have assembled and successfully integrated. The global pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance. Tony will further elaborate on this topic shortly. 
In North America, our business grew approximately 5% to more than $1.2 billion. This increase was primarily due to net sales from the acquisitions of Meda and Renaissance Topicals Business. These increases were partially offset by the net impact of lower net sales from new products and existing products. 
As anticipated, sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector declined in the current quarter as a result of increased competition and the impact of lower-priced authorized generic. Excluding the impact of EpiPen, our North American business would have been up approximately 20%. 
This year, EpiPen will represent less than 5% of global revenues and less than 10% of sales in North America. In Europe, sales totaled about $900 million, a year-over-year increase of 53%. The increase was primarily the result of net sales from acquisition of Meda. 
We continue to grow our leadership position in key European markets such as Italy, where we recently became the generics market leader, and France. We also continue to experience sustained growth in our key products across the region. 
In Rest of the World, sales totaled about $580 million, a year-over-year increase of 34%. This increase was primarily driven by acquisition of Meda. In addition, net sales from existing products increased as higher volumes offset lower pricing throughout the segment. We were especially pleased to see a return to strong growth in our ARV franchise with double digits year-over-year growth. We look forward to continued opportunities for growth in ARV with the launch of our TLE400 product in the developing world. 
We continue to make good progress in the integration of Mylan and are on track to realizing our synergy targets, as evidenced by the decrease in our SG&A spend on a percentage basis year-over-year. We also continue to leverage revenue synergy opportunities by operating as One Mylan. 
With now 3 quarters under our belt, these acquisitions are exceeding our expectations, and we are well positioned to leverage these assets and see continued benefits from these assets. 
With regards our operating platform, Mylan has always had a deep and unwavering commitment to quality everywhere we operate. FDA standards for our industry continue to evolve, and this continues to raise the bar for every player in our industry, which is something we very much welcome. 
For Mylan's part, we are dedicated to continually enhancing our systems and processes, with a deliberate and thorough approach to ensure sustainable quality across our entire network of facilities, working closely with FDA to resolve any issues that come our way. As you are aware, we recently received a warning letter at our Nashik site in India. We are working closely with the FDA to respond to and address the issues raised in the letter as comprehensively and expeditiously as possible. Production from Nashik site continues uninterrupted, and we anticipate no material impact to Mylan's overall business as a result of this warning letter. 
At the same time, we have successfully completed remediation efforts at the 3 sites acquired from Agila that were under FDA warning letters. The warning letters have been lifted at both SFF and SPD sites and we are pleased with our progress at OTL site, which also was very recently inspected by FDA. 
I note that during the quarter, we are shifting inspections by various global regulators across our 50 facilities. In fact, the Nashik site is in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and MHRA, which inspected the site following FDA and issued a GMP-compliant certificate. 
Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs. With regards to our biosimilar portfolio, we continue to make good progress on our application and are working closely with the various health authorities on their reviews and the result to the GCP and GMP inspection of our facilities. We remain on track with all key programs, including insulin Glargine. 
As a reminder, during the quarter, we announced that we agreed to the terms of a global settlement with Genentech and Roche in relation to patents from Herceptin, which provides Mylan with global licenses for our trastuzumab product, excluding Brazil, Japan and Mexico. This global license will provide a clear pathway for Mylan to commercialize its product in various markets around the world, commencing on the license effective date. 
As of this quarter, we now have approvals for our trastuzumab biosimilar in 15 developing markets. 
On the respiratory front, we received a complete response letter from FDA regarding our ANDA for generic Advair Diskus. We have carefully assessed the CRL, which represents the full review of ANDA from all FDA disciplines. Although it's designated as a major CRL, we have a difference of opinion with the agency on certain items raised in the CRL. We believe that the resolution of some of these points, based on our previously agreed-upon protocols with FDA, can potentially change this major designation of the CRL. In any event, the agency has again expressly confirmed that they consider this application a high priority. 
For these reasons, it's important for us to have this interaction with FDA before we can commence further upon the potential impact of the CRL. Regardless of the timing, we remain confident that there will be a significant market opportunity for a substitutable generic to Advair, and the demand for this product will be strong. 
I would also like to note that we are ready from both a manufacturing and commercial perspective to launch upon approval. It's important to note that our Dublin manufacturing facility was inspected by FDA in June of [ 2015 ], and we have been informed that this facility is in good standing.
Turning to Copaxone. We have a target action date for both the 20 milligram and 40 milligram for next month. We see no reason that these dates cannot be met. We believe that all scientific questions have been resolved to FDA's satisfaction, and we also believe that there are no facility GMP issues that should be a barrier to approval of this ANDA. 
Generally speaking, we believe that the process for approving complex generics continues to be an area that requires greater focus and clarity, and we believe that FDA's committed to enhancing its capabilities and approach in this area. We are encouraged by the comments by the new FDA commissioner that this process will be a priority for him as he assumes his new office. 
We remain very committed to investing in complex products through our robust R&D efforts. Mylan is distinguished from many of our competitors as a result of our willingness to make the substantial investments required over the long term to continue to bring these needed products to the patients. Although you will continue to see some variability in our quarterly R&D spending due to timing of program expense, there is no change to our overall commitment to investment in R&D. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on commercial landscape. Thank you."

As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across all of our regions, with very strong double-digit growth in Europe and Rest of World and solid performance in North America. We also continue to see growth from our global key brands around the world. 
As in previous recent quarters, the pricing environment remains a topic of much discussion throughout our industry. We are pleased that as a result of our diversity from a product, channel and geographic perspective, our expectations for the global pricing environment are unchanged, and we are still predicting mid-single-digit price erosion globally for the year. 
This quarter, we actually saw price erosion in the low single digits on a global basis while price erosion in our U.S. generics business was in the mid-single digits. 
Looking ahead in the U.S., we have several meaningful first-to-market products that launched in 2016 that have come off their exclusivity periods, which will cause fluctuations and skew year-over-year comparisons in the coming quarters. This being said, excluding these products from our future outlook, we expect that our U.S.-based business will continue to maintain annualized erosion in the mid-single digits. 
Let me reiterate again that we continue to believe we will see mid-single-digit price erosion for our global business for the remainder of the year, including all products. 
With respect to EpiPen, the authorized generic continues to gain traction and now represents almost 40% of the epinephrine auto-injector market. Additionally, we have seen market growth pick up to more than 10% year-over-year for the category. The AG also continues to have the lowest wholesale acquisition cost of any epinephrine auto-injector on the market. 
That said, competitive activity in this space continues to be robust, and our overall shares declined from last year. You are aware of the worldwide recall of 20-plus lots of EpiPen by the manufacturer, Pfizer's Meridian Medical Technologies. We quickly implemented a voucher program for patients to replace any impacted product and successfully been executing on this program. We, in partnership with our customers, continue to communicate to impacted patients and replace their product as efficiently as possible while ensuring these patients have no additional out-of-pocket costs. We also note that Meridian Medical Technologies is contractually responsible for the recall cost.
We continue to be very pleased with the contribution from the assets we have acquired, which have even further strengthened our broad portfolio offering for our customers. For example, during the first quarter, we completed our acquisition of Cold-EEZE as we continue to expand our OTC business. Cold-EEZE is now Mylan's largest U.S. consumer health care brand, and we look forward to serving this loyal customer base and supporting this well-known brand. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."

Let me add a little more detail on our financial results. First quarter revenues grew to $2.7 billion, and that's an increase of 24% over the first quarter of last year.

First quarter revenues grew to $2.7 billion, and that's an increase of 24% over the first quarter of last year. This increase included growth in third-party net sales of 5% in our North America segment, 53% in our Europe segment and 34% in our Rest of World segment. The key drivers to these increases were net sales from the acquisitions of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business, which totaled approximately $607 million in the quarter. 
These increases were partially offset by an $86 million net decrease in the combination of sales, driven by the impact of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products. For the quarter, we continue to experience global generic price deflation in the low single digits. 
As Rajiv mentioned, net sales from our North America segment reached $1.2 billion and grew by 5%, up approximately 20% excluding EpiPen Auto-Injector. Net sales from acquisitions contributed approximately $182 million of the sales growth, and partially offsetting this increase was a net decrease in sales from the combination of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products. In addition, segment profitability increased 3%. 
Net sales in our Europe segment increased by approximately $308 million or 53%. The acquisition of Meda contributed approximately $338 million of the sales growth, and this increase was partially offset by a net decrease in sales from the combination of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 4%. Segment profitability in Europe increased approximately 88% year-over-year. 
Net sales from our Rest of World segment increased by approximately $146 million or 34%. This increase was driven largely by an acquisition of Meda, which totaled approximately $87 million. In addition, higher volume from existing products, primarily in our antiretroviral franchise, plus an increase in new products more than offset ongoing pricing headwinds. Net sales in this segment were favorably impacted by approximately 3% due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Segment profitability in Rest of World increased approximately 159% in the quarter. 
Adjusted gross margins for the first quarter of 2017 were 53%. That's down less than 60 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to the impact from the launch of the EpiPen Auto-Injector authorized generic, as well as additional competition and partially offset by the contributions from prior year acquisitions. 
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D declined to $151 million, equating to approximately 6% of revenues, which was in line with our expectations. SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, increased to $592 million, primarily as the result of selling and marketing costs from the acquired businesses. However, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues declined by 1.3 percentage points to approximately 22% of sales as increased revenues from the acquired businesses and benefits of Mylan integration were realized in the quarter. 
Our adjusted tax rate was 17.5% for the first quarter of 2017, which was also in line with our expectations. Adjusted net earnings increased by $114 million to $500 million in the quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.93 compared to $0.76 in the prior year quarter. 
Turning to cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong at $536 million for the first 3 months of the year compared to $202 million for the prior year. The increase in the current quarter was mostly driven by favorable timing of working capital, including receivables, due to the December launch of the EpiPen authorized generic. 
We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivables securitization or revolving credit facility. At the end of Q1 2017, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio declined to approximately 3.7x as compared to 3.8x at the end of 2016. 
On a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, we were at 3.5x at the end of the first quarter. We're fully committed to our investment-grade rating and to reducing our debt, as evidenced by our voluntary prepayment of $550 million on our 2016 term loans during the first quarter. 
We have no significant near-term debt maturities and remain committed to moving towards our long-term average target leverage ratio of approximately 3x EBITDA. We have the financial flexibility to achieve this goal while still deploying capital for strategic acquisitions. 
As you can see, we started off the year strong, and we're very pleased with our operational and financial results for the first 3 months of the year. We remain committed to our previously communicated full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55, which keeps us on track to realizing our $6 adjusted EPS goal in 2018. 
In terms of phasing, we continue to see the relative percentage contribution from the first half of 2017 to be consistent with the percentage contribution of the first half of 2016. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

I guess, specifically with respect to the evolving consortium dynamics, and particularly the McKesson-Walmart collaboration, a lot of small to midsize manufacturers have pointed to this dynamic as having a significant negative impact on their business or at least create a potential to have a significant negative impact on their business. I'm just wondering sort of what Mylan's position is on the evolution of that particular consortium, whether or not you're actually seeing a current impact or this is something that you think is going to play out over the next couple of quarters. And then just sort of maybe conceptually kind of how much risk that creates around your mid-single-digit pricing erosion assumption."

Elliott, I think this is no different than the consolidation we've seen over the last several years. When you look at our customer base, the consolidation, especially on a global -- from a global perspective, what we've said then and remains true today is that consolidation is really a benefit to a company like ours at Mylan. Given our portfolio, our breadth and our geographical reach, our ability to not only supply the level of demand that is needed but to be able to do so on a global basis. And I think what we've seen is the continued strength as these customers have consolidated our ability to really leverage our entire portfolio as well as our pipeline. We've got some important products coming, and what I would say is I can appreciate some of the players that are in one country or geographically landlocked or from a product perspective, not being able to meet some of the supply and demand needed on a global basis. So I think this further underscores Mylan's differentiated and diversified platform and is allowing us to meet and exceed, quite honestly, what we have done in the past with some of these players as they're looking at a different business model."

Is that the new level of sales that we should expect? Will that continue to erode? Help us to think about that. And secondly, in terms of your revenue guide, which I don't know that I've heard you reiterate, if you do want to, this is good opportunity, if not, that says something, too, but to hit the low end of your revenue guide would seem to require about $350 million in new products sales.

So I really appreciate your recognition of that, and we're going to continue to do so. And the one thing I'll just say on EpiPen and I'll let Ken get into some of the financials is that as we said on Investor Day, Jami, we anticipated a big change in EpiPen, and we knew that it would continue to be a mix of -- between the AG and the brand, and we continue to see that conversion. But the reality is people had a very strong loyalty to the brand EpiPen and it's continued to be an education to let them know that it's the same product.

With that number, you've done the math, you can model it. You're kind of right in the ballpark. As far as projecting out the year, we don't give any quarterly kind of run rate on EpiPen. But as Heather said, what happened in the quarter was very consistent with what we expected. The recall did occur. We disclosed both in the Q and in our commentary that the cost of the recall is recoverable. That has driven a little bit of change in trend in some of the sales number but nothing of significance. But to reiterate, we said at Investor Day that year-over-year EpiPen profitability at the operating profit level will be down $400 million year-over-year, a huge number. $500 million at the gross profit level, offset by some reduction in spending in sales and marketing. And that's exactly where we're moving through right now. So you've done the math, you're right in the right ballpark, and everything is exactly how we expected it. As far as new products, we said we have about $850 million contribution this year year-over-year for new products, and at this point in time, we're working towards that road map. It's a long list of products and whether it be at the low end, the mid, we're generating those new product launches in order to drive $850 million."

I'll maybe take some at a high level and then others can chime in. I'll start with the acquisition. Look, as we've done for this quarter and we will do this year is break out acquisitions and that contribution. I think I'm not sure where your numbers -- or if those are old numbers, but what I will tell you again is what we're doing with the asset in combination. So while we're breaking out for 1 year post the acquisitions because that visibility on our legacy business to try to start now dissecting between the acquisitions, I don't think would be useful because it's really what we're being able to drive out of this asset in totality that is driving the results that you're seeing. As far as Biocon, I don't believe we've given the contractual relationship. What I can tell you, obviously, we have a very important partnership with Biocon and continue to be very happy with the performance, both in the products that are already approved and marketing and those that are in the pipeline. So that continues to be a very important partnership. And as far as price decline, I think Tony laid it out. I don't know if there's any other visibility. But I think that's why we try to give the dynamics around the fact that where you have a first-to-market opportunity and you're the only plan to market and then there's 5 or 6 players in the market overnight, that certainly can drive a little bit of anomaly and volatility as you look at a year or comparisons year-over-year, which is the point we were trying to make. However, all products then and looking at everything across our globe, we're still saying our generic price erosion is in mid-single digits, without excluding anything."

Can you talk a little bit about when you decided it's about time to stop selling a particular product? Is this something we should expect, the strategic direction that the company has taken to walk away from unprofitable business? And then last, one of the things we try to do always is cross over between the previous quarter and this quarter.

With that being said, I think Ken at Investor Day kind of laid out what we saw corresponding quarters and proportionality from '16 to '17 that would help for modeling purposes if you look at the percentage of the businesses. So again, I think what we couldn't be more excited about is the resiliency of this platform and the fact that the seasonality for any product or given market, we're able to now really absorb that and show this contribution continuing to grow in a meaningful way and not being so much subjected to seasonality."

And that is consistent with what we projected and gave you an outlook for, for the full year. So even though seasonality may move around a bit and you followed us long enough to know that the second half is a bigger half than the first half is, we'll see a significant amount of variation in that. We saw in the first quarter what we have an outlook for, for the year. Specifically, as far as new product introductions, new product launches this year we indicated will be heavier, obviously, in the second half. Last year, I would say if you're looking at fourth quarter to first quarter, not significantly different because they were lighter new product launch quarters."

And all generic companies aren't created equally. All branded companies aren't created equally, and all hybrid companies aren't created equally. I think what we've continued to show is that the assets that we pull together on a global basis have allowed us to drive not only a different conversation but a reliable supply chain. Our commitment to generics over the past 55 years and certainly the investment we've made in important complex generics like generic Advair and our biosimilars was one of the largest pipelines in the industry. So not only do our customers see us as valuable to be able to have a global partnership, but certainly our pipeline drives much of that conversation and relationship and the importance that we are to each other. So I absolutely can't underscore enough about how the platform and our differentiation is absolutely allowing us to have very different conversations than if we were just in one country with a niche portfolio."

And my final question was actually shifting gears to biosimilars and biosimilar Neulasta in the U.S. Seems like a large and very attractive market.

We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of the financial performance. 
Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Mylan's first quarter results mark the start of what we believe will be another great year of performance for our company. 
On the top line, we generated total revenues of more than $2.7 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24%. And on the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $500 million or $0.93 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 22%. 
Not only is this a strong performance as the quarter goes, it also once again demonstrates the resiliency of the global platform we've built and our ability to absorb both our industry's natural volatility as well as additional headwinds related to particular products and/or markets.
Over the past few years, our strategic acquisitions and ability to truly integrate Mylan have allowed us to transform ourselves into a highly differentiated and diversified organization, as evidenced by our geographical reach, our broad portfolio, our extensive pipeline and our ability to expand the world's access to high-quality products. This organization enables our unique go-to-market approach in country, optimizing our brand, branded generic, generic and OTC products. In fact, it's precisely this unique profile and approach of how -- to how we now run and drive our businesses that led us to change our reporting from product-focused segments to geography-focused segments. For these reasons, we remain confident in our ability to meet our full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55, which is not dependent on any one product. 
Our strong first quarter results are set against the backdrop of a global debate regarding health care, and to a degree, unprecedented here in the U.S. The current debate continues to focus both on how health care is delivered as well as its price. And we're encouraged by the recent multiple actions of players across multiple industries to help reduce the burden to patients. 
As a leading generics company, Mylan has a 55-year history of providing assets and serving as part of the backbone of health care systems around the world to help supply affordable medicine, and we fully intend to keep doing our part to deliver health for a better world. 
I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team to thank all of our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to serving all of our stakeholders around the world. 
In addition, we continue to build our bench strength, and I'd like to welcome Dan Gallagher, who joined Mylan last month as our Chief Legal Officer. His extensive experience in regulatory matters, financial markets and corporate legal affairs and governance makes him an excellent addition to our senior leadership team and further depth to our already strong legal organization. He will prove invaluable as we maximize our many opportunities.

Before I begin, I too would like to thank our employees around the world for their continued dedication and hard work as well as their unwavering focus on our mission and business objectives. It is this focus from each and every one of them that allowed us to again deliver strong performance around the world. 
Let's turn to the first quarter results, where we have reported according to our new regional segments. I'll provide an overview of our top line performance and then we'll get into segment profitability. 
Overall, our total business delivered revenue of approximately $2.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of 24% compared to the prior year. This performance is once again driven by the strength, diversity and the resilience of the assets we have assembled and successfully integrated. The global pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance. Tony will further elaborate on this topic shortly. 
In North America, our business grew approximately 5% to more than $1.2 billion. This increase was primarily due to net sales from the acquisitions of Meda and Renaissance Topicals Business. These increases were partially offset by the net impact of lower net sales from new products and existing products. 
As anticipated, sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector declined in the current quarter as a result of increased competition and the impact of lower-priced authorized generic. Excluding the impact of EpiPen, our North American business would have been up approximately 20%. 
This year, EpiPen will represent less than 5% of global revenues and less than 10% of sales in North America. In Europe, sales totaled about $900 million, a year-over-year increase of 53%. The increase was primarily the result of net sales from acquisition of Meda. 
We continue to grow our leadership position in key European markets such as Italy, where we recently became the generics market leader, and France. We also continue to experience sustained growth in our key products across the region. 
In Rest of the World, sales totaled about $580 million, a year-over-year increase of 34%. This increase was primarily driven by acquisition of Meda. In addition, net sales from existing products increased as higher volumes offset lower pricing throughout the segment. We were especially pleased to see a return to strong growth in our ARV franchise with double digits year-over-year growth. We look forward to continued opportunities for growth in ARV with the launch of our TLE400 product in the developing world. 
We continue to make good progress in the integration of Mylan and are on track to realizing our synergy targets, as evidenced by the decrease in our SG&A spend on a percentage basis year-over-year. We also continue to leverage revenue synergy opportunities by operating as One Mylan. 
With now 3 quarters under our belt, these acquisitions are exceeding our expectations, and we are well positioned to leverage these assets and see continued benefits from these assets. 
With regards to our operating platform, Mylan has always had a deep and unwavering commitment to quality everywhere we operate. FDA standards for our industry continue to evolve, and this continues to raise the bar for every player in our industry, which is something we very much welcome. 
For Mylan's part, we are dedicated to continually enhancing our systems and processes, with a deliberate and thorough approach to ensure sustainable quality across our entire network of facilities, working closely with FDA to resolve any issues that come our way. As you are aware, we recently received a warning letter at our Nashik site in India. We are working closely with the FDA to respond to and address the issues raised in the letter as comprehensively and expeditiously as possible. Production from Nashik site continues uninterrupted, and we anticipate no material impact to Mylan's overall business as a result of this warning letter. 
At the same time, we have successfully completed remediation efforts at the 3 sites acquired from Agila that were under FDA warning letters. The warning letters have been lifted at both SFF and SPD sites and we are pleased with our progress at OTL site, which also was very recently inspected by FDA. 
I note that during the quarter, we are shifting inspections by various global regulators across our 50 facilities. In fact, the Nashik site is in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and MHRA, which inspected the site following FDA and issued a GMP-compliant certificate. 
Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs. With regards to our biosimilar portfolio, we continue to make good progress on our application and are working closely with the various health authorities on their reviews and with regard to the GCP and GMP inspection of our facilities. We remain on track with all key programs, including insulin Glargine. 
As a reminder, during the quarter, we announced that we agreed to the terms of a global settlement with Genentech and Roche in relation to patents from Herceptin, which provides Mylan with global licenses for our trastuzumab product, excluding Brazil, Japan and Mexico. This global license will provide a clear pathway for Mylan to commercialize its product in various markets around the world, commencing on the license effective date. 
As of this quarter, we now have approvals for our trastuzumab biosimilar in 15 developing markets. 
On the respiratory front, we received a complete response letter from FDA regarding our ANDA for generic Advair Diskus. We have carefully assessed the CRL, which represents the full review of ANDA from all FDA disciplines. Although it's designated as a major CRL, we have a difference of opinion with the agency on certain items raised in the CRL. We believe that the resolution of some of these points, based on our previously agreed-upon protocols with FDA, can potentially change this major designation of the CRL. In any event, the agency has again expressly confirmed that they consider this application a high priority. 
For these reasons, it's important for us to have this interaction with FDA before we can commence further upon the potential impact of the CRL. Regardless of the timing, we remain confident that there will be a significant market opportunity for a substitutable generic to Advair, and the demand for this product will be strong. 
I would also like to note that we are ready from both a manufacturing and commercial perspective to launch upon approval. It's important to note that our Dublin manufacturing facility was inspected by FDA in June of [ 2015 ], and we have been informed that this facility is in good standing.
Turning to Copaxone. We have a target action date for both the 20 milligram and 40 milligram for next month. We see no reason that these dates cannot be met. We believe that all scientific questions have been resolved to FDA's satisfaction, and we also believe that there are no facility GMP issues that should be a barrier to approval of this ANDA. 
Generally speaking, we believe that the process for approving complex generics continues to be an area that requires greater focus and clarity, and we believe that FDA's committed to enhancing its capabilities and approach in this area. We are encouraged by the comments by the new FDA commissioner that this process will be a priority for him as he assumes his new office. 
We remain very committed to investing in complex products through our robust R&D efforts. Mylan is distinguished from many of our competitors as a result of our willingness to make the substantial investments required over the long term to continue to bring these needed products to the patients. Although you will continue to see some variability in our quarterly R&D spending due to timing of program expense, there is no change to our overall commitment to investment in R&D. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on commercial landscape. Thank you."

As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across all of our regions, with very strong double-digit growth in Europe and Rest of World and solid performance in North America. We also continue to see growth from our global key brands around the world. 
As in previous recent quarters, the pricing environment remains a topic of much discussion throughout our industry. We are pleased that as a result of our diversity from a product, channel and geographic perspective, our expectations for the global pricing environment are unchanged, and we are still predicting mid-single-digit price erosion globally for the year. 
This quarter, we actually saw price erosion in the low single digits on a global basis while price erosion in our U.S. generics business was in the mid-single digits. 
Looking ahead in the U.S., we have several meaningful first-to-market products that launched in 2016 that have come off their exclusivity periods, which will cause fluctuations and skew year-over-year comparisons in the coming quarters. This being said, excluding these products from our future outlook, we expect that our U.S.-based business will continue to maintain annualized erosion in the mid-single digits. 
Let me reiterate again that we continue to believe we will see mid-single-digit price erosion for our global business for the remainder of the year, including all products. 
With respect to EpiPen, the authorized generic continues to gain traction and now represents almost 40% of the epinephrine auto-injector market. Additionally, we have seen market growth pick up to more than 10% year-over-year for the category. The AG also continues to have the lowest wholesale acquisition cost of any epinephrine auto-injector on the market. 
That said, competitive activity in this space continues to be robust, and our overall shares declined from last year. You are aware of the worldwide recall of 20-plus lots of EpiPen by the manufacturer, Pfizer's Meridian Medical Technologies. We quickly implemented a voucher program for patients to replace any impacted product and successfully been executing on this program. We, in partnership with our customers, continue to communicate to impacted patients and replace their product as efficiently as possible while ensuring these patients have no additional out-of-pocket costs. We also note that Meridian Medical Technologies is contractually responsible for the recall cost.
We continue to be very pleased with the contribution from the assets we have acquired, which have even further strengthened our broad portfolio offering for our customers. For example, during the first quarter, we completed our acquisition of Cold-EEZE as we continue to expand our OTC business. Cold-EEZE is now Mylan's largest U.S. consumer health care brand, and we look forward to serving this loyal customer base and supporting this well-known brand. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."
290203,429010238,1199180,"Mylan N.V., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 10, 2017",2017-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Let me add a little more detail on our financial results. First quarter revenues grew to $2.7 billion, and that's an increase of 24% over the first quarter of last year.

First quarter revenues grew to $2.7 billion, and that's an increase of 24% over the first quarter of last year. This increase included growth in third-party net sales of 5% in our North America segment, 53% in our Europe segment and 34% in our Rest of World segment. The key drivers to these increases were net sales from the acquisitions of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business, which totaled approximately $607 million in the quarter. 
These increases were partially offset by an $86 million net decrease in the combination of sales, driven by the impact of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products. For the quarter, we continue to experience global generic price deflation in the low single digits. 
As Rajiv mentioned, net sales from our North America segment reached $1.2 billion and grew by 5%, up approximately 20% excluding EpiPen Auto-Injector. Net sales from acquisitions contributed approximately $182 million of the sales growth, and partially offsetting this increase was a net decrease in sales from the combination of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products. In addition, segment profitability increased 3%. 
Net sales in our Europe segment increased by approximately $308 million or 53%. The acquisition of Meda contributed approximately $338 million of the sales growth, and this increase was partially offset by a net decrease in sales from the combination of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 4%. Segment profitability in Europe increased approximately 88% year-over-year. 
Net sales from our Rest of World segment increased by approximately $146 million or 34%. This increase was driven largely by an acquisition of Meda, which totaled approximately $87 million. In addition, higher volume from existing products, primarily in our antiretroviral franchise, plus an increase in new products more than offset ongoing pricing headwinds. Net sales in this segment were favorably impacted by approximately 3% due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Segment profitability in Rest of World increased approximately 159% in the quarter. 
Adjusted gross margins for the first quarter of 2017 were 53%. That's down less than 60 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to the impact from the launch of the EpiPen Auto-Injector authorized generic, as well as additional competition and partially offset by the contributions from prior year acquisitions. 
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D declined to $151 million, equating to approximately 6% of revenues, which was in line with our expectations. SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, increased to $592 million, primarily as the result of selling and marketing costs from the acquired businesses. However, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues declined by 1.3 percentage points to approximately 22% of sales as increased revenues from the acquired businesses and benefits of Mylan integration were realized in the quarter. 
Our adjusted tax rate was 17.5% for the first quarter of 2017, which was also in line with our expectations. Adjusted net earnings increased by $114 million to $500 million in the quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.93 compared to $0.76 in the prior year quarter. 
Turning to cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong at $536 million for the first 3 months of the year compared to $202 million for the prior year. The increase in the current quarter was mostly driven by favorable timing of working capital, including receivables, due to the December launch of the EpiPen authorized generic. 
We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivables securitization or revolving credit facility. At the end of Q1 2017, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio declined to approximately 3.7x as compared to 3.8x at the end of 2016. 
On a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, we were at 3.5x at the end of the first quarter. We're fully committed to our investment-grade rating and to reducing our debt, as evidenced by our voluntary prepayment of $550 million on our 2016 term loans during the first quarter. 
We have no significant near-term debt maturities and remain committed to moving towards our long-term average target leverage ratio of approximately 3x EBITDA. We have the financial flexibility to achieve this goal while still deploying capital for strategic acquisitions. 
As you can see, we started off the year strong, and we're very pleased with our operational and financial results for the first 3 months of the year. We remain committed to our previously communicated full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55, which keeps us on track to realizing our $6 adjusted EPS goal in 2018. 
In terms of phasing, we continue to see the relative percentage contribution from the first half of 2017 to be consistent with the percentage contribution of the first half of 2016. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

Elliott, I think this is no different than the consolidation we've seen over the last several years. When you look at our customer base, the consolidation, especially on a global -- from a global perspective, what we've said then and remains true today is that consolidation is really a benefit to a company like ours at Mylan. Given our portfolio, our breadth and our geographical reach, our ability to not only supply the level of demand that is needed but to be able to do so on a global basis. And I think what we've seen is the continued strength as these customers have consolidated our ability to really leverage our entire portfolio as well as our pipeline. We've got some important products coming, and what I would say is I can appreciate some of the players that are in one country or geographically landlocked or from a product perspective, not being able to meet some of the supply and demand needed on a global basis.

And secondly, in terms of your revenue guide, which I don't know that I've heard you reiterate, if you do want to, this is good opportunity, if not, that says something, too, but to hit the low end of your revenue guide would seem to require about $350 million in new products sales.

With that number, you've done the math, you can model it. You're kind of right in the ballpark. As far as projecting out the year, we don't give any quarterly kind of run rate on EpiPen. But as Heather said, what happened in the quarter was very consistent with what we expected. The recall did occur. We disclosed both in the Q and in our commentary that the cost of the recall is recoverable. That has driven a little bit of change in trend in some of the sales number but nothing of significance. But to reiterate, we said at Investor Day that year-over-year EpiPen profitability at the operating profit level will be down $400 million year-over-year, a huge number. $500 million at the gross profit level, offset by some reduction in spending in sales and marketing. And that's exactly where we're moving through right now. So you've done the math, you're right in the right ballpark, and everything is exactly how we expected it. As far as new products, we said we'd have about $850 million contribution this year year-over-year for new products, and at this point in time, we're working towards that road map.

And I think we were able to show last year that we turned that to a flat to increasing in business. And then as we look at bringing on Meda and Renaissance, we've continued to see our ability to leverage now the infrastructure around these countries that are allowing us to maximize the product that each of these acquisitions brought us, the Mylan legacy, the Abbott as well as now with Meda. And so we continue to see our ability to get more out of that asset than they were doing on a standalone basis in conjunction with our existing businesses.

The first is with respect to U.S. price decline commentary, could you just educate us on how you calculate that? I know that Teva, I think at one point, was excluding price declines associated with competition after first-to-file products face competition, for example. And also, I've heard that some generic companies exclude it when they have to discontinue a product due to price decline. They exclude that from their price calculation. So if you could just educate us on how you calculate U.S. price declines, that would be helpful. Second, with respect to Biocon, could you please review the economics how Mylan books revenue and profits associated with Biocon products? And I'm guessing that may differ by geography. And then finally, you disclosed global Meda and Renaissance revenue of $606 million. Now last year, we had run rates and I thought these were provided by the company or I'm not sure where we got these from, but we had a total revenue run rate of about $650 million from the 2. That was $555 million from Meda and $95 million from Renaissance. So just wanted to see if indeed those numbers are accurate and the business has decreased maybe due to divestitures?

Look, as we've done for this quarter and we will do this year is break out acquisitions and that contribution. I think I'm not sure where your numbers -- or if those are old numbers, but what I will tell you again, it's what we're doing with the asset in combination. So while we're breaking out for 1 year post acquisitions because that visibility on our legacy business to try to start now dissecting between the acquisitions, I don't think would be useful because it's really what we're being able to drive out of this asset in totality that is driving the results that you're seeing. As far as Biocon, I don't believe we've given the contractual relationship. What I can tell you, obviously, we have a very important partnership with Biocon and continue to be very happy with the performance, both in the products that are already approved and marketing and those that are in the pipeline. So that continues to be a very important partnership. And as far as price decline, I think Tony laid it out. I don't know if there's any other visibility. But I think that's why we try to give the dynamics around the fact that where you have a first-to-market opportunity and you're the only plan to market and then there's 5 or 6 players in the market overnight, that certainly can drive a little bit of anomaly and volatility as you look at a year or comparisons year-over-year, which is the point we were trying to make. However, all products then and looking at everything across our globe, we're still saying our generic price erosion is in mid to single digits, without excluding anything."

So even though seasonality may move around a bit and you followed us long enough to know that the second half is a bigger half than the first half is, we don't see a significant amount of variation in that.

And I think what we've continued to show is that the assets that we've pulled together on a global basis have allowed us to drive not only a different conversation but a reliable supply chain. Our commitment to generics over the past 55 years and certainly the investment we've made in important complex generics like generic Advair and our biosimilars was one of the largest pipelines in the industry. So not only do our customers see us as valuable to be able to have a global partnership, but certainly our pipeline drives much of that conversation and relationship and the importance that we are to each other.

I know you usually don't comment on specific products but just given the focus on this one, I think that would be helpful. My second question, also on Advair, if your dialogue with FDA is unsuccessful, can you just give us some rough time lines on how we should think about a generic Advair approval? Was that -- is that -- is mid-'18 a reasonable time for them to think about it if you're unsuccessful? And my final question was actually shifting gears to biosimilars and biosimilar Neulasta in the U.S. Seems like a large and very attractive market. Is that something that could be a contributor for you in 2018? Or are there still IP hurdles for you to think about there, assuming you're approved later this year?"

Mylan's first quarter results mark the start of what we believe will be another great year of performance for our company. 
On the top line, we generated total revenues of more than $2.7 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24%. And on the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $500 million or $0.93 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 22%. 
Not only is this a strong performance as the quarter goes, it also once again demonstrates the resiliency of the global platform we've built and our ability to absorb both our industry's natural volatility as well as additional headwinds related to particular products and/or markets.
Over the past few years, our strategic acquisitions and ability to truly integrate Mylan have allowed us to transform ourselves into a highly differentiated and diversified organization, as evidenced by our geographical reach, our broad portfolio, our extensive pipeline and our ability to expand the world's access to high-quality products. This organization enables our unique go-to-market approach in country, optimizing our brand, branded generic, generic and OTC products. In fact, it's precisely this unique profile and approach of how -- to how we now run and drive our businesses that led us to change our reporting from product-focused segments to geography-focused segments. For these reasons, we remain confident in our ability to meet our full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55, which is not dependent on any one product. 
Our strong first quarter results are set against the backdrop of a global debate regarding health care, and to a degree, unprecedented here in the U.S. The current debate continues to focus both on how health care is delivered as well as its price. And we're encouraged by the recent multiple actions of players across multiple industries to help reduce the burden to patients. 
As a leading generics company, Mylan has a 55-year history of providing assets and serving as part of the backbone of health care systems around the world to help supply affordable medicine, and we fully intend to keep doing our part to deliver health for a better world. 
I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team to thank all of our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to serving all of our stakeholders around the world. 
In addition, we continue to build our bench strength, and I'd like to welcome Dan Gallagher, who joined Mylan last month as our Chief Legal Officer. His extensive experience in regulatory matters, financial markets and corporate legal affairs and governance makes him an excellent addition to our senior leadership team and further depth to our already strong legal organization. He will prove invaluable as we maximize our many opportunities. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

Before I begin, I too would like to thank our employees around the world for their continued dedication and hard work as well as their unwavering focus on our mission and business objectives. It is this focus from each and every one of them that allowed us to again deliver strong performance around the world. 
Let's turn to the first quarter results, where we have reported according to our new regional segments. I'll provide an overview of our top line performance and then we'll get into segment profitability. 
Overall, our total business delivered revenue of approximately $2.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of 24% compared to the prior year. This performance is once again driven by the strength, diversity and the resilience of the assets we have assembled and successfully integrated. The global pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance. Tony will further elaborate on this topic shortly. 
In North America, our business grew approximately 5% to more than $1.2 billion. This increase was primarily due to net sales from the acquisitions of Meda and Renaissance Topicals Business. These increases were partially offset by the net impact of lower net sales from new products and existing products. 
As anticipated, sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector declined in the current quarter as a result of increased competition and the impact of lower-priced authorized generic. Excluding the impact of EpiPen, our North American business would have been up approximately 20%. 
This year, EpiPen will represent less than 5% of global revenues and less than 10% of sales in North America. In Europe, sales totaled about $900 million, a year-over-year increase of 53%. The increase was primarily the result of net sales from acquisition of Meda. 
We continue to grow our leadership position in key European markets such as Italy, where we recently became the generics market leader, and France. We also continue to experience sustained growth in our key products across the region. 
In Rest of the World, sales totaled about $580 million, a year-over-year increase of 34%. This increase was primarily driven by acquisition of Meda. In addition, net sales from existing products increased as higher volumes offset lower pricing throughout the segment. We were especially pleased to see a return to strong growth in our ARV franchise with double digits year-over-year growth. We look forward to continued opportunities for growth in ARV with the launch of our TLE400 product in the developing world. 
We continue to make good progress in the integration of Mylan and are on track to realizing our synergy targets, as evidenced by the decrease in our SG&A spend on a percentage basis year-over-year. We also continue to leverage revenue synergy opportunities by operating as One Mylan. 
With now 3 quarters under our belt, these acquisitions are exceeding our expectations, and we are well positioned to leverage these assets and see continued benefits from these assets. 
With regards to our operating platform, Mylan has always had a deep and unwavering commitment to quality everywhere we operate. FDA standards for our industry continue to evolve, and this continues to raise the bar for every player in our industry, which is something we very much welcome. 
For Mylan's part, we are dedicated to continually enhancing our systems and processes, with a deliberate and thorough approach to ensure sustainable quality across our entire network of facilities, working closely with FDA to resolve any issues that come our way. As you are aware, we recently received a warning letter at our Nashik site in India. We are working closely with the FDA to respond to and address the issues raised in the letter as comprehensively and expeditiously as possible. Production from Nashik site continues uninterrupted, and we anticipate no material impact to Mylan's overall business as a result of this warning letter. 
At the same time, we have successfully completed remediation efforts at the 3 sites acquired from Agila that were under FDA warning letters. The warning letters have been lifted at both SFF and SPD sites and we are pleased with our progress at OTL site, which also was very recently inspected by FDA. 
I note that during the quarter, we are shifting inspections by various global regulators across our 50 facilities. In fact, the Nashik site is in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and MHRA, which inspected the site following FDA and issued a GMP-compliant certificate. 
Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs. With regards to our biosimilar portfolio, we continue to make good progress on our application and are working closely with the various health authorities on their reviews and with regard to the GCP and GMP inspection of our facilities. We remain on track with all key programs, including insulin Glargine. 
As a reminder, during the quarter, we announced that we agreed to the terms of a global settlement with Genentech and Roche in relation to patents from Herceptin, which provides Mylan with global licenses for our trastuzumab product, excluding Brazil, Japan and Mexico. This global license will provide a clear pathway for Mylan to commercialize its product in various markets around the world, commencing on the license effective date. 
As of this quarter, we now have approvals for our trastuzumab biosimilar in 15 developing markets. 
On the respiratory front, we received a complete response letter from FDA regarding our ANDA for generic Advair Diskus. We have carefully assessed the CRL, which represents the full review of ANDA from all FDA disciplines. Although it's designated as a major CRL, we have a difference of opinion with the agency on certain items raised in the CRL. We believe that the resolution of some of these points, based on our previously agreed-upon protocols with FDA, can potentially change this major designation of the CRL. In any event, the agency has again expressly confirmed that they consider this application a high priority. 
For these reasons, it's important for us to have this interaction with FDA before we can commence further upon the potential impact of the CRL. Regardless of the timing, we remain confident that there will be a significant market opportunity for a substitutable generic to Advair, and the demand for this product will be strong. 
I would also like to note that we are ready from both a manufacturing and commercial perspective to launch upon approval. It's important to note that our Dublin manufacturing facility was inspected by FDA in June of [ 2015 ], and we have been informed that this facility is in good standing.
Turning to Copaxone. We have a target action date for both the 20 milligram and 40 milligram for next month. We see no reason that these dates cannot be met. We believe that all scientific questions have been resolved to FDA's satisfaction, and we also believe that there are no facility GMP issues that should be a barrier to approval of this ANDA. 
Generally speaking, we believe that the process for approving complex generics continues to be an area that requires greater focus and clarity, and we believe that FDA's committed to enhancing its capabilities and approach in this area. We are encouraged by the comments by the new FDA commissioner that this process will be a priority for him as he assumes his new office. 
We remain very committed to investing in complex products through our robust R&D efforts. Mylan is distinguished from many of our competitors as a result of our willingness to make the substantial investments required over the long term to continue to bring these needed products to the patients. Although you will continue to see some variability in our quarterly R&D spending due to timing of program expense, there is no change to our overall commitment to investment in R&D. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on commercial landscape. Thank you."

As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across all of our regions, with very strong double-digit growth in Europe and Rest of World and solid performance in North America. We also continue to see growth from our global key brands around the world. 
As in previous recent quarters, the pricing environment remains a topic of much discussion throughout our industry. We are pleased that as a result of our diversity from a product, channel and geographic perspective, our expectations for the global pricing environment are unchanged, and we are still predicting mid-single-digit price erosion globally for the year. 
This quarter, we actually saw price erosion in the low single digits on a global basis while price erosion in our U.S. generics business was in the mid-single digits. 
Looking ahead in the U.S., we have several meaningful first-to-market products that launched in 2016 that have come off their exclusivity periods, which will cause fluctuations and skew year-over-year comparisons in the coming quarters. This being said, excluding these products from our future outlook, we expect that our U.S.-based business will continue to maintain annualized erosion in the mid-single digits. 
Let me reiterate again that we continue to believe we will see mid-single-digit price erosion for our global business for the remainder of the year, including all products. 
With respect to EpiPen, the authorized generic continues to gain traction and now represents almost 40% of the epinephrine auto-injector market. Additionally, we have seen market growth pick up to more than 10% year-over-year for the category. The AG also continues to have the lowest wholesale acquisition cost of any epinephrine auto-injector on the market. 
That said, competitive activity in this space continues to be robust, and our overall shares declined from last year. You are aware of the worldwide recall of 20-plus lots of EpiPen by the manufacturer, Pfizer's Meridian Medical Technologies. We quickly implemented a voucher program for patients to replace any impacted product and successfully been executing on this program. We, in partnership with our customers, continue to communicate to impacted patients and replace their product as efficiently as possible while ensuring these patients have no additional out-of-pocket costs. We also note that Meridian Medical Technologies is contractually responsible for the recall cost.
We continue to be very pleased with the contribution from the assets we have acquired, which have even further strengthened our broad portfolio offering for our customers. For example, during the first quarter, we completed our acquisition of Cold-EEZE as we continue to expand our OTC business. Cold-EEZE is now Mylan's largest U.S. consumer health care brand, and we look forward to serving this loyal customer base and supporting this well-known brand. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."

First quarter revenues grew to $2.7 billion, and that's an increase of 24% over the first quarter of last year. This increase included growth in third-party net sales of 5% in our North America segment, 53% in our Europe segment and 34% in our Rest of World segment. The key drivers to these increases were net sales from the acquisitions of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business, which totaled approximately $607 million in the quarter. 
These increases were partially offset by an $86 million net decrease in the combination of sales, driven by the impact of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products. For the quarter, we continue to experience global generic price deflation in the low single digits. 
As Rajiv mentioned, net sales from our North America segment reached $1.2 billion and grew by 5%, up approximately 20% excluding EpiPen Auto-Injector. Net sales from acquisitions contributed approximately $182 million of the sales growth, and partially offsetting this increase was a net decrease in sales from the combination of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products. In addition, segment profitability increased 3%. 
Net sales in our Europe segment increased by approximately $308 million or 53%. The acquisition of Meda contributed approximately $338 million of the sales growth, and this increase was partially offset by a net decrease in sales from the combination of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 4%. Segment profitability in Europe increased approximately 88% year-over-year. 
Net sales from our Rest of World segment increased by approximately $146 million or 34%. This increase was driven largely by an acquisition of Meda, which totaled approximately $87 million. In addition, higher volume from existing products, primarily in our antiretroviral franchise, plus an increase in new products more than offset ongoing pricing headwinds. Net sales in this segment were favorably impacted by approximately 3% due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Segment profitability in Rest of World increased approximately 159% in the quarter. 
Adjusted gross margins for the first quarter of 2017 were 53%. That's down less than 60 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to the impact from the launch of the EpiPen Auto-Injector authorized generic as well as additional competition and partially offset by the contributions from prior year acquisitions. 
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D declined to $151 million, equating to approximately 6% of revenues, which was in line with our expectations. SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, increased to $592 million, primarily as the result of selling and marketing costs from the acquired businesses. However, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues declined by 1.3 percentage points to approximately 22% of sales as increased revenues from the acquired businesses and benefits of Mylan integration were realized in the quarter. 
Our adjusted tax rate was 17.5% for the first quarter of 2017, which was also in line with our expectations. Adjusted net earnings increased by $114 million to $500 million in the quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.93 compared to $0.76 in the prior year quarter. 
Turning to cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong at $536 million for the first 3 months of the year compared to $202 million for the prior year. The increase in the current quarter was mostly driven by favorable timing of working capital, including receivables, due to the December launch of the EpiPen authorized generic. 
We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivables securitization or revolving credit facility. At the end of Q1 2017, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio declined to approximately 3.7x as compared to 3.8x at the end of 2016. 
On a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, we were at 3.5x at the end of the first quarter. We're fully committed to our investment-grade rating and to reducing our debt, as evidenced by our voluntary prepayment of $550 million on our 2016 term loans during the first quarter. 
We have no significant near-term debt maturities and remain committed to moving towards our long-term average target leverage ratio of approximately 3x EBITDA. We have the financial flexibility to achieve this goal while still deploying capital for strategic acquisitions. 
As you can see, we started off the year strong, and we're very pleased with our operational and financial results for the first 3 months of the year. We remain committed to our previously communicated full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55, which keeps us on track to realizing our $6 adjusted EPS goal in 2018. 
In terms of phasing, we continue to see the relative percentage contribution from the first half of 2017 to be consistent with the percentage contribution of the first half of 2016. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

Given our portfolio, our breadth and our geographical reach, our ability to not only supply the level of demand that is needed but to be able to do so on a global basis. And I think what we've seen is the continued strength as these customers have consolidated our ability to really leverage our entire portfolio as well as our pipeline. We've got some important products coming, and what I would say is I can appreciate some of the players that are in one country or geographically landlocked or from a product perspective, not being able to meet some of the supply and demand needed on a global basis.

Regarding generic Advair, so let me reiterate that this submission was done in complete accordance to the products that we've guided and pre-agreed protocols, and we have not been asked to do any additional clinical endpoint or device-related studies at this juncture. What we have been asked is now that some of the studies, especially the device-related studies, we have now been asked to analyze and report our findings of our study against a newly issued industry draft guidance for [indiscernible] human factor studies, draft guidance. So that's what we want to go back and discuss with the FDA and we can get this meeting any day. We have been waiting for this meeting, and it can happen any moment or any day, and we can only comment upon the potential impact of this CRL once we have these discussions behind us.

And I'm just wondering if that's related to the recall? Is that the new level of sales that we should expect? Will that continue to erode? Help us to think about that. And secondly, in terms of your revenue guide, which I don't know that I've heard you reiterate, if you do want to, this is good opportunity, if not, that says something, too, but to hit the low end of your revenue guide would seem to require about $350 million in new products sales.

We've got a lot of moving pieces and parts. We're trying to be reflective of how we're running and driving this business, which is completely leveraging all of these channels from generics brands and branded generics and OTCs and how we're leveraging those in countries. So I really appreciate your recognition of that, and we're going to continue to do so. And the one thing I'll just say on EpiPen and I'll let Ken get into some of the financials is that as we said on Investor Day, Jami, we anticipated a big change in EpiPen, and we knew that it would continue to be a mix of -- between the AG and the brand, and we continue to see that conversion. But the reality is people had a very strong loyalty to the brand EpiPen and it's continued to be an education to let them know that it's the same product.

With that number, you've done the math, you can model it. You're kind of right in the ballpark. As far as projecting out the year, we don't give any quarterly kind of run rate on EpiPen. But as Heather said, what happened in the quarter was very consistent with what we expected. The recall did occur. We disclosed both in the Q and in our commentary that the cost of the recall is recoverable. That has driven a little bit of change in trend in some of the sales number but nothing of significance. But to reiterate, we said at Investor Day that year-over-year EpiPen profitability at the operating profit level will be down $400 million year-over-year, a huge number. $500 million at the gross profit level, offset by some reduction in spending in sales and marketing. And that's exactly where we're moving through right now. So you've done the math, you're right in the right ballpark, and everything is exactly how we expected it. As far as new products, we said we'd have about $850 million contribution this year year-over-year for new products, and at this point in time, we're working towards that road map. It's a long list of products and whether it be at the low end, the mid, we're generating those new product launches in order to drive the $850 million."

So if you could just educate us on how you calculate U.S. price declines, that would be helpful. Second, with respect to Biocon, could you please review the economics how Mylan books revenue and profits associated with Biocon products? And I'm guessing that may differ by geography. And then finally, you disclosed global Meda and Renaissance revenue of $606 million. Now last year, we had run rates and I thought these were provided by the company or I'm not sure where we got these from, but we had a total revenue run rate of about $650 million from the 2.

So while we're breaking out for 1 year post acquisitions because that visibility on our legacy business to try to start now dissecting between the acquisitions, I don't think would be useful because it's really what we're being able to drive out of this asset in totality that is driving the results that you're seeing. As far as Biocon, I don't believe we've given the contractual relationship. What I can tell you, obviously, we have a very important partnership with Biocon and continue to be very happy with the performance, both in the products that are already approved and marketing and those that are in the pipeline. So that continues to be a very important partnership. And as far as price decline, I think Tony laid it out. I don't know if there's any other visibility. But I think that's why we try to give the dynamics around the fact that where you have a first-to-market opportunity and you're the only plan to market and then there's 5 or 6 players in the market overnight, that certainly can drive a little bit of anomaly and volatility as you look at a year or comparisons year-over-year, which is the point we were trying to make.

Can you talk a little bit about when you decided it's about time to stop selling a particular product? Is this something we should expect, the strategic direction that the company has taken to walk away from unprofitable business? And then last, one of the things we try to do always is cross over between the previous quarter and this quarter.

With that being said, I think Ken at Investor Day kind of laid out what we saw corresponding quarters and proportionality from '16 to '17 that would help for modeling purposes if you look at the percentage of the businesses. So again, I think what we couldn't be more excited about is the resiliency of this platform and the fact that the seasonality for any product or given market, we're able to now really absorb that and show this contribution continuing to grow in a meaningful way and not being so much subjected to seasonality."

So even though seasonality may move around a bit and you followed us long enough to know that the second half is a bigger half than the first half is, we don't see a significant amount of variation in that. We saw in the first quarter what we have an outlook for, for the year. Specifically, as far as new product introductions, new product launches this year we indicated will be heavier, obviously, in the second half. Last year, I would say if you're looking at fourth quarter to first quarter, not significantly different because they were lighter new product launch quarters."

And I think what we've continued to show is that the assets that we've pulled together on a global basis have allowed us to drive not only a different conversation but a reliable supply chain. Our commitment to generics over the past 55 years and certainly the investment we've made in important complex generics like generic Advair and our biosimilars was one of the largest pipelines in the industry. So not only do our customers see us as valuable to be able to have a global partnership, but certainly our pipeline drives much of that conversation and relationship and the importance that we are to each other. So I absolutely can't underscore enough about how the platform and our differentiation is absolutely allowing us to have very different conversations than if we were just in one country with a niche portfolio."

To say that times are changing would be an understatement. However, as history shows, it's during times like these that industries and companies transform themselves. The gen",1077,"Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. To say that times are changing would be an understatement. However, as history shows, it's during times like these that industries and companies transform themselves. The generic as well as the entire health care industry is now at an inflection point, and every company's intersection with this point is unique. 
Our transformation from a domestic company started a decade ago when we committed to a strategy of globalization, diversification and scale. As important as developing our strategy is how we have consistently executed against it and further derisk our platform. We have been very purposeful on the types of acquisitions we do, and we are very disciplined about integrating them. We undertook this strategy because of the volatility inherent in any geographic- or product-centric model. Since 2007, this strategy has allowed us to overcome periods of intense competition, consolidation, unpredictable regulatory environments and geographic economic fluctuations around the world. 
At times, this may have seemed like the road less traveled, but given the industry environment today, I believe the path we chose and our patience and commitment to deliver over the long term is paying off given our guidance and especially our outlook in the face of the significant headwinds in the U.S. market. In fact, there's never been a better time to recognize how unique our intersection with the industry is. We have built a global pharmaceutical company that is a leader in each of our geographical regions and which no longer resembles the companies that are focused solely on running just generic and/or Specialty pharmaceutical businesses. This is precisely why we introduced new geographical reporting segments at the end of last year. 
In doing so, we're providing investors with visibility into how we are running and driving our business and at current valuations, believe we are also distinguishing Mylan's differentiated platform as an opportunity, creating yet another new entry point for investors to come into our security. 
Our second quarter performance is a testament to the importance of diversity and building for the long term. We generated total revenues of close to $3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase that was driven by growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments, which now account for more than 50% of Mylan's overall revenues. 
On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $590 million or adjusted EPS of $1.10, down 5% compared to the same period in 2016. While Europe and Rest of World grew significantly as expected, our North America segment was down considerably year-over-year due to delayed launches in EpiPen. We expect these dynamics to continue for some time and for approval delays to persist this year as the FDA continues to reorganize and adapt its processes and priorities. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2017, we continue to have great confidence in our underlying business in every region. However, given this unpredictability and in an abundance of caution, we have removed Copaxone and Advair from our 2017 financial guidance and have simply deferred them to 2018. 
As a result of rebasing our North America business, we now expect to deliver total revenues this year of between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion and adjusted EPS of between $4.30 and $4.70. Our outlook for Europe and Rest of World remains essentially in line with our previously stated expectations. And similarly, we expect no further adjustments to what we already have laid out with respect to EpiPen. 
I note as well that given our breadth, diversification and ability to matter more to customers, our outlook reflects global generic pricing erosion in the mid-single digits, which now takes into account high single-digit erosion in North America Generics. 
Turning to 2018. We're moving our targeted adjusted EPS to at least $5.40 for the year, revised from $6. This new target represents 20% growth over 2017 based on the midpoint of our revised range. It incorporates a rebasing of the impact of deferred key U.S. launches and their associated contributions to profitability, AB generic competition to EpiPen, further optimization of our commercial and operational platforms and capital deployment as we utilize our financial flexibility. 
So yes, this was a tough quarter, and it'll be a challenging year due to the volatility and uncertainty in the U.S., the world's largest pharmaceutical market. But we have and in the past and still are not managing this company quarter-to-quarter. We're managing it for the long term, and that's why today, we've been able to maintain our business while continuing to invest and build for sustainable growth. 
Further, as CEO, I can assure you that given our depressed share price, I'm very focused on continuing to engage and educate investors about the true value of Mylan's unique and highly differentiated platform. Indeed, when we step back and look at our business holistically, we find ourselves more confident and optimistic than ever about Mylan's prospects. We have a product portfolio and pipeline that is exceptionally deep and broad covering numerous important therapeutic franchises, including medicines for which demand is very strong and growing rapidly such as respiratory products and biosimilars. 
A great example of the latter is our proposed biosimilar for trastuzumab, which recently received a unanimous vote recommending approval from FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee. As impressive is the sheer scale and scope of our operational and commercial infrastructure, which positions us to truly expand the world's access to high-quality products and meet the needs of the industry's dynamic and rapidly consolidating customer base. 
We also continue to have financial flexibility given our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation. In addition, unlike many of our peers, we have a very stable and perhaps one of the most experienced leadership teams in this industry. We believe its continuity reflects the soundness of our strategy, our unwavering focus on building for the long term and the resilience of our culture. 
For all of these reasons, we believe that Mylan's best years lie ahead, which is particularly meaningful given the 25% CAGR and adjusted EPS that we delivered between 2008 and 2016. For making this opportunity possible and for our second quarter performance, I'd like, on behalf of Mylan's board and entire leadership team, to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution and for their continued commitment to delivering better health for a better world. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv."

Before I begin, I, too, would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and continued unwavering focus on our mission and business objective despite the challenges that come our way. 
Let's turn to the second quarter results. I'll provide an overview of our top line performance, and Ken will get into the segment profitability. 
Overall, we delivered nearly USD 3 billion in total revenues for the quarter, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year. As Heather noted, this performance is a result of the breadth, diversity and resilience of our global integrated platform, which has given us the strength to manage the headwinds and ensure long-term sustainability. 
This quarter, the headwinds came primarily from the U.S., where challenging market dynamics accelerated. However, our performance in our Europe and ROW segments delivered on our expectations. 
I'm especially pleased with the performance of our Meda and Topicals Business acquisitions, which continue to meet and exceed our expectations in their contributions. Let me provide some more detail on the challenging environment in North America, especially in U.S., which resulted in third-party net sales declining by 9% to about $1.3 billion. 
I note that the reason we'll have seen an increase of 4% if not for higher-than-anticipated negative impact from EpiPen Auto-Injector. During the quarter, we saw increased competition resulting from FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth or fifth Generics. Unfortunately, we have not seen the same for the first Generics nor for more complex and niche products, which we believe have been impacted by the recent ongoing reorganization within FDA. 
However, while the timing of realizing some of these opportunities may be delayed, our confidence in our ability to bring these products to market and maximize their potential has not changed. To be prudent, we have taken contribution from the major product launches in U.S. out of our guidance for 2017. 
That said, we continue to remain optimistic based on commentary by Commissioner Bartlett and other senior FDA officers that FDA is committed to enhancing its capabilities and approval process for complex Generics. 
Another consistent pressure point in our industry is pricing, where again, our approach operating global scale and diversity continues to help us manage the challenging conditions. While we will continue to see choppiness in pricing across individual markets exemplified by increasing pressure in the U.S., the global generic pricing environment this quarter was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance. 
However, given the environment in U.S.A., we have adjusted our expectations for a price erosion in our global Generics business to mid-single digits for the year. Tony will further elaborate on this topic. 
Turning to Europe. Sales totaled more than $950 million, a year-over-year increase of 59%. The increase was primarily the result of contributions from the Meda acquisition. In Rest of the World, sales totaled approximately $690 million, a year-over-year increase of 29%. This increase was primarily driven by the Meda acquisition along with sales from new products and higher volumes from existing product, which more than offset lower pricing. 
Shifting to integration. We continue to make good progress in the integration of Mylan as evidenced by 150 basis point decline year-over-year in our adjusted SG&A spend as a percentage of total revenues. In recognition of the challenging environment we are operating in, we continue to identify additional cost synergies as well as revenue synergy opportunities that we expect to realize in 2017, 2018 time frame. 
Let me now talk about generic Copaxone and generic Advair. Regarding Copaxone, we are disappointed with the execution by FDA of this complex ANDA as the administrative time line continues to move despite a number of interactions as well as meeting all of the criteria as for the product-specific guidance issued by FDA. Having said that, we strongly believe in our science and have no spending scientific question or any additional studies required at this time and are looking forward to this long-standing approval. 
On generic Advair front, we very recently met with FDA with regards to the complete response letter, which we received in the late March. We were pleased with highly constructive nature of our dialogue with the agency, and we were able to clarify and resolve a number of key points raised in the CRL. 
Based on this interaction, we can confirm that no further clinical or device-related studies are required, and we plan to submit our response to the CRL in the next couple of weeks. We believe that agency continues to consider this application as a high priority, and we continue to be ready for both a manufacturing as well as commercial prospective to launch upon approval. 
However, given the unpredictability of timing and in an abundance of caution, we have removed Copaxone and Advair from our 2017 financial guidance and have simply deferred them to 2018. Given all of this, we are very confident in our revised guidance for 2017. 
With regards to our operating platform, we are in the constructive dialogue with the FDA regarding the warning letter that our Nashik site in India received earlier this year. We are working closely with the agency to comprehensively resolve their 2 observations as expeditiously as possible. The site remains in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and NHRA. Unfortunately, the warning letter has delayed new U.S. launches from this site. 
We are pleased to have had a warning letter from Agila on quality site lifted during this quarter, joining SSF and SPD in being cleared by FDA. With this warning letter now lifted and new approvals from these sites accelerating, we see the opportunity to further support the unmet needs in the injectables space. 
Turning now to some of our other pipeline programs, which will be key drivers of our future growth. Starting with our biosimilar portfolio. We are very pleased with the progress of our programs from a development perspective. We received unanimous approval from FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee for our proposed biosimilar, trastuzumab, last month. This is a very important milestone, not just for this product, but also for our overall biosimilars program and demonstrates the strength of our science in this complex area. We continue to execute on the review of our global submissions of trastuzumab and pegfilgrastim and working closely with our partner, Biocon, and the health authorities to address any outstanding issues. 
In addition, our proposed biosimilar, bevacizumab, also in partnership with Biocon, recently received approval from the Indian drug regulator. We look forward to bring a more affordable, automated for metastatic colorectal cancer and lung cancer to patients in India and other Rest of the World markets. 
Our programs with Momenta are also progressing well. We expect to report top line data for the Phase I study for our biosimilar, ORENCIA, candidate by the end of the year. We are also advancing the development of M710, the next biosimilar candidate that we and Momenta are developing as part of our collaboration and [indiscernible] are now starting clinical studies in 2018. 
As a reminder, we have no material contributions from biosimilars in our guidance for 2017 or in our 2018 target. 
With regards to our insulin Glargine program, we presented data from the INSTRIDE study at the American Diabetes Association's Scientific Session in San Diego, which demonstrated the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Mylan's insulin Glargine in comparison to Lantus in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Our regulatory applications are in active review for Europe, Australia and Canada. 
From the U.S. commercial manufacturing study point of view, we have decided to include the manufacturing site variations from Bangalore to Malaysia upfront in their applications rather than as a postapproval chain. We are meeting with the FDA very shortly to reach agreement regarding their expectation in this regard for the U.S. filing. 
Our revefenacin collaboration with Theravance Biopharma for COPD continues to deliver results at every step along the development path. We recently announced positive results from a 12-month Phase III safety study, which demonstrated that revefenacin was generally well tolerated and no new safety issues were identified. We know feel that we have all the data necessary to support a successful NDA filing later this year. 
Turning to our infectious disease franchise. Our ARV business has been further strengthened by the first approval from WHO for new ARV combination specifically TLE400 and a TLD a triple combination with, which both have [indiscernible] approval by FDA under. 
We also recently received first approval from WHO Prequalification of Medicines Program for our generic version of Gilead Sovaldi, which will be available in developing countries. As we said, the foundation of our business remains strong, and the rebased 2017 business provides opportunities for us going forward. 
Let me now provide you some backdrop to our revised adjusted EPS target of at least $5.40 in 2018, which represents 20% growth from 2017 based on the midpoint of our revised adjusted EPS guidance announced today. In revising this target, we took into consideration the current headwinds we face in the U.S.A., including increased competition on our base business and have assumed that they will continue through 2018. We have also assumed that launches deferred from 2017 will happen in 2018. 
However, we have adjusted our expectations for the contributions from these new launches. This includes anticipated launches of generic Advair and generic Copaxone. We have also taken into account the full impact of an anticipated launch of an AB substitutable generic to EpiPen. Further, we continue to identify additional cost savings opportunities from the continued rationalization and optimization of our platform above and beyond the targets communicated at Investor Day. We have recognized that the U.S. industry outlook has changed substantially, and we are rapidly adapting our business to reflect these new market dynamics. 
That said, we see additional growth opportunities outside the U.S.A. as we successfully integrate our platform and operate as One Mylan in these geographies. We also have maintained financial flexibility in order to ensure we can pursue additional business development opportunities as they arise. 
There are many assets becoming available, and we will be opportunistic and prudent in pursuing those that will be a right fit for our business, filling a product or geographic gaps. With the commercial footprint we have in place, there are great opportunities to drop in [ one ] product and get more out of them as part of One Mylan. 
In summary, as it relates to the platform portfolio and pipeline, we have built and our proven capability to execute. Mylan remains extremely well positioned to meet the needs of customers and patients around the world. Our industry can be challenging one, but we had built to overcome and weather these challenges like few other companies are, and we have in place more opportunities than ever before. As a result, I am very confident in our future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on commercial landscape. Thank you."

I would like to reiterate the confidence you heard from Heather and Rajiv in the underlying strength of our businesses around the world, our proven ability to overcome adversity in our business environment and",985,"Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. I would like to reiterate the confidence you heard from Heather and Rajiv in the underlying strength of our businesses around the world, our proven ability to overcome adversity in our business environment and the many opportunities we have for continued commercial leadership and sustainable growth. 
I would now like to provide a framework for the management and commercial execution around our business from a geographic segment perspective, selling our broad portfolio across all channels in a holistic manner as One Mylan as we focus on being a partner of choice to our customers. 
We will start with our strong performance in Europe, which demonstrates what we've been able to build in this region over the past several years through continued and consistent execution and effective integration of the entire Mylan platform, most recently the Meda acquisition. 
As a result of the focus on execution, Europe now makes up more than 30% of our total revenues. We have been able to successfully maintain and expand upon our leadership positions in countries like France, Italy, and Portugal while capitalizing on meaningful growth opportunities in the U.K., Germany and Spain. 
Our European business is also diversified across channels, with strong positions across brands, Generics and now OTC, where we have an established presence from the Meda acquisition. We are encouraged by the growth potential of our brands in the regions such as Dymista, Creon, Brufen and Betadine, and we are also excited about our strong future pipeline. 
Our Rest of World segment continues to show double-digit revenue growth and now makes up more than 20% of our total revenues. While our ARV business continues to perform strongly, we are very pleased that the integrated platform we have built in key geographic markets is also yielding benefits. 
For instance, we saw strong performance of 20% plus revenue growth in Australia, a market where we have successfully integrated our platform and are now selling across all channels. We continue to be the market leader in New Zealand and have experienced growth in Japan. 
Today, we are one of the top 5 generic companies in Japan, and we continue to seek ways to optimize our assets and develop new partnerships in this market. We also have high expectations for growth opportunities for many of our products in key emerging markets such as China and Russia. 
Further, we are excited about the integration of Meda products around the region. We see key brands such as Dona, Elavil and ArmoLIPID being additional growth opportunities for us. 
Moving to our business in North America, which now represents less than 50% of our total revenues, we have built comprehensive business in this region focusing on generic retail, Institutional, branded and a small but fast-growing OTC business. 
As in our other regions, we are selling our portfolio across this entire platform as One Mylan. As Rajiv discussed, we have had a challenging quarter in North America, with pressures arising from both accelerated new approvals on our existing generic products and continued consolidation of our U.S. customer base. 
Specifically, contributions from new product launches in the U.S. was among the lowest in recent history. At the same time, we are seeing increased competitive pressure on our existing products as FDA focuses on bringing more competition to already genericized products through accelerated approvals. 
As noted in industry reports, in Q2, we saw a much higher number of approvals for competitors on our existing base business than we've seen historically or anticipated. While these dynamics have continued to put pressure on pricing in the region, overall price erosion in our North American Generics business remain in the mid-single digits for the quarter, in line with our expectations and global trends. 
However, as we noted last quarter, we expect fluctuations in the pricing environment in the third and fourth quarter due to having several meaningful first-to-market products that launched in 2016 come off of their exclusivity periods as well as accelerated competition on our base business. As a result of these factors, we expect to see full year price erosion for our North American Generics business in the high single digits. 
We were able to offset some of this choppiness through our global diversity with several bright spots in the U.S. and elsewhere, which is why our global Generics price erosion for the quarter and expectations for the year are mid-single digits. 
Turning to EpiPen. Decline in this product was more than forecasted, primarily due to increased competition and the impact of the launch of the authorized generic. We now represent more than 70% of the total epinephrine auto-injector market through our branded and authorized generic products. 
While the competition in this market remains robust, our customers and patients continue to value this product. Despite the many challenges this quarter, we firmly believe that our underlying business in North America is solid and that our scale and breadth will serve us well for the long term and continue to differentiate us. 
As the industry transforms like it has many times over the last 20 years and customers' consolidation continues, success in this region will be defined by those who offer the most robust and diverse product offerings across channels, deliver industry-leading customer service levels and commit to investing in complex new products with longer opportunity horizons. 
Those attributes define Mylan. While we always will see fluctuations on a quarter-by-quarter basis in relation to specific products and individual markets, and sometimes these fluctuations may be dramatic, over the long-term horizon, we believe we can deliver a consistent and sustainable growth by focusing on supply, diversification and new product introductions. In fact, I feel like we are just getting started on maximizing our powerful commercial platform, and I continue to be very excited about the commercial opportunities we see in each of our regions. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."
290203,531267085,1273974,"Mylan N.V., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2017",2017-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results and summary. In Q2, we delivered total revenues of approximately $3 billion. That's an increase of 16% over the same period last year. This increase included growth in third-party",1041,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results and summary. In Q2, we delivered total revenues of approximately $3 billion. That's an increase of 16% over the same period last year. This increase included growth in third-party net sales in both our European and Rest of World segments, which were up 59% and 29%, respectively. 
The growth in both segments was largely driven by contributions from our acquisitions last year of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business. Acquisitions also contributed to our North America segment more than $150 million, which helped to mitigate some of the impact associated with the decline in our EpiPen business, along with mid-single-digit generic price erosion that Tony just spoke about. 
As a result of these headwinds, our North American segment third-party net sales declined 9% year-over-year. And excluding the decline in EpiPen, North America was up 4%, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio and our ability to absorb the ongoing challenging dynamics in the U.S. 
On a consolidated basis, we reported adjusted gross margins of approximately 54% in the current quarter compared to approximately 56% in the same period last year. The decline is the result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, including EpiPen, partially mitigated by contributions from last year's acquisitions. 
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D was approximately 6% of total revenues or $171 million, which was in line with the prior year, including the incremental impact from acquisitions. 
Adjusted SG&A increased to $583 million, primarily due to integrating the acquired businesses. However, I'll point out that adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues declined 150 basis points to less than 20%, driven by increased revenues from the acquired businesses along with benefits of Mylan integration. 
Moving to profitability. In Q2, adjusted earnings from operations was up approximately 15% when compared to the prior year. Similar to total revenue, the strong performance was largely due to increases in European and Rest of World segments, partially offset by declines in North America associated with the impact of EpiPen and the U.S. market dynamics discussed. 
Europe segment profitability was up 114%, and Rest of World segment profitability was up 197%, both reflecting contributions from the Meda acquisition as well as new product sales. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.10, which was down 5% when compared to the second quarter of last year. The decline was due to a higher adjusted effective tax rate, reflecting the impact of key product launch delays. In addition, our adjusted net earnings were also impacted by higher interest expense and share count when compared to the prior year, resulting from the acquisition of Meda. 
Briefly turning to our results for the 6 months ended June 30. Total revenues increased 20% to $5.7 billion. That includes acquisition contributions of approximately $1.2 billion. 
In addition, our adjusted net earnings for the 6 months ended June 30 increased $111 million to $1.1 billion, and adjusted EPS increased 6% to $2.03. 
Now turning to cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was very strong at $664 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2017. That compares to $485 million for the prior year. The increase in the current quarter is driven by favorable working capital performance. I'll note that on a year-to-date basis, just a net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion compared to $687 million for the prior year. 
For the full year, even with our new adjusted EPS guidance range, we still expect to deliver on our initial cash flow guidance. In 2017, we said we expect to generate $2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow, net of $400 million to $500 million of capital expenditures. 
Our ability to generate strong cash flows continues to support the strength of our balance sheet and provide financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business. 
Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, was approximately 3.8x, and that's in line with the level at the end of 2016. While we continue to execute on our commitment to deleverage as evidenced by our voluntary debt prepayment of more than $800 million in the first half of the year, we expect our leverage ratio at the end of the year will be higher than we had initially indicated. 
As a result of our revised EBITDA guidance, we now forecast our year-end debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to be closer to 3.7x. We remain fully committed to our deleveraging strategy, to compliance with our covenant requirements, to our long-term average debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3x and most importantly, to our investment-grade credit rating. 
In our earnings materials this morning, you saw a comprehensive table detailing our revised 2017 guidance ranges. Before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to comment briefly on a few items in that table. 
As you heard earlier, as a result of the impact from delayed approvals by the FDA for complex products, including generic Advair and generic Copaxone as well as the impact from the accelerated competitive U.S. market dynamic, including further price erosion in the U.S., we revised our full year 2017 guidance ranges. 
We're lowering our previous total revenue guidance range of $12.25 billion to $13.75 billion of revenues to our current range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, which now represents an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus full year 2016. 
As a result of the lower top line expectations, along with a dilutive impact that we'll have on our adjusted gross margins and effective tax rate and despite incremental cost-saving actions, we've also revised our adjusted EPS guidance down from the previous range of $5.15 to $5.55 per share to our new range of between $4.30 to $4.70 per share. That's a decrease of 8% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. 
As both Heather and Rajiv have already noted this morning, we're targeting at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS in 2018. We'll continue to work through our planning process, and we'll provide further updates as we get closer to setting our official 2018 guidance. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

Clearly, we're all in a new environment. It's a tough environment for all of these companies, but this is also an industry that has maintained roughly 30% operating margins over a long period of time with improvements year-on-year. Now we're entering a period where we're seeing margin degradation. Where are we in this cycle of things? In other words, how much lower can margins go? And, on the other hand, can they get back to where they were before? It seems to me that it's all entirely dependent on new product launches. But assuming product launches don't occur, how much lower can those margins go? And if I could just stick in another one, and it's kind of related, Heather, can you just talk about how your scale gives you leverage over the consolidated customers? It seems that Teva has said scale really hasn't helped them. And based on the new guidance for this year for Mylan, it would appear that scale may not be helping you either. So if you could address those 2 topics, I'd appreciate it."

So yes, I'll start off, and then anyone else who wants to jump in can. So I guess, here's what I would say. I think this goes back fundamentally when you talk about the margins and what does this business look like going forward, I think again, if we just stick within the United States, the diversity of your product portfolio I think is incredibly important. And I think that as you hear us continue to talk about not only that diversification from Institutional to retail to continuing to build upon our OTC footprint, that kind of diversity within a segment absolutely helps maintain the margins that you've been used to. And I think importantly, to your comment, new product launches, when you think about complex new market formation and as we enter the biosimilar arena. So I do believe that those are going to be able to maintain the levels that you've been used to. Now with that being said, I think we're at a moment in time with the FDA that it's those launches that have continued to have some delay in timing. But they will come, and I think it's companies who have been able to invest and continue to maintain that investment in R&D and bring those important products to market is what will continue to differentiate companies that are able to maintain, I think, those margins that this industry has been used to for some time. But I don't think -- as always, one size doesn't fit all, and I don't think everybody's going to be able to maintain that. And I think having the levers to manage and maintain your portfolio to account for that is going to be very important. I think as far as scale goes, again, I think you have to differentiate scale. I think that as you referenced, Teva, where they really doubled down on scale in the last [ 2 ] years within the United States. And I would say that as we see this market changing dramatically and transforming itself, that perhaps more of the same in this market isn't going to get you very much. And I think that we've been pretty vocal and consistent about that over the last couple of years. When you think about scale, scale over the global platform as you look at Mylan today with over 50% of our revenues coming outside the United States, and us really doubling over the last [ 2 ] years about building, not only Europe, Rest of World but our global supply chain, our vertical integration, it's that sustainability and differentiation that I absolutely believe will continue to pay off. Yes, are there challenges in this U.S. market, which is the largest pharmaceutical market in the world? Absolutely, and we're not running away from that. What we're saying is Mylan's ability to withstand those challenges [indiscernible] stronger, and this U.S. market is definitely what we're confident in. But it's our global scale across these regions, both from an operation and a commercial perspective, which I think is what will continue to be able to differentiate ourselves. And as I said, I can assure you, I'm committed as CEO to get out there and make sure we're engaged in educating that investors really have the opportunity to understand our opportunities outside the U.S. as well as those that are coming with all the pipeline products that Rajiv spoke about."

Having said that, as I told you, we remain very confident. We see no issue of bringing to the market, and it's a timing issue, and that's what we are trying to adjust. On Neulasta, we continue to work with FDA. We continue to work on the science as well as on the GMP front. And as you know, we have not factored in any revenues even in 2018 any meaningful way from biosimilars.

When you look at -- on both fronts, the continued delay on new, complex key market or key product launches and as we've said, and I can't underscore this enough, we honestly see the administrative as the barrier, not the science. And I think we are, I can assure you, working diligently to daily be in contact with the FDA and work through these issues, and I'm highly optimistic that given even the new commissioner's recent commentary that this is a very important area, they recognize that getting these products to market are important. So -- but if you say the delay of those launches as well if you look over the last 2 months, I think the acceleration of almost near double of approvals in these already commoditized generic products. So when you're bringing #3, 4, 5, 6 to the market and approvals I think jumped up last month to over 90 approvals off kind of falling in that bucket, which is why we acknowledge that increased competition on the existing product and recognize and called out this high single-digit in North America or U.S. generic. So I think both of those really were the primary driver. And to your point, the first one is the most important because this isn't a permanent hit. It's a deferred one, and that's why we did what we thought was the most prudent thing to do of pushing those into '18. But I can tell you we're fighting everyday to have them come as soon as they possibly can. So after that, I think things like EpiPen, I mean, you think of all of the different kind of compounding factors that have culminated right now. I think that's kind of finding its footing, and I think important to recognize that we're down to -- it's going to less than 5% of this company's profit going forward. So I mean, we -- I think it definitely rebased itself, and we see that kind of final settling of where EpiPen is and what it means to us as a product. And I would say those are the 2 big factors. And as we step back because of that unpredictability, that's why we took that news we did and know that we pride ourselves on giving you guys that visibility and transparency as we see it. I think over the last year, we talked about why there's been challenges in the industry, we have not. Mylan had been able continue to absorb those challenges and that volatility. And when we get to a moment where we can say, ""You know what? The impact of both of those things moves pretty dramatically over these last couple of months, and which is why we made the steps we did but couldn't be more confident in what we put out there, and I think most importantly, excited about still offering a 20% year-over-year growth as we look into the target we've put out there for next year."" So I don't know if anybody -- okay. Thank you for that."

It doesn't seem like necessarily subsiding anytime soon. So should we be thinking about a high single-digit price erosion as something that's likely to continue for the foreseeable future? And second quick question was just on generic Advair. I believe you commented that you're going to be responding to the CRL over the next few weeks. I guess, given that near-term refiling, could we assume that there weren't any issues that you reanalyzed your device studies against the FDA draft guidance I think was one of the requests that you talked about from FDA on last quarter's call."

I do think importantly, we'll point out that they're also not just buying for the U.S. These are global now buyers coming together. And from our perspective, that being able to supply globally as well as having these important products come to market. So while they're deferred, it doesn't take away their importance. Speaking of generic Advair, which I think we still feel confident that even though deferred, we're going to be the first to bring this product to market.

We -- our global integrated platform in the segments allow us to run this and manage this business globally. Now coming back to Advair, I think I'd like to take this opportunity to clarify and explain one of the remarks I made about how reorganization with FDA can impact it. Take Advair, generic Advair. It's been a 9 year-long journey, and we had intense collaboration with FDA till definition of this ANDA and saw many face-to-face meetings and agreement on several protocols. As FDA transformed over the last 2, 3 years and emergence of GD and OPQ, many new players are coming, and many new draft guidance [indiscernible] even this year and the beginning of this year, which was on devices. So there can be different opinions, which can come at point, and that's what led to this extensive CRL which we received. We took this opportunity. We took -- FDA took about 4 months to give us this meeting, but this was one good meeting to put everything on the table and come to a good spot and agree with FDA that whatever we have provided them as part of the product-specific guidance is good enough. We don't need anymore data. We don't need anymore clinical study or device-related studies. And that's what I meant from how sometimes reorganization or transformation can impact such specially the complex and the first approval. Having said that, we have -- we are in the process of consolidating this response, and this response will be out the next week -- we have to get it within the next couple of [ days ], and we continue to work with the FDA for this high-priority product."

As you know, we've got just here in the U.S. alone over 630 products, and we have had a historical approach of risk spacing as we put products in and keep products into our assumptions. I think that's why we call out we were taken taking a prudent step to put them into 2018, and we've also not just deferred everything as at all looks the same being deferred for a year. So as my commentary noted that not only were we deferring U.S. key launches, we were taking into account their contribution. And so again, I'm looking at this whole portfolio and risk adjusting for that, but we have taken that same approach. And then like I said, prudent as we think about their contribution in 2018. As for the FDA and the prioritizing of ANDAs, look, I mean, is it where we like it to be? No. If it is where we like it to be, we would be seeing, I think, approvals of important product that have no generic competition into the marketplace. But I'm hopeful that we continue that FDA is focusing on their processes and prioritizing. We're certainly doing our part working with them, and I believe we will get there. It's just again sometimes, when you're in these transformation, FDA themselves is in a transformation and continuing that performance while you transform is sometimes difficult, but I'm truly hopeful that we get to where ANDAs are prioritized in the backlog and getting important first-to-market products to the market are at the top."

I continue to caution that you can put as much competition in that generic marketplace as you want. But as you look to the right the supply chain, the lack of competition, everything to the right of the manufacturer has continued to constrict. So not only are you down to just 3 buying groups. You're down to every single step along the way until it reaches the patients' hands. It's become a very constricted and less competitive marketplace. So I agree that I believe that as FTC and others looked at that landscape, there could be unintended consequences to letting that entire supply chain become very less competitive, meaning at the end of the day, I think what this country's going to continue to find a solution for is ultimately the product getting to patients' hands and doing it as competitively and market-driven as possible."

To say that times are changing would be an understatement. However, as history shows, it's during times like these that industries and companies transform themselves. The gen",1076,"Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. To say that times are changing would be an understatement. However, as history shows, it's during times like these that industries and companies transform themselves. The generic as well as the entire health care industry is now at an inflection point, and every company's intersection with this point is unique. 
Our transformation from a domestic company started a decade ago when we committed to a strategy of globalization, diversification and scale. As important as developing our strategy is how we have consistently executed against it and further derisked our platform. We have been very purposeful on the types of acquisitions we do, and we are very disciplined about integrating them. We undertook this strategy because of the volatility inherent in any geographic- or product-centric model. Since 2007, this strategy has allowed us to overcome periods of intense competition, consolidation, unpredictable regulatory environments and geographic economic fluctuations around the world. 
At times, this may have seemed like the road less traveled, but given the industry environment today, I believe the path we chose and our patience and commitment to deliver over the long term is paying off given our guidance and especially our outlook in the face of the significant headwinds in the U.S. market. In fact, there's never been a better time to recognize how unique our intersection with the industry is. We have built a global pharmaceutical company that is a leader in each of our geographical regions and which no longer resembles the companies that are focused solely on running just generic and/or specialty pharmaceutical businesses. 
This is precisely why we introduced new geographical reporting segments at the end of last year. In doing so, we're providing investors with visibility into how we are running and driving our business and, at current valuations, believe we are also distinguishing Mylan's differentiated platform as an opportunity, creating yet another new entry point for investors to come into our security. 
Our second quarter performance is a testament to the importance of diversity and building for the long term. We generated total revenues of close to $3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase that was driven by growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments, which now account for more than 50% of Mylan's overall revenues. 
On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $590 million or adjusted EPS of $1.10, down 5% compared to the same period in 2016. While Europe and Rest of World grew significantly as expected, our North America segment was down considerably year-over-year due to delayed launches in EpiPen. We expect these dynamics to continue for some time and for approval delays to persist this year as the FDA continues to reorganize and adapt its processes and priorities. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2017, we continue to have great confidence in our underlying business in every region. However, given this unpredictability and in an abundance of caution, we have removed Copaxone and Advair from our 2017 financial guidance and have simply deferred them to 2018. 
As a result of rebasing our North America business, we now expect to deliver total revenues this year of between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion and adjusted EPS of between $4.30 and $4.70. Our outlook for Europe and Rest of World remains essentially in line with our previously stated expectations. And similarly, we expect no further adjustments to what we already have laid out with respect to EpiPen. 
I note as well that given our breadth, diversification and ability to matter more to customers, our outlook reflects global generic pricing erosion in the mid-single digits, which now takes into account high single-digit erosion in North America generics. 
Turning to 2018. We're moving our targeted adjusted EPS to at least $5.40 for the year, revised from $6. This new target represents 20% growth over 2017 based on the midpoint of our revised range. It incorporates a rebasing of the impact of deferred key U.S. launches and their associated contributions to profitability, AB generic competition to EpiPen, further optimization of our commercial and operational platforms and capital deployment as we utilize our financial flexibility. 
So yes, this was a tough quarter, and it'll be a challenging year due to the volatility and uncertainty in the U.S., the world's largest pharmaceutical market. But we haven't in the past and still are not managing this company quarter-to-quarter. We're managing it for the long term. And that's why today, we've been able to maintain our business while continuing to invest and build for sustainable growth. 
Further, as CEO, I can assure you that given our depressed share price, I'm very focused on continuing to engage and educate investors about the true value of Mylan's unique and highly differentiated platform. Indeed, when we step back and look at our business holistically, we find ourselves more confident and optimistic than ever about Mylan's prospects. We have a product portfolio and pipeline that is exceptionally deep and broad, covering numerous important therapeutic franchises, including medicines for which demand is very strong and growing rapidly, such as respiratory products and biosimilars. 
A great example of the latter is our proposed biosimilar for trastuzumab, which recently received a unanimous vote recommending approval from FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee. As impressive is the sheer scale and scope of our operational and commercial infrastructure, which positions us to truly expand the world's access to high-quality products and meet the needs of the industry's dynamic and rapidly consolidating customer base. We also continue to have financial flexibility given our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation. In addition, unlike many of our peers, we have a very stable and perhaps one of the most experienced leadership teams in this industry. We believe its continuity reflects the soundness of our strategy, our unwavering focus on building for the long term and the resilience of our culture. 
For all of these reasons, we believe that Mylan's best years lie ahead, which is particularly meaningful given the 25% CAGR in adjusted EPS that we delivered between 2008 and 2016. For making this opportunity possible and for our second quarter performance, I'd like, on behalf of Mylan's board and entire leadership team, to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution and for their continued commitment to delivering better health for a better world. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv."

Before I begin, I, too, would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and continued unwavering focus on our mission and business objectives despite the challenges that come our way. 
Let's turn to the second quarter results. I'll provide an overview of our top line performance, and Ken will get into the segment profitability. 
Overall, we delivered nearly USD 3 billion in total revenues for the quarter, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year. As Heather noted, this performance is a result of the breadth, diversity and resilience of our global integrated platform, which has given us the strength to manage the headwinds and ensure long-term sustainability. This quarter, the headwinds came primarily from the U.S., where challenging market dynamics accelerated. However, our performance in our Europe and ROW segments delivered on our expectations. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our Meda and Topicals Business acquisitions, which continue to meet and exceed our expectations in their contributions. 
Let me provide some more detail on the challenging environment in North America, especially in U.S., which resulted in third-party net sales declining by 9% to about $1.3 billion. I note that the region will have seen an increase of 4% if not for higher-than-anticipated negative impact from EpiPen Auto-Injector. During the quarter, we saw increased competition resulting from FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth or fifth generics. Unfortunately, we have not seen the same for the first generics nor for more complex and niche products, which we believe have been impacted by the recent ongoing reorganization within FDA. 
However, while the timing of realizing some of these opportunities may be delayed, our confidence in our ability to bring these products to market and maximize their potential has not changed. To be prudent, we have taken contribution from the major product launches in U.S. out of our guidance for 2017. That said, we continue to remain optimistic based on commentary by Commissioner Gottlieb and other senior FDA officials that FDA is committed to enhancing its capabilities and approval process for complex generics. 
Another consistent pressure point in our industry is pricing, where, again, our approach operating global scale and diversity continues to help us manage these challenging conditions. While we will continue to see choppiness in pricing across individual markets, exemplified by increasing pressure in U.S., the global generic pricing environment this quarter was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance. However, given the environment in U.S.A., we have adjusted our expectations for a price erosion in our global Generics business to mid-single digits for the year. Tony will further elaborate on this topic. 
Turning to Europe. Sales totaled more than $950 million, a year-over-year increase of 59%. The increase was primarily the result of contributions from the Meda acquisition. 
In Rest of the World, sales totaled approximately $690 million, a year-over-year increase of 29%. This increase was primarily driven by the Meda acquisition along with sales from new products and higher volumes from existing products, which more than offset lower pricing. 
Shifting to integration. We continue to make good progress in the integration of Mylan, as evidenced by 150 basis point decline year-over-year in our adjusted SG&A spend as a percentage of total revenues. In recognition of challenging environment we are operating in, we continue to identify additional cost synergies as well as revenue synergy opportunities that we expect to realize in 2017-2018 time frame. 
Let me now talk about generic Copaxone and generic Advair. Regarding Copaxone, we are disappointed with the execution by FDA of this complex ANDA as the administrative time line continues to move despite a number of interactions as well as meeting all of the criteria as per the product-specific guidance issued by FDA. Having said that, we strongly believe in our science and have no pending scientific questions or any additional studies required at this time and are looking forward to this long-pending approval. 
On generic Advair front, we very recently met with the FDA with regards to the complete response letter, which we received in the late March. We were pleased with the highly constructive nature of our dialogue with the agency, and we were able to clarify and resolve a number of key points raised in the CRL. Based on this interaction, we can confirm that no further clinical or device-related studies are required, and we plan to submit our response to the CRL in the next couple of weeks. We believe that agency continues to consider this application as a high priority, and we continue to be ready from both a manufacturing as well as commercial perspective to launch upon approval. 
However, given the unpredictability of timing and in an abundance of caution, we have removed Copaxone and Advair from our 2017 financial guidance and have simply deferred them to 2018. Given all of this, we are very confident in our revised guidance for 2017. 
With regards to our operating platform, we are in the constructive dialogue with the FDA regarding the warning letter that our Nashik site in India received earlier this year. We are working closely with the agency to comprehensively resolve their 2 observations as expeditiously as possible. The site remains in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and MHRA. Unfortunately, the warning letter has delayed new U.S. launches from this site. 
We are pleased to have had the warning letter from Agila Oncology site lifted during this quarter, joining SFF and SPD in being cleared by FDA. With this warning letter now lifted and new approvals from these sites accelerating, we see the opportunity to further support the unmet needs in the injectables space. 
Turning now to some of our other pipeline programs, which will be key drivers of our future growth. Starting with our biosimilar portfolio. We are very pleased with the progress of our programs from a development perspective. We received unanimous approval from FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee for our proposed biosimilar, trastuzumab, last month. This is a very important milestone not just for this product but also for our overall biosimilars program and demonstrates the strength of our science in this complex area. We continue to execute on the review of our global submissions of trastuzumab and pegfilgrastim and working closely with our partner, Biocon, and the health authorities to address any outstanding issues. 
In addition, our proposed biosimilar, bevacizumab, also in partnership with Biocon, recently received approval from the Indian drug regulator. We look forward to bringing a more affordable alternative for metastatic colorectal cancer and lung cancer to patients in India and other Rest of the World markets. 
Our programs with Momenta are also progressing well. We expect to report top line data for the Phase I study for our biosimilar, ORENCIA, candidate by the end of the year. We are also advancing the development of M710, the next biosimilar candidate that we and Momenta are developing as part of our collaboration and plan on starting clinical studies in 2018. 
As a reminder, we have no material contributions from biosimilars in our guidance for 2017 or in our 2018 target. 
With regards to our insulin Glargine program, we presented data from the INSTRIDE study at the American Diabetes Association's Scientific Session in San Diego, which demonstrated the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Mylan's insulin Glargine in comparison to Lantus in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Our regulatory applications are in active review for Europe, Australia and Canada. 
From the U.S. commercial manufacturing strategy point of view, we have decided to include the manufacturing site variations from Bangalore to Malaysia upfront in the application rather than as a post-approval change. We are meeting with the FDA very shortly to reach agreement regarding their expectation in this regard for the U.S. filing. 
Our revefenacin collaboration with Theravance Biopharma for COPD continues to deliver results at every step along the development path. We recently announced positive results from a 12-month Phase III safety study, which demonstrated that revefenacin was generally well tolerated and no new safety issues were identified. We know feel that we have all the data necessary to support a successful NDA filing later this year. 
Turning to our infectious disease franchise. Our ARV business has been further strengthened by the first approval from WHO for new ARV combinations, specifically TLE400 and TLD, a triple combination with Dolutegravir, which both have tentative approvals by FDA under PEPFAR. We also recently received first approval from WHO Prequalification of Medicines Program for our generic version of Gilead's Sovaldi, which will be available in developing countries. 
As we said, the foundation of our business remains strong, and the rebased 2017 business provides opportunities for us going forward. 
Let me now provide you some backdrop to our revised adjusted EPS target of at least $5.40 in 2018, which represents 20% growth from 2017 based on the midpoint of our revised adjusted EPS guidance range announced today. In revising this target, we took into consideration the current headwinds we face in the U.S.A., including increased competition on our base business, and have assumed that they will continue through 2018. We have also assumed that launches deferred from 2017 will happen in 2018. 
However, we have adjusted our expectations for the contribution from these new launches. This includes anticipated launches of generic Advair and generic Copaxone. We have also taken into account the full impact of an anticipated launch of an AB substitutable generic to EpiPen. 
Further, we continue to identify additional cost savings opportunities from the continued rationalization and optimization of our platform above and beyond the targets communicated at Investor Day. We have recognized that the U.S. industry outlook has changed substantially, and we are rapidly adapting our business to reflect these new market dynamics. 
That said, we see additional growth opportunities outside the U.S.A. as we successfully integrate our platform and operate as One Mylan in these geographies. We also have maintained financial flexibility in order to ensure we can pursue additional business development opportunities as they arise. 
There are many assets becoming available, and we will be opportunistic and prudent in pursuing those that will be a right fit for our business, filling a product or geographic gaps. With the commercial footprint we have in place, there are great opportunities to drop in, find products and get more out of them as part of One Mylan. 
In summary, as a result of the platform, portfolio and pipeline we have built and our proven capability to execute, Mylan remains extremely well positioned to meet the needs of customers and patients around the world. Our industry can be challenging one, but we are built to overcome and weather these challenges like few other companies are, and we have in place more opportunities than ever before. As a result, I am very confident in our future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on commercial landscape. Thank you."

I would like to reiterate the confidence you heard from Heather and Rajiv in the underlying strength of our businesses around the world, our proven ability to overcome adversity in our business environment and",984,"Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. I would like to reiterate the confidence you heard from Heather and Rajiv in the underlying strength of our businesses around the world, our proven ability to overcome adversity in our business environment and the many opportunities we have for continued commercial leadership and sustainable growth. 
I would now like to provide a framework for the management and commercial execution around our business from a geographic segment perspective, selling our broad portfolio across all channels in a holistic manner as One Mylan as we focus on being a partner of choice to our customers. 
We will start with our strong performance in Europe, which demonstrates what we've been able to build in this region over the past several years through continued and consistent execution and effective integration of the entire Mylan platform, most recently the Meda acquisition. As a result of the focus on execution, Europe now makes up more than 30% of our total revenues. We've been able to successfully maintain and expand upon our leadership positions in countries like France, Italy and Portugal while capitalizing on meaningful growth opportunities in the U.K., Germany and Spain. 
Our European business is also diversified across channels, with strong positions across brands, generics and now OTC, where we have an established presence from the Meda acquisition. We are encouraged by the growth potential of our brands in the region, such as Dymista, Creon, Influvac, Brufen and Betadine. And we are also excited about our strong future pipeline. 
Our Rest of World segment continues to show double-digit revenue growth and now makes up more than 20% of our total revenues. While our ARV business continues to perform strongly, we are very pleased that the integrated platform we have built in key geographic markets is also yielding benefits. 
For instance, we saw strong performance of 20%-plus revenue growth in Australia, a market where we have successfully integrated our platform and are now selling across all channels. We continue to be the market leader in New Zealand and have experienced growth in Japan. Today, we are one of the top 5 generic companies in Japan, and we continue to seek ways to optimize our assets and develop new partnerships in this market. We also have high expectations for growth opportunities for many of our products in key emerging markets, such as China and Russia. 
Further, we are excited about the integration of Meda products around the region. We see key brands such as Dona, Elavil and ArmoLIPID being additional growth opportunities for us. 
Moving to our business in North America, which now represents less than 50% of our total revenues. We have built a comprehensive business in this region focusing on generic retail, institutional, branded and a small but fast-growing OTC business. As in our other regions, we are selling our portfolio across this entire platform as One Mylan. 
As Rajiv discussed, we have had a challenging quarter in North America, with pressures arising from both accelerated new approvals on our existing generic products and continued consolidation of our U.S. customer base. Specifically, contributions from new product launches in the U.S. was among the lowest in recent history. At the same time, we are seeing increased competitive pressure on our existing products as FDA focuses on bringing more competition to already genericized products through accelerated approvals. As noted in industry reports, in Q2, we saw a much higher number of approvals for competitors on our existing base business than we've seen historically or anticipated. While these dynamics have continued to put pressure on pricing in the region, overall price erosion in our North American Generics business remain in the mid-single digits for the quarter, in line with our expectations and global trends. 
However, as we noted last quarter, we expect fluctuations in the pricing environment in the third and fourth quarter due to having several meaningful first-to-market products that launched in 2016 come off of their exclusivity periods as well as accelerated competition on our base business. 
As a result of these factors, we expect to see full year price erosion for our North American Generics business in the high single digits. We were able to offset some of this choppiness through our global diversity, with several bright spots in the U.S. and elsewhere, which is why our global generics price erosion for the quarter and expectations for the year are mid-single digits. 
Turning to EpiPen. Decline in this product was more than forecasted, primarily due to increased competition and the impact of the launch of the authorized generic. We now represent more than 70% of the total epinephrine auto-injector market through our branded and authorized generic products. 
While the competition in this market remains robust, our customers and patients continue to value this product. Despite the many challenges this quarter, we firmly believe that our underlying business in North America is solid and that our scale and breadth will serve us well for the long term and continue to differentiate us. 
As the industry transforms, like it has many times over the last 20 years, and customers' consolidation continues, success in this region will be defined by those who offer the most robust and diverse product offerings across channels, deliver industry-leading customer service levels and commit to investing in complex new products with longer opportunity horizons. 
Those attributes define Mylan. While we always will see fluctuations on a quarter-by-quarter basis in relation to specific products and individual markets, and sometimes these fluctuations may be dramatic, over the long-term horizon, we believe we can deliver consistent and sustainable growth by focusing on supply, diversification and new product introductions. In fact, I feel like we are just getting started on maximizing our powerful commercial platform, and I continue to be very excited about the commercial opportunities we see in each of our regions. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."
290203,531267085,1274406,"Mylan N.V., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2017",2017-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results and summary. In Q2, we delivered total revenues of approximately $3 billion. That's an increase of 16% over the same period last year. This increase included growth in third-party",1040,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results and summary. In Q2, we delivered total revenues of approximately $3 billion. That's an increase of 16% over the same period last year. This increase included growth in third-party net sales in both our European and Rest of World segments, which were up 59% and 29%, respectively. The growth in both segments was largely driven by contributions from our acquisitions last year of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business. 
Acquisitions also contributed to our North America segment more than $150 million, which helped to mitigate some of the impact associated with the decline in our EpiPen business, along with mid-single-digit generic price erosion that Tony just spoke about. 
As a result of these headwinds, our North American segment third-party net sales declined 9% year-over-year. And excluding the decline in EpiPen, North America was up 4%, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio and our ability to absorb the ongoing challenging dynamics in the U.S. 
On a consolidated basis, we reported adjusted gross margins of approximately 54% in the current quarter compared to approximately 56% in the same period last year. The decline is the result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, including EpiPen, partially mitigated by contributions from last year's acquisitions. 
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D was approximately 6% of total revenues or $171 million, which was in line with the prior year, including the incremental impact from acquisitions. 
Adjusted SG&A increased to $583 million primarily due to integrating the acquired businesses. However, I'll point out that adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues declined 150 basis points to less than 20%, driven by increased revenues from the acquired businesses along with benefits of Mylan integration. 
Moving to profitability. In Q2, adjusted earnings from operations was up approximately 15% when compared to the prior year. Similar to total revenue, the strong performance was largely due to increases in European and Rest of World segments, partially offset by declines in North America associated with the impact of EpiPen and the U.S. market dynamics discussed. 
Europe segment profitability was up 114%, and Rest of World segment profitability was up 197%, both reflecting contributions from the Meda acquisition as well as new product sales. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.10, which was down 5% when compared to the second quarter of last year. The decline was due to a higher adjusted effective tax rate, reflecting the impact of key product launch delays. In addition, our adjusted net earnings were also impacted by higher interest expense and share count when compared to the prior year, resulting from the acquisition of Meda. 
Briefly turning to our results for the 6 months ended June 30. Total revenues increased 20% to $5.7 billion. That includes acquisition contributions of approximately $1.2 billion. In addition, our adjusted net earnings for the 6 months ended June 30 increased $111 million to $1.1 billion, and adjusted EPS increased 6% to $2.03. 
Now turning to cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was very strong at $664 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2017. That compares to $485 million for the prior year. The increase in the current quarter is driven by favorable working capital performance. I'll note that on a year-to-date basis, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion compared to $687 million for the prior year. 
For the full year, even with our new adjusted EPS guidance range, we still expect to deliver on our initial cash flow guidance. In 2017, we said we expect to generate $2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow, net of $400 million to $500 million of capital expenditures. Our ability to generate strong cash flows continues to support the strength of our balance sheet and provide financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business. 
Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, was approximately 3.8x, and that's in line with the level at the end of 2016. While we continue to execute on our commitment to deleverage, as evidenced by our voluntary debt prepayment of more than $800 million in the first half of the year, we expect our leverage ratio at the end of the year will be higher than we had initially indicated. 
As a result of our revised EBITDA guidance, we now forecast our year-end debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to be closer to 3.7x. We remain fully committed to our deleveraging strategy; to compliance with our covenant requirements; to our long-term average debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3x; and most importantly, to our investment-grade credit rating. 
In our earnings materials this morning, you saw a comprehensive table detailing our revised 2017 guidance ranges. Before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to comment briefly on a few items in that table. 
As you heard earlier, as a result of the impact from delayed approvals by the FDA for complex products, including generic Advair and generic Copaxone, as well as the impact from the accelerated competitive U.S. market dynamic, including further price erosion in the U.S., we revised our full year 2017 guidance ranges. We're lowering our previous total revenue guidance range of $12.25 billion to $13.75 billion of revenues to our current range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, which now represents an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus full year 2016. 
As a result of the lower top line expectations, along with a dilutive impact it will have on our adjusted gross margins and effective tax rate and despite incremental cost-saving actions, we've also revised our adjusted EPS guidance down from the previous range of $5.15 to $5.55 per share to our new range of between $4.30 to $4.70 per share. That's a decrease of 8% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. 
As both Heather and Rajiv have already noted this morning, we're targeting at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS in 2018. We'll continue to work through our planning process, and we'll provide further updates as we get closer to setting our official 2018 guidance. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

Clearly, we're all in a new environment. It's a tough environment for all of these companies, but this is also an industry that has maintained roughly 30% operating margins over a long period of time, with improvements year-on-year. Now we're entering a period where we're seeing margin degradation. Where are we in this cycle of things? In other words, how much lower can margins go? And on the other hand, can they get back to where they were before? It seems to me that it's all entirely dependent on new product launches. But assuming product launches don't occur, how much lower can those margins go? And if I could just stick in another one, and it's kind of related, Heather, can you just talk about how your scale gives you leverage over the consolidated customers? It seems that -- Teva has said scale really hasn't helped them. And based on the new guidance for this year for Mylan, it would appear that scale may not be helping you either. So if you could address those 2 topics, I'd appreciate it."

So yes, I'll start off, and then anyone else who wants to jump in can. So I guess here's what I would say. I think this goes back fundamentally, when you talk about the margins and what does this business look like going forward, I think, again, if we just stick within the United States, the diversity of your product portfolio, I think, is incredibly important. And I think that as you hear us continue to talk about not only that diversification from institutional to retail to continuing to build upon our OTC footprint, that kind of diversity within a segment absolutely helps maintain the margins that you've been used to, and I think, importantly, to your comment, new product launches when you think about complex new market formation and as we enter the biosimilar arena. So I do believe that those are going to be able to maintain the levels that you've been used to. Now with that being said, I think we're at a moment in time with the FDA that it's those launches that have continued to have some delay in timing, but they will come. And I think it's companies who have been able to invest and continue to maintain that investment in R&D and bring those important products to market is what will continue to differentiate companies that are able to maintain, I think, those margins that this industry has been used to for some time. But I don't think it's -- as always, one size doesn't fit all, and I don't think everybody's going to be able to maintain that. And I think having the levers to manage and maintain your portfolio to account for that is going to be very important. I think as far as scale goes, again, I think you have to differentiate scale. I think that as you referenced, Teva, well, they really doubled down on scale in the last few years within the United States. And I would say that as we see this market changing dramatically and transforming itself, that perhaps more of the same in this market isn't going to get you very much. And I think that we've been pretty vocal and consistent about that over the last couple of years. When you think about scale, building scale over the global platform, as you look at Mylan today with over 50% of our revenues coming outside of the United States and us really doubling down over the last few years about building not only Europe, Rest of World but our global supply chain, our vertical integration, it's that sustainability and differentiation that I absolutely believe will continue to pay off. Yes, are these -- are there challenges in this U.S. market, which is the largest pharmaceutical market in the world? Absolutely, and we're not running away from that. What we're saying is Mylan's ability to withstand those challenges and, I think, come out stronger in this U.S. market is definitely what we're confident in. But it's our global scale across these regions, both from an operation and a commercial perspective, which I think is what will continue to be able to differentiate ourselves. And as I said, I can assure you, I'm committed as CEO to get out there and make sure we're engaged in educating that investors really have the opportunity to understand our opportunities outside the U.S. as well as those that are coming with all the pipeline products that Rajiv spoke about."

Having said that, as I told you, we remain very confident. We see no issue of us bringing to the market, and it's a timing issue. And that's what we are trying to adjust. On Neulasta, we continue to work with the FDA. We continue to work on the science as well as on the GMP front. And as you know, we have not factored in any revenues even in 2018 in any meaningful way from biosimilars.

And I'm highly optimistic that given even the new commissioner's recent commentary that this is a very important area, they recognize that getting these products to market are important. So -- but if you say the delay of those launches as well if you look over the last 2 months, I think the acceleration is almost near double of approvals in these already commoditized generic products. So when you're bringing #3, 4, 5, 6 to the market, and approvals, I think, jumped up last month to over 90 approvals off kind of falling in that bucket, which is why we acknowledge that increased competition on the existing products and recognize and called out this high single-digit in North America or U.S. generic. So I think both of those really were the primary driver. And to your point, the first one is the most important because this isn't a permanent hit. It's a deferred one. And that's why we did what we thought was the most prudent thing to do of pushing those into '18. But I can tell you we're fighting every day to have them come as soon as they possibly can. So after that, I think things like EpiPen -- I mean, you think of all of the different kind of compounding factors that have culminated right now. I think that's kind of finding its footing. And I think important to recognize that we're down to -- it's going to be less than 5% of this company's profit going forward. So I mean, we -- I think it definitely rebased itself, and we see that kind of final settling of where EpiPen is and what it means to us as a product. And I would say those are your -- the 2 big factors. And as we step back because of that unpredictability, it's why we took the moves we did and know that we pride ourselves on giving you guys that visibility and transparency as we see it. I think over the last year, we've talked about while there's been challenges in the industry, we had not -- Mylan had been able continue to absorb those challenges and that volatility. And when we get to a moment where we'd say, you know what, the impact of both of those things moved pretty dramatically over these last couple of months, and which is why we made the steps we did, but couldn't be more confident in what we've put out there and, I think most importantly, excited about still offering a 20% year-over-year growth as we look into the target we've put out there for next year. So I don't know if anybody -- okay. Thank you for that."

I would say that the consolidation, obviously, you continue to see, I think, we're down really now to about 3 buying consortiums here in the United States. I do think importantly, we'll point out that they're also not just buying for the U.S. These are global, now, buyers coming together. And from our perspective, that being able to supply globally as well as having these important products come to market -- so while they're deferred, it doesn't take away their importance. Speaking of generic Advair, which I think we still feel confident that even though deferred, we're going to be the first to bring this product to market. So I think that our ability to partner and leverage our global scale with these global buying consortiums, that we are best positioned to take our entire product portfolio across the globe and be one of the best partners out there."

We -- our global integrated platform and the segments allow us to run this and manage this business globally. Now coming back to Advair, I think I would like to take this opportunity to clarify and explain one of the remarks I made about how reorganization with FDA can impact it. Take Advair, generic Advair. It's been a 9 year-long journey, and we had intense collaboration with FDA until definition of this ANDA and saw many face-to-face meetings and agreement on several protocols. As the FDA transformed over the last 2, 3 years and emergence of OPQ and -- between OGD and OPQ, many new players have come on -- come in, and many new draft guidance is posted even this year in the beginning of this year, which was on devices. So there can be different opinions which can come at a point, and that's what led to this extensive CRL which we received. We took this opportunity. We took -- FDA took about 4 months to give us this meeting, but this was one good meeting to put everything on the table and come to a good spot and agree with the FDA that they -- whatever we have provided them as part of the product-specific guidance is good enough. We don't need any more data. We don't need any more clinical study or device-related studies. And that's what I meant from how sometimes reorganization or this transformation can impact some touch -- especially the complex and the first approval. Having said that, we have -- we are in the process of consolidating this response and will -- this response will be out the next [ week ]. We have to get it in the -- within the next couple of [ weeks ]. And we continue to work with the FDA for this high-priority product."

I think that's why we call out -- we were taking a prudent step to put them into 2018, and we've also not just deferred everything as it all looks the same being deferred for a year. So as my commentary noted that not only were we deferring U.S. key launches, we were taking into account their contribution. And so again, it's looking at this whole portfolio and risk adjusting for that, but we have taken that same approach, have been, like I said, prudent as we think about their contribution in 2018. As for the FDA and the prioritizing of ANDAs, look, I mean, is it where we'd like it to be? No. If it was where we'd like it to be, we would be seeing, I think, approvals of important product that have no generic competition into the marketplace. But I'm hopeful that we continue that FDA is focusing on their processes and prioritizing, we're certainly doing our part working with them. And I believe we will get there. It's just -- again, sometimes when you're in these transformation, FDA themselves is in a transformation, and continuing that performance while you transform is sometimes difficult. But I'm truly hopeful that we get to where ANDAs are prioritized in the backlog and getting important first-to-market products to the market are at the top."

But as you look to the right of the supply chain, the lack of competition, everything to the right of the manufacturer has continued to constrict. So not only are you down to just 3 buying groups, you're down to every single step along the way until it reaches the patients' hands has become a very constricted and less competitive marketplace. So I agree that I believe that as FTC and others looked at that landscape, there could be unintended consequences to letting that entire supply chain become very less competitive, meaning, at the end of the day, I think what this country's got to continue to find a solution for is ultimately the product getting to patients' hands and doing it as competitively and market driven as possible."

To say that times  are changing would be an understatement. However, as history shows, it's during times like these that industries and companies transform themselves. The ge",1076,"Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. To say that times  are changing would be an understatement. However, as history shows, it's during times like these that industries and companies transform themselves. The generic as well as the entire health care industry is now at an inflection point, and every company's intersection with this point is unique. 
Our transformation from a domestic company started a decade ago when we committed to a strategy of globalization, diversification and scale. As important as developing our strategy is how we have consistently executed against it and further derisked our platform. We have been very purposeful on the types of acquisitions we do, and we are very disciplined about integrating them. We undertook this strategy because of the volatility inherent in any geographic- or product-centric model. Since 2007, this strategy has allowed us to overcome periods of intense competition, consolidation, unpredictable regulatory environments and geographic economic fluctuations around the world. 
At times, this may have seemed like the road less traveled, but given the industry environment today, I believe the path we chose and our patience and commitment to deliver over the long term is paying off given our guidance and especially our outlook in the face of the significant headwinds in the U.S. market. In fact, there's never been a better time to recognize how unique our intersection with the industry is. We have built a global pharmaceutical company that is a leader in each of our geographical regions and which no longer resembles the companies that are focused solely on running just generic and/or specialty pharmaceutical businesses. 
This is precisely why we introduced new geographical reporting segments at the end of last year. In doing so, we're providing investors with visibility into how we are running and driving our business and, at current valuations, believe we are also distinguishing Mylan's differentiated platform as an opportunity, creating yet another new entry point for investors to come into our security. 
Our second quarter performance is a testament to the importance of diversity and building for the long term. We generated total revenues of close to $3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase that was driven by growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments, which now account for more than 50% of Mylan's overall revenues. 
On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $590 million or adjusted EPS of $1.10, down 5% compared to the same period in 2016. While Europe and Rest of World grew significantly as expected, our North America segment was down considerably year-over-year due to delayed launches in EpiPen. We expect these dynamics to continue for some time and for approval delays to persist this year as the FDA continues to reorganize and adapt its processes and priorities. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2017, we continue to have great confidence in our underlying business in every region. However, given this unpredictability and in an abundance of caution, we have removed Copaxone and Advair from our 2017 financial guidance and have simply deferred them to 2018. 
As a result of rebasing our North America business, we now expect to deliver total revenues this year of between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion and adjusted EPS of between $4.30 and $4.70. Our outlook for Europe and Rest of World remains essentially in line with our previously stated expectations. And similarly, we expect no further adjustments to what we already have laid out with respect to EpiPen. 
I note as well that given our breadth, diversification and ability to matter more to customers, our outlook reflects global generic pricing erosion in the mid-single digits, which now takes into account high single-digit erosion in North America generics. 
Turning to 2018. We're moving our targeted adjusted EPS to at least $5.40 for the year, revised from $6. This new target represents 20% growth over 2017 based on the midpoint of our revised range. It incorporates a rebasing of the impact of deferred key U.S. launches and their associated contributions to profitability, AB generic competition to EpiPen, further optimization of our commercial and operational platforms and capital deployment as we utilize our financial flexibility. 
So yes, this was a tough quarter, and it'll be a challenging year due to the volatility and uncertainty in the U.S., the world's largest pharmaceutical market. But we haven't in the past and still are not managing this company quarter-to-quarter. We're managing it for the long term. And that's why today, we've been able to maintain our business while continuing to invest and build for sustainable growth. 
Further, as CEO, I can assure you that given our depressed share price, I'm very focused on continuing to engage and educate investors about the true value of Mylan's unique and highly differentiated platform. Indeed, when we step back and look at our business holistically, we find ourselves more confident and optimistic than ever about Mylan's prospects. We have a product portfolio and pipeline that is exceptionally deep and broad, covering numerous important therapeutic franchises, including medicines for which demand is very strong and growing rapidly, such as respiratory products and biosimilars. 
A great example of the latter is our proposed biosimilar for trastuzumab, which recently received a unanimous vote recommending approval from FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee. As impressive is the sheer scale and scope of our operational and commercial infrastructure, which positions us to truly expand the world's access to high-quality products and meet the needs of the industry's dynamic and rapidly consolidating customer base. We also continue to have financial flexibility given our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation. In addition, unlike many of our peers, we have a very stable and perhaps one of the most experienced leadership teams in this industry. We believe its continuity reflects the soundness of our strategy, our unwavering focus on building for the long term and the resilience of our culture. 
For all of these reasons, we believe that Mylan's best years lie ahead, which is particularly meaningful given the 25% CAGR in adjusted EPS that we delivered between 2008 and 2016. For making this opportunity possible and for our second quarter performance, I'd like, on behalf of Mylan's board and entire leadership team, to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution and for their continued commitment to delivering better health for a better world. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv."

Let's turn to the second quarter results. I'll provide an overview of our top line performance, and Ken will get into the segment profitability. 
Overall, we delivered nearly USD 3 billion in total revenues for the quarter, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year. As Heather noted, this performance is a result of the breadth, diversity and resilience of our global integrated platform, which has given us the strength to manage the headwinds and ensured long-term sustainability. This quarter, the headwinds came primarily from the U.S., where challenging market dynamics accelerated. However, our performance in our Europe and ROW segments delivered on our expectations. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our Meda and Topicals Business acquisitions, which continue to meet and exceed our expectations in their contributions. 
Let me provide some more detail on the challenging environment in North America, especially in U.S., which resulted in third-party net sales declining by 9% to about $1.3 billion. I note that the region will have seen an increase of 4% if not for higher-than-anticipated negative impact from EpiPen Auto-Injector. During the quarter, we saw increased competition resulting from FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth or fifth generics. Unfortunately, we have not seen the same for the first generics nor for more complex and niche products, which we believe have been impacted by the recent ongoing reorganization within FDA. 
However, while the timing of realizing some of these opportunities may be delayed, our confidence in our ability to bring these products to market and maximize their potential has not changed. To be prudent, we have taken contribution from the major product launches in U.S. out of our guidance for 2017. That said, we continue to remain optimistic based on commentary by Commissioner Gottlieb and other senior FDA officials that FDA is committed to enhancing its capabilities and approval process for complex generics. 
Another consistent pressure point in our industry is pricing, where, again, our approach operating global scale and diversity continues to help us manage these challenging conditions. While we will continue to see choppiness in pricing across individual markets, exemplified by increasing pressure in U.S., the global generic pricing environment this quarter was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance. However, given the environment in U.S.A., we have adjusted our expectations for a price erosion in our global Generics business to mid-single digits for the year. Tony will further elaborate on this topic. 
Turning to Europe. Sales totaled more than $950 million, a year-over-year increase of 59%. The increase was primarily the result of contributions from the Meda acquisition. 
In Rest of the World, sales totaled approximately $690 million, a year-over-year increase of 29%. This increase was primarily driven by the Meda acquisition along with sales from new products and higher volumes from existing products, which more than offset lower pricing. 
Shifting to integration. We continue to make good progress in the integration of Mylan, as evidenced by 150 basis point decline year-over-year in our adjusted SG&A spend as a percentage of total revenues. In recognition of challenging environment we are operating in, we continue to identify additional cost synergies as well as revenue synergy opportunities that we expect to realize in 2017-2018 time frame. 
Let me now talk about generic Copaxone and generic Advair. Regarding Copaxone, we are disappointed with the execution by FDA of this complex ANDA as the administrative time line continues to move despite a number of interactions as well as meeting all of the criteria as per the product-specific guidance issued by FDA. Having said that, we strongly believe in our science and have no pending scientific questions or any additional studies required at this time and are looking forward to this long-pending approval. 
On generic Advair front, we very recently met with the FDA with regards to the complete response letter, which we received in the late March. We were pleased with the highly constructive nature of our dialogue with the agency, and we were able to clarify and resolve a number of key points raised in the CRL. Based on this interaction, we can confirm that no further clinical or device-related studies are required, and we plan to submit our response to the CRL in the next couple of weeks. We believe that agency continues to consider this application as a high priority, and we continue to be ready from both a manufacturing as well as commercial perspective to launch upon approval. 
However, given the unpredictability of timing and in an abundance of caution, we have removed Copaxone and Advair from our 2017 financial guidance and have simply deferred them to 2018. Given all of this, we are very confident in our revised guidance for 2017. 
With regards to our operating platform, we are in the constructive dialogue with the FDA regarding the warning letter that our Nashik site in India received earlier this year. We are working closely with the agency to comprehensively resolve their 2 observations as expeditiously as possible. The site remains in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and MHRA. Unfortunately, the warning letter has delayed new U.S. launches from this site. 
We are pleased to have had the warning letter from Agila Oncology site lifted during this quarter, joining SFF and SPD in being cleared by FDA. With this warning letter now lifted and new approvals from these sites accelerating, we see the opportunity to further support the unmet needs in the injectables space. 
Turning now to some of our other pipeline programs, which will be key drivers of our future growth. Starting with our biosimilar portfolio. We are very pleased with the progress of our programs from a development perspective. We received unanimous approval from FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee for our proposed biosimilar, trastuzumab, last month. This is a very important milestone not just for this product but also for our overall biosimilars program and demonstrates the strength of our science in this complex area. We continue to execute on the review of our global submissions of trastuzumab and pegfilgrastim and working closely with our partner, Biocon, and the health authorities to address any outstanding issues. 
In addition, our proposed biosimilar, bevacizumab, also in partnership with Biocon, recently received approval from the Indian drug regulator. We look forward to bringing a more affordable alternative for metastatic colorectal cancer and lung cancer to patients in India and other Rest of the World markets. 
Our programs with Momenta are also progressing well. We expect to report top line data for the Phase I study for our biosimilar, ORENCIA, candidate by the end of the year. We are also advancing the development of M710, the next biosimilar candidate that we and Momenta are developing as part of our collaboration and plan on starting clinical studies in 2018. 
As a reminder, we have no material contributions from biosimilars in our guidance for 2017 or in our 2018 target. 
With regards to our insulin Glargine program, we presented data from the INSTRIDE study at the American Diabetes Association's Scientific Session in San Diego, which demonstrated the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Mylan's insulin Glargine in comparison to Lantus in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Our regulatory applications are in active review for Europe, Australia and Canada. 
From the U.S. commercial manufacturing strategy point of view, we have decided to include the manufacturing side variations from Bangalore to Malaysia upfront in the application rather than as a post-approval change. We are meeting with the FDA very shortly to reach agreement regarding their expectation in this regard for the U.S. filing. 
Our revefenacin collaboration with Theravance Biopharma for COPD continues to deliver results at every step along the development path. We recently announced positive results from a 12-month Phase III safety study, which demonstrated that revefenacin was generally well tolerated and no new safety issues were identified. We know feel that we have all the data necessary to support a successful NDA filing later this year. 
Turning to our infectious disease franchise. Our ARV business has been further strengthened by the first approval from WHO for new ARV combinations, specifically TLE400 and TLD, a triple combination with Dolutegravir, which both have tentative approvals by FDA under PEPFAR. We also recently received first approval from WHO Prequalification of Medicines Program for our generic version of Gilead's Sovaldi, which will be available in developing countries. 
As we said, the foundation of our business remains strong, and the rebased 2017 business provides opportunities for us going forward. 
Let me now provide you some backdrop to our revised adjusted EPS target of at least $5.40 in 2018, which represents 20% growth from 2017 based on the midpoint of our revised adjusted EPS guidance range announced today. In revising this target, we took into consideration the current headwinds we face in the U.S.A., including increased competition on our base business, and have assumed that they will continue through 2018. We have also assumed that launches deferred from 2017 will happen in 2018. 
However, we have adjusted our expectations for the contribution from these new launches. This includes anticipated launches of generic Advair and generic Copaxone. We have also taken into account the full impact of an anticipated launch of an AB substitutable generic to EpiPen. 
Further, we continue to identify additional cost savings opportunities from the continued rationalization and optimization of our platform above and beyond the targets communicated at Investor Day. We have recognized that the U.S. industry outlook has changed substantially, and we are rapidly adapting our business to reflect these new market dynamics. 
That said, we see additional growth opportunities outside the U.S.A. as we successfully integrate our platform and operate as One Mylan in these geographies. We also have maintained financial flexibility in order to ensure we can pursue additional business development opportunities as they arise. 
There are many assets becoming available, and we will be opportunistic and prudent in pursuing those that will be a right fit for our business, filling a product or geographic gaps. With the commercial footprint we have in place, there are great opportunities to drop in, find products and get more out of them as part of One Mylan. 
In summary, as a result of the platform, portfolio and pipeline we have built and our proven capability to execute, Mylan remains extremely well positioned to meet the needs of customers and patients around the world. Our industry can be challenging one, but we are built to overcome and weather these challenges like few other companies are, and we have in place more opportunities than ever before. As a result, I am very confident in our future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on commercial landscape. Thank you."

I would like to reiterate the confidence you heard from Heather and Rajiv in the underlying strength of our businesses around the world, our proven ability to overcome adversity in our business environment and",985,"Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. I would like to reiterate the confidence you heard from Heather and Rajiv in the underlying strength of our businesses around the world, our proven ability to overcome adversity in our business environment and the many opportunities we have for continued commercial leadership and sustainable growth. 
I would now like to provide a framework for the management and commercial execution around our business from a geographic segment perspective, selling our broad portfolio across all channels in a holistic manner as One Mylan as we focus on being a partner of choice to our customers. 
We will start with our strong performance in Europe, which demonstrates what we've been able to build in this region over the past several years through continued and consistent execution and effective integration of the entire Mylan platform, most recently the Meda acquisition. As a result of the focus on execution, Europe now makes up more than 30% of our total revenues. We've been able to successfully maintain and expand upon our leadership positions in countries like France, Italy and Portugal while capitalizing on meaningful growth opportunities in the U.K., Germany and Spain. 
Our European business is also diversified across channels, with strong positions across brands, generics and now OTC, where we have an established presence from the Meda acquisition. We are encouraged by the growth potential of our brands in the region, such as Dymista, Creon, Influvac, Brufen and Betadine. And we are also excited about our strong future pipeline. 
Our Rest of World segment continues to show double-digit revenue growth and now makes up more than 20% of our total revenues. While our ARV business continues to perform strongly, we are very pleased that the integrated platform we have built in key geographic markets is also yielding benefits. 
For instance, we saw strong performance of 20%-plus revenue growth in Australia, a market where we have successfully integrated our platform and are now selling across all channels. We continue to be the market leader in New Zealand and have experienced growth in Japan. Today, we are one of the top 5 generic companies in Japan, and we continue to seek ways to optimize our assets and develop new partnerships in this market. We also have high expectations for growth opportunities for many of our products in key emerging markets, such as China and Russia. 
Further, we are excited about the integration of Meda products around the region. We see key brands such as Dona, Elavil and ArmoLIPID being additional growth opportunities for us. 
Moving to our business in North America, which now represents less than 50% of our total revenues. We have built a comprehensive business in this region focusing on generic retail, institutional, branded and a small but fast-growing OTC business. As in our other regions, we are selling our portfolio across this entire platform as One Mylan. 
As Rajiv discussed, we have had a challenging quarter in North America, with pressures arising from both accelerated new approvals on our existing generic products and continued consolidation of our U.S. customer base. Specifically, contributions from new product launches in the U.S. was among the lowest in recent history. At the same time, we are seeing increased competitive pressure on our existing products as FDA focuses on bringing more competition to already genericized products through accelerated approvals. As noted in industry reports, in Q2, we saw a much higher number of approvals for competitors on our existing base business than we've seen historically or anticipated. While these dynamics have continued to put pressure on pricing in the region, overall price erosion in our North American Generics business remain in the mid-single digits for the quarter, in line with our expectations and global trends. 
However, as we noted last quarter, we expect fluctuations in the pricing environment in the third and fourth quarter due to having several meaningful first-to-market products that launched in 2016 come off of their exclusivity periods as well as accelerated competition on our base business. 
As a result of these factors, we expect to see full year price erosion for our North American Generics business in the high single digits. We were able to offset some of this choppiness through our global diversity, with several bright spots in the U.S. and elsewhere, which is why our global generics price erosion for the quarter and expectations for the year are mid-single digits. 
Turning to EpiPen. The decline in this product was more than forecasted, primarily due to increased competition and the impact of the launch of the authorized generic. We now represent more than 70% of the total epinephrine auto-injector market through our branded and authorized generic products. 
While the competition in this market remains robust, our customers and patients continue to value this product. Despite the many challenges this quarter, we firmly believe that our underlying business in North America is solid and that our scale and breadth will serve us well for the long term and continue to differentiate us. 
As the industry transforms, like it has many times over the last 20 years, and customers' consolidation continues, success in this region will be defined by those who offer the most robust and diverse product offerings across channels, deliver industry-leading customer service levels and commit to investing in complex new products with longer opportunity horizons. 
Those attributes define Mylan. While we always will see fluctuations on a quarter-by-quarter basis in relation to specific products and individual markets, and sometimes these fluctuations may be dramatic, over the long-term horizon, we believe we can deliver consistent and sustainable growth by focusing on supply, diversification and new product introductions. In fact, I feel like we are just getting started on maximizing our powerful commercial platform, and I continue to be very excited about the commercial opportunities we see in each of our regions. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."
290203,531267085,1274865,"Mylan N.V., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2017",2017-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results and summary. In Q2, we delivered total revenues of approximately $3 billion. That's an increase of 16% over the same period last year. This increase included growth in third-party",1040,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results and summary. In Q2, we delivered total revenues of approximately $3 billion. That's an increase of 16% over the same period last year. This increase included growth in third-party net sales in both our European and Rest of World segments, which were up 59% and 29%, respectively. The growth in both segments was largely driven by contributions from our acquisitions last year of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business. 
Acquisitions also contributed to our North America segment more than $150 million, which helped to mitigate some of the impact associated with the decline in our EpiPen business, along with mid-single-digit generic price erosion that Tony just spoke about. 
As a result of these headwinds, our North American segment third-party net sales declined 9% year-over-year. And excluding the decline in EpiPen, North America was up 4%, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio and our ability to absorb the ongoing challenging dynamics in the U.S. 
On a consolidated basis, we reported adjusted gross margins of approximately 54% in the current quarter compared to approximately 56% in the same period last year. The decline is the result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, including EpiPen, partially mitigated by contributions from last year's acquisitions. 
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D was approximately 6% of total revenues or $171 million, which was in line with the prior year, including the incremental impact from acquisitions. 
Adjusted SG&A increased to $583 million primarily due to integrating the acquired businesses. However, I'll point out that adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues declined 150 basis points to less than 20%, driven by increased revenues from the acquired businesses along with benefits of Mylan integration. 
Moving to profitability. In Q2, adjusted earnings from operations was up approximately 15% when compared to the prior year. Similar to total revenue, the strong performance was largely due to increases in European and Rest of World segments, partially offset by declines in North America associated with the impact of EpiPen and the U.S. market dynamics discussed. 
Europe segment profitability was up 114%, and Rest of World segment profitability was up 197%, both reflecting contributions from the Meda acquisition as well as new product sales. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.10, which was down 5% when compared to the second quarter of last year. The decline was due to a higher adjusted effective tax rate, reflecting the impact of key product launch delays. In addition, our adjusted net earnings were also impacted by higher interest expense and share count when compared to the prior year, resulting from the acquisition of Meda. 
Briefly turning to our results for the 6 months ended June 30. Total revenues increased 20% to $5.7 billion. That includes acquisition contributions of approximately $1.2 billion. In addition, our adjusted net earnings for the 6 months ended June 30 increased $111 million to $1.1 billion, and adjusted EPS increased 6% to $2.03. 
Now turning to cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was very strong at $664 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2017. That compares to $485 million for the prior year. The increase in the current quarter is driven by favorable working capital performance. I'll note that on a year-to-date basis, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion compared to $687 million for the prior year. 
For the full year, even with our new adjusted EPS guidance range, we still expect to deliver on our initial cash flow guidance. In 2017, we said we expect to generate $2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow, net of $400 million to $500 million of capital expenditures. Our ability to generate strong cash flows continues to support the strength of our balance sheet and provide financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business. 
Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, was approximately 3.8x, and that's in line with the level at the end of 2016. While we continue to execute on our commitment to deleverage, as evidenced by our voluntary debt prepayment of more than $800 million in the first half of the year, we expect our leverage ratio at the end of the year will be higher than we had initially indicated. 
As a result of our revised EBITDA guidance, we now forecast our year-end debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to be closer to 3.7x. We remain fully committed to our deleveraging strategy; to compliance with our covenant requirements; to our long-term average debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3x; and most importantly, to our investment-grade credit rating. 
In our earnings materials this morning, you saw a comprehensive table detailing our revised 2017 guidance ranges. Before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to comment briefly on a few items in that table. 
As you heard earlier, as a result of the impact from delayed approvals by the FDA for complex products, including generic Advair and generic Copaxone, as well as the impact from the accelerated competitive U.S. market dynamic, including further price erosion in the U.S., we revised our full year 2017 guidance ranges. We're lowering our previous total revenue guidance range of $12.25 billion to $13.75 billion of revenues to our current range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, which now represents an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus full year 2016. 
As a result of the lower top line expectations, along with a dilutive impact it will have on our adjusted gross margins and effective tax rate and despite incremental cost-saving actions, we've also revised our adjusted EPS guidance down from the previous range of $5.15 to $5.55 per share to our new range of between $4.30 to $4.70 per share. That's a decrease of 8% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. 
As both Heather and Rajiv have already noted this morning, we're targeting at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS in 2018. We'll continue to work through our planning process, and we'll provide further updates as we get closer to setting our official 2018 guidance. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

Clearly, we're all in a new environment. It's a tough environment for all of these companies, but this is also an industry that has maintained roughly 30% operating margins over a long period of time, with improvements year-on-year. Now we're entering a period where we're seeing margin degradation. Where are we in this cycle of things? In other words, how much lower can margins go? And on the other hand, can they get back to where they were before? It seems to me that it's all entirely dependent on new product launches. But assuming product launches don't occur, how much lower can those margins go? And if I could just stick in another one, and it's kind of related, Heather, can you just talk about how your scale gives you leverage over the consolidated customers? It seems that -- Teva has said scale really hasn't helped them. And based on the new guidance for this year for Mylan, it would appear that scale may not be helping you either.

So yes, I'll start off, and then anyone else who wants to jump in can. So I guess here's what I would say. I think this goes back fundamentally, when you talk about the margins and what does this business look like going forward, I think, again, if we just stick within the United States, the diversity of your product portfolio, I think, is incredibly important. And I think that as you hear us continue to talk about not only that diversification from institutional to retail to continuing to build upon our OTC footprint, that kind of diversity within a segment absolutely helps maintain the margins that you've been used to, and I think, importantly, to your comment, new product launches when you think about complex new market formation and as we enter the biosimilar arena. So I do believe that those are going to be able to maintain the levels that you've been used to. Now with that being said, I think we're at a moment in time with the FDA that it's those launches that have continued to have some delay in timing, but they will come. And I think it's companies who have been able to invest and continue to maintain that investment in R&D and bring those important products to market is what will continue to differentiate companies that are able to maintain, I think, those margins that this industry has been used to for some time. But I don't think it's -- as always, one size doesn't fit all, and I don't think everybody's going to be able to maintain that. And I think having the levers to manage and maintain your portfolio to account for that is going to be very important. I think as far as scale goes, again, I think you have to differentiate scale. I think that as you referenced, Teva where they really doubled down on scale in the last few years within the United States. And I would say that as we see this market changing dramatically and transforming itself, that perhaps more of the same in this market isn't going to get you very much. And I think that we've been pretty vocal and consistent about that over the last couple of years. When you think about scale, building scale over the global platform, as you look at Mylan today with over 50% of our revenues coming outside of the United States and us really doubling down over the last few years about building not only Europe, Rest of World but our global supply chain, our vertical integration, it's that sustainability and differentiation that I absolutely believe will continue to pay off. Yes, are these -- are there challenges in this U.S. market, which is the largest pharmaceutical market in the world? Absolutely, and we're not running away from that. What we're saying is Mylan's ability to withstand those challenges and, I think, come out stronger in this U.S. market is definitely what we're confident in. But it's our global scale across these regions, both from an operation and a commercial perspective, which I think is what will continue to be able to differentiate ourselves. And as I said, I can assure you, I'm committed as CEO to get out there and make sure we're engaged in educating that investors really have the opportunity to understand our opportunities outside the U.S. as well as those that are coming with all the pipeline products that Rajiv spoke about."

Having said that, as I told you, we remain very confident. We see no issue of us bringing to the market, and it's a timing issue. And that's what we are trying to adjust. On Neulasta, we continue to work with the FDA. We continue to work on the science as well as on the GMP front. And as you know, we have not factored in any revenues even in 2018 in any meaningful way from biosimilars.

If we think about the adjustment to your profitability expectations this year, just simply EPS, could you just maybe give us a little bit insight or just kind of rank order of all the factors that we've talked about, accelerated pricing pressure and sort of the ongoing impact of the evolution of these consortiums and kind of the rebidding process or the pushout in new product launch expectations? Is there any one factor that sort of stands out much more than the others in terms of leading to revision in your expectation? I'm just trying to figure out where the team was probably most surprised with respect to those dynamics because I certainly think pushing out $500 million in product sales is quite a bit different in terms of the implications than suggesting there's been a $500 million permanent impairment on the base. So was just hoping to get a little bit more insight into the different dynamics there."

Our -- I would say first and foremost, it's launches. When you look at, on both fronts, the continued delay on new, complex key market or key product launches -- and as we've said, and",540,"Yes, no, thank you, Elliot, and I think your observations are correct. Our -- I would say first and foremost, it's launches. When you look at, on both fronts, the continued delay on new, complex key market or key product launches -- and as we've said, and I can't underscore this enough, we honestly see the administrative as the barrier and not the science. And I think we are, I can assure you, working diligently to daily be in contact with the FDA and work through these issues. And I'm highly optimistic that given even the new commissioner's recent commentary that this is a very important area, they recognize that getting these products to market are important. So -- but if you say the delay of those launches as well, if you look over the last 2 months, I think the acceleration is almost near double of approvals in these already commoditized generic products. So when you're bringing #3, 4, 5, 6 to the market, and approvals, I think, jumped up last month to over 90 approvals all kind of falling in that bucket, which is why we acknowledge that increased competition on the existing products and recognize and called out this high single-digit in North America or U.S. generic. So I think both of those really were the primary driver. And to your point, the first one is the most important because this isn't a permanent hit. It's a deferred one. And that's why we did what we thought was the most prudent thing to do of pushing those into '18. But I can tell you we're fighting every day to have them come as soon as they possibly can. So after that, I think things like EpiPen -- I mean, you think of all of the different kind of compounding factors that have culminated right now. I think that's kind of finding its footing. And I think important to recognize that we're down to -- it's going to be less than 5% of this company's profit going forward. So I mean, we -- I think it has definitely rebased itself, and we see that kind of final settling of where EpiPen is and what it means to us as a product. And I would say those are your -- the 2 big factors. And as we step back because of that unpredictability, it's why we took the moves we did and know that we pride ourselves on giving you guys that visibility and transparency as we see it. I think over the last year, we've talked about while there's been challenges in the industry, we had not -- Mylan had been able continue to absorb those challenges and that volatility. And when we get to a moment where we'd say, you know what, the impact of both of those things moved pretty dramatically over these last couple of months, and which is why we made the steps we did, but couldn't be more confident in what we've put out there and, I think most importantly, excited about still offering a 20% year-over-year growth as we look into the target we've put out there for next year. So I don't know if anybody -- okay. Thank you for that."

I would say that the consolidation, obviously, you continue to see, I think, we're down really now to about 3 buying consortiums here in the United States. I do think importantly, we'll point out that they're also not just buying for the U.S. These are global, now, buyers coming together. And from our perspective, that being able to supply globally as well as having these important products come to market -- so while they're deferred, it doesn't take away their importance. Speaking of generic Advair, which I think we still feel confident that even though deferred, we're going to be the first to bring this product to market.

We -- our global integrated platform and the segments allow us to run this and manage this business globally. Now coming back to Advair, I think I would like to take this opportunity to clarify and explain one of the remarks I made about how reorganization with FDA can impact it. Take Advair, generic Advair. It's been a 9 year-long journey, and we had intense collaboration with FDA until definition of this ANDA and saw many face-to-face meetings and agreement on several protocols. As the FDA transformed over the last 2, 3 years and emergence of OPQ and -- between OGD and OPQ, many new players have come on -- come in, and many new draft guidance is posted even this year in the beginning of this year, which was on devices. So there can be different opinions which can come at a point, and that's what led to this extensive CRL which we received. We took this opportunity. We took -- FDA took about 4 months to give us this meeting, but this was one good meeting to put everything on the table and come to a good spot and agree with the FDA that they -- whatever we have provided them as part of the product-specific guidance is good enough. We don't need any more data. We don't need any more clinical study or device-related studies. And that's what I meant from how sometimes reorganization or this transformation can impact some touch -- especially the complex and the first approval. Having said that, we have -- we are in the process of consolidating this response and will -- this response will be out the next [ week ]. We have to get it in the -- within the next couple of weeks. And we continue to work with the FDA for this high-priority product."

I think that's why we call out -- we were taking a prudent step to put them into 2018, and we've also not just deferred everything as it all looks the same being deferred for a year. So as my commentary noted that not only were we deferring U.S. key launches, we were taking into account their contribution. And so again, it's looking at this whole portfolio and risk adjusting for that, but we have taken that same approach, have been, like I said, prudent as we think about their contribution in 2018. As for the FDA and the prioritizing of ANDAs, look, I mean, is it where we'd like it to be? No. If it was where we'd like it to be, we would be seeing, I think, approvals of important product that have no generic competition into the marketplace. But I'm hopeful that we continue, that the FDA is focusing on their processes and prioritizing, we're certainly doing our part working with them. And I believe we will get there. It's just -- again, sometimes when you're in these transformation, FDA themselves is in a transformation, and continuing that performance while you transform is sometimes difficult. But I'm truly hopeful that we get to where ANDAs are prioritized in the backlog and getting important first-to-market products to the market are at the top."

But as you look to the right of the supply chain, the lack of competition, everything to the right of the manufacturer has continued to constrict. So not only are you down to just 3 buying groups, you're down to every single step along the way until it reaches the patients' hands has become a very constricted and less competitive marketplace. So I agree that I believe that as FTC and others looked at that landscape, there could be unintended consequences to letting that entire supply chain become very less competitive, meaning, at the end of the day, I think what this country's got to continue to find a solution for is ultimately the product getting into patients' hands and doing it as competitively and market driven as possible."

To say that times are changing would be an understatement. However, as history shows, it's during times like these that industries and companies transform themselves. The gen",1076,"Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. To say that times are changing would be an understatement. However, as history shows, it's during times like these that industries and companies transform themselves. The generic as well as the entire health care industry is now at an inflection point, and every company's intersection with this point is unique. 
Our transformation from a domestic company started a decade ago when we committed to a strategy of globalization, diversification and scale. As important as developing our strategy is how we have consistently executed against it and further derisked our platform. We have been very purposeful on the types of acquisitions we do, and we are very disciplined about integrating them. We undertook this strategy because of the volatility inherent in any geographic- or product-centric model. Since 2007, this strategy has allowed us to overcome periods of intense competition, consolidation, unpredictable regulatory environments and geographic economic fluctuations around the world. 
At times, this may have seemed like the road less traveled, but given the industry environment today, I believe the path we chose and our patience and commitment to deliver over the long term is paying off given our guidance and especially our outlook in the face of the significant headwinds in the U.S. market. In fact, there's never been a better time to recognize how unique our intersection with the industry is. We have built a global pharmaceutical company that is a leader in each of our geographical regions and which no longer resembles the companies that are focused solely on running just generic and/or specialty pharmaceutical businesses. 
This is precisely why we introduced new geographical reporting segments at the end of last year. In doing so, we're providing investors with visibility into how we are running and driving our business and, at current valuations, believe we are also distinguishing Mylan's differentiated platform as an opportunity, creating yet another new entry point for investors to come into our security. 
Our second quarter performance is a testament to the importance of diversity and building for the long term. We generated total revenues of close to $3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase that was driven by growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments, which now account for more than 50% of Mylan's overall revenues. 
On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $590 million or adjusted EPS of $1.10, down 5% compared to the same period in 2016. While Europe and Rest of World grew significantly as expected, our North America segment was down considerably year-over-year due to delayed launches in EpiPen. We expect these dynamics to continue for some time and for approval delays to persist this year as the FDA continues to reorganize and adapt its processes and priorities. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2017, we continue to have great confidence in our underlying business in every region. However, given this unpredictability and in an abundance of caution, we have removed Copaxone and Advair from our 2017 financial guidance and have simply deferred them to 2018. 
As a result of rebasing our North America business, we now expect to deliver total revenues this year of between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion and adjusted EPS of between $4.30 and $4.70. Our outlook for Europe and Rest of World remains essentially in line with our previously stated expectations. And similarly, we expect no further adjustments to what we already have laid out with respect to EpiPen. 
I note as well that given our breadth, diversification and ability to matter more to customers, our outlook reflects global generic pricing erosion in the mid-single digits, which now takes into account high single-digit erosion in North America generics. 
Turning to 2018. We're moving our targeted adjusted EPS to at least $5.40 for the year, revised from $6. This new target represents 20% growth over 2017 based on the midpoint of our revised range. It incorporates a rebasing of the impact of deferred key U.S. launches and their associated contributions to profitability, AB generic competition to EpiPen, further optimization of our commercial and operational platforms and capital deployment as we utilize our financial flexibility. 
So yes, this was a tough quarter, and it'll be a challenging year due to the volatility and uncertainty in the U.S., the world's largest pharmaceutical market. But we haven't in the past and still are not managing this company quarter-to-quarter. We're managing it for the long term. And that's why today, we've been able to maintain our business while continuing to invest and build for sustainable growth. 
Further, as CEO, I can assure you that given our depressed share price, I'm very focused on continuing to engage and educate investors about the true value of Mylan's unique and highly differentiated platform. Indeed, when we step back and look at our business holistically, we find ourselves more confident and optimistic than ever about Mylan's prospects. We have a product portfolio and pipeline that is exceptionally deep and broad, covering numerous important therapeutic franchises, including medicines for which demand is very strong and growing rapidly, such as respiratory products and biosimilars. 
A great example of the latter is our proposed biosimilar for trastuzumab, which recently received a unanimous vote recommending approval from FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee. As impressive is the sheer scale and scope of our operational and commercial infrastructure, which positions us to truly expand the world's access to high-quality products and meet the needs of the industry's dynamic and rapidly consolidating customer base. We also continue to have financial flexibility given our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation. In addition, unlike many of our peers, we have a very stable and perhaps one of the most experienced leadership teams in this industry. We believe its continuity reflects the soundness of our strategy, our unwavering focus on building for the long term and the resilience of our culture. 
For all of these reasons, we believe that Mylan's best years lie ahead, which is particularly meaningful given the 25% CAGR in adjusted EPS that we delivered between 2008 and 2016. For making this opportunity possible and for our second quarter performance, I'd like, on behalf of Mylan's board and entire leadership team, to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution and for their continued commitment to delivering better health for a better world. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv."

Before I begin, I, too, would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and continued unwavering focus on our mission and business objectives despite the challenges that come our way. 
Let's turn to the second quarter results. I'll provide an overview of our top line performance, and Ken will get into the segment profitability. 
Overall, we delivered nearly USD 3 billion in total revenues for the quarter, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year. As Heather noted, this performance is a result of the breadth, diversity and resilience of our global integrated platform, which has given us the strength to manage the headwinds and ensured long-term sustainability. This quarter, the headwinds came primarily from the U.S., where challenging market dynamics accelerated. However, our performance in our Europe and ROW segments delivered on our expectations. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our Meda and Topicals Business acquisitions, which continue to meet and exceed our expectations in their contributions. 
Let me provide some more detail on the challenging environment in North America, especially in U.S., which resulted in third-party net sales declining by 9% to about $1.3 billion. I note that the region will have seen an increase of 4% if not for higher-than-anticipated negative impact from EpiPen Auto-Injector. During the quarter, we saw increased competition resulting from FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth or fifth generics. Unfortunately, we have not seen the same for the first generics nor for more complex and niche products, which we believe have been impacted by the recent ongoing reorganization within FDA. 
However, while the timing of realizing some of these opportunities may be delayed, our confidence in our ability to bring these products to market and maximize their potential has not changed. To be prudent, we have taken contribution from the major product launches in U.S. out of our guidance for 2017. That said, we continue to remain optimistic based on commentary by Commissioner Gottlieb and other senior FDA officials that FDA is committed to enhancing its capabilities and approval process for complex generics. 
Another consistent pressure point in our industry is pricing, where, again, our approach operating global scale and diversity continues to help us manage these challenging conditions. While we will continue to see choppiness in pricing across individual markets, exemplified by increasing pressure in U.S., the global generic pricing environment this quarter was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance. However, given the environment in U.S.A., we have adjusted our expectations for a price erosion in our global Generics business to mid-single digits for the year. Tony will further elaborate on this topic. 
Turning to Europe. Sales totaled more than $950 million, a year-over-year increase of 59%. The increase was primarily the result of contributions from the Meda acquisition. 
In Rest of the World, sales totaled approximately $690 million, a year-over-year increase of 29%. This increase was primarily driven by the Meda acquisition along with sales from new products and higher volumes from existing products, which more than offset lower pricing. 
Shifting to integration. We continue to make good progress in the integration of Mylan, as evidenced by 150 basis point decline year-over-year in our adjusted SG&A spend as a percentage of total revenues. In recognition of challenging environment we are operating in, we continue to identify additional cost synergies as well as revenue synergy opportunities that we expect to realize in 2017-2018 time frame. 
Let me now talk about generic Copaxone and generic Advair. Regarding Copaxone, we are disappointed with the execution by FDA of this complex ANDA as the administrative time line continues to move despite a number of interactions as well as meeting all of the criteria as per the product-specific guidance issued by FDA. Having said that, we strongly believe in our science and have no pending scientific questions or any additional studies required at this time and are looking forward to this long-pending approval. 
On generic Advair front, we very recently met with the FDA with regards to the complete response letter, which we received in the late March. We were pleased with the highly constructive nature of our dialogue with the agency, and we were able to clarify and resolve a number of key points raised in the CRL. Based on this interaction, we can confirm that no further clinical or device-related studies are required, and we plan to submit our response to the CRL in the next couple of weeks. We believe that agency continues to consider this application as a high priority, and we continue to be ready from both a manufacturing as well as commercial perspective to launch upon approval. 
However, given the unpredictability of timing and in an abundance of caution, we have removed Copaxone and Advair from our 2017 financial guidance and have simply deferred them to 2018. Given all of this, we are very confident in our revised guidance for 2017. 
With regards to our operating platform, we are in the constructive dialogue with the FDA regarding the warning letter that our Nashik site in India received earlier this year. We are working closely with the agency to comprehensively resolve their 2 observations as expeditiously as possible. The site remains in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and MHRA. Unfortunately, the warning letter has delayed new U.S. launches from this site. 
We are pleased to have had the warning letter from Agila Oncology site lifted during this quarter, joining SFF and SPD in being cleared by FDA. With this warning letter now lifted and new approvals from these sites accelerating, we see the opportunity to further support the unmet needs in the injectables space. 
Turning now to some of our other pipeline programs, which will be key drivers of our future growth. Starting with our biosimilar portfolio. We are very pleased with the progress of our programs from a development perspective. We received unanimous approval from FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee for our proposed biosimilar, trastuzumab, last month. This is a very important milestone not just for this product but also for our overall biosimilars program and demonstrates the strength of our science in this complex area. We continue to execute on the review of our global submissions of trastuzumab and pegfilgrastim and working closely with our partner, Biocon, and the health authorities to address any outstanding issues. 
In addition, our proposed biosimilar, bevacizumab, also in partnership with Biocon, recently received approval from the Indian drug regulator. We look forward to bringing a more affordable alternative for metastatic colorectal cancer and lung cancer to patients in India and other Rest of the World markets. 
Our programs with Momenta are also progressing well. We expect to report top line data for the Phase I study for our biosimilar, ORENCIA, candidate by the end of the year. We are also advancing the development of M710, the next biosimilar candidate that we and Momenta are developing as part of our collaboration and plan on starting clinical studies in 2018. 
As a reminder, we have no material contributions from biosimilars in our guidance for 2017 or in our 2018 target. 
With regards to our insulin Glargine program, we presented data from the INSTRIDE study at the American Diabetes Association's Scientific Session in San Diego, which demonstrated the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Mylan's insulin Glargine in comparison to Lantus in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Our regulatory applications are in active review for Europe, Australia and Canada. 
From the U.S. commercial manufacturing strategy point of view, we have decided to include the manufacturing side variations from Bangalore to Malaysia upfront in the application rather than as a post-approval change. We are meeting with the FDA very shortly to reach agreement regarding their expectation in this regard for the U.S. filing. 
Our revefenacin collaboration with Theravance Biopharma for COPD continues to deliver results at every step along the development path. We recently announced positive results from a 12-month Phase III safety study, which demonstrated that revefenacin was generally well tolerated and no new safety issues were identified. We know feel that we have all the data necessary to support a successful NDA filing later this year. 
Turning to our infectious disease franchise. Our ARV business has been further strengthened by the first approval from WHO for new ARV combinations, specifically TLE400 and TLD, a triple combination with Dolutegravir, which both have tentative approvals by FDA under PEPFAR. We also recently received first approval from WHO Prequalification of Medicines Program for our generic version of Gilead's Sovaldi, which will be available in developing countries. 
As we said, the foundation of our business remains strong, and the rebased 2017 business provides opportunities for us going forward. 
Let me now provide you some backdrop to our revised adjusted EPS target of at least $5.40 in 2018, which represents 20% growth from 2017 based on the midpoint of our revised adjusted EPS guidance range announced today. In revising this target, we took into consideration the current headwinds we face in the U.S.A., including increased competition on our base business, and have assumed that they will continue through 2018. We have also assumed that launches deferred from 2017 will happen in 2018. 
However, we have adjusted our expectations for the contribution from these new launches. This includes anticipated launches of generic Advair and generic Copaxone. We have also taken into account the full impact of an anticipated launch of an AB substitutable generic to EpiPen. 
Further, we continue to identify additional cost savings opportunities from the continued rationalization and optimization of our platform above and beyond the targets communicated at Investor Day. We have recognized that the U.S. industry outlook has changed substantially, and we are rapidly adapting our business to reflect these new market dynamics. 
That said, we see additional growth opportunities outside the U.S.A. as we successfully integrate our platform and operate as One Mylan in these geographies. We also have maintained financial flexibility in order to ensure we can pursue additional business development opportunities as they arise. 
There are many assets becoming available, and we will be opportunistic and prudent in pursuing those that will be a right fit for our business, filling a product or geographic gaps. With the commercial footprint we have in place, there are great opportunities to drop in, find products and get more out of them as part of One Mylan. 
In summary, as a result of the platform, portfolio and pipeline we have built and our proven capability to execute, Mylan remains extremely well positioned to meet the needs of customers and patients around the world. Our industry can be challenging one, but we are built to overcome and weather these challenges like few other companies are, and we have in place more opportunities than ever before. As a result, I am very confident in our future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on commercial landscape. Thank you."

I would like to reiterate the confidence you heard from Heather and Rajiv in the underlying strength of our businesses around the world, our proven ability to overcome adversity in our business environment and",985,"Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. I would like to reiterate the confidence you heard from Heather and Rajiv in the underlying strength of our businesses around the world, our proven ability to overcome adversity in our business environment and the many opportunities we have for continued commercial leadership and sustainable growth. 
I would now like to provide a framework for the management and commercial execution around our business from a geographic segment perspective, selling our broad portfolio across all channels in a holistic manner as One Mylan as we focus on being a partner of choice to our customers. 
We will start with our strong performance in Europe, which demonstrates what we've been able to build in this region over the past several years through continued and consistent execution and effective integration of the entire Mylan platform, most recently the Meda acquisition. As a result of the focus on execution, Europe now makes up more than 30% of our total revenues. We've been able to successfully maintain and expand upon our leadership positions in countries like France, Italy and Portugal while capitalizing on meaningful growth opportunities in the U.K., Germany and Spain. 
Our European business is also diversified across channels, with strong positions across brands, generics and now OTC, where we have an established presence from the Meda acquisition. We are encouraged by the growth potential of our brands in the region, such as Dymista, Creon, Influvac, Brufen and Betadine. And we are also excited about our strong future pipeline. 
Our Rest of World segment continues to show double-digit revenue growth and now makes up more than 20% of our total revenues. While our ARV business continues to perform strongly, we are very pleased that the integrated platform we have built in key geographic markets is also yielding benefits. 
For instance, we saw strong performance of 20%-plus revenue growth in Australia, a market where we have successfully integrated our platform and are now selling across all channels. We continue to be the market leader in New Zealand and have experienced growth in Japan. Today, we are one of the top 5 generic companies in Japan, and we continue to seek ways to optimize our assets and develop new partnerships in this market. We also have high expectations for growth opportunities for many of our products in key emerging markets, such as China and Russia. 
Further, we are excited about the integration of Meda products around the region. We see key brands such as Dona, Elavil and ArmoLIPID being additional growth opportunities for us. 
Moving to our business in North America, which now represents less than 50% of our total revenues. We have built a comprehensive business in this region focusing on generic retail, institutional, branded and a small but fast-growing OTC business. As in our other regions, we are selling our portfolio across this entire platform as One Mylan. 
As Rajiv discussed, we have had a challenging quarter in North America, with pressures arising from both accelerated new approvals on our existing generic products and continued consolidation of our U.S. customer base. Specifically, contributions from new product launches in the U.S. was among the lowest in recent history. At the same time, we are seeing increased competitive pressure on our existing products as FDA focuses on bringing more competition to already genericized products through accelerated approvals. As noted in industry reports, in Q2, we saw a much higher number of approvals for competitors on our existing base business than we've seen historically or anticipated. While these dynamics have continued to put pressure on pricing in the region, overall price erosion in our North American Generics business remain in the mid-single digits for the quarter, in line with our expectations and global trends. 
However, as we noted last quarter, we expect fluctuations in the pricing environment in the third and fourth quarter due to having several meaningful first-to-market products that launched in 2016 come off of their exclusivity periods as well as accelerated competition on our base business. 
As a result of these factors, we expect to see full year price erosion for our North American Generics business in the high single digits. We were able to offset some of this choppiness through our global diversity, with several bright spots in the U.S. and elsewhere, which is why our global generics price erosion for the quarter and expectations for the year are mid-single digits. 
Turning to EpiPen. The decline in this product was more than forecasted, primarily due to increased competition and the impact of the launch of the authorized generic. We now represent more than 70% of the total epinephrine auto-injector market through our branded and authorized generic products. 
While the competition in this market remains robust, our customers and patients continue to value this product. Despite the many challenges this quarter, we firmly believe that our underlying business in North America is solid and that our scale and breadth will serve us well for the long term and continue to differentiate us. 
As the industry transforms, like it has many times over the last 20 years, and customers' consolidation continues, success in this region will be defined by those who offer the most robust and diverse product offerings across channels, deliver industry-leading customer service levels and commit to investing in complex new products with longer opportunity horizons. 
Those attributes define Mylan. While we always will see fluctuations on a quarter-by-quarter basis in relation to specific products and individual markets, and sometimes these fluctuations may be dramatic, over the long-term horizon, we believe we can deliver consistent and sustainable growth by focusing on supply, diversification and new product introductions. In fact, I feel like we are just getting started on maximizing our powerful commercial platform, and I continue to be very excited about the commercial opportunities we see in each of our regions. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."
290203,531267085,1279184,"Mylan N.V., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2017",2017-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results and summary. In Q2, we delivered total revenues of approximately $3 billion. That's an increase of 16% over the same period last year.

In Q2, we delivered total revenues of approximately $3 billion. That's an increase of 16% over the same period last year. This increase included growth in third-party net sales in both our European and Rest of World segments, which were up 59% and 29%, respectively. The growth in both segments was largely driven by contributions from our acquisitions last year of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business. 
Acquisitions also contributed to our North America segment more than $150 million, which helped to mitigate some of the impact associated with the decline in our EpiPen business, along with mid-single-digit generic price erosion that Tony just spoke about. 
As a result of these headwinds, our North American segment third-party net sales declined 9% year-over-year. And excluding the decline in EpiPen, North America was up 4%, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio and our ability to absorb the ongoing challenging dynamics in the U.S. 
On a consolidated basis, we reported adjusted gross margins of approximately 54% in the current quarter compared to approximately 56% in the same period last year. The decline is the result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, including EpiPen, partially mitigated by contributions from last year's acquisitions. 
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D was approximately 6% of total revenues or $171 million, which was in line with the prior year, including the incremental impact from acquisitions. 
Adjusted SG&A increased to $583 million primarily due to integrating the acquired businesses. However, I'll point out that adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues declined 150 basis points to less than 20%, driven by increased revenues from the acquired businesses along with benefits of Mylan integration. 
Moving to profitability. In Q2, adjusted earnings from operations was up approximately 15% when compared to the prior year. Similar to total revenue, the strong performance was largely due to increases in European and Rest of World segments, partially offset by declines in North America associated with the impact of EpiPen and the U.S. market dynamics discussed. 
Europe segment profitability was up 114%, and Rest of World segment profitability was up 197%, both reflecting contributions from the Meda acquisition as well as new product sales. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.10, which was down 5% when compared to the second quarter of last year. The decline was due to a higher adjusted effective tax rate, reflecting the impact of key product launch delays. In addition, our adjusted net earnings were also impacted by higher interest expense and share count when compared to the prior year, resulting from the acquisition of Meda. 
Briefly turning to our results for the 6 months ended June 30. Total revenues increased 20% to $5.7 billion. That includes acquisition contributions of approximately $1.2 billion. In addition, our adjusted net earnings for the 6 months ended June 30 increased $111 million to $1.1 billion, and adjusted EPS increased 6% to $2.03. 
Now turning to cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was very strong at $664 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2017. That compares to $485 million for the prior year. The increase in the current quarter is driven by favorable working capital performance. I'll note that on a year-to-date basis, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion compared to $687 million for the prior year. 
For the full year, even with our new adjusted EPS guidance range, we still expect to deliver on our initial cash flow guidance. In 2017, we said we expect to generate $2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow, net of $400 million to $500 million of capital expenditures. Our ability to generate strong cash flows continues to support the strength of our balance sheet and provide financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business. 
Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, was approximately 3.8x, and that's in line with the level at the end of 2016. While we continue to execute on our commitment to deleverage, as evidenced by our voluntary debt prepayment of more than $800 million in the first half of the year, we expect our leverage ratio at the end of the year will be higher than we had initially indicated. 
As a result of our revised EBITDA guidance, we now forecast our year-end debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to be closer to 3.7x. We remain fully committed to our deleveraging strategy; to compliance with our covenant requirements; to our long-term average debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3x; and most importantly, to our investment-grade credit rating. 
In our earnings materials this morning, you saw a comprehensive table detailing our revised 2017 guidance ranges. Before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to comment briefly on a few items in that table. 
As you heard earlier, as a result of the impact from delayed approvals by the FDA for complex products, including generic Advair and generic Copaxone, as well as the impact from the accelerated competitive U.S. market dynamic, including further price erosion in the U.S., we revised our full year 2017 guidance ranges. We're lowering our previous total revenue guidance range of $12.25 billion to $13.75 billion of revenues to our current range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, which now represents an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus full year 2016. 
As a result of the lower top line expectations, along with a dilutive impact it will have on our adjusted gross margins and effective tax rate and despite incremental cost-saving actions, we've also revised our adjusted EPS guidance down from the previous range of $5.15 to $5.55 per share to our new range of between $4.30 to $4.70 per share. That's a decrease of 8% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. 
As both Heather and Rajiv have already noted this morning, we're targeting at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS in 2018. We'll continue to work through our planning process, and we'll provide further updates as we get closer to setting our official 2018 guidance. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

It's a tough environment for all of these companies, but this is also an industry that has maintained roughly 30% operating margins over a long period of time, with improvements year-on-year. Now we're entering a period where we're seeing margin degradation. Where are we in this cycle of things? In other words, how much lower can margins go? And on the other hand, can they get back to where they were before? It seems to me that it's all entirely dependent on new product launches. But assuming product launches don't occur, how much lower can those margins go? And if I could just stick in another one, and it's kind of related, Heather, can you just talk about how your scale gives you leverage over the consolidated customers? It seems that -- Teva has said scale really hasn't helped them. And based on the new guidance for this year for Mylan, it would appear that scale may not be helping you either.

So yes, I'll start off, and then anyone else who wants to jump in can. So I guess here's what I would say. I think this goes back fundamentally, when you talk about the margins and what does this business look like going forward, I think, again, if we just stick within the United States, the diversity of your product portfolio, I think, is incredibly important. And I think that as you hear us continue to talk about not only that diversification from institutional to retail to continuing to build upon our OTC footprint, that kind of diversity within a segment absolutely helps maintain the margins that you've been used to, and I think, importantly, to your comment, new product launches when you think about complex new market formation and as we enter the biosimilar arena. So I do believe that those are going to be able to maintain the levels that you've been used to. Now with that being said, I think we're at a moment in time with the FDA that it's those launches that have continued to have some delay in timing, but they will come. And I think it's companies who have been able to invest and continue to maintain that investment in R&D and bring those important products to market is what will continue to differentiate companies that are able to maintain, I think, those margins that this industry has been used to for some time. But I don't think it's -- as always, one size doesn't fit all, and I don't think everybody's going to be able to maintain that. And I think having the levers to manage and maintain your portfolio to account for that is going to be very important. I think as far as scale goes, again, I think you have to differentiate scale. I think that as you referenced, Teva where they really doubled down on scale in the last few years within the United States. And I would say that as we see this market changing dramatically and transforming itself, that perhaps more of the same in this market isn't going to get you very much. And I think that we've been pretty vocal and consistent about that over the last couple of years. When you think about scale, building scale over the global platform, as you look at Mylan today with over 50% of our revenues coming outside of the United States and us really doubling down over the last few years about building not only Europe, Rest of World but our global supply chain, our vertical integration, it's that sustainability and differentiation that I absolutely believe will continue to pay off. Yes, are these -- are there challenges in this U.S. market, which is the largest pharmaceutical market in the world? Absolutely, and we're not running away from that. What we're saying is Mylan's ability to withstand those challenges and, I think, come out stronger in this U.S. market is definitely what we're confident in. But it's our global scale across these regions, both from an operation and a commercial perspective, which I think is what will continue to be able to differentiate ourselves. And as I said, I can assure you, I'm committed as CEO to get out there and make sure we're engaged in educating that investors really have the opportunity to understand our opportunities outside the U.S. as well as those that are coming with all the pipeline products that Rajiv spoke about."

So it's perplexing because it's some -- this whole reorganization within FDA is coming into play, and we see this being on complex and niche products, which are in this sort of bracket. Having said that, as I told you, we remain very confident. We see no issue of us bringing to the market, and it's a timing issue. And that's what we are trying to adjust. On Neulasta, we continue to work with the FDA. We continue to work on the science as well as on the GMP front. And as you know, we have not factored in any revenues even in 2018 in any meaningful way from biosimilars. But if there is a one upside which I can see from biosimilars and where -- how the competitive landscape is lining up between other different players who are ahead of us, Neulasta might be the one. But we'll give you more visibility as we go along."

And one of those slides will bring those numbers out for you. We actually show segment, not only sales but profitability. But just to highlight the numbers, the North America segment's continuing to run at about 50% segment profitability level while the expansion in profitability in both the European and Rest of World segments shows that Europe is running now north of 25% profitability, and you know the numbers a few years ago were significantly lower than that. And in Rest of World for the quarter was about 33% segment profitability. So expansion in that segment nicely as well. But that data is out there available for you if you just click on the website and download those slides."

If we think about the adjustment to your profitability expectations this year, just simply EPS, could you just maybe give us a little bit insight or just kind of rank order of all the factors that we've talked about, accelerated pricing pressure and sort of the ongoing impact of the evolution of these consortiums and kind of the rebidding process or the pushout in new product launch expectations? Is there any one factor that sort of stands out much more than the others in terms of leading to revision in your expectation? I'm just trying to figure out where the team was probably most surprised with respect to those dynamics because I certainly think pushing out $500 million in product sales is quite a bit different in terms of the implications than suggesting there's been a $500 million permanent impairment on the base. So was just hoping to get a little bit more insight into the different dynamics there."

Our -- I would say first and foremost, it's launches. When you look at, on both fronts, the continued delay on new, complex key market or key product launches -- and as we've said, and I can't underscore this enough, we honestly see the administrative as the barrier and not the science. And I think we are, I can assure you, working diligently to daily be in contact with the FDA and work through these issues. And I'm highly optimistic that given even the new commissioner's recent commentary that this is a very important area, they recognize that getting these products to market are important. So -- but if you say the delay of those launches as well, if you look over the last 2 months, I think the acceleration is almost near double of approvals in these already commoditized generic products. So when you're bringing #3, 4, 5, 6 to the market, and approvals, I think, jumped up last month to over 90 approvals all kind of falling in that bucket, which is why we acknowledge that increased competition on the existing products and recognize and called out this high single-digit in North America or U.S. generic. So I think both of those really were the primary driver. And to your point, the first one is the most important because this isn't a permanent hit. It's a deferred one. And that's why we did what we thought was the most prudent thing to do of pushing those into '18. But I can tell you we're fighting every day to have them come as soon as they possibly can. So after that, I think things like EpiPen -- I mean, you think of all of the different kind of compounding factors that have culminated right now. I think that's kind of finding its footing. And I think important to recognize that we're down to -- it's going to be less than 5% of this company's profit going forward. So I mean, we -- I think it has definitely rebased itself, and we see that kind of final settling of where EpiPen is and what it means to us as a product. And I would say those are your -- the 2 big factors. And as we step back because of that unpredictability, it's why we took the moves we did and know that we pride ourselves on giving you guys that visibility and transparency as we see it. I think over the last year, we've talked about while there's been challenges in the industry, we had not -- Mylan had been able continue to absorb those challenges and that volatility. And when we get to a moment where we'd say, you know what, the impact of both of those things moved pretty dramatically over these last couple of months, and which is why we made the steps we did, but couldn't be more confident in what we've put out there and, I think most importantly, excited about still offering a 20% year-over-year growth as we look into the target we've put out there for next year. So I don't know if anybody -- okay. Thank you for that."

I would say that the consolidation, obviously, you continue to see, I think, we're down really now to about 3 buying consortiums here in the United States. I do think importantly, we'll point out that they're also not just buying for the U.S. These are global, now, buyers coming together. And from our perspective, that being able to supply globally as well as having these important products come to market -- so while they're deferred, it doesn't take away their importance. Speaking of generic Advair, which I think we still feel confident that even though deferred, we're going to be the first to bring this product to market.

We -- our global integrated platform and the segments allow us to run this and manage this business globally. Now coming back to Advair, I think I would like to take this opportunity to clarify and explain one of the remarks I made about how reorganization with FDA can impact it. Take Advair, generic Advair. It's been a 9 year-long journey, and we had intense collaboration with FDA until definition of this ANDA and saw many face-to-face meetings and agreement on several protocols. As the FDA transformed over the last 2, 3 years and emergence of OPQ and -- between OGD and OPQ, many new players have come on -- come in, and many new draft guidance is posted even this year in the beginning of this year, which was on devices. So there can be different opinions which can come at a point, and that's what led to this extensive CRL which we received. We took this opportunity. We took -- FDA took about 4 months to give us this meeting, but this was one good meeting to put everything on the table and come to a good spot and agree with the FDA that they -- whatever we have provided them as part of the product-specific guidance is good enough. We don't need any more data. We don't need any more clinical study or device-related studies. And that's what I meant from how sometimes reorganization or this transformation can impact some touch -- especially the complex and the first approval. Having said that, we have -- we are in the process of consolidating this response and will -- this response will be out the next [ week ]. We have to get it in the -- within the next couple of weeks. And we continue to work with the FDA for this high-priority product."

I think that's why we call out -- we were taking a prudent step to put them into 2018, and we've also not just deferred everything as it all looks the same being deferred for a year. So as my commentary noted that not only were we deferring U.S. key launches, we were taking into account their contribution. And so again, it's looking at this whole portfolio and risk adjusting for that, but we have taken that same approach, have been, like I said, prudent as we think about their contribution in 2018. As for the FDA and the prioritizing of ANDAs, look, I mean, is it where we'd like it to be? No. If it was where we'd like it to be, we would be seeing, I think, approvals of important product that have no generic competition into the marketplace. But I'm hopeful that we continue, that the FDA is focusing on their processes and prioritizing, we're certainly doing our part working with them. And I believe we will get there. It's just -- again, sometimes when you're in these transformation, FDA themselves is in a transformation, and continuing that performance while you transform is sometimes difficult. But I'm truly hopeful that we get to where ANDAs are prioritized in the backlog and getting important first-to-market products to the market are at the top."

But as you look to the right of the supply chain, the lack of competition, everything to the right of the manufacturer has continued to constrict. So not only are you down to just 3 buying groups, you're down to every single step along the way until it reaches the patients' hands has become a very constricted and less competitive marketplace. So I agree that I believe that as FTC and others looked at that landscape, there could be unintended consequences to letting that entire supply chain become very less competitive, meaning, at the end of the day, I think what this country's got to continue to find a solution for is ultimately the product getting into patients' hands and doing it as competitively and market driven as possible."

To say that times are changing would be an understatement. However, as history shows, it's during times like these that industries and companies transform themselves. The gen",1076,"Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. To say that times are changing would be an understatement. However, as history shows, it's during times like these that industries and companies transform themselves. The generic as well as the entire health care industry is now at an inflection point, and every company's intersection with this point is unique. 
Our transformation from a domestic company started a decade ago when we committed to a strategy of globalization, diversification and scale. As important as developing our strategy is how we have consistently executed against it and further derisked our platform. We have been very purposeful on the types of acquisitions we do, and we are very disciplined about integrating them. We undertook this strategy because of the volatility inherent in any geographic- or product-centric model. Since 2007, this strategy has allowed us to overcome periods of intense competition, consolidation, unpredictable regulatory environments and geographic economic fluctuations around the world. 
At times, this may have seemed like the road less traveled, but given the industry environment today, I believe the path we chose and our patience and commitment to deliver over the long term is paying off given our guidance and especially our outlook in the face of the significant headwinds in the U.S. market. In fact, there's never been a better time to recognize how unique our intersection with the industry is. We have built a global pharmaceutical company that is a leader in each of our geographical regions and which no longer resembles the companies that are focused solely on running just generic and/or specialty pharmaceutical businesses. 
This is precisely why we introduced new geographical reporting segments at the end of last year. In doing so, we're providing investors with visibility into how we are running and driving our business and, at current valuations, believe we are also distinguishing Mylan's differentiated platform as an opportunity, creating yet another new entry point for investors to come into our security. 
Our second quarter performance is a testament to the importance of diversity and building for the long term. We generated total revenues of close to $3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase that was driven by growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments, which now account for more than 50% of Mylan's overall revenues. 
On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $590 million or adjusted EPS of $1.10, down 5% compared to the same period in 2016. While Europe and Rest of World grew significantly as expected, our North America segment was down considerably year-over-year due to delayed launches in EpiPen. We expect these dynamics to continue for some time and for approval delays to persist this year as the FDA continues to reorganize and adapt its processes and priorities. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2017, we continue to have great confidence in our underlying business in every region. However, given this unpredictability and in an abundance of caution, we have removed Copaxone and Advair from our 2017 financial guidance and have simply deferred them to 2018. 
As a result of rebasing our North America business, we now expect to deliver total revenues this year of between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion and adjusted EPS of between $4.30 and $4.70. Our outlook for Europe and Rest of World remains essentially in line with our previously stated expectations. And similarly, we expect no further adjustments to what we already have laid out with respect to EpiPen. 
I note as well that given our breadth, diversification and ability to matter more to customers, our outlook reflects global generic pricing erosion in the mid-single digits, which now takes into account high single-digit erosion in North America generics. 
Turning to 2018. We're moving our targeted adjusted EPS to at least $5.40 for the year, revised from $6. This new target represents 20% growth over 2017 based on the midpoint of our revised range. It incorporates a rebasing of the impact of deferred key U.S. launches and their associated contributions to profitability, AB generic competition to EpiPen, further optimization of our commercial and operational platforms and capital deployment as we utilize our financial flexibility. 
So yes, this was a tough quarter, and it'll be a challenging year due to the volatility and uncertainty in the U.S., the world's largest pharmaceutical market. But we haven't in the past and still are not managing this company quarter-to-quarter. We're managing it for the long term. And that's why today, we've been able to maintain our business while continuing to invest and build for sustainable growth. 
Further, as CEO, I can assure you that given our depressed share price, I'm very focused on continuing to engage and educate investors about the true value of Mylan's unique and highly differentiated platform. Indeed, when we step back and look at our business holistically, we find ourselves more confident and optimistic than ever about Mylan's prospects. We have a product portfolio and pipeline that is exceptionally deep and broad, covering numerous important therapeutic franchises, including medicines for which demand is very strong and growing rapidly, such as respiratory products and biosimilars. 
A great example of the latter is our proposed biosimilar for trastuzumab, which recently received a unanimous vote recommending approval from FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee. As impressive is the sheer scale and scope of our operational and commercial infrastructure, which positions us to truly expand the world's access to high-quality products and meet the needs of the industry's dynamic and rapidly consolidating customer base. We also continue to have financial flexibility given our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation. In addition, unlike many of our peers, we have a very stable and perhaps one of the most experienced leadership teams in this industry. We believe its continuity reflects the soundness of our strategy, our unwavering focus on building for the long term and the resilience of our culture. 
For all of these reasons, we believe that Mylan's best years lie ahead, which is particularly meaningful given the 25% CAGR in adjusted EPS that we delivered between 2008 and 2016. For making this opportunity possible and for our second quarter performance, I'd like, on behalf of Mylan's board and entire leadership team, to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution and for their continued commitment to delivering better health for a better world. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv."

Before I begin, I, too, would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and continued unwavering focus on our mission and business objectives despite the challenges that come our way. 
Let's turn to the second quarter results. I'll provide an overview of our top line performance, and Ken will get into the segment profitability. 
Overall, we delivered nearly USD 3 billion in total revenues for the quarter, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year. As Heather noted, this performance is a result of the breadth, diversity and resilience of our global integrated platform, which has given us the strength to manage the headwinds and ensured long-term sustainability. This quarter, the headwinds came primarily from the U.S., where challenging market dynamics accelerated. However, our performance in our Europe and ROW segments delivered on our expectations. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our Meda and Topicals Business acquisitions, which continue to meet and exceed our expectations in their contributions. 
Let me provide some more detail on the challenging environment in North America, especially in U.S., which resulted in third-party net sales declining by 9% to about $1.3 billion. I note that the region will have seen an increase of 4% if not for higher-than-anticipated negative impact from EpiPen Auto-Injector. During the quarter, we saw increased competition resulting from FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth or fifth generics. Unfortunately, we have not seen the same for the first generics nor for more complex and niche products, which we believe have been impacted by the recent ongoing reorganization within FDA. 
However, while the timing of realizing some of these opportunities may be delayed, our confidence in our ability to bring these products to market and maximize their potential has not changed. To be prudent, we have taken contribution from the major product launches in U.S. out of our guidance for 2017. That said, we continue to remain optimistic based on commentary by Commissioner Gottlieb and other senior FDA officials that FDA is committed to enhancing its capabilities and approval process for complex generics. 
Another consistent pressure point in our industry is pricing, where, again, our approach operating global scale and diversity continues to help us manage these challenging conditions. While we will continue to see choppiness in pricing across individual markets, exemplified by increasing pressure in U.S., the global generic pricing environment this quarter was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance. However, given the environment in U.S.A., we have adjusted our expectations for a price erosion in our global Generics business to mid-single digits for the year. Tony will further elaborate on this topic. 
Turning to Europe. Sales totaled more than $950 million, a year-over-year increase of 59%. The increase was primarily the result of contributions from the Meda acquisition. 
In Rest of the World, sales totaled approximately $690 million, a year-over-year increase of 29%. This increase was primarily driven by the Meda acquisition along with sales from new products and higher volumes from existing products, which more than offset lower pricing. 
Shifting to integration. We continue to make good progress in the integration of Mylan, as evidenced by 150 basis point decline year-over-year in our adjusted SG&A spend as a percentage of total revenues. In recognition of challenging environment we are operating in, we continue to identify additional cost synergies as well as revenue synergy opportunities that we expect to realize in 2017-2018 time frame. 
Let me now talk about generic Copaxone and generic Advair. Regarding Copaxone, we are disappointed with the execution by FDA of this complex ANDA as the administrative time line continues to move despite a number of interactions as well as meeting all of the criteria as per the product-specific guidance issued by FDA. Having said that, we strongly believe in our science and have no pending scientific questions or any additional studies required at this time and are looking forward to this long-pending approval. 
On generic Advair front, we very recently met with the FDA with regards to the complete response letter, which we received in the late March. We were pleased with the highly constructive nature of our dialogue with the agency, and we were able to clarify and resolve a number of key points raised in the CRL. Based on this interaction, we can confirm that no further clinical or device-related studies are required, and we plan to submit our response to the CRL in the next couple of weeks. We believe that agency continues to consider this application as a high priority, and we continue to be ready from both a manufacturing as well as commercial perspective to launch upon approval. 
However, given the unpredictability of timing and in an abundance of caution, we have removed Copaxone and Advair from our 2017 financial guidance and have simply deferred them to 2018. Given all of this, we are very confident in our revised guidance for 2017. 
With regards to our operating platform, we are in the constructive dialogue with the FDA regarding the warning letter that our Nashik site in India received earlier this year. We are working closely with the agency to comprehensively resolve their 2 observations as expeditiously as possible. The site remains in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and MHRA. Unfortunately, the warning letter has delayed new U.S. launches from this site. 
We are pleased to have had the warning letter from Agila Oncology site lifted during this quarter, joining SFF and SPD in being cleared by FDA. With this warning letter now lifted and new approvals from these sites accelerating, we see the opportunity to further support the unmet needs in the injectables space. 
Turning now to some of our other pipeline programs, which will be key drivers of our future growth. Starting with our biosimilar portfolio. We are very pleased with the progress of our programs from a development perspective. We received unanimous approval from FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee for our proposed biosimilar, trastuzumab, last month. This is a very important milestone not just for this product but also for our overall biosimilars program and demonstrates the strength of our science in this complex area. We continue to execute on the review of our global submissions of trastuzumab and pegfilgrastim and working closely with our partner, Biocon, and the health authorities to address any outstanding issues. 
In addition, our proposed biosimilar, bevacizumab, also in partnership with Biocon, recently received approval from the Indian drug regulator. We look forward to bringing a more affordable alternative for metastatic colorectal cancer and lung cancer to patients in India and other Rest of the World markets. 
Our programs with Momenta are also progressing well. We expect to report top line data for the Phase I study for our biosimilar, ORENCIA, candidate by the end of the year. We are also advancing the development of M710, the next biosimilar candidate that we and Momenta are developing as part of our collaboration and plan on starting clinical studies in 2018. 
As a reminder, we have no material contributions from biosimilars in our guidance for 2017 or in our 2018 target. 
With regards to our insulin Glargine program, we presented data from the INSTRIDE study at the American Diabetes Association's Scientific Session in San Diego, which demonstrated the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Mylan's insulin Glargine in comparison to Lantus in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Our regulatory applications are in active review for Europe, Australia and Canada. 
From the U.S. commercial manufacturing strategy point of view, we have decided to include the manufacturing side variations from Bangalore to Malaysia upfront in the application rather than as a post-approval change. We are meeting with the FDA very shortly to reach agreement regarding their expectation in this regard for the U.S. filing. 
Our revefenacin collaboration with Theravance Biopharma for COPD continues to deliver results at every step along the development path. We recently announced positive results from a 12-month Phase III safety study, which demonstrated that revefenacin was generally well tolerated and no new safety issues were identified. We now feel that we have all the data necessary to support a successful NDA filing later this year. 
Turning to our infectious disease franchise. Our ARV business has been further strengthened by the first approval from WHO for new ARV combinations, specifically TLE400 and TLD, a triple combination with Dolutegravir, which both have tentative approvals by FDA under PEPFAR. We also recently received first approval from WHO Prequalification of Medicines Program for our generic version of Gilead's Sovaldi, which will be available in developing countries. 
As we said, the foundation of our business remains strong, and the rebased 2017 business provides opportunities for us going forward. 
Let me now provide you some backdrop to our revised adjusted EPS target of at least $5.40 in 2018, which represents 20% growth from 2017 based on the midpoint of our revised adjusted EPS guidance range announced today. In revising this target, we took into consideration the current headwinds we face in the U.S.A., including increased competition on our base business, and have assumed that they will continue through 2018. We have also assumed that launches deferred from 2017 will happen in 2018. 
However, we have adjusted our expectations for the contribution from these new launches. This includes anticipated launches of generic Advair and generic Copaxone. We have also taken into account the full impact of an anticipated launch of an AB substitutable generic to EpiPen. 
Further, we continue to identify additional cost savings opportunities from the continued rationalization and optimization of our platform above and beyond the targets communicated at Investor Day. We have recognized that the U.S. industry outlook has changed substantially, and we are rapidly adapting our business to reflect these new market dynamics. 
That said, we see additional growth opportunities outside the U.S.A. as we successfully integrate our platform and operate as One Mylan in these geographies. We also have maintained financial flexibility in order to ensure we can pursue additional business development opportunities as they arise. 
There are many assets becoming available, and we will be opportunistic and prudent in pursuing those that will be a right fit for our business, filling a product or geographic gaps. With the commercial footprint we have in place, there are great opportunities to drop in, find products and get more out of them as part of One Mylan. 
In summary, as a result of the platform, portfolio and pipeline we have built and our proven capability to execute, Mylan remains extremely well positioned to meet the needs of customers and patients around the world. Our industry can be challenging one, but we are built to overcome and weather these challenges like few other companies are, and we have in place more opportunities than ever before. As a result, I am very confident in our future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on commercial landscape. Thank you."

I would like to reiterate the confidence you heard from Heather and Rajiv in the underlying strength of our businesses around the world, our proven ability to overcome adversity in our business environment and the many opportunities we have for continued commercial leadership and sustainable growth. 
I would now like to provide a framework for the management and commercial execution around our business from a geographic segment perspective, selling our broad portfolio across all channels in a holistic manner as One Mylan as we focus on being a partner of choice to our customers. 
We will start with our strong performance in Europe, which demonstrates what we've been able to build in this region over the past several years through continued and consistent execution and effective integration of the entire Mylan platform, most recently the Meda acquisition. As a result of the focus on execution, Europe now makes up more than 30% of our total revenues. We've been able to successfully maintain and expand upon our leadership positions in countries like France, Italy and Portugal while capitalizing on meaningful growth opportunities in the U.K., Germany and Spain. 
Our European business is also diversified across channels, with strong positions across brands, generics and now OTC, where we have an established presence from the Meda acquisition. We are encouraged by the growth potential of our brands in the region, such as Dymista, Creon, Influvac, Brufen and Betadine. And we are also excited about our strong future pipeline. 
Our Rest of World segment continues to show double-digit revenue growth and now makes up more than 20% of our total revenues. While our ARV business continues to perform strongly, we are very pleased that the integrated platform we have built in key geographic markets is also yielding benefits. 
For instance, we saw strong performance of 20%-plus revenue growth in Australia, a market where we have successfully integrated our platform and are now selling across all channels. We continue to be the market leader in New Zealand and have experienced growth in Japan. Today, we are one of the top 5 generic companies in Japan, and we continue to seek ways to optimize our assets and develop new partnerships in this market. We also have high expectations for growth opportunities for many of our products in key emerging markets, such as China and Russia. 
Further, we are excited about the integration of Meda products around the region. We see key brands such as Dona, Elavil and ArmoLIPID being additional growth opportunities for us. 
Moving to our business in North America, which now represents less than 50% of our total revenues. We have built a comprehensive business in this region focusing on generic retail, institutional, branded and a small but fast-growing OTC business. As in our other regions, we are selling our portfolio across this entire platform as One Mylan. 
As Rajiv discussed, we have had a challenging quarter in North America, with pressures arising from both accelerated new approvals on our existing generic products and continued consolidation of our U.S. customer base. Specifically, contributions from new product launches in the U.S. was among the lowest in recent history. At the same time, we are seeing increased competitive pressure on our existing products as FDA focuses on bringing more competition to already genericized products through accelerated approvals. As noted in industry reports, in Q2, we saw a much higher number of approvals for competitors on our existing base business than we've seen historically or anticipated. While these dynamics have continued to put pressure on pricing in the region, overall price erosion in our North American Generics business remain in the mid-single digits for the quarter, in line with our expectations and global trends. 
However, as we noted last quarter, we expect fluctuations in the pricing environment in the third and fourth quarter due to having several meaningful first-to-market products that launched in 2016 come off of their exclusivity periods as well as accelerated competition on our base business. 
As a result of these factors, we expect to see full year price erosion for our North American Generics business in the high single digits. We were able to offset some of this choppiness through our global diversity, with several bright spots in the U.S. and elsewhere, which is why our global generics price erosion for the quarter and expectations for the year are mid-single digits. 
Turning to EpiPen. The decline in this product was more than forecasted, primarily due to increased competition and the impact of the launch of the authorized generic. We now represent more than 70% of the total epinephrine auto-injector market through our branded and authorized generic products. 
While the competition in this market remains robust, our customers and patients continue to value this product. Despite the many challenges this quarter, we firmly believe that our underlying business in North America is solid and that our scale and breadth will serve us well for the long term and continue to differentiate us. 
As the industry transforms, like it has many times over the last 20 years, and customers' consolidation continues, success in this region will be defined by those who offer the most robust and diverse product offerings across channels, deliver industry-leading customer service levels and commit to investing in complex new products with longer opportunity horizons. 
Those attributes define Mylan. While we always will see fluctuations on a quarter-by-quarter basis in relation to specific products and individual markets, and sometimes these fluctuations may be dramatic, over the long-term horizon, we believe we can deliver consistent and sustainable growth by focusing on supply, diversification and new product introductions. In fact, I feel like we are just getting started on maximizing our powerful commercial platform, and I continue to be very excited about the commercial opportunities we see in each of our regions. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ken."
290203,531267085,1279827,"Mylan N.V., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2017",2017-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results and summary. In Q2, we delivered total revenues of approximately $3 billion. That's an increase of 16% over the same period last year.

In Q2, we delivered total revenues of approximately $3 billion. That's an increase of 16% over the same period last year. This increase included growth in third-party net sales in both our European and Rest of World segments, which were up 59% and 29%, respectively. The growth in both segments was largely driven by contributions from our acquisitions last year of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business. 
Acquisitions also contributed to our North America segment more than $150 million, which helped to mitigate some of the impact associated with the decline in our EpiPen business, along with mid-single-digit generic price erosion that Tony just spoke about. 
As a result of these headwinds, our North American segment third-party net sales declined 9% year-over-year. And excluding the decline in EpiPen, North America was up 4%, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio and our ability to absorb the ongoing challenging dynamics in the U.S. 
On a consolidated basis, we reported adjusted gross margins of approximately 54% in the current quarter compared to approximately 56% in the same period last year. The decline is the result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, including EpiPen, partially mitigated by contributions from last year's acquisitions. 
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D was approximately 6% of total revenues or $171 million, which was in line with the prior year, including the incremental impact from acquisitions. 
Adjusted SG&A increased to $583 million primarily due to integrating the acquired businesses. However, I'll point out that adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues declined 150 basis points to less than 20%, driven by increased revenues from the acquired businesses along with benefits of Mylan integration. 
Moving to profitability. In Q2, adjusted earnings from operations was up approximately 15% when compared to the prior year. Similar to total revenue, the strong performance was largely due to increases in European and Rest of World segments, partially offset by declines in North America associated with the impact of EpiPen and the U.S. market dynamics discussed. 
Europe segment profitability was up 114%, and Rest of World segment profitability was up 197%, both reflecting contributions from the Meda acquisition as well as new product sales. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.10, which was down 5% when compared to the second quarter of last year. The decline was due to a higher adjusted effective tax rate, reflecting the impact of key product launch delays. In addition, our adjusted net earnings were also impacted by higher interest expense and share count when compared to the prior year, resulting from the acquisition of Meda. 
Briefly turning to our results for the 6 months ended June 30. Total revenues increased 20% to $5.7 billion. That includes acquisition contributions of approximately $1.2 billion. In addition, our adjusted net earnings for the 6 months ended June 30 increased $111 million to $1.1 billion, and adjusted EPS increased 6% to $2.03. 
Now turning to cash flow and liquidity. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was very strong at $664 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2017. That compares to $485 million for the prior year. The increase in the current quarter is driven by favorable working capital performance. I'll note that on a year-to-date basis, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion compared to $687 million for the prior year. 
For the full year, even with our new adjusted EPS guidance range, we still expect to deliver on our initial cash flow guidance. In 2017, we said we expect to generate $2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow, net of $400 million to $500 million of capital expenditures. Our ability to generate strong cash flows continues to support the strength of our balance sheet and provide financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business. 
Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, was approximately 3.8x, and that's in line with the level at the end of 2016. While we continue to execute on our commitment to deleverage, as evidenced by our voluntary debt prepayment of more than $800 million in the first half of the year, we expect our leverage ratio at the end of the year will be higher than we had initially indicated. 
As a result of our revised EBITDA guidance, we now forecast our year-end debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to be closer to 3.7x. We remain fully committed to our deleveraging strategy; to compliance with our covenant requirements; to our long-term average debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3x; and most importantly, to our investment-grade credit rating. 
In our earnings materials this morning, you saw a comprehensive table detailing our revised 2017 guidance ranges. Before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to comment briefly on a few items in that table. 
As you heard earlier, as a result of the impact from delayed approvals by the FDA for complex products, including generic Advair and generic Copaxone, as well as the impact from the accelerated competitive U.S. market dynamic, including further price erosion in the U.S., we revised our full year 2017 guidance ranges. We're lowering our previous total revenue guidance range of $12.25 billion to $13.75 billion of revenues to our current range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, which now represents an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus full year 2016. 
As a result of the lower top line expectations, along with a dilutive impact it will have on our adjusted gross margins and effective tax rate and despite incremental cost-saving actions, we've also revised our adjusted EPS guidance down from the previous range of $5.15 to $5.55 per share to our new range of between $4.30 to $4.70 per share. That's a decrease of 8% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. 
As both Heather and Rajiv have already noted this morning, we're targeting at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS in 2018. We'll continue to work through our planning process, and we'll provide further updates as we get closer to setting our official 2018 guidance. 
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

It's a tough environment for all of these companies, but this is also an industry that has maintained roughly 30% operating margins over a long period of time, with improvements year-on-year. Now we're entering a period where we're seeing margin degradation. Where are we in this cycle of things? In other words, how much lower can margins go? And on the other hand, can they get back to where they were before? It seems to me that it's all entirely dependent on new product launches. But assuming product launches don't occur, how much lower can those margins go? And if I could just stick in another one, and it's kind of related, Heather, can you just talk about how your scale gives you leverage over the consolidated customers? It seems that -- Teva has said scale really hasn't helped them. And based on the new guidance for this year for Mylan, it would appear that scale may not be helping you either.

So yes, I'll start off, and then anyone else who wants to jump in can. So I guess here's what I would say. I think this goes back fundamentally, when you talk about the margins and what does this business look like going forward, I think, again, if we just stick within the United States, the diversity of your product portfolio, I think, is incredibly important. And I think that as you hear us continue to talk about not only that diversification from institutional to retail to continuing to build upon our OTC footprint, that kind of diversity within a segment absolutely helps maintain the margins that you've been used to, and I think, importantly, to your comment, new product launches when you think about complex new market formation and as we enter the biosimilar arena. So I do believe that those are going to be able to maintain the levels that you've been used to. Now with that being said, I think we're at a moment in time with the FDA that it's those launches that have continued to have some delay in timing, but they will come. And I think it's companies who have been able to invest and continue to maintain that investment in R&D and bring those important products to market is what will continue to differentiate companies that are able to maintain, I think, those margins that this industry has been used to for some time. But I don't think it's -- as always, one size doesn't fit all, and I don't think everybody's going to be able to maintain that. And I think having the levers to manage and maintain your portfolio to account for that is going to be very important. I think as far as scale goes, again, I think you have to differentiate scale. I think that as you referenced, Teva where they really doubled down on scale in the last few years within the United States. And I would say that as we see this market changing dramatically and transforming itself, that perhaps more of the same in this market isn't going to get you very much. And I think that we've been pretty vocal and consistent about that over the last couple of years. When you think about scale, building scale over the global platform, as you look at Mylan today with over 50% of our revenues coming outside of the United States and us really doubling down over the last few years about building not only Europe, Rest of World but our global supply chain, our vertical integration, it's that sustainability and differentiation that I absolutely believe will continue to pay off. Yes, are these -- are there challenges in this U.S. market, which is the largest pharmaceutical market in the world? Absolutely, and we're not running away from that. What we're saying is Mylan's ability to withstand those challenges and, I think, come out stronger in this U.S. market is definitely what we're confident in. But it's our global scale across these regions, both from an operation and a commercial perspective, which I think is what will continue to be able to differentiate ourselves. And as I said, I can assure you, I'm committed as CEO to get out there and make sure we're engaged in educating that investors really have the opportunity to understand our opportunities outside the U.S. as well as those that are coming with all the pipeline products that Rajiv spoke about."

And I cited out administrative delays. And truly, there is no science we are dealing with anymore. There's not any pending studies which FDA has asked from us or something like that. So it's perplexing because it's some -- this whole reorganization within FDA is coming into play, and we see this being on complex and niche products, which are in this sort of bracket. Having said that, as I told you, we remain very confident. We see no issue of us bringing to the market, and it's a timing issue. And that's what we are trying to adjust. On Neulasta, we continue to work with the FDA. We continue to work on the science as well as on the GMP front. And as you know, we have not factored in any revenues even in 2018 in any meaningful way from biosimilars. But if there is a one upside which I can see from biosimilars and where -- how the competitive landscape is lining up between other different players who are ahead of us, Neulasta might be the one.

But just to highlight the numbers, the North America segment's continuing to run at about 50% segment profitability level while the expansion in profitability in both the European and Rest of World segments shows that Europe is running now north of 25% profitability, and you know the numbers a few years ago were significantly lower than that. And in Rest of World for the quarter was about 33% segment profitability. So expansion in that segment nicely as well.

Is there any one factor that sort of stands out much more than the others in terms of leading to revision in your expectation? I'm just trying to figure out where the team was probably most surprised with respect to those dynamics because I certainly think pushing out $500 million in product sales is quite a bit different in terms of the implications than suggesting there's been a $500 million permanent impairment on the base.

Our -- I would say first and foremost, it's launches. When you look at, on both fronts, the continued delay on new, complex key market or key product launches -- and as we've said, and I can't underscore this enough, we honestly see the administrative as the barrier and not the science. And I think we are, I can assure you, working diligently to daily be in contact with the FDA and work through these issues. And I'm highly optimistic that given even the new commissioner's recent commentary that this is a very important area, they recognize that getting these products to market are important. So -- but if you say the delay of those launches as well, if you look over the last 2 months, I think the acceleration is almost near double of approvals in these already commoditized generic products. So when you're bringing #3, 4, 5, 6 to the market, and approvals, I think, jumped up last month to over 90 approvals all kind of falling in that bucket, which is why we acknowledge that increased competition on the existing products and recognize and called out this high single-digit in North America or U.S. generic. So I think both of those really were the primary driver. And to your point, the first one is the most important because this isn't a permanent hit. It's a deferred one. And that's why we did what we thought was the most prudent thing to do of pushing those into '18. But I can tell you we're fighting every day to have them come as soon as they possibly can. So after that, I think things like EpiPen -- I mean, you think of all of the different kind of compounding factors that have culminated right now. I think that's kind of finding its footing. And I think important to recognize that we're down to -- it's going to be less than 5% of this company's profit going forward. So I mean, we -- I think it has definitely rebased itself, and we see that kind of final settling of where EpiPen is and what it means to us as a product. And I would say those are your -- the 2 big factors. And as we step back because of that unpredictability, it's why we took the moves we did and know that we pride ourselves on giving you guys that visibility and transparency as we see it. I think over the last year, we've talked about while there's been challenges in the industry, we had not -- Mylan had been able continue to absorb those challenges and that volatility. And when we get to a moment where we'd say, you know what, the impact of both of those things moved pretty dramatically over these last couple of months, and which is why we made the steps we did, but couldn't be more confident in what we've put out there and, I think most importantly, excited about still offering a 20% year-over-year growth as we look into the target we've put out there for next year. So I don't know if anybody -- okay. Thank you for that."

And second quick question was just on generic Advair. I believe you commented that you're going to be responding to the CRL over the next few weeks.

I would say that the consolidation, obviously, you continue to see, I think, we're down really now to about 3 buying consortiums here in the United States. I do think importantly, we'll point out that they're also not just buying for the U.S. These are global, now, buyers coming together. And from our perspective, that being able to supply globally as well as having these important products come to market -- so while they're deferred, it doesn't take away their importance. Speaking of generic Advair, which I think we still feel confident that even though deferred, we're going to be the first to bring this product to market.

We -- our global integrated platform and the segments allow us to run this and manage this business globally. Now coming back to Advair, I think I would like to take this opportunity to clarify and explain one of the remarks I made about how reorganization with FDA can impact it. Take Advair, generic Advair. It's been a 9 year-long journey, and we had intense collaboration with FDA till the submission of this ANDA and saw many face-to-face meetings and agreement on several protocols. As the FDA transformed over the last 2, 3 years and emergence of OPQ and -- between OGD and OPQ, many new players have come on -- come in, and many new draft guidance is posted even this year in the beginning of this year, which was on devices. So there can be different opinions which can come at a point, and that's what led to this extensive CRL which we received. We took this opportunity. We took -- FDA took about 4 months to give us this meeting, but this was one good meeting to put everything on the table and come to a good spot and agree with the FDA that they -- whatever we have provided them as part of the product-specific guidance is good enough. We don't need any more data. We don't need any more clinical study or device-related studies. And that's what I meant from how sometimes reorganization or this transformation can impact some touch -- especially the complex and the first approval. Having said that, we have -- we are in the process of consolidating this response and will -- this response will be out  in its way to FDA within the next couple of weeks. And we continue to work with the FDA for this high-priority product."

I think that's why we call out -- we were taking a prudent step to put them into 2018, and we've also not just deferred everything as it all looks the same being deferred for a year. So as my commentary noted that not only were we deferring U.S. key launches, we were taking into account their contribution. And so again, it's looking at this whole portfolio and risk adjusting for that, but we have taken that same approach, have been, like I said, prudent as we think about their contribution in 2018. As for the FDA and the prioritizing of ANDAs, look, I mean, is it where we'd like it to be? No. If it was where we'd like it to be, we would be seeing, I think, approvals of important product that have no generic competition into the marketplace. But I'm hopeful that we continue, that the FDA is focusing on their processes and prioritizing, we're certainly doing our part working with them. And I believe we will get there. It's just -- again, sometimes when you're in these transformation, FDA themselves is in a transformation, and continuing that performance while you transform is sometimes difficult. But I'm truly hopeful that we get to where ANDAs are prioritized in the backlog and getting important first-to-market products to the market are at the top."

But as you look to the right of the supply chain, the lack of competition, everything to the right of the manufacturer has continued to constrict. So not only are you down to just 3 buying groups, you're down to every single step along the way until it reaches the patients' hands has become a very constricted and less competitive marketplace. So I agree that I believe that as FTC and others looked at that landscape, there could be unintended consequences to letting that entire supply chain become very less competitive, meaning, at the end of the day, I think what this country's got to continue to find a solution for is ultimately the product getting into patients' hands and doing it as competitively and market driven as possible."

Before we get started, I'd like to send a special message to our employees in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and thank them for their perseverance following the devastating h",1378,"Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Before we get started, I'd like to send a special message to our employees in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and thank them for their perseverance following the devastating hurricanes that struck there during the quarter. We're extremely grateful that all of them are safely accounted for and are proud of how we all came together to support one another and people and surrounding communities in the storm's aftermath. So we recognize that the journey to rebuild will be a long one, especially in Puerto Rico, which was affected most severely. We're glad to report that our plant there is operational, and we have not experienced any shortages of the drugs we manufacture at the facility. 
Turning now to our business. I'm personally very grateful to say that after years of hopeful anticipation, it finally happened. Early last month, we received FDA approval of our Glatiramer Acetate product for both the 20- and 40-milligram strengths and immediately launched them into the U.S. marketplace. Being first to market with the 40-milligram strength as well as offering the 20 is a milestone in many regards. 
First and foremost, it underscores our scientific and regulatory capabilities to develop, secure approval of, manufacture and bring to market an extremely complex product despite an arduous multiyear process. Second, and equally as important, is our ability to continue to deliver on our mission of providing access to more affordable products to patients, and that's where our new Mylan MS advocate program comes in. It's designed to help patients get started and stay on track with their physician's treatment plan for either dosage strength. It should be noted that this program also paves the way for the many other products in our pipeline that have special commercialization needs. 
Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention how proud we are of all of our employees here at Mylan. Our success in launching this very important product, one of the largest generic launches in recent history, which could not have come at a better time, only stands as a reminder of why we get up every day and what we fight and stand for. This single launch alone could have the effect of saving billions of dollars cumulatively for MS patients, taxpayers and the overall health care system. 
This launch should also serve as an important reminder to all stakeholders in the health care system about the importance of our industry and the role that we play, especially as our industry continues to come under attack by those whom we believe may not fully understand or appreciate how our industry works and all that's involved in bringing very important products like this to market. 
Because of this, we applaud our industry's group, the Association for Affordable Medicine, for their hard work in helping educate all stakeholders interested in our health care system. 
With that said and while the U.S. health care system rebases itself, there are some fundamentals that will not change. The demand for high-quality Generics will not be going away. Generics already fill 90% of all prescriptions dispensed within the U.S. as well as a growing proportion of scripts filled around the world. Meeting this global demand is exactly what we envision and have executed on over the last decade. 
This is exactly why we moved out of the U.S. Generics and Specialty neighborhood and into a much larger and more resilient path in the global community. We've built our global platform to absorb and withstand geographic volatility, and it's through our product and channel diversification that Mylan has truly transformed itself from a single market, high-risk, first-to-file company into resilient global business with strong durable cash flows. 
To put a number to it, we now believe that approximately 75% of our more than $2 billion adjusted operating cash flows stem from predictable, recurring revenues across all markets around the world, leaving a 25% basket of smaller, less predictable products, primarily in the U.S. Generics market. This model provides Mylan with a unique opportunity to meet the demands of individual markets around the world much more reliably, and as a result, it positions us very differently from our peers. 
We believe there is a real disconnect between our current valuation and the global business we've built. I believe our depressed share price is reflective of investor sentiment regarding a U.S.-only marketplace, which, therefore, provides us an opportunity to educate and expand shareholders' knowledge base and therefore, our multiple. 
I am personally committed to helping shareholders fully understand our transformation and who Mylan is today, so that we can reach our intended goal of fully realizing Mylan's value through total shareholder return accretion. As a part of that commitment, we will be embarking on an investor outreach program that will lay out how we intend to adjust this disconnect. 
Specifically, we intend to effectively deploy capital for future growth while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue investing on our existing pipeline and additional opportunities to further enhance our pipeline. We will continue to look for and execute on opportunistic bolt-on transactions to add our existing platform. And finally, we will do all of this while continuing to grow the top and bottom line. 
Above all, the key message we'll be delivering is that we have built Mylan to last, and that what makes us different is what makes us durable. As a result, we now have a substantial number of opportunities that are unique to Mylan's growth profile. 
Having begun our transformation a decade ago, we have a huge start. And going forward, you can be absolutely sure we'll be executing to the best of our ability to use our strengths to matter even more to our customers, patients and health care systems around the world and therefore, continue delivering growth and value to our shareholders. 
You can find our presentation called Build to Last in the Investor Relations section of our website at mylan.com. When you arrive at this site, you'll also see an invitation to learn more about Mylan's story and our global impact by providing access to medicine, innovation and science and public health policy. It's part of the campaign we recently launched called Better Health for a Better World, and through it, we intend to better tell our story to a much broader audience. 
Turning to the third quarter. Our results, which included adjusted EPS of $1.10, were especially strong considering the ongoing challenges we experienced in the U.S., including accelerated deceleration of EpiPen sales, both from our launch of an authorized generic as well as the contraction of the overall epinephrine auto-injector market. 
Substantially moderating those challenges were our Rest of World and European segments, which together accounted for 60% of our third-party net sales during the quarter. Both segments showed continued strength, with our business in Europe again posting double-digit growth, a great example of the ability of our highly diversified global platform to absorb our industry's inevitable headwinds wherever they occur. 
As for the fourth quarter, given our GA launch and the stability of our platform, we see a strong finish ahead. We are, thus, increasing the low end of our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. 
Our new 2017 revenue range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full year 2016. Our new 2017 adjusted EPS range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share, a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. 
What's more, we believe the momentum and growth we see ahead is sustainable, which is why we remain confident in our 2018 target of at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS. We look forward to bringing you detailed guidance for 2018 during our 4Q call. 
We're once again continuing to deliver and differentiate Mylan in a rapidly changing industry. And for our third quarter performance, I'd like on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution and for their commitment to delivering better health for a better world. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

Before I begin, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and unwavering focus on our mission, especially those who were affected recently by natural disasters. We are very proud of our employees who, despite personally going through this ordeal, were able to ensure that there was no significant disruption and drug shortages from our facilities.
Let me briefly turn to our third quarter results. I will provide an overview of our top line performance, and Ken will covered segment profitability. 
Overall, we delivered nearly $3 billion in total revenues for the quarter, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year. We saw strong performance in our Europe and Rest of the World regions, which again represent more than half of our revenue. This helped to partially mitigate the expected decline in North America. 
All regions benefited from contributions from our acquisition of Meda businesses, which continue to perform well and meet our expectations. Mylan integration is going strong, and we're excited to see that integrated platform come to life with no business disruption while we brought various assets from Meda and Renaissance together. Now we are continuing to optimize the assets we have acquired and identify additional cost-saving as well as revenue opportunities beyond what we have previously stated and are expected to generate additional annual saving of more than $200 million.
In North America, our robust portfolio, rich pipeline, commercial infrastructure and our long-standing relationships we have fostered with our customers give us the unique ability to face the turbulence of this market. We expect to see sustainable cash flows from our hard-to-make, complex product portfolio, which generally have a high regulatory hurdle to quite and oftentimes, require clinical trials and thus, give relatively better visibility of emerging new competition. 
Also, such complex products usually provide more predictable and durable cash flows. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from North America. We also anticipate that our growing portfolio of injectables, OTC as well as Topicals Business will also further contributes to our stability and future growth in this market. 
I would also note that EpiPen, the one big reason for decline this year, is projected to be less than 3% of total revenue and is not a meaningful contributor as we go into 2018. 
A strong and sustainable performance in Europe is being delivered from our well-executed integrated platform of Mylan legacy, Abbott EPT and Meda businesses. Our European business is no longer primarily generic but has approximately 2/3 of revenue coming from our Rx and OTC channels. 
Our portfolio of key brands like Creon, Influvac, Dymista, Dona, Betadine, and EpiPen belongs to a class of hard-to-make, complex products and provide us predictable and durable cash flows. These brands have a great brand equity in these markets and also given the nature of these markets, do not get genericized over night. About 40% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows comes from Europe. We will be further focusing on our global key brand portfolio, and we'll continue to make sustainable efforts to further grow and expand these across other countries. 
Also, we're excited by the growth opportunities we see to further strengthen our business in our key markets like France, Italy, Germany, Poland, U.K. and Nordics, where we are now in position to add many more exciting products from our pipeline like biosimilars and through a cross-pollination of our vast portfolio as we go along. 
Our Rest of the World business currently represents approximately 60% of revenues from Generics, with the rest from Rx and OTC. This business not only is a significant source of durable cash flows but will be a significant contributor for sustained growth in the future. We are focusing on expansion of our strong global portfolio into various markets, which came along with Meda acquisition like China, Russia, Turkey, Mexico as well as Brazil. 
Our Australia and Japanese businesses will continue to show a sustained performance. Also, we'll continue to build on our successful track record of our performance and expand this further globally beyond emerging markets of sub-Saharan Africa. 
For example, we recently announced a 3-year volume-based contract with a consortium constituting of Gates Foundation, PEPFAR and Global Fund to provide the new [indiscernible] GLD for more than 90 countries. This is a significant step to accelerate treatment roll out as part of global efforts to reach all 36.7 million people living with HIV. This initiative will give this otherwise relatively volatile business more predictability, stability and growth over a period of time. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from the Rest of the World. 
Before I review our key pipeline programs, let me start by saying that we are very pleased to have received FDA approval of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as another much-needed alternative to the Copaxone 20-milligram. 
We have always believed in our science, regulatory and intellectual property capabilities, and we're excited to bring this affordable and substitutable product ultimately to the patients who are dealing with this very difficult disease. This approval is a perfect example of how Mylan's mission of providing high-quality medicines to those who need them is consistent with FDA's focus on access to complex Generics. 
We also are excited about the opportunity to launch the generic version of Copaxone 40-milligram with our partner in certain key European countries as we receive EMA approval in October. Each country will now follow its own process to obtain marketing authorization to launch in their country. We have already launched generic version of Copaxone 20-milligram in certain European markets. 
From the future pipeline investments point of view, we'll continue to focus on the development and manufacturing of complex products while we diligently invest in our businesses, including ARV, injectables, Topicals and all solid dosage forms. This is especially the case with our injectable portfolio as we are seeing more approvals come through for these products. 
As you recall, we acquired Agila with the goal of becoming a reliable, global source of high-quality injectables for patients. With the period of enhancements to the acquired facilities behind us, this growth is now a reality. 
This year alone, we received more than 20 approvals of injectables in U.S. and more than 70 products are in our pipeline or pending approval. Complex and hard-to-make products especially require substantial R&D resources and investments, a strong regulatory and intellectual property expertise along with an ability to invest significant capital to manufacturer and commercialize these products. We believe Mylan is well positioned in all of these areas to execute on our other pipeline opportunities. 
Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs. Starting with our biosimilar programs. The regulatory environment continues to be active over the last few months. While we believe additional changes are still needed to enable the U.S. biosimilar market, we are encouraged by the commitments expressed by Commissioner Gottlieb and steps being taken by U.S. FDA in facilitating the views as well as their recent initiation of their efforts to educate physicians on the benefits and the cost savings of biosimilars. 
We are also very pleased at the steps we saw last week on the CMS for Medicare. Regarding our Biocon partnership, we continue to see progress with the submissions and regulatory process. With our pegfilgrastim application in the U.S.A., you will recall that FDA issued a CRL related to certain CMC data from drug product facility inspection. It is important to highlight the fact that the CRL did not raise any questions on biosimilarity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic, clinical data or immunogenicity. We remain very confident that we will be able to respond to the CRL in the next few weeks. 
On the GMP side, Mylan and Biocon have been in close collaboration with FDA, and we have a clear path towards it -- clear path forward to resolve issues identified in the inspection. 
For trastuzumab in the U.S.A., we continue to work with the FDA to resolve all outstanding issues, and we are hopeful to get this very important product approved very soon. Our DUFA goal date for this product is December 3, 2017. 
With respect to our pegfilgrastim and trastuzumab application in Europe, Mylan along with our partner, Biocon, has completed the corrective actions for the inspection of the rations and continue to make good progress toward inspection of the Bangalore site. We are also making progress on the Marketing Authorization Applications. 
As for the administrative protocol, we have resubmitted both applications to EMA to restart the review. We'll keep you posted on the progress on these programs as we go along. 
I also noted that for pegfilgrastim, we have also completed our regulatory submission for Canada, Australia and South Africa. And for trastuzumab, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 32 additional countries. And we have already received approvals in another 19 countries.
With respect to the Insulin Glargine, in the U.S., we submitted our 505(b) 2 application, which is under active review with the FDA. You have seen that we have been sued by sanofi, which triggered a 30-month stay on our approval. This 505(b) 2 application includes [indiscernible] and disposable pens with cartridges. For our part, we'll continue to work on this submission with FDA to bring an interchangeable alternative Glargine to the patients as soon as possible. 
For Europe, the insulin manufacturing facility in Malaysia has been given GMP clearance by EMA, and we continue to have an ongoing and productivity traction with EMA on our application. In addition to the submission in U.S. and Europe, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 41 additional countries. We have already received approval in 6 other countries.
Moving to our Momenta partnership. Our biosimilar received initial top line results from its Phase I study last week, and unfortunately, it did not meet primary PK endpoints. We are disappointed by these results, and we'll work closely with Momenta to fully analyze the data and determine next steps. 
Additionally, with the respect to our next biosimilar candidate in this partnership, M710, we'll continue to plan for it to enter clinics in 2018. 
On the respiratory front, you will recall that we have conformed with FDA that no further clinical or device-related studies are required for our generic Advair program. We have responded to the CRL and continue to work with FDA for this very important product. Also, we are encouraged that FDA is treating this complex product as a high priority. We remain ready from a manufacturing and commercial perspective and are optimistic to bring this very important product to patients as soon as possible.
Our revefenacin collaboration with Theravance Biopharma continues to make progress, and just last week, we announced a presentation to the additional positive efficacy data from the 3-month pivotal Phase III study at 2017 annual meeting. We are expecting to file this NDA for a novel nebulized LAMA treatment for COPD very shortly. 
If you recall, we announced previously that we have entered into a partnership with the 3M for the development of generic version of Symbicort for the U.S. market. We are excited about the progress we are making in the development of this product and are confident that we are on track towards a 2018 ANDA 505(j) submission. Pivotal PK studies are now complete with demonstrated for both low- and high-strength products. 
Regarding our generic pharma, we have made good progress on our application, and we believe that we have a product that adheres to the FDA's latest new guidance. Our bridging goal date is December 31 of this year. With this district goal verdict behind us, we look forward to bring this very important product to patients soon. 
In summary, I remain confident that we are poised for future growth with this incredibly unique and durable platform, and I'm excited about the progress we are making within our pipeline, our continued commercial diversification breaking across different channels and geographies and our ability to mean more to our customers around the globe. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tony."

As Heather and Rajiv commented, the strong global diversified business we have built over the past decade gives us more confidence than ever about our future and our ability to be a key supplier to customers and patient",876,"Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning. As Heather and Rajiv commented, the strong global diversified business we have built over the past decade gives us more confidence than ever about our future and our ability to be a key supplier to customers and patients around the world. Our unique commercial platform is fit to withstand change in our industry and continues to distinguish Mylan as a partner of choice during a time of further consumer consolidation and globalization. 
One of the most important drivers behind our confidence is the daily effort made by our commercial team of nearly 7,000 people around the world. Without them, our products wouldn't reach the patients and providers who need it most. We are beginning to reap the rewards of long-term and significant investments in science and innovation that Rajiv outlined in his remarks with the much anticipated U.S. launch of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as the generic version of Copaxone 20-milligram. We are particularly pleased with our prescription uptake to date for the 40-milligram strength. 
For the week ending October 27, our share of new prescriptions was 16.2%, and total prescriptions was approximately 8%. We also are encouraged by the number of patients who are utilizing our comprehensive support services through our MS advocate program. Some of these services include in-home injection training with an experienced MS nurse, educational resources and a 24/7 patient support center. We view this launch as a critical opportunity to provide an affordable alternative for patients and payers while still optimizing conversion and delivering value for Mylan. We look forward to successfully commercializing both strengths of this product in other key markets around the world as we receive appropriate regulatory approvals. 
In addition to generic Copaxone in the U.S., we are pleased with the strong performance of some of our global key brands around the world such as Dymista, Dona, Betadine and Elavil. These important products, which were acquired through our Meda transaction, experienced significant growth this quarter and continue to exceed our original expectations. We expect this growth to continue as we leverage our strong commercial infrastructure in key markets like Italy, France, Germany and the emerging and expansion markets.
I'd now like to provide an overview of our regional performances beginning with North America. As anticipated and outlined last quarter, this segment declined about 22% to just under $1.2 billion. Sales of EpiPen declined by $245 million this quarter as the overall market contracted when compared to the robust growth from the same quarter the prior year as well as experiencing additional competition. 
Excluding EpiPen, North America declined 6% as anticipated and as outlined last quarter, primarily due to the impact of significant first-to-market products losing exclusivity over the prior year as well as increased competition. We are still estimating annualized price erosion in the high single digits for the region for 2017.
Despite these challenges, we continue to see momentum and be excited about the future for this region. We've been pleased with the launches of several limited competition products this quarter, most notably, the launch of tablets further strengthen our robust U.S. oncology portfolio, which now contains more than 40 products. This is a very important therapeutic area for Mylan globally, which would bolster even further in the coming years with the introduction of several biosimilars to treat cancer. 
That said, I am pleased to report that the geographic diversity of our platform, which we have been building over the last 10 years, also has been balancing pressure in North America. 
In Europe, sales totaled more than $1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24%. These strong results were due to incremental sales from our Meda acquisition and favorable pricing and volume trends in the region. This includes mid-single-digit organic growth in the region, specifically in some of our largest markets such as France, Italy, Germany, U.K. and the Nordics. 
We also continue to be excited about the stability and performance of our strong brands in the region such as Creon and Influvac as well as new growth from brands like Betadine, and Dymista. This quarter's growth from our acquired assets reinforces our confidence that building scale in Europe under our One Mylan approach has us well positioned within the region. 
In our Rest of World segment, sales totaled $740 million, a year-over-year increase of 9% driven primarily by our new Meda assets and strong performance in emerging markets. We are also seeing strong performance from some of our key brands in this region. Amitiza, for instance, delivered robust growth of more than 20% for the quarter in Japan, and we will continue to seek ways to optimize our assets and partnerships in this market. 
Overall, for the third quarter, we saw as expected global generic price deflation in the mid-single digits, and we continue to anticipate this for the full year 2017. 
In summary, we believe our unique product mix of Generics, brands and over-the-counter medications across a range of therapeutic categories and sold in multiple sales channels, combined with an expansive geographic reach and strong commercial platform, position Mylan better than any other company in the industry to serve our customers and deliver better health for patients. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."
290203,540834470,1333843,"Mylan N.V., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2017",2017-11-06,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues in the quarter declined slightly year-over-year to approximately $3 billion. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through our top line result",1075,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues in the quarter declined slightly year-over-year to approximately $3 billion. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through our top line results for Mylan in total and our segments. I'll now take you through the rest of our financial performance, which was in line with our expectations.
In the third quarter, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to approximately 57% from the same period last year. The decline is the result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, primarily EpiPen, partially mitigated by new product introductions and contributions from last year's acquisitions.
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D was approximately 6% of total revenues, which was in line with our expectations and down slightly from the prior year period due to the timing of clinical activities related primarily to our respiratory programs. 
SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, declined 3% to $586 million or approximately 20% of total revenues and also in line with our expectations. In the quarter, the benefits from our ongoing Mylan integration activities more than offset the incremental SG&A from our Meda acquisition.
Our adjusted tax rate was 17.5% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 18%. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. 
Moving on to segment profitability. As a result of the declines in third-party sales, including EpiPen, segment profitability in North America declined 27% in the quarter to $576 million. Partially offsetting this decline, segment profitability expanded in the Europe and Rest of World segments, reflecting contributions from the Meda acquisition as well as new products sales. 
When compared to the prior year period, the Europe segment profitability was up 15%, and Rest of World segment profitability was up 16%. 
Adjusted net earnings in the quarter declined to $590 million, and adjusted diluted EPS declined 20% to $1.10. 
Briefly turning to our results for the 9 months ended September 30. Total revenues increased to approximately $8.7 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of 11%. Acquisitions contributed approximately $1.4 billion in net sales during the 9-month period, and adjusted earnings for the 9 months ended September 30 decreased by $26 million to $1.7 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS decreased 5% to $3.13.
Now turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.1 billion for the 9 months ended September 30 compared to approximately $1.9 billion in the prior year period.
Capital expenditures totaled $156 million compared to approximately $240 million in the prior year.
As we said previously, we are fully committed to continuing to deleverage and have demonstrated that by paying down our debt by approximately $1.2 billion in the first 9 months of the year, which includes approximately $420 million in the third quarter.
As a result of our continued strong cash flow generation, for the full year, we expect to deliver on our initial cash flow guidance of between $2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow net of our revised capital expenditures range of $300 million to $350 million. 
Our ability to generate strong cash flows reflects the strength and durability of our portfolio, resulting from the decade-long transformation of our business into a global diversified player and is supported by the power of our balance sheet, which provides us with the financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business. 
At the end of Q3 2017, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio as calculated under our credit agreement was 3.6x and was in compliance with our covenant requirements. You may recall that following the Meda acquisition, we elected to increase the leverage ratio covenant as permitted under our credit agreement to 4.25x through the second quarter of 2017. 
Just last week, on November 3, we entered into amendments to the agreements for the 2016 term loans and 2016 revolving facility to extend the leverage ratio covenant of 4.25x through the December 31, 2018, reporting period. These amendments provide us with the additional financial flexibility as we manage our capital structure during 2018. This does not change in any way our commitment to our deleveraging strategy or maintaining our investment-grade credit rating as we continue to work towards our long-term average debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3.0x.
Moving on to the revised guidance. Primarily due to the approval and subsequent launch of generic Copaxone in the U.S. market, we've increased the low end of both our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS 2017 guidance ranges. 
Our revised total revenue guidance range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full year 2016.
Our new adjusted EPS guidance range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share. That's a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. This year-over-year decline reflects the ongoing North America generic business dynamics as well as the more than $500 million impact from the rebasing of our EpiPen brand. 
Moving to 2018. As Heather mentioned, we're continuing to target at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS, which is an increase of more than 18% from the midpoint of our new guidance range for 2017. This target factors in the launch of generic Copaxone as well as the deferred launches of complex products from 2017, including generic Advair. It also includes incremental savings from integration activities and cost actions, continued growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments as well as the continuation of a challenging North American environment. We'll provide further details of our 2018 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Before I turn it over to Q&A, I urge all of you to take a closer look at the Built to Last presentation that Heather spoke about earlier and which is posted on our website this morning. We're very proud of the business that we've built over the last decade, and this presentation highlights our transformational journey as well as the path we plan to take to fully realize the value transformation and our differentiated portfolio. We believe that our differentiated business model, our performance and our stable, durable cash flow generation are not yet reflected in our stock price valuation.

I think all the weaknesses you just laid out are all primarily U.S. driven. And as we continue to show, both from our European as well as our Rest of World segment, our ability to continue to grow at double digits in the case of Europe and high single-digit in Rest of World, that as we continue to leverage our assets, our products in these areas and continue to bring complex Generics as we'll be launching Copaxone throughout Europe, I think those are very important to telling the story of how we're continuing to be able to absorb the volatility and issue of Generics market and which is why I made the commentary that just remind everyone that we moved out that the neighborhood of just U.S. Generics and Specialty and into this global community. That's helping us absorb that, and the Mylan that we built today is able to continue to deliver and on our growth profile as we continue to bring these products to market. As far as the U.S. Generics, we continue to see those headwinds are going to continue for the foreseeable future, but I think again, the dynamics of our portfolio of the products we're launching, Rajiv spoke of the multiple injectable products we've launched and the 70 that are in our pipeline. So the durability again of what we are launching from complex to injectables as well as continuing to deliver on our outside of the U.S. platform is what's able to give us the confidence to say that at least 5 40 next year given all those things you just mentioned, taking into consideration. So what I would say is just again the message of the durability of our platform and our ability to absorb the volatility, which we believe really distinguishes us from our peers."

So I can assure you that the financial flexibility that we still have today and are maintaining because of our -- the generation of our cash flows that we're going to continue to be balanced as far as yes, paying down debt and staying committed investment grade but also have the flexibility to be able to bring the right products or dosage forms into our mix, both whether it's U.S., Europe or Rest of World. And I think you're going to continue to see us execute on that. And the last thing I'd say because it your point about the decimation of the industry. I think one thing I would just ask, and I've said this before, but I think it's continuing to play out is the continuity of our management team and the tenure of it. We've been together a decade as we continue to not only manage at the peaks but in the valleys. And I think that's where you see a management team that has had a strategy out there. We've executed to it. We continue to navigate the waters, I think, better than anybody else out there. So hopefully, that differentiation is what continues to put investors at ease with not only the credibility we've now hopefully amassed on the scientific side, but also just being able to continue to maximize this global platform and absorb what the industry is going through here in the U.S."

Before we get started, I'd like to send a special message to our employees in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and thank them for their perseverance following the devastating h",1383,"Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Before we get started, I'd like to send a special message to our employees in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and thank them for their perseverance following the devastating hurricanes that struck there during the quarter. 
We're extremely grateful that all of them are safely accounted for and are proud of how we all came together to support one another and people in surrounding communities in the storm's aftermath. So we recognize that the journey to rebuild will be a long one, especially in Puerto Rico, which was affected most severely. We're glad to report that our plant there is operational, and we have not experienced any shortages of the drugs we manufacture at the facility. 
Turning now to our business. I'm personally very grateful to say that after years of hopeful anticipation, it finally happened. Early last month, we received FDA approval of our Glatiramer Acetate product for both the 20- and 40-milligram strengths and immediately launched them into the U.S. marketplace. Being first to market with the 40-milligram strength as well as offering the 20 is a milestone in many regards. 
First and foremost, it underscores our scientific and regulatory capabilities to develop, secure approval of, manufacture and bring to market an extremely complex product despite an arduous multiyear process. Second, and equally as important, is our ability to continue to deliver on our mission of providing access to more affordable products to patients, and that's where our new Mylan MS Advocate program comes in. It's designed to help patients get started and stay on track with their physician's treatment plan for either dosage strength. It should be noted that this program also paves the way for the many other products in our pipeline that have special commercialization needs. 
Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention how proud we are of all of our employees here at Mylan. Our success in launching this very important product, one of the largest generic launches in recent history, which could not have come at a better time, only stands as a reminder of why we get up every day and what we fight and stand for. This single launch alone could have the effect of saving billions of dollars cumulatively for MS patients, taxpayers and the overall health care system. 
This launch should also serve as an important reminder to all stakeholders in the health care system about the importance of our industry and the role that we play, especially as our industry continues to come under attack by those whom we believe may not fully understand or appreciate how our industry works and all that's involved in bringing very important products like this to market. Because of this, we applaud our industry's trade group, the Association for Affordable Medicine, for their hard work in helping educate all stakeholders interested in our health care system. 
With that said and while the U.S. health care system rebases itself, there are some fundamentals that will not change. The demand for high-quality generics will not be going away. Generics already fill 90% of all prescriptions dispensed within the U.S. as well as a growing proportion of scripts filled around the world. Meeting this global demand is exactly what we envision and have executed on over the last decade. This is exactly why we moved out of the U.S. Generics and Specialty neighborhood and into a much larger and more resilient path in the global community. We've built our global platform to absorb and withstand geographic volatility, and it's through our product and channel diversification that Mylan has truly transformed itself from a single market, high-risk, first-to-file company into a resilient global business with strong durable cash flows. 
To put a number to it, we now believe that approximately 75% of our more than $2 billion adjusted operating cash flows stem from predictable, recurring revenues across all markets around the world, leaving a 25% basket of smaller, less predictable products, primarily in the U.S. Generics market. This model provides Mylan with a unique opportunity to meet the demands of individual markets around the world much more reliably, and as a result, it positions us very differently from our peers. 
We believe there is a real disconnect between our current valuation and the global business we've built. I believe our depressed share price is reflective of investor sentiment regarding a U.S.-only marketplace, which, therefore, provides us an opportunity to educate and expand shareholders' knowledge base and therefore, our multiple. 
I am personally committed to helping shareholders fully understand our transformation and who Mylan is today, so that we can reach our intended goal of fully realizing Mylan's value through total shareholder return accretion. As a part of that commitment, we will be embarking on an investor outreach program that will lay out how we intend to address this disconnect. 
Specifically, we intend to effectively deploy capital for future growth while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue investing on our existing pipeline and additional opportunities to further enhance our pipeline. We will continue to look for and execute on opportunistic bolt-on transactions to add to our existing platform. And finally, we will do all of this while continuing to grow the top and bottom line. 
Above all, the key message we'll be delivering is that we have built Mylan to last, and that what makes us different is what makes us durable. As a result, we now have a substantial number of opportunities that are unique to Mylan's growth profile. 
Having begun our transformation a decade ago, we have a huge start. And going forward, you can be absolutely sure we'll be executing to the best of our ability to use our strengths to matter even more to our customers, patients and health care systems around the world and therefore, continue delivering growth and value to our shareholders. 
You can find our presentation called Built to Last in the Investor Relations section of our website at mylan.com. When you arrive at this site, you will also see an invitation to learn more about Mylan's story and our global impact by providing access to medicine, innovation and science and public health policy. It's part of the campaign we recently launched called Better Health for a Better World, and through it, we intend to better tell our story to a much broader audience. 
Turning to the third quarter. Our results, which included adjusted EPS of $1.10, were especially strong considering the ongoing challenges we experienced in the U.S., including accelerated deceleration of EpiPen sales, both from our launch of an authorized generic as well as the contraction of the overall epinephrine auto-injector market. 
Substantially moderating those challenges were our Rest of World and European segments, which together accounted for 60% of our third party net sales during the quarter. Both segments showed continued strength, with our business in Europe again posting double-digit growth, a great example of the ability of our highly diversified global platform to absorb our industry's inevitable headwinds wherever they occur. 
As for the fourth quarter, given our GA launch and the stability of our platform, we see a strong finish ahead. We are, thus, increasing the low end of our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. 
Our new 2017 revenue range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full year 2016. Our new 2017 adjusted EPS range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share, a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. 
What's more, we believe the momentum and growth we see ahead is sustainable, which is why we remain confident in our 2018 target of at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS. We look forward to bringing you detailed guidance for 2018 during our 4Q call. 
We're once again continuing to deliver and differentiate Mylan in a rapidly changing industry. And for our third quarter performance, I'd like on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution and for their commitment to delivering better health for a better world. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

Before I begin, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and unwavering focus on our mission, especially those who were affected recently by natural disasters. We are very pro",2055,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and unwavering focus on our mission, especially those who were affected recently by natural disasters. We are very proud of our employees who, despite personally going through this ordeal, were able to ensure that there was no significant disruption and drug shortages from our facilities.
Let me briefly turn to our third quarter results. I will provide an overview of our top line performance, and Ken will cover segment profitability. Overall, we delivered nearly $3 billion in total revenues for the quarter, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year. We saw strong performance in our Europe and Rest of the World regions, which again represent more than half of our revenue. This helped to partially mitigate the expected decline in North America. 
All regions benefited from contributions from our acquisition of Meda businesses, which continue to perform well and meet our expectations. Mylan's integration is going strong, and we are excited to see that integrated platform come to life with no business disruption while we brought various assets from Meda and Renaissance together. Now we are continuing to optimize the assets we have acquired and identify additional cost-saving as well as revenue opportunities beyond what we have previously stated and are expected to generate additional annual saving of more than $200 million.
In North America, our robust portfolio, rich pipeline, commercial infrastructure and our long-standing relationships we have fostered with our customers give us the unique ability to face the turbulence of this market. We expect to see sustainable cash flows from our hard-to-make, complex product portfolio, which generally have a high regulatory hurdle to climb and oftentimes, require clinical trials and thus, give relatively better visibility of emerging new competition. 
Also, such complex products usually provide more predictable and durable cash flows. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from North America. We also anticipate that our growing portfolio of injectables, OTC as well as Topicals Business will also further contribute to our stability and future growth in this market. I will also note that EpiPen, the one big reason for decline this year, is projected to be less than 3% of total revenue and is not a meaningful contributor as we go into 2018. 
A strong and sustainable performance in Europe is being delivered from our well-executed integrated platform of Mylan's legacy Abbott EPD and Meda businesses. Our European business is no longer primarily generic but has approximately 2/3 of revenue coming from our Rx and OTC channels. 
Our portfolio of key brands like Creon, Influvac, Dymista, Dona, Betadine, Saugella and EpiPen belongs to a class of hard-to-make, complex products and provide us predictable and durable cash flows. These brands have a great brand equity in these markets and also given the nature of these markets, do not get genericized over night. About 40% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from Europe. We will be further focusing on our global key brand portfolio, and we'll continue to make sustainable efforts to further grow and expand these across other countries. 
Also, we're excited by the growth opportunities we see to further strengthen our business in our key markets like France, Italy, Germany, Poland, U.K. and Nordics, where we are now in position to add many more exciting products from our pipeline like biosimilars and through a cross-pollination of our vast portfolio as we go along. 
Our Rest of the World business currently represents approximately 60% of revenues from generics, with the rest from Rx and OTC. This business not only is a significant source of durable cash flows but will be a significant contributor for sustained growth in the future. We are focusing on expansion of our strong global portfolio into various markets, which came along with Meda acquisition like China, Russia, Turkey, Mexico as well as Brazil. 
Our Australia and Japanese businesses will continue to show a sustained performance. Also, we'll continue to build on our successful track record of our ARV performance and explore -- and expand this further globally beyond emerging markets of sub-Saharan Africa. 
For example, we recently announced a 3-year volume-based contract with a consortium constituting UNAIDS, CHAI, Gates Foundation, PEPFAR and Global Fund to provide the new [indiscernible] for more than 90 countries. This is a significant step to accelerate treatment rollout as part of global efforts to reach all 36.7 million people living with HIV. This initiative will give this otherwise relatively volatile business more predictability, stability and growth over a period of time. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from the Rest of the World. 
Before I review our key pipeline programs, let me start by saying that we are very pleased to have received FDA approval of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as another much needed alternative to the Copaxone 20-milligram. 
We have always believed in our science, regulatory and intellectual property capabilities, and we are excited to bring this affordable and substitutable product ultimately to the patients who are dealing with this very difficult disease. This approval is a perfect example of how Mylan's mission of providing high-quality medicines to those who need them is consistent with FDA's focus on access to complex Generics. 
We also are excited about the opportunity to launch the generic version of Copaxone 40-milligram with our partner, Synthon, in certain key European countries as we receive EMA approval in October. Each country will now follow its own process to obtain marketing authorizations to launch in their country. We have already launched generic version of Copaxone 20-milligram in certain European markets. 
From the future pipeline investments point of view, we'll continue to focus on the development and manufacturing of complex products while we diligently invest in our colds businesses, including ARVs, injectables, topicals and oral solid dosage forms. This is especially the case with our injectable portfolio as we are seeing more approvals come through for these products. 
As you recall, we acquired Agila with the goal of becoming a reliable, global source of high-quality injectables for patients. With the period of enhancements to the acquired facilities behind us, this goal is now a reality. This year alone, we received more than 20 approvals of injectables in U.S. and more than 70 products are in our pipeline or pending approval. Complex and hard-to-make products especially require substantial R&D resources and investments, a strong regulatory and intellectual property expertise, along with an ability to invest significant capital to manufacture and commercialize these products. We believe Mylan is well positioned in all of these areas to execute on our other pipeline opportunities. 
Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs. Starting with our biosimilar programs. The regulatory environment continues to be active over the last few months. While we believe additional changes are still needed to enable the U.S. biosimilar market, we are encouraged by the commitments expressed by Commissioner Gottlieb and steps being taken by U.S. FDA in facilitating the views as well as their recent initiation of their efforts to educate physicians on the benefits and the cost savings of biosimilars. 
We are also very pleased at the steps we saw last week on the [ CMS ] for Medicare. Regarding our Biocon partnership, we continue to see progress with the submission and regulatory process. With our pegfilgrastim application in the U.S.A., you will recall that FDA issued a CRL relating to certain CMC data from drug product facility inspection. It is important to highlight the fact that the CRL did not raise any questions on biosimilarity, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic data, clinical data or immunogenicity. We remain very confident that we will be able to respond to the CRL in the next few weeks. 
On the GMP side, Mylan and Biocon have been in close collaboration with FDA, and we have a clear path towards it -- clear path forward to resolve issues identified in the inspection. For trastuzumab in the U.S.A., we continue to work with the FDA to resolve all outstanding issues, and we are hopeful to get this very important product approved very soon. Our BsUFA goal date for this product is December 3, 2017. 
With respect to our pegfilgrastim and trastuzumab application in Europe, Mylan, along with our partner, Biocon, has completed the corrective actions for the inspection of durations and continue to make good progress toward a reinspection of the Bangalore site. We are also making progress on the Marketing Authorization Applications. As for the administrative protocol, we have resubmitted both applications to EMA to restart the review. We'll keep you posted on the progress on these programs as we go along. 
I also note that for pegfilgrastim, we have also completed our regulatory submission for Canada, Australia and South Africa. And for trastuzumab, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 32 additional countries. And we have already received approvals in another 19 countries.
With respect to Insulin Glargine, in the U.S., we submitted our 505(b)(2) application, which is under active review with the FDA. You have seen that we have been sued by Sanofi, which triggered a 30-month stay on our approval. This 505(b)(2) application includes vials and disposable pens with cartridges. For our part, we'll continue to work on this submission with FDA to bring an interchangeable alternative Glargine to the patients as soon as possible. 
For Europe, the insulin manufacturing facility in Malaysia has been given GMP clearance by EMA, and we continue to have an ongoing and productive interactions with EMA on our application. In addition to the submission in U.S. and Europe, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 41 additional countries. We have already received approval in 6 other countries.
Moving to our Momenta partnership. Our biosimilar of ORENCIA received initial top line results from its Phase I study last week, and unfortunately, it did not meet primary PK endpoints. We are disappointed by these results, and we'll work closely with Momenta to fully analyze the data and determine next steps. Additionally, with respect to our next biosimilar candidate in this partnership, M710, we continue to plan for it to enter clinics in 2018. 
On the respiratory front, you will recall that we have confirmed with FDA that no further clinical or device-related studies are required for our generic Advair program. We have responded to the CRL and continue to work with FDA for this very important product. Also, we are encouraged that FDA is treating this complex product as a high priority. We remain ready from a manufacturing and commercial perspective and are optimistic to bring this very important product to patients as soon as possible.
Our revefenacin collaboration with Theravance Biopharma continues to make progress. And just last week, we announced a presentation to the additional positive efficacy data from the 3-month pivotal Phase III study at 2017 CHEST annual meeting. We are expecting to file this NDA for a novel nebulized LAMA treatment for COPD very shortly. 
If you recall, we announced previously that we have entered into a partnership with 3M for the development of generic version of Symbicort for the U.S. market. We are excited about the progress we are making in the development of this product and are confident that we are on track towards a 2018 ANDA 505(j) submission. Pivotal PK studies are now complete with (b) demonstrated for both low- and high-strength products. 
Regarding our generic form of prosthesis, we have made good progress on our application. And we believe that we have a product that adheres to the FDA's latest new guidance. Our bridging goal date is December 31 of this year. With this District Court verdict behind us, we look forward to bring this very important product to patients soon. 
In summary, I remain confident that we are poised for future growth with this incredibly unique and durable platform. And I'm excited about the progress we are making within our pipeline, our continued commercial diversification breaking across different channels and geographies and our ability to mean more to our customers around the globe. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tony."

As Heather and Rajiv commented, the strong global diversified business we have built over the past decade gives us more confidence than ever about our future and our ability to be a key supplier to customers and patients around the world. Our unique commercial platform is fit to withstand change in our industry and continues to distinguish Mylan as a partner of choice during a time of further customer consolidation and globalization. 
One of the most important drivers behind our confidence is the daily effort made by our commercial team of nearly 7,000 people around the world. Without them, our products wouldn't reach the patients and providers who need them most. We are beginning to reap the rewards of the long-term and significant investments in science and innovation that Rajiv outlined in his remarks with the much anticipated U.S. launch of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as the generic version of the Copaxone 20-milligram. We are particularly pleased with our prescription uptake to date for the 40-milligram strength. 
For the week ending October 27, our share of new prescriptions was 16.2%, and total prescriptions was approximately 8%. We also are encouraged by the number of patients who are utilizing our comprehensive support services through our MS Advocate program. Some of these services include in-home injection trainings with an experienced MS nurse, educational resources and a 24/7 patient support center. We view this launch as a critical opportunity to provide an affordable alternative for patients and payers while still optimizing conversion and delivering value for Mylan. We look forward to successfully commercializing both strengths of this product in other key markets around the world as we receive appropriate regulatory approvals. 
In addition to generic Copaxone in the U.S., we are pleased with the strong performance of some of our global key brands around the world such as Dymista, Dona, Betadine and Elavil. These important products, which were acquired through our Meda transaction, experienced significant growth this quarter and continue to exceed our original expectations. We expect this growth to continue as we leverage our strong commercial infrastructure in key markets like Italy, France, Germany and the emerging and expansion markets.
I'd now like to provide an overview of our regional performances beginning with North America. As anticipated and outlined last quarter, this segment declined about 22% to just under $1.2 billion. Sales of EpiPen declined by $245 million this quarter as the overall market contracted when compared to the robust growth from the same quarter the prior year as well as experiencing additional competition. 
Excluding EpiPen, North America declined 6% as anticipated and as outlined last quarter, primarily due to the impact of significant first-to-market products losing exclusivity over the prior year as well as increased competition. We are still estimating annualized price erosion in the high single digits for the region for 2017.
Despite these challenges, we continue to see momentum and be excited about the future for this region. We've been pleased with the launches of several limited competition products this quarter. Most notably, the launch of Imatinib tablets further strengthen our robust U.S. oncology portfolio, which now contains more than 40 products. This is a very important therapeutic area for Mylan globally, which would be bolstered even further in the coming years with the introduction of several biosimilars to treat cancer. That said, I am pleased to report that the geographic diversity of our platform, which we have been building over the last 10 years, also has been balancing pressure in North America. 
In Europe, sales totaled more than $1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24%. These strong results were due to incremental sales from our Meda acquisition and favorable pricing and volume trends in the region. This includes mid-single-digit organic growth in the region, specifically in some of our largest markets such as France, Italy, Germany, U.K. and the Nordics. 
We also continue to be excited about the stability and performance of our strong brands in the region such as Creon and Influvac as well as new growth from brands like Betadine and Dymista. This quarter's growth from our acquired assets reinforces our confidence that building scale in Europe under our One Mylan approach has us well positioned within the region. 
In our Rest of World segment, sales totaled $740 million, a year-over-year increase of 9% driven primarily by our new Meda assets and strong performance in emerging markets. We are also seeing strong performance from some of our key brands in this region. Amitiza, for instance, delivered robust growth of more than 20% for the quarter in Japan. And we will continue to seek ways to optimize our assets and partnerships in this market. Overall, for the third quarter, we saw as expected global generic price deflation in the mid-single digits, and we continue to anticipate this for the full year 2017. 
In summary, we believe our unique product mix of generics, brands and over-the-counter medications across a range of therapeutic categories and sold in multiple sales channels, combined with an expansive geographic reach and strong commercial platform, position Mylan better than any other company in the industry to serve our customers and deliver better health for patients. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."

Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues in the quarter declined slightly year-over-year to approximately $3 billion. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through our top line result",1074,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues in the quarter declined slightly year-over-year to approximately $3 billion. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through our top line results for Mylan in total and our segments. I'll now take you through the rest of our financial performance, which was in line with our expectations.
In the third quarter, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to approximately 57% in the same period last year. The decline is the result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, primarily EpiPen, partially mitigated by new product introductions and contributions from last year's acquisitions.
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D was approximately 6% of total revenues, which was in line with our expectations and down slightly from the prior year period due to the timing of clinical activities related primarily to our respiratory programs. 
SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, declined 3% to $586 million or approximately 20% of total revenues and also in line with our expectations. In the quarter, the benefits from our ongoing Mylan integration activities more than offset the incremental SG&A from our Meda acquisition. Our adjusted tax rate was 17.5% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 18%. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. 
Moving on to segment profitability. As a result of the declines in third party sales, including EpiPen, segment profitability in North America declined 27% in the quarter to $576 million. Partially offsetting this decline, segment profitability expanded in the Europe and Rest of World segments, reflecting contributions from the Meda acquisition as well as new product sales. When compared to the prior year period, Europe segment profitability was up 15%, and Rest of World segment profitability was up 16%. Adjusted net earnings in the quarter declined to $590 million, and adjusted diluted EPS declined 20% to $1.10. 
Briefly turning to our results for the 9 months ended September 30. Total revenues increased to approximately $8.7 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of 11%. Acquisitions contributed approximately $1.4 billion in net sales during the 9-month period, and adjusted earnings for the 9 months ended September 30 decreased by $26 million to $1.7 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS decreased 5% to $3.13.
Now turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.1 billion for the 9 months ended September 30 compared to approximately $1.9 billion in the prior year period. Capital expenditures totaled $156 million compared to approximately $240 million in the prior year.
As we said previously, we're fully committed to continuing to deleverage and have demonstrated that by paying down our debt by approximately $1.2 billion in the first 9 months of the year, which includes approximately $420 million in the third quarter. As a result of our continued strong cash flow generation, for the full year, we expect to deliver on our initial cash flow guidance of between $2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow net of our revised capital expenditures range of $300 million to $350 million. 
Our ability to generate strong cash flows reflects the strength and durability of our portfolio, resulting from the decade-long transformation of our business into a global diversified player and is supported by the power of our balance sheet, which provides us with the financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business. 
At the end of Q3 2017, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio as calculated under our credit agreement was 3.6x and was in compliance with our covenant requirements. You may recall that following the Meda acquisition, we elected to increase the leverage ratio covenant as permitted under our credit agreement to 4.25x through the second quarter of 2017. 
Just last week, on November 3, we entered into amendments to the agreements for the 2016 term loans and 2016 revolving facility to extend the leverage ratio covenant of 4.25x through the December 31, 2018, reporting period. These amendments provide us with the additional financial flexibility as we manage our capital structure during 2018. This does not change in any way our commitment to our deleveraging strategy or maintaining our investment-grade credit rating as we continue to work towards our long-term average debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3.0x.
Moving on to the revised guidance. Primarily due to the approval and subsequent launch of generic Copaxone in the U.S. market, we've increased the low end of both our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS 2017 guidance ranges. Our revised total revenue guidance range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full year 2016.
Our new adjusted EPS guidance range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share. That's a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. This year-over-year decline reflects the ongoing North America generic business dynamics as well as the more than $500 million impact from the rebasing of our EpiPen brand. 
Moving to 2018. As Heather mentioned, we're continuing to target at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS, which is an increase of more than 18% from the midpoint of our new guidance range for 2017. This target factors in the launch of generic Copaxone as well as the deferred launches of complex products from 2017, including generic Advair. It also includes incremental savings from integration activities and cost actions, continued growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments as well as the continuation of a challenging North American environment. We'll provide further details of our 2018 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Before I turn it over to Q&A, I urge all of you to take a closer look at the Built to Last presentation that Heather spoke about earlier and which is posted on our website this morning. We're very proud of the business that we've built over the last decade, and this presentation highlights our transformational journey as well as the path we plan to take to fully realize the value transformation and our differentiated portfolio. We believe that our differentiated business model, our performance and our stable, durable cash flow generation are not yet reflected in our stock price valuation.
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

I think all the weaknesses you just laid out are all primarily U.S.-driven. And as we continue to show, both from our European as well as our Rest of World segment, our ability to continue to grow at double digit in the case of Europe and high single-digit in Rest of World, that as we continue to leverage our assets, our products in these areas and continue to bring complex generics as we'll be launching Copaxone throughout Europe, I think those are very important to telling the story of how we're continuing to be able to absorb the volatility in this U.S. Generics market and which is why I made the commentary that -- just to remind everyone that we moved out of the neighborhood of just U.S. Generics and Specialty and into this global community that's helping us absorb that. And the Mylan that we've built today is able to continue to deliver and on our growth profile as we continue to bring these products to market. As far as the U.S. Generics, we continue to see those headwinds are going to continue for the foreseeable future. But I think again, the dynamics of our portfolio of the products we're launching, Rajiv spoke of the multiple injectable products we've launched and the [ 70 ] that are in our pipeline. So the durability again of what we are launching from complex to injectables as well as continuing to deliver on our outside of the U.S. platform is what's able to give us the confidence to say that at least [5 40 ] next year given all those things you just mentioned, taking into consideration. So what I would say is just again the message of the durability of our platform and our ability to absorb the volatility, which we believe really distinguishes us from our peers."

So I can assure you that the financial flexibility that we still have today and are maintaining because of our -- the generation of our cash flows that we're going to continue to be balanced as far as yes, paying down debt and staying committed to investment-grade but also have the flexibility to be able to bring the right products or dosage forms into our mix, both whether it's U.S., Europe or Rest of World. And I think you're going to continue to see us execute on that. And the last thing I'd say because I think your point about the decimation of the industry. I think one thing I would just ask, and I've said this before, but I think it's continuing to play out is the continuity of our management team and the tenure of it. We've been together a decade as we've continued to not only manage at the peaks but in the valleys. And I think that's where you see a management team that has had a strategy out there. We've executed to it. We've continued to navigate the waters, I think, better than anybody else out there. So hopefully, that differentiation is what continues to put investors at ease with not only the credibility we've now hopefully amassed on a scientific side, but also just being able to continue to maximize this global platform and absorb what the industry is going through here in the U.S."

And the banking group supports us, and that's why we have continued to delever but have asked for that extension at 4.25.

Because I think that what you'll find in the presentation that we provided, Built to Last, is that when you look at Mylan and the portfolio we have in each of these segments and you look at peers within, especially Europe and Rest of World and some of the valuations that are happening around their businesses where we have as good if not better businesses within those geographical regions, I think that's where a multiple expansion is certainly warranted when you now put our whole global product mix together. And I don't believe that's rooted or grounded in governance. I think that as we continue to have shareholder meetings and certainly stay open-minded and have these discussions, again what I can say is we look at companies out there around the globe with a whole host of governance issues from family-owned to a whole wide array of how they're on the public markets. We really believe it's the fundamentals that should drive that valuation. And we believe that the shareholder outreach program is going to go a long way to help rebase and have honestly us get credit of the company we've built over the last decade and believe that we've got a real strong lead ahead of anybody else out there and have a real opportunity to really be the bellwether of this industry."

Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Commercial Officer, Tony Mauro; and Chief Financial Officer, Ken Parks.

Before we get started, I'd like to send a special message to our employees in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and thank them for their perseverance following the devastating h",1383,"Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Before we get started, I'd like to send a special message to our employees in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and thank them for their perseverance following the devastating hurricanes that struck there during the quarter. 
We're extremely grateful that all of them are safely accounted for and are proud of how we all came together to support one another and people in surrounding communities in the storm's aftermath. So we recognize that the journey to rebuild will be a long one, especially in Puerto Rico, which was affected most severely. We're glad to report that our plant there is operational, and we have not experienced any shortages of the drugs we manufacture at the facility. 
Turning now to our business. I'm personally very grateful to say that after years of hopeful anticipation, it finally happened. Early last month, we received FDA approval of our Glatiramer Acetate product for both the 20- and 40-milligram strengths and immediately launched them into the U.S. marketplace. Being first to market with the 40-milligram strength as well as offering the 20 is a milestone in many regards. 
First and foremost, it underscores our scientific and regulatory capabilities to develop, secure approval of, manufacture and bring to market an extremely complex product despite an arduous multiyear process. Second, and equally as important, is our ability to continue to deliver on our mission of providing access to more affordable products to patients, and that's where our new Mylan MS Advocate program comes in. It's designed to help patients get started and stay on track with their physician's treatment plan for either dosage strength. It should be noted that this program also paves the way for the many other products in our pipeline that have special commercialization needs. 
Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention how proud we are of all of our employees here at Mylan. Our success in launching this very important product, one of the largest generic launches in recent history, which could not have come at a better time, only stands as a reminder of why we get up every day and what we fight and stand for. This single launch alone could have the effect of saving billions of dollars cumulatively for MS patients, taxpayers and the overall health care system. 
This launch should also serve as an important reminder to all stakeholders in the health care system about the importance of our industry and the role that we play, especially as our industry continues to come under attack by those whom we believe may not fully understand or appreciate how our industry works and all that's involved in bringing very important products like this to market. Because of this, we applaud our industry's trade group, the Association for Affordable Medicine, for their hard work in helping educate all stakeholders interested in our health care system. 
With that said and while the U.S. health care system rebases itself, there are some fundamentals that will not change. The demand for high-quality generics will not be going away. Generics already fill 90% of all prescriptions dispensed within the U.S. as well as a growing proportion of scripts filled around the world. Meeting this global demand is exactly what we envision and have executed on over the last decade. This is exactly why we moved out of the U.S. Generics and Specialty neighborhood and into a much larger and more resilient path in the global community. We've built our global platform to absorb and withstand geographic volatility, and it's through our product and channel diversification that Mylan has truly transformed itself from a single market, high-risk, first-to-file company into a resilient global business with strong durable cash flows. 
To put a number to it, we now believe that approximately 75% of our more than $2 billion adjusted operating cash flows stem from predictable, recurring revenues across all markets around the world, leaving a 25% basket of smaller, less predictable products, primarily in the U.S. Generics market. This model provides Mylan with a unique opportunity to meet the demands of individual markets around the world much more reliably, and as a result, it positions us very differently from our peers. 
We believe there is a real disconnect between our current valuation and the global business we've built. I believe our depressed share price is reflective of investor sentiment regarding a U.S.-only marketplace, which, therefore, provides us an opportunity to educate and expand shareholders' knowledge base and therefore, our multiple. 
I am personally committed to helping shareholders fully understand our transformation and who Mylan is today, so that we can reach our intended goal of fully realizing Mylan's value through total shareholder return accretion. As a part of that commitment, we will be embarking on an investor outreach program that will lay out how we intend to address this disconnect. 
Specifically, we intend to effectively deploy capital for future growth while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue investing on our existing pipeline and additional opportunities to further enhance our pipeline. We will continue to look for and execute on opportunistic bolt-on transactions to add to our existing platform. And finally, we will do all of this while continuing to grow the top and bottom line. 
Above all, the key message we'll be delivering is that we have built Mylan to last, and that what makes us different is what makes us durable. As a result, we now have a substantial number of opportunities that are unique to Mylan's growth profile. 
Having begun our transformation a decade ago, we have a huge start. And going forward, you can be absolutely sure we'll be executing to the best of our ability to use our strengths to matter even more to our customers, patients and health care systems around the world and therefore, continue delivering growth and value to our shareholders. 
You can find our presentation called Built to Last in the Investor Relations section of our website at mylan.com. When you arrive at this site, you will also see an invitation to learn more about Mylan's story and our global impact by providing access to medicine, innovation and science and public health policy. It's part of the campaign we recently launched called Better Health for a Better World, and through it, we intend to better tell our story to a much broader audience. 
Turning to the third quarter. Our results, which included adjusted EPS of $1.10, were especially strong considering the ongoing challenges we experienced in the U.S., including accelerated deceleration of EpiPen sales, both from our launch of an authorized generic as well as the contraction of the overall epinephrine auto-injector market. 
Substantially moderating those challenges were our Rest of World and European segments, which together accounted for 60% of our third party net sales during the quarter. Both segments showed continued strength, with our business in Europe again posting double-digit growth, a great example of the ability of our highly diversified global platform to absorb our industry's inevitable headwinds wherever they occur. 
As for the fourth quarter, given our GA launch and the stability of our platform, we see a strong finish ahead. We are, thus, increasing the low end of our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. 
Our new 2017 revenue range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full year 2016. Our new 2017 adjusted EPS range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share, a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. 
What's more, we believe the momentum and growth we see ahead is sustainable, which is why we remain confident in our 2018 target of at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS. We look forward to bringing you detailed guidance for 2018 during our 4Q call. 
We're once again continuing to deliver and differentiate Mylan in a rapidly changing industry. And for our third quarter performance, I'd like on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution and for their commitment to delivering better health for a better world. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

Before I begin, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and unwavering focus on our mission, especially those who were affected recently by natural disasters. We are very pro",2055,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and unwavering focus on our mission, especially those who were affected recently by natural disasters. We are very proud of our employees who, despite personally going through this ordeal, were able to ensure that there was no significant disruption and drug shortages from our facilities.
Let me briefly turn to our third quarter results. I will provide an overview of our top line performance, and Ken will cover segment profitability. Overall, we delivered nearly $3 billion in total revenues for the quarter, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year. We saw strong performance in our Europe and Rest of the World regions, which again represent more than half of our revenue. This helped to partially mitigate the expected decline in North America. 
All regions benefited from contributions from our acquisition of Meda businesses, which continue to perform well and meet our expectations. Mylan's integration is going strong, and we are excited to see that integrated platform come to life with no business disruption while we brought various assets from Meda and Renaissance together. Now we are continuing to optimize the assets we have acquired and identify additional cost-saving as well as revenue opportunities beyond what we have previously stated and are expected to generate additional annual saving of more than $200 million.
In North America, our robust portfolio, rich pipeline, commercial infrastructure and our long-standing relationships we have fostered with our customers give us the unique ability to face the turbulence of this market. We expect to see sustainable cash flows from our hard-to-make, complex product portfolio, which generally have a high regulatory hurdle to climb and oftentimes, require clinical trials and thus, give relatively better visibility of emerging new competition. 
Also, such complex products usually provide more predictable and durable cash flows. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from North America. We also anticipate that our growing portfolio of injectables, OTC as well as Topicals Business will also further contribute to our stability and future growth in this market. I will also note that EpiPen, the one big reason for decline this year, is projected to be less than 3% of total revenue and is not a meaningful contributor as we go into 2018. 
A strong and sustainable performance in Europe is being delivered from our well-executed integrated platform of Mylan's legacy Abbott EPD and Meda businesses. Our European business is no longer primarily generic but has approximately 2/3 of revenue coming from our Rx and OTC channels. 
Our portfolio of key brands like Creon, Influvac, Dymista, Dona, Betadine, Saugella and EpiPen belongs to a class of hard-to-make, complex products and provide us predictable and durable cash flows. These brands have a great brand equity in these markets and also given the nature of these markets, do not get genericized overnight. About 40% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from Europe. We will be further focusing on our global key brand portfolio, and we'll continue to make sustainable efforts to further grow and expand these across other countries. 
Also, we're excited by the growth opportunities we see to further strengthen our business in our key markets like France, Italy, Germany, Poland, U.K. and Nordics, where we are now in position to add many more exciting products from our pipeline like biosimilars and through a cross-pollination of our vast portfolio as we go along. 
Our Rest of the World business currently represents approximately 60% of revenues from generics, with the rest from Rx and OTC. This business not only is a significant source of durable cash flows but will be a significant contributor for sustained growth in the future. We are focusing on expansion of our strong global portfolio into various markets, which came along with Meda acquisition like China, Russia, Turkey, Mexico as well as Brazil. 
Our Australia and Japanese businesses will continue to show a sustained performance. Also, we'll continue to build on our successful track record of our ARV performance and explore -- and expand this further globally beyond emerging markets of sub-Saharan Africa. 
For example, we recently announced a 3-year volume-based contract with a consortium constituting UNAIDS, CHAI, Gates Foundation, PEPFAR and Global Fund to provide the new [indiscernible] for more than 90 countries. This is a significant step to accelerate treatment rollout as part of global efforts to reach all 36.7 million people living with HIV. This initiative will give this otherwise relatively volatile business more predictability, stability and growth over a period of time. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from the Rest of the World. 
Before I review our key pipeline programs, let me start by saying that we are very pleased to have received FDA approval of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as another much needed alternative to the Copaxone 20-milligram. 
We have always believed in our science, regulatory and intellectual property capabilities, and we are excited to bring this affordable and substitutable product ultimately to the patients who are dealing with this very difficult disease. This approval is a perfect example of how Mylan's mission of providing high-quality medicines to those who need them is consistent with FDA's focus on access to complex Generics. 
We also are excited about the opportunity to launch the generic version of Copaxone 40-milligram with our partner, Synthon, in certain key European countries as we receive EMA approval in October. Each country will now follow its own process to obtain marketing authorizations to launch in their country. We have already launched generic version of Copaxone 20-milligram in certain European markets. 
From the future pipeline investments point of view, we'll continue to focus on the development and manufacturing of complex products while we diligently invest in our colds businesses, including ARVs, injectables, topicals and oral solid dosage forms. This is especially the case with our injectable portfolio as we are seeing more approvals come through for these products. 
As you recall, we acquired Agila with the goal of becoming a reliable, global source of high-quality injectables for patients. With the period of enhancements to the acquired facilities behind us, this goal is now a reality. This year alone, we received more than 20 approvals of injectables in U.S. and more than 70 products are in our pipeline or pending approval. Complex and hard-to-make products especially require substantial R&D resources and investments, a strong regulatory and intellectual property expertise, along with an ability to invest significant capital to manufacture and commercialize these products. We believe Mylan is well positioned in all of these areas to execute on our other pipeline opportunities. 
Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs. Starting with our biosimilar programs. The regulatory environment continues to be active over the last few months. While we believe additional changes are still needed to enable the U.S. biosimilar market, we are encouraged by the commitments expressed by Commissioner Gottlieb and steps being taken by U.S. FDA in facilitating the views as well as their recent initiation of their efforts to educate physicians on the benefits and the cost savings of biosimilars. 
We are also very pleased at the steps we saw last week on the [ CMS ] for the Medicare. Regarding our Biocon partnership, we continue to see progress with the submission and regulatory process. With our pegfilgrastim application in the U.S.A., you will recall that FDA issued a CRL relating to certain CMC data from drug product facility inspection. It is important to highlight the fact that the CRL did not raise any questions on biosimilarity, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic data, clinical data or immunogenicity. We remain very confident that we will be able to respond to the CRL in the next few weeks. 
On the GMP side, Mylan and Biocon have been in close collaboration with FDA, and we have a clear path towards it -- clear path forward to resolve issues identified in the inspection. For trastuzumab in the U.S.A., we continue to work with the FDA to resolve all outstanding issues, and we are hopeful to get this very important product approved very soon. Our BsUFA goal date for this product is December 3, 2017. 
With respect to our pegfilgrastim and trastuzumab application in Europe, Mylan, along with our partner, Biocon, has completed the corrective actions for the inspection of durations and continue to make good progress toward a reinspection of the Bangalore site. We are also making progress on the Marketing Authorization Applications. As for the administrative protocol, we have resubmitted both applications to EMA to restart the review. We'll keep you posted on the progress on these programs as we go along. 
I also note that for pegfilgrastim, we have also completed our regulatory submission for Canada, Australia and South Africa. And for trastuzumab, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 32 additional countries. And we have already received approvals in another 19 countries.
With respect to Insulin Glargine, in the U.S., we submitted our 505(b)(2) application, which is under active review with the FDA. You have seen that we have been sued by Sanofi, which triggered a 30-month stay on our approval. This 505(b)(2) application includes vials and disposable pens with cartridges. For our part, we'll continue to work on this submission with FDA to bring an interchangeable alternative Glargine to the patients as soon as possible. 
For Europe, the insulin manufacturing facility in Malaysia has been given GMP clearance by EMA, and we continue to have an ongoing and productive interaction with EMA on our application. In addition to the submission in U.S. and Europe, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 41 additional countries. We have already received approval in 6 other countries.
Moving to our Momenta partnership. Our biosimilar of ORENCIA received initial top line results from its Phase I study last week, and unfortunately, it did not meet primary PK endpoints. We are disappointed by these results, and we'll work closely with Momenta to fully analyze the data and determine next steps. Additionally, with respect to our next biosimilar candidate in this partnership, M710, we continue to plan for it to enter clinics in 2018. 
On the respiratory front, you will recall that we have confirmed with FDA that no further clinical or device-related studies are required for our generic Advair program. We have responded to the CRL and continue to work with FDA for this very important product. Also, we are encouraged that FDA is treating this complex product as a high priority. We remain ready from a manufacturing and commercial perspective and are optimistic to bring this very important product to patients as soon as possible.
Our revefenacin collaboration with Theravance Biopharma continues to make progress. And just last week, we announced a presentation to the additional positive efficacy data from the 3-month pivotal Phase III study at 2017 CHEST annual meeting. We are expecting to file this NDA for a novel nebulized LAMA treatment for COPD very shortly. 
If you recall, we announced previously that we have entered into a partnership with 3M for the development of generic version of Symbicort for the U.S. market. We are excited about the progress we are making in the development of this product and are confident that we are on track towards a 2018 ANDA 505(j) submission. Pivotal PK studies are now complete with (b) demonstrated for both low- and high-strength products. 
Regarding our generic form of prosthesis, we have made good progress on our application. And we believe that we have a product that adheres to the FDA's latest new guidance. Our bridging goal date is December 31 of this year. With this District Court verdict behind us, we look forward to bring this very important product to patients soon. 
In summary, I remain confident that we are poised for future growth with this incredibly unique and durable platform. And I'm excited about the progress we are making within our pipeline, our continued commercial diversification breaking across different channels and geographies and our ability to mean more to our customers around the globe. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tony."

As Heather and Rajiv commented, the strong global diversified business we have built over the past decade gives us more confidence than ever about our future and our ability to be a key supplier to customers and patients around the world. Our unique commercial platform is fit to withstand change in our industry and continues to distinguish Mylan as a partner of choice during a time of further customer consolidation and globalization. 
One of the most important drivers behind our confidence is the daily effort made by our commercial team of nearly 7,000 people around the world. Without them, our products wouldn't reach the patients and providers who need them most. We are beginning to reap the rewards of the long-term and significant investments in science and innovation that Rajiv outlined in his remarks with the much anticipated U.S. launch of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as the generic version of the Copaxone 20-milligram. We are particularly pleased with our prescription uptake to date for the 40-milligram strength. 
For the week ending October 27, our share of new prescriptions was 16.2%, and total prescriptions was approximately 8%. We also are encouraged by the number of patients who are utilizing our comprehensive support services through our MS Advocate program. Some of these services include in-home injection trainings with an experienced MS nurse, educational resources and a 24/7 patient support center. We view this launch as a critical opportunity to provide an affordable alternative for patients and payers while still optimizing conversion and delivering value for Mylan. We look forward to successfully commercializing both strengths of this product in other key markets around the world as we receive appropriate regulatory approvals. 
In addition to generic Copaxone in the U.S., we are pleased with the strong performance of some of our global key brands around the world such as Dymista, Dona, Betadine and Elavil. These important products, which were acquired through our Meda transaction, experienced significant growth this quarter and continue to exceed our original expectations. We expect this growth to continue as we leverage our strong commercial infrastructure in key markets like Italy, France, Germany and the emerging and expansion markets.
I'd now like to provide an overview of our regional performances beginning with North America. As anticipated and outlined last quarter, this segment declined about 22% to just under $1.2 billion. Sales of EpiPen declined by $245 million this quarter as the overall market contracted when compared to the robust growth from the same quarter the prior year as well as experiencing additional competition. 
Excluding EpiPen, North America declined 6% as anticipated and as outlined last quarter, primarily due to the impact of significant first-to-market products losing exclusivity over the prior year as well as increased competition. We are still estimating annualized price erosion in the high single digits for the region for 2017.
Despite these challenges, we continue to see momentum and be excited about the future for this region. We've been pleased with the launches of several limited competition products this quarter. Most notably, the launch of Imatinib tablets further strengthen our robust U.S. oncology portfolio, which now contains more than 40 products. This is a very important therapeutic area for Mylan globally, which would be bolstered even further in the coming years with the introduction of several biosimilars to treat cancer. That said, I am pleased to report that the geographic diversity of our platform, which we have been building over the last 10 years, also has been balancing pressure in North America. 
In Europe, sales totaled more than $1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24%. These strong results were due to incremental sales from our Meda acquisition and favorable pricing and volume trends in the region. This includes mid-single-digit organic growth in the region, specifically in some of our largest markets such as France, Italy, Germany, U.K. and the Nordics. 
We also continue to be excited about the stability and performance of our strong brands in the region such as Creon and Influvac as well as new growth from brands like Betadine and Dymista. This quarter's growth from our acquired assets reinforces our confidence that building scale in Europe under our One Mylan approach has us well positioned within the region. 
In our Rest of World segment, sales totaled $740 million, a year-over-year increase of 9% driven primarily by our new Meda assets and strong performance in emerging markets. We are also seeing strong performance from some of our key brands in this region. Amitiza, for instance, delivered robust growth of more than 20% for the quarter in Japan. And we will continue to seek ways to optimize our assets and partnerships in this market. Overall, for the third quarter, we saw as expected global generic price deflation in the mid-single digits, and we continue to anticipate this for the full year 2017. 
In summary, we believe our unique product mix of generics, brands and over-the-counter medications across a range of therapeutic categories and sold in multiple sales channels, combined with an expansive geographic reach and strong commercial platform, position Mylan better than any other company in the industry to serve our customers and deliver better health for patients. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."
290203,540834470,1334007,"Mylan N.V., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2017",2017-11-06,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues in the quarter declined slightly year-over-year to approximately $3 billion. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through our top line result",1074,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues in the quarter declined slightly year-over-year to approximately $3 billion. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through our top line results for Mylan in total and our segments. I'll now take you through the rest of our financial performance, which was in line with our expectations.
In the third quarter, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to approximately 57% in the same period last year. The decline is the result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, primarily EpiPen, partially mitigated by new product introductions and contributions from last year's acquisitions.
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D was approximately 6% of total revenues, which was in line with our expectations and down slightly from the prior year period due to the timing of clinical activities related primarily to our respiratory programs. 
SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, declined 3% to $586 million or approximately 20% of total revenues and also in line with our expectations. In the quarter, the benefits from our ongoing Mylan integration activities more than offset the incremental SG&A from our Meda acquisition. Our adjusted tax rate was 17.5% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 18%. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. 
Moving on to segment profitability. As a result of the declines in third party sales, including EpiPen, segment profitability in North America declined 27% in the quarter to $576 million. Partially offsetting this decline, segment profitability expanded in the Europe and Rest of World segments, reflecting contributions from the Meda acquisition as well as new product sales. When compared to the prior year period, Europe segment profitability was up 15%, and Rest of World segment profitability was up 16%. Adjusted net earnings in the quarter declined to $590 million, and adjusted diluted EPS declined 20% to $1.10. 
Briefly turning to our results for the 9 months ended September 30. Total revenues increased to approximately $8.7 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of 11%. Acquisitions contributed approximately $1.4 billion in net sales during the 9-month period, and adjusted earnings for the 9 months ended September 30 decreased by $26 million to $1.7 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS decreased 5% to $3.13.
Now turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.1 billion for the 9 months ended September 30 compared to approximately $1.9 billion in the prior year period. Capital expenditures totaled $156 million compared to approximately $240 million in the prior year.
As we said previously, we're fully committed to continuing to deleverage and have demonstrated that by paying down our debt by approximately $1.2 billion in the first 9 months of the year, which includes approximately $420 million in the third quarter. As a result of our continued strong cash flow generation, for the full year, we expect to deliver on our initial cash flow guidance of between $2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow net of our revised capital expenditures range of $300 million to $350 million. 
Our ability to generate strong cash flows reflects the strength and durability of our portfolio, resulting from the decade-long transformation of our business into a global diversified player and is supported by the power of our balance sheet, which provides us with the financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business. 
At the end of Q3 2017, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio as calculated under our credit agreement was 3.6x and was in compliance with our covenant requirements. You may recall that following the Meda acquisition, we elected to increase the leverage ratio covenant as permitted under our credit agreement to 4.25x through the second quarter of 2017. 
Just last week, on November 3, we entered into amendments to the agreements for the 2016 term loans and 2016 revolving facility to extend the leverage ratio covenant of 4.25x through the December 31, 2018, reporting period. These amendments provide us with the additional financial flexibility as we manage our capital structure during 2018. This does not change in any way our commitment to our deleveraging strategy or maintaining our investment-grade credit rating as we continue to work towards our long-term average debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3.0x.
Moving on to the revised guidance. Primarily due to the approval and subsequent launch of generic Copaxone in the U.S. market, we've increased the low end of both our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS 2017 guidance ranges. Our revised total revenue guidance range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full year 2016.
Our new adjusted EPS guidance range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share. That's a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. This year-over-year decline reflects the ongoing North America generic business dynamics as well as the more than $500 million impact from the rebasing of our EpiPen brand. 
Moving to 2018. As Heather mentioned, we're continuing to target at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS, which is an increase of more than 18% from the midpoint of our new guidance range for 2017. This target factors in the launch of generic Copaxone as well as the deferred launches of complex products from 2017, including generic Advair. It also includes incremental savings from integration activities and cost actions, continued growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments as well as the continuation of a challenging North American environment. We'll provide further details of our 2018 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Before I turn it over to Q&A, I urge all of you to take a closer look at the Built to Last presentation that Heather spoke about earlier and which is posted on our website this morning. We're very proud of the business that we've built over the last decade, and this presentation highlights our transformational journey as well as the path we plan to take to fully realize the value transformation and our differentiated portfolio. We believe that our differentiated business model, our performance and our stable, durable cash flow generation are not yet reflected in our stock price valuation.
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

I think all the weaknesses you just laid out are all primarily U.S.-driven. And as we continue to show, both from our European as well as our Rest of World segment, our ability to continue to grow at double digit in the case of Europe and high single-digit in Rest of World, that as we continue to leverage our assets, our products in these areas and continue to bring complex generics as we'll be launching Copaxone throughout Europe, I think those are very important to telling the story of how we're continuing to be able to absorb the volatility in this U.S. Generics market and which is why I made the commentary that -- just to remind everyone that we moved out of the neighborhood of just U.S. Generics and Specialty and into this global community that's helping us absorb that. And the Mylan that we've built today is able to continue to deliver and on our growth profile as we continue to bring these products to market. As far as the U.S. Generics, we continue to see those headwinds are going to continue for the foreseeable future. But I think again, the dynamics of our portfolio of the products we're launching, Rajiv spoke of the multiple injectable products we've launched and the [ 70 ] that are in our pipeline. So the durability again of what we are launching from complex to injectables as well as continuing to deliver on our outside of the U.S. platform is what's able to give us the confidence to say that at least [5 40 ] next year given all those things you just mentioned, taking into consideration. So what I would say is just again the message of the durability of our platform and our ability to absorb the volatility, which we believe really distinguishes us from our peers."

So I can assure you that the financial flexibility that we still have today and are maintaining because of our -- the generation of our cash flows that we're going to continue to be balanced as far as yes, paying down debt and staying committed to investment-grade but also have the flexibility to be able to bring the right products or dosage forms into our mix, both whether it's U.S., Europe or Rest of World. And I think you're going to continue to see us execute on that. And the last thing I'd say because I think your point about the decimation of the industry. I think one thing I would just ask, and I've said this before, but I think it's continuing to play out is the continuity of our management team and the tenure of it. We've been together a decade as we've continued to not only manage at the peaks but in the valleys. And I think that's where you see a management team that has had a strategy out there. We've executed to it. We've continued to navigate the waters, I think, better than anybody else out there. So hopefully, that differentiation is what continues to put investors at ease with not only the credibility we've now hopefully amassed on a scientific side, but also just being able to continue to maximize this global platform and absorb what the industry is going through here in the U.S."

We did say and I did say in this call that we've asked and obtained an extension from our banks at 4.25 for the balance of 2017 and 2018, and that doesn't mean we're not committed to continuing to delever. But it actually speaks to the strength of our cash flows, and we talked about that a lot during the call today as well as the fact that as Heather said, in this environment, there are assets out in the marketplace that we just are going to continue to take a look at for potential bolt-on opportunities. And the banking group supports us, and that's why we have continued to delever but have asked for that extension at 4.25.

Because I think that what you'll find in the presentation that we provided, Built to Last, is that when you look at Mylan and the portfolio we have in each of these segments and you look at peers within, especially Europe and Rest of World and some of the valuations that are happening around their businesses where we have as good if not better businesses within those geographical regions, I think that's where a multiple expansion is certainly warranted when you now put our whole global product mix together. And I don't believe that's rooted or grounded in governance. I think that as we continue to have shareholder meetings and certainly stay open-minded and have these discussions, again what I can say is we look at companies out there around the globe with a whole host of governance issues from family-owned to a whole wide array of how they're on the public markets. We really believe it's the fundamentals that should drive that valuation. And we believe that the shareholder outreach program is going to go a long way to help rebase and have honestly us get credit of the company we've built over the last decade and believe that we've got a real strong lead ahead of anybody else out there and have a real opportunity to really be the bellwether of this industry."

Before we get started, I'd like to send a special message to our employees in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and thank them for their perseverance following the devastating h",1383,"Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Before we get started, I'd like to send a special message to our employees in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and thank them for their perseverance following the devastating hurricanes that struck there during the quarter. 
We're extremely grateful that all of them are safely accounted for and are proud of how we all came together to support one another and people in surrounding communities in the storm's aftermath. So we recognize that the journey to rebuild will be a long one, especially in Puerto Rico, which was affected most severely. We're glad to report that our plant there is operational, and we have not experienced any shortages of the drugs we manufacture at the facility. 
Turning now to our business. I'm personally very grateful to say that after years of hopeful anticipation, it finally happened. Early last month, we received FDA approval of our Glatiramer Acetate product for both the 20- and 40-milligram strengths and immediately launched them into the U.S. marketplace. Being first to market with the 40-milligram strength as well as offering the 20 is a milestone in many regards. 
First and foremost, it underscores our scientific and regulatory capabilities to develop, secure approval of, manufacture and bring to market an extremely complex product despite an arduous multiyear process. Second, and equally as important, is our ability to continue to deliver on our mission of providing access to more affordable products to patients, and that's where our new Mylan MS Advocate program comes in. It's designed to help patients get started and stay on track with their physician's treatment plan for either dosage strength. It should be noted that this program also paves the way for the many other products in our pipeline that have special commercialization needs. 
Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention how proud we are of all of our employees here at Mylan. Our success in launching this very important product, one of the largest generic launches in recent history, which could not have come at a better time, only stands as a reminder of why we get up every day and what we fight and stand for. This single launch alone could have the effect of saving billions of dollars cumulatively for MS patients, taxpayers and the overall health care system. 
This launch should also serve as an important reminder to all stakeholders in the health care system about the importance of our industry and the role that we play, especially as our industry continues to come under attack by those whom we believe may not fully understand or appreciate how our industry works and all that's involved in bringing very important products like this to market. Because of this, we applaud our industry's trade group, the Association for Affordable Medicine, for their hard work in helping educate all stakeholders interested in our health care system. 
With that said and while the U.S. health care system rebases itself, there are some fundamentals that will not change. The demand for high-quality generics will not be going away. Generics already fill 90% of all prescriptions dispensed within the U.S. as well as a growing proportion of scripts filled around the world. Meeting this global demand is exactly what we envision and have executed on over the last decade. This is exactly why we moved out of the U.S. Generics and Specialty neighborhood and into a much larger and more resilient path in the global community. We've built our global platform to absorb and withstand geographic volatility, and it's through our product and channel diversification that Mylan has truly transformed itself from a single market, high-risk, first-to-file company into a resilient global business with strong durable cash flows. 
To put a number to it, we now believe that approximately 75% of our more than $2 billion adjusted operating cash flows stem from predictable, recurring revenues across all markets around the world, leaving a 25% basket of smaller, less predictable products, primarily in the U.S. Generics market. This model provides Mylan with a unique opportunity to meet the demands of individual markets around the world much more reliably, and as a result, it positions us very differently from our peers. 
We believe there is a real disconnect between our current valuation and the global business we've built. I believe our depressed share price is reflective of investor sentiment regarding a U.S.-only marketplace, which, therefore, provides us an opportunity to educate and expand shareholders' knowledge base and therefore, our multiple. 
I am personally committed to helping shareholders fully understand our transformation and who Mylan is today, so that we can reach our intended goal of fully realizing Mylan's value through total shareholder return accretion. As a part of that commitment, we will be embarking on an investor outreach program that will lay out how we intend to address this disconnect. 
Specifically, we intend to effectively deploy capital for future growth while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue investing on our existing pipeline and additional opportunities to further enhance our pipeline. We will continue to look for and execute on opportunistic bolt-on transactions to add to our existing platform. And finally, we will do all of this while continuing to grow the top and bottom line. 
Above all, the key message we'll be delivering is that we have built Mylan to last, and that what makes us different is what makes us durable. As a result, we now have a substantial number of opportunities that are unique to Mylan's growth profile. 
Having begun our transformation a decade ago, we have a huge start. And going forward, you can be absolutely sure we'll be executing to the best of our ability to use our strengths to matter even more to our customers, patients and health care systems around the world and therefore, continue delivering growth and value to our shareholders. 
You can find our presentation called Built to Last in the Investor Relations section of our website at mylan.com. When you arrive at this site, you will also see an invitation to learn more about Mylan's story and our global impact by providing access to medicine, innovation and science and public health policy. It's part of the campaign we recently launched called Better Health for a Better World, and through it, we intend to better tell our story to a much broader audience. 
Turning to the third quarter. Our results, which included adjusted EPS of $1.10, were especially strong considering the ongoing challenges we experienced in the U.S., including accelerated deceleration of EpiPen sales, both from our launch of an authorized generic as well as the contraction of the overall epinephrine auto-injector market. 
Substantially moderating those challenges were our Rest of World and European segments, which together accounted for 60% of our third party net sales during the quarter. Both segments showed continued strength, with our business in Europe again posting double-digit growth, a great example of the ability of our highly diversified global platform to absorb our industry's inevitable headwinds wherever they occur. 
As for the fourth quarter, given our GA launch and the stability of our platform, we see a strong finish ahead. We are, thus, increasing the low end of our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. 
Our new 2017 revenue range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full year 2016. Our new 2017 adjusted EPS range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share, a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. 
What's more, we believe the momentum and growth we see ahead is sustainable, which is why we remain confident in our 2018 target of at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS. We look forward to bringing you detailed guidance for 2018 during our 4Q call. 
We're once again continuing to deliver and differentiate Mylan in a rapidly changing industry. And for our third quarter performance, I'd like on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution and for their commitment to delivering better health for a better world. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

Before I begin, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and unwavering focus on our mission, especially those who were affected recently by natural disasters. We are very pro",2055,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and unwavering focus on our mission, especially those who were affected recently by natural disasters. We are very proud of our employees who, despite personally going through this ordeal, were able to ensure that there was no significant disruption and drug shortages from our facilities.
Let me briefly turn to our third quarter results. I will provide an overview of our top line performance, and Ken will cover segment profitability. Overall, we delivered nearly $3 billion in total revenues for the quarter, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year. We saw strong performance in our Europe and Rest of the World regions, which again represent more than half of our revenue. This helped to partially mitigate the expected decline in North America. 
All regions benefited from contributions from our acquisition of Meda businesses, which continue to perform well and meet our expectations. Mylan's integration is going strong, and we are excited to see that integrated platform come to life with no business disruption while we brought various assets from Meda and Renaissance together. Now we are continuing to optimize the assets we have acquired and identify additional cost-saving as well as revenue opportunities beyond what we have previously stated and are expected to generate additional annual saving of more than $200 million.
In North America, our robust portfolio, rich pipeline, commercial infrastructure and our long-standing relationships we have fostered with our customers give us the unique ability to face the turbulence of this market. We expect to see sustainable cash flows from our hard-to-make, complex product portfolio, which generally have a high regulatory hurdle to climb and oftentimes, require clinical trials and thus, give relatively better visibility of emerging new competition. 
Also, such complex products usually provide more predictable and durable cash flows. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from North America. We also anticipate that our growing portfolio of injectables, OTC as well as Topicals Business will also further contribute to our stability and future growth in this market. I will also note that EpiPen, the one big reason for decline this year, is projected to be less than 3% of total revenue and is not a meaningful contributor as we go into 2018. 
A strong and sustainable performance in Europe is being delivered from our well-executed integrated platform of Mylan's legacy Abbott EPD and Meda businesses. Our European business is no longer primarily generic but has approximately 2/3 of revenue coming from our Rx and OTC channels. 
Our portfolio of key brands like Creon, Influvac, Dymista, Dona, Betadine, Saugella and EpiPen belongs to a class of hard-to-make, complex products and provide us predictable and durable cash flows. These brands have a great brand equity in these markets and also given the nature of these markets, do not get genericized overnight. About 40% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from Europe. We will be further focusing on our global key brand portfolio, and we'll continue to make sustainable efforts to further grow and expand these across other countries. 
Also, we're excited by the growth opportunities we see to further strengthen our business in our key markets like France, Italy, Germany, Poland, U.K. and Nordics, where we are now in position to add many more exciting products from our pipeline like biosimilars and through a cross-pollination of our vast portfolio as we go along. 
Our Rest of the World business currently represents approximately 60% of revenues from generics, with the rest from Rx and OTC. This business not only is a significant source of durable cash flows but will be a significant contributor for sustained growth in the future. We are focusing on expansion of our strong global portfolio into various markets, which came along with Meda acquisition like China, Russia, Turkey, Mexico as well as Brazil. 
Our Australia and Japanese businesses will continue to show a sustained performance. Also, we'll continue to build on our successful track record of our ARV performance and explore -- and expand this further globally beyond emerging markets of sub-Saharan Africa. 
For example, we recently announced a 3-year volume-based contract with a consortium constituting UNAIDS, CHAI, Gates Foundation, PEPFAR and Global Fund to provide the new [indiscernible] for more than 90 countries. This is a significant step to accelerate treatment rollout as part of global efforts to reach all 36.7 million people living with HIV. This initiative will give this otherwise relatively volatile business more predictability, stability and growth over a period of time. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from the Rest of the World. 
Before I review our key pipeline programs, let me start by saying that we are very pleased to have received FDA approval of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as another much needed alternative to the Copaxone 20-milligram. 
We have always believed in our science, regulatory and intellectual property capabilities, and we are excited to bring this affordable and substitutable product ultimately to the patients who are dealing with this very difficult disease. This approval is a perfect example of how Mylan's mission of providing high-quality medicines to those who need them is consistent with FDA's focus on access to complex Generics. 
We also are excited about the opportunity to launch the generic version of Copaxone 40-milligram with our partner, Synthon, in certain key European countries as we receive EMA approval in October. Each country will now follow its own process to obtain marketing authorizations to launch in their country. We have already launched generic version of Copaxone 20-milligram in certain European markets. 
From the future pipeline investments point of view, we'll continue to focus on the development and manufacturing of complex products while we diligently invest in our colds businesses, including ARVs, injectables, topicals and oral solid dosage forms. This is especially the case with our injectable portfolio as we are seeing more approvals come through for these products. 
As you recall, we acquired Agila with the goal of becoming a reliable, global source of high-quality injectables for patients. With the period of enhancements to the acquired facilities behind us, this goal is now a reality. This year alone, we received more than 20 approvals of injectables in U.S. and more than 70 products are in our pipeline or pending approval. Complex and hard-to-make products especially require substantial R&D resources and investments, a strong regulatory and intellectual property expertise, along with an ability to invest significant capital to manufacture and commercialize these products. We believe Mylan is well positioned in all of these areas to execute on our other pipeline opportunities. 
Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs. Starting with our biosimilar programs. The regulatory environment continues to be active over the last few months. While we believe additional changes are still needed to enable the U.S. biosimilar market, we are encouraged by the commitments expressed by Commissioner Gottlieb and steps being taken by U.S. FDA in facilitating the views as well as their recent initiation of their efforts to educate physicians on the benefits and the cost savings of biosimilars. 
We are also very pleased at the steps we saw last week on the [ CMS ] for the Medicare. Regarding our Biocon partnership, we continue to see progress with the submission and regulatory process. With our pegfilgrastim application in the U.S.A., you will recall that FDA issued a CRL relating to certain CMC data from drug product facility inspection. It is important to highlight the fact that the CRL did not raise any questions on biosimilarity, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic data, clinical data or immunogenicity. We remain very confident that we will be able to respond to the CRL in the next few weeks. 
On the GMP side, Mylan and Biocon have been in close collaboration with FDA, and we have a clear path towards it -- clear path forward to resolve issues identified in the inspection. For trastuzumab in the U.S.A., we continue to work with the FDA to resolve all outstanding issues, and we are hopeful to get this very important product approved very soon. Our BsUFA goal date for this product is December 3, 2017. 
With respect to our pegfilgrastim and trastuzumab application in Europe, Mylan, along with our partner, Biocon, has completed the corrective actions for the inspection of durations and continue to make good progress toward a reinspection of the Bangalore site. We are also making progress on the Marketing Authorization Applications. As for the administrative protocol, we have resubmitted both applications to EMA to restart the review. We'll keep you posted on the progress on these programs as we go along. 
I also note that for pegfilgrastim, we have also completed our regulatory submission for Canada, Australia and South Africa. And for trastuzumab, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 32 additional countries. And we have already received approvals in another 19 countries.
With respect to Insulin Glargine, in the U.S., we submitted our 505(b)(2) application, which is under active review with the FDA. You have seen that we have been sued by Sanofi, which triggered a 30-month stay on our approval. This 505(b)(2) application includes vials and disposable pens with cartridges. For our part, we'll continue to work on this submission with FDA to bring an interchangeable alternative Glargine to the patients as soon as possible. 
For Europe, the insulin manufacturing facility in Malaysia has been given GMP clearance by EMA, and we continue to have an ongoing and productive interaction with EMA on our application. In addition to the submission in U.S. and Europe, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 41 additional countries. We have already received approval in 6 other countries.
Moving to our Momenta partnership. Our biosimilar of ORENCIA received initial top line results from its Phase I study last week, and unfortunately, it did not meet primary PK endpoints. We are disappointed by these results, and we'll work closely with Momenta to fully analyze the data and determine next steps. Additionally, with respect to our next biosimilar candidate in this partnership, M710, we continue to plan for it to enter clinics in 2018. 
On the respiratory front, you will recall that we have confirmed with FDA that no further clinical or device-related studies are required for our generic Advair program. We have responded to the CRL and continue to work with FDA for this very important product. Also, we are encouraged that FDA is treating this complex product as a high priority. We remain ready from a manufacturing and commercial perspective and are optimistic to bring this very important product to patients as soon as possible.
Our revefenacin collaboration with Theravance Biopharma continues to make progress. And just last week, we announced a presentation to the additional positive efficacy data from the 3-month pivotal Phase III study at 2017 CHEST annual meeting. We are expecting to file this NDA for a novel nebulized LAMA treatment for COPD very shortly. 
If you recall, we announced previously that we have entered into a partnership with 3M for the development of generic version of Symbicort for the U.S. market. We are excited about the progress we are making in the development of this product and are confident that we are on track towards a 2018 ANDA 505(j) submission. Pivotal PK studies are now complete with (b) demonstrated for both low- and high-strength products. 
Regarding our generic form of prosthesis, we have made good progress on our application. And we believe that we have a product that adheres to the FDA's latest new guidance. Our bridging goal date is December 31 of this year. With this District Court verdict behind us, we look forward to bring this very important product to patients soon. 
In summary, I remain confident that we are poised for future growth with this incredibly unique and durable platform. And I'm excited about the progress we are making within our pipeline, our continued commercial diversification breaking across different channels and geographies and our ability to mean more to our customers around the globe. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tony."
290203,540834470,1338798,"Mylan N.V., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2017",2017-11-06,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning. As Heather and Rajiv commented, the strong global diversified business we have built over the past decade gives us more confidence than ever about our future and our ability to be a key supplier to customers and patient",880,"Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning. As Heather and Rajiv commented, the strong global diversified business we have built over the past decade gives us more confidence than ever about our future and our ability to be a key supplier to customers and patients around the world. Our unique commercial platform is fit to withstand change in our industry and continues to distinguish Mylan as a partner of choice during a time of further customer consolidation and globalization. 
One of the most important drivers behind our confidence is the daily effort made by our commercial team of nearly 7,000 people around the world. Without them, our products wouldn't reach the patients and providers who need them most. We are beginning to reap the rewards of the long-term and significant investments in science and innovation that Rajiv outlined in his remarks with the much anticipated U.S. launch of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as the generic version of the Copaxone 20-milligram. We are particularly pleased with our prescription uptake to date for the 40-milligram strength. 
For the week ending October 27, our share of new prescriptions was 16.2%, and total prescriptions was approximately 8%. We also are encouraged by the number of patients who are utilizing our comprehensive support services through our MS Advocate program. Some of these services include in-home injection trainings with an experienced MS nurse, educational resources and a 24/7 patient support center. We view this launch as a critical opportunity to provide an affordable alternative for patients and payers while still optimizing conversion and delivering value for Mylan. We look forward to successfully commercializing both strengths of this product in other key markets around the world as we receive appropriate regulatory approvals. 
In addition to generic Copaxone in the U.S., we are pleased with the strong performance of some of our global key brands around the world such as Dymista, Dona, Betadine and Elavil. These important products, which were acquired through our Meda transaction, experienced significant growth this quarter and continue to exceed our original expectations. We expect this growth to continue as we leverage our strong commercial infrastructure in key markets like Italy, France, Germany and the emerging and expansion markets.
I'd now like to provide an overview of our regional performances beginning with North America. As anticipated and outlined last quarter, this segment declined about 22% to just under $1.2 billion. Sales of EpiPen declined by $245 million this quarter as the overall market contracted when compared to the robust growth from the same quarter the prior year as well as experiencing additional competition. 
Excluding EpiPen, North America declined 6% as anticipated and as outlined last quarter, primarily due to the impact of significant first-to-market products losing exclusivity over the prior year as well as increased competition. We are still estimating annualized price erosion in the high single digits for the region for 2017.
Despite these challenges, we continue to see momentum and be excited about the future for this region. We've been pleased with the launches of several limited competition products this quarter. Most notably, the launch of Imatinib tablets further strengthen our robust U.S. oncology portfolio, which now contains more than 40 products. This is a very important therapeutic area for Mylan globally, which would be bolstered even further in the coming years with the introduction of several biosimilars to treat cancer. That said, I am pleased to report that the geographic diversity of our platform, which we have been building over the last 10 years, also has been balancing pressure in North America. 
In Europe, sales totaled more than $1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24%. These strong results were due to incremental sales from our Meda acquisition and favorable pricing and volume trends in the region. This includes mid-single-digit organic growth in the region, specifically in some of our largest markets such as France, Italy, Germany, U.K. and the Nordics. 
We also continue to be excited about the stability and performance of our strong brands in the region such as Creon and Influvac as well as new growth from brands like Betadine and Dymista. This quarter's growth from our acquired assets reinforces our confidence that building scale in Europe under our One Mylan approach has us well positioned within the region. 
In our Rest of World segment, sales totaled $740 million, a year-over-year increase of 9% driven primarily by our new Meda assets and strong performance in emerging markets. We are also seeing strong performance from some of our key brands in this region. Amitiza, for instance, delivered robust growth of more than 20% for the quarter in Japan. And we will continue to seek ways to optimize our assets and partnerships in this market. Overall, for the third quarter, we saw as expected global generic price deflation in the mid-single digits, and we continue to anticipate this for the full year 2017. 
In summary, we believe our unique product mix of generics, brands and over-the-counter medications across a range of therapeutic categories and sold in multiple sales channels, combined with an expansive geographic reach and strong commercial platform, position Mylan better than any other company in the industry to serve our customers and deliver better health for patients. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."
290203,540834470,1338798,"Mylan N.V., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2017",2017-11-06,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues in the quarter declined slightly year-over-year to approximately $3 billion. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through our top line result",1074,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues in the quarter declined slightly year-over-year to approximately $3 billion. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through our top line results for Mylan in total and our segments. I'll now take you through the rest of our financial performance, which was in line with our expectations.
In the third quarter, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to approximately 57% in the same period last year. The decline is the result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, primarily EpiPen, partially mitigated by new product introductions and contributions from last year's acquisitions.
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D was approximately 6% of total revenues, which was in line with our expectations and down slightly from the prior year period due to the timing of clinical activities related primarily to our respiratory programs. 
SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, declined 3% to $586 million or approximately 20% of total revenues and also in line with our expectations. In the quarter, the benefits from our ongoing Mylan integration activities more than offset the incremental SG&A from our Meda acquisition. Our adjusted tax rate was 17.5% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 18%. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. 
Moving on to segment profitability. As a result of the declines in third party sales, including EpiPen, segment profitability in North America declined 27% in the quarter to $576 million. Partially offsetting this decline, segment profitability expanded in the Europe and Rest of World segments, reflecting contributions from the Meda acquisition as well as new product sales. When compared to the prior year period, Europe segment profitability was up 15%, and Rest of World segment profitability was up 16%. Adjusted net earnings in the quarter declined to $590 million, and adjusted diluted EPS declined 20% to $1.10. 
Briefly turning to our results for the 9 months ended September 30. Total revenues increased to approximately $8.7 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of 11%. Acquisitions contributed approximately $1.4 billion in net sales during the 9-month period, and adjusted earnings for the 9 months ended September 30 decreased by $26 million to $1.7 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS decreased 5% to $3.13.
Now turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.1 billion for the 9 months ended September 30 compared to approximately $1.9 billion in the prior year period. Capital expenditures totaled $156 million compared to approximately $240 million in the prior year.
As we said previously, we're fully committed to continuing to deleverage and have demonstrated that by paying down our debt by approximately $1.2 billion in the first 9 months of the year, which includes approximately $420 million in the third quarter. As a result of our continued strong cash flow generation, for the full year, we expect to deliver on our initial cash flow guidance of between $2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow net of our revised capital expenditures range of $300 million to $350 million. 
Our ability to generate strong cash flows reflects the strength and durability of our portfolio, resulting from the decade-long transformation of our business into a global diversified player and is supported by the power of our balance sheet, which provides us with the financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business. 
At the end of Q3 2017, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio as calculated under our credit agreement was 3.6x and was in compliance with our covenant requirements. You may recall that following the Meda acquisition, we elected to increase the leverage ratio covenant as permitted under our credit agreement to 4.25x through the second quarter of 2017. 
Just last week, on November 3, we entered into amendments to the agreements for the 2016 term loans and 2016 revolving facility to extend the leverage ratio covenant of 4.25x through the December 31, 2018, reporting period. These amendments provide us with the additional financial flexibility as we manage our capital structure during 2018. This does not change in any way our commitment to our deleveraging strategy or maintaining our investment-grade credit rating as we continue to work towards our long-term average debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3.0x.
Moving on to the revised guidance. Primarily due to the approval and subsequent launch of generic Copaxone in the U.S. market, we've increased the low end of both our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS 2017 guidance ranges. Our revised total revenue guidance range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full year 2016.
Our new adjusted EPS guidance range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share. That's a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. This year-over-year decline reflects the ongoing North America generic business dynamics as well as the more than $500 million impact from the rebasing of our EpiPen brand. 
Moving to 2018. As Heather mentioned, we're continuing to target at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS, which is an increase of more than 18% from the midpoint of our new guidance range for 2017. This target factors in the launch of generic Copaxone as well as the deferred launches of complex products from 2017, including generic Advair. It also includes incremental savings from integration activities and cost actions, continued growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments as well as the continuation of a challenging North American environment. We'll provide further details of our 2018 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Before I turn it over to Q&A, I urge all of you to take a closer look at the Built to Last presentation that Heather spoke about earlier and which is posted on our website this morning. We're very proud of the business that we've built over the last decade, and this presentation highlights our transformational journey as well as the path we plan to take to fully realize the value transformation and our differentiated portfolio. We believe that our differentiated business model, our performance and our stable, durable cash flow generation are not yet reflected in our stock price valuation.
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

I think all the weaknesses you just laid out are all primarily U.S.-driven. And as we continue to show, both from our European as well as our Rest of World segment, our ability to continue to grow at double digit in the case of Europe and high single-digit in Rest of World, that as we continue to leverage our assets, our products in these areas and continue to bring complex generics as we'll be launching Copaxone throughout Europe, I think those are very important to telling the story of how we're continuing to be able to absorb the volatility in this U.S. Generics market and which is why I made the commentary that -- just to remind everyone that we moved out of the neighborhood of just U.S. Generics and Specialty and into this global community that's helping us absorb that. And the Mylan that we've built today is able to continue to deliver and on our growth profile as we continue to bring these products to market. As far as the U.S. Generics, we continue to see those headwinds are going to continue for the foreseeable future. But I think again, the dynamics of our portfolio of the products we're launching, Rajiv spoke of the multiple injectable products we've launched and the [ 70 ] that are in our pipeline. So the durability again of what we are launching from complex to injectables as well as continuing to deliver on our outside of the U.S. platform is what's able to give us the confidence to say that at least [5 40 ] next year given all those things you just mentioned, taking into consideration. So what I would say is just again the message of the durability of our platform and our ability to absorb the volatility, which we believe really distinguishes us from our peers."

So I can assure you that the financial flexibility that we still have today and are maintaining because of our -- the generation of our cash flows that we're going to continue to be balanced as far as yes, paying down debt and staying committed to investment-grade but also have the flexibility to be able to bring the right products or dosage forms into our mix, both whether it's U.S., Europe or Rest of World. And I think you're going to continue to see us execute on that. And the last thing I'd say because I think your point about the decimation of the industry. I think one thing I would just ask, and I've said this before, but I think it's continuing to play out is the continuity of our management team and the tenure of it. We've been together a decade as we've continued to not only manage at the peaks but in the valleys. And I think that's where you see a management team that has had a strategy out there. We've executed to it. We've continued to navigate the waters, I think, better than anybody else out there. So hopefully, that differentiation is what continues to put investors at ease with not only the credibility we've now hopefully amassed on a scientific side, but also just being able to continue to maximize this global platform and absorb what the industry is going through here in the U.S."

We did say and I did say in this call that we've asked and obtained an extension from our banks at 4.25 for the balance of 2017 and 2018, and that doesn't mean we're not committed to continuing to delever. But it actually speaks to the strength of our cash flows, and we talked about that a lot during the call today as well as the fact that as Heather said, in this environment, there are assets out in the marketplace that we just are going to continue to take a look at for potential bolt-on opportunities. And the banking group supports us, and that's why we have continued to delever but have asked for that extension at 4.25.

And I don't believe that's rooted or grounded in governance. I think that as we continue to have shareholder meetings and certainly stay open-minded and have these discussions, again what I can say is we look at companies out there around the globe with a whole host of governance issues from family-owned to a whole wide array of how they're on the public markets. We really believe it's the fundamentals that should drive that valuation. And we believe that the shareholder outreach program is going to go a long way to help rebase and have honestly us get credit of the company we've built over the last decade and believe that we've got a real strong lead ahead of anybody else out there and have a real opportunity to really be the bellwether of this industry."

Mylan routinely posts information that may be important to investors on this website, and we may use this website address as a means of disclosing material information to the public in a broad, nonexclusionary manner for purposes of the SEC's regulation fair disclosure. 
In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Before we get started, I'd like to send a special message to our employees in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and thank them for their perseverance following the devastating h",1383,"Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Before we get started, I'd like to send a special message to our employees in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and thank them for their perseverance following the devastating hurricanes that struck there during the quarter. 
We're extremely grateful that all of them are safely accounted for and are proud of how we all came together to support one another and people in surrounding communities in the storm's aftermath. So we recognize that the journey to rebuild will be a long one, especially in Puerto Rico, which was affected most severely. We're glad to report that our plant there is operational, and we have not experienced any shortages of the drugs we manufacture at the facility. 
Turning now to our business. I'm personally very grateful to say that after years of hopeful anticipation, it finally happened. Early last month, we received FDA approval of our Glatiramer Acetate product for both the 20- and 40-milligram strengths and immediately launched them into the U.S. marketplace. Being first to market with the 40-milligram strength as well as offering the 20 is a milestone in many regards. 
First and foremost, it underscores our scientific and regulatory capabilities to develop, secure approval of, manufacture and bring to market an extremely complex product despite an arduous multiyear process. Second, and equally as important, is our ability to continue to deliver on our mission of providing access to more affordable products to patients, and that's where our new Mylan MS Advocate program comes in. It's designed to help patients get started and stay on track with their physician's treatment plan for either dosage strength. It should be noted that this program also paves the way for the many other products in our pipeline that have special commercialization needs. 
Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention how proud we are of all of our employees here at Mylan. Our success in launching this very important product, one of the largest generic launches in recent history, which could not have come at a better time, only stands as a reminder of why we get up every day and what we fight and stand for. This single launch alone could have the effect of saving billions of dollars cumulatively for MS patients, taxpayers and the overall health care system. 
This launch should also serve as an important reminder to all stakeholders in the health care system about the importance of our industry and the role that we play, especially as our industry continues to come under attack by those whom we believe may not fully understand or appreciate how our industry works and all that's involved in bringing very important products like this to market. Because of this, we applaud our industry's trade group, the Association for Affordable Medicine, for their hard work in helping educate all stakeholders interested in our health care system. 
With that said and while the U.S. health care system rebases itself, there are some fundamentals that will not change. The demand for high-quality generics will not be going away. Generics already fill 90% of all prescriptions dispensed within the U.S. as well as a growing proportion of scripts filled around the world. Meeting this global demand is exactly what we envision and have executed on over the last decade. This is exactly why we moved out of the U.S. Generics and Specialty neighborhood and into a much larger and more resilient path in the global community. We've built our global platform to absorb and withstand geographic volatility, and it's through our product and channel diversification that Mylan has truly transformed itself from a single market, high-risk, first-to-file company into a resilient global business with strong durable cash flows. 
To put a number to it, we now believe that approximately 75% of our more than $2 billion adjusted operating cash flows stem from predictable, recurring revenues across all markets around the world, leaving a 25% basket of smaller, less predictable products, primarily in the U.S. Generics market. This model provides Mylan with a unique opportunity to meet the demands of individual markets around the world much more reliably, and as a result, it positions us very differently from our peers. 
We believe there is a real disconnect between our current valuation and the global business we've built. I believe our depressed share price is reflective of investor sentiment regarding a U.S.-only marketplace, which, therefore, provides us an opportunity to educate and expand shareholders' knowledge base and therefore, our multiple. 
I am personally committed to helping shareholders fully understand our transformation and who Mylan is today, so that we can reach our intended goal of fully realizing Mylan's value through total shareholder return accretion. As a part of that commitment, we will be embarking on an investor outreach program that will lay out how we intend to address this disconnect. 
Specifically, we intend to effectively deploy capital for future growth while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue investing on our existing pipeline and additional opportunities to further enhance our pipeline. We will continue to look for and execute on opportunistic bolt-on transactions to add to our existing platform. And finally, we will do all of this while continuing to grow the top and bottom line. 
Above all, the key message we'll be delivering is that we have built Mylan to last, and that what makes us different is what makes us durable. As a result, we now have a substantial number of opportunities that are unique to Mylan's growth profile. 
Having begun our transformation a decade ago, we have a huge start. And going forward, you can be absolutely sure we'll be executing to the best of our ability to use our strengths to matter even more to our customers, patients and health care systems around the world and therefore, continue delivering growth and value to our shareholders. 
You can find our presentation called Built to Last in the Investor Relations section of our website at mylan.com. When you arrive at this site, you will also see an invitation to learn more about Mylan's story and our global impact by providing access to medicine, innovation and science and public health policy. It's part of the campaign we recently launched called Better Health for a Better World, and through it, we intend to better tell our story to a much broader audience. 
Turning to the third quarter. Our results, which included adjusted EPS of $1.10, were especially strong considering the ongoing challenges we experienced in the U.S., including accelerated deceleration of EpiPen sales, both from our launch of an authorized generic as well as the contraction of the overall epinephrine auto-injector market. 
Substantially moderating those challenges were our Rest of World and European segments, which together accounted for 60% of our third party net sales during the quarter. Both segments showed continued strength, with our business in Europe again posting double-digit growth, a great example of the ability of our highly diversified global platform to absorb our industry's inevitable headwinds wherever they occur. 
As for the fourth quarter, given our GA launch and the stability of our platform, we see a strong finish ahead. We are, thus, increasing the low end of our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. 
Our new 2017 revenue range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full year 2016. Our new 2017 adjusted EPS range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share, a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. 
What's more, we believe the momentum and growth we see ahead is sustainable, which is why we remain confident in our 2018 target of at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS. We look forward to bringing you detailed guidance for 2018 during our 4Q call. 
We're once again continuing to deliver and differentiate Mylan in a rapidly changing industry. And for our third quarter performance, I'd like on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution and for their commitment to delivering better health for a better world. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

Before I begin, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and unwavering focus on our mission, especially those who were affected recently by natural disasters. We are very pro",2058,"Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and unwavering focus on our mission, especially those who were affected recently by natural disasters. We are very proud of our employees who, despite personally going through this ordeal, were able to ensure that there was no significant disruption and drug shortages from our facilities.
Let me briefly turn to our third quarter results. I will provide an overview of our top line performance, and Ken will cover segment profitability. Overall, we delivered nearly $3 billion in total revenues for the quarter, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year. We saw strong performance in our Europe and Rest of the World regions, which again represent more than half of our revenue. This helped to partially mitigate the expected decline in North America. 
All regions benefited from contributions from our acquisition of Meda businesses, which continue to perform well and meet our expectations. Mylan's integration is going strong, and we are excited to see that integrated platform come to life with no business disruption while we brought various assets from Meda and Renaissance together. Now we are continuing to optimize the assets we have acquired and identify additional cost-saving as well as revenue opportunities beyond what we have previously stated and are expected to generate additional annual saving of more than $200 million.
In North America, our robust portfolio, rich pipeline, commercial infrastructure and our long-standing relationships we have fostered with our customers give us the unique ability to face the turbulence of this market. We expect to see sustainable cash flows from our hard-to-make, complex product portfolio, which generally have a high regulatory hurdle to climb and oftentimes, require clinical trials and thus, give relatively better visibility of emerging new competition. 
Also, such complex products usually provide more predictable and durable cash flows. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from North America. We also anticipate that our growing portfolio of injectables, OTC as well as Topicals Business will also further contribute to our stability and future growth in this market. I will also note that EpiPen, the one big reason for decline this year, is projected to be less than 3% of total revenue and is not a meaningful contributor as we go into 2018. 
A strong and sustainable performance in Europe is being delivered from our well-executed integrated platform of Mylan's legacy Abbott EPD and Meda businesses. Our European business is no longer primarily generic but has approximately 2/3 of revenue coming from our Rx and OTC channels. 
Our portfolio of key brands like Creon, Influvac, Dymista, Dona, Betadine, Saugella and EpiPen belongs to a class of hard-to-make, complex products and provide us predictable and durable cash flows. These brands have a great brand equity in these markets and also given the nature of these markets, do not get genericized overnight. About 40% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from Europe. We will be further focusing on our global key brand portfolio, and we'll continue to make sustainable efforts to further grow and expand these across other countries. 
Also, we're excited by the growth opportunities we see to further strengthen our business in our key markets like France, Italy, Germany, Poland, U.K. and Nordics, where we are now in position to add many more exciting products from our pipeline like biosimilars and through a cross-pollination of our vast portfolio as we go along. 
Our Rest of the World business currently represents approximately 60% of revenues from generics, with the rest from Rx and OTC. This business not only is a significant source of durable cash flows but will be a significant contributor for sustained growth in the future. We are focusing on expansion of our strong global portfolio into various markets, which came along with Meda acquisition like China, Russia, Turkey, Mexico as well as Brazil. 
Our Australia and Japanese businesses will continue to show a sustained performance. Also, we'll continue to build on our successful track record of our ARV performance and explore -- and expand this further globally beyond emerging markets of sub-Saharan Africa. 
For example, we recently announced a 3-year volume-based contract with a consortium constituting UNAIDS, CHAI, Gates Foundation, PEPFAR and Global Fund to provide the new antiretroviral therapy of TLD for more than 90 countries. This is a significant step to accelerate treatment rollout as part of global efforts to reach all 36.7 million people living with HIV. This initiative will give this otherwise relatively volatile business more predictability, stability and growth over a period of time. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from the Rest of the World. 
Before I review our key pipeline programs, let me start by saying that we are very pleased to have received FDA approval of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as another much needed alternative to the Copaxone 20-milligram. 
We have always believed in our science, regulatory and intellectual property capabilities, and we are excited to bring this affordable and substitutable product ultimately to the patients who are dealing with this very difficult disease. This approval is a perfect example of how Mylan's mission of providing high-quality medicines to those who need them is consistent with FDA's focus on access to complex Generics. 
We also are excited about the opportunity to launch the generic version of Copaxone 40-milligram with our partner, Synthon, in certain key European countries as we receive EMA approval in October. Each country will now follow its own process to obtain marketing authorizations to launch in their country. We have already launched generic version of Copaxone 20-milligram in certain European markets. 
From the future pipeline investments point of view, we'll continue to focus on the development and manufacturing of complex products while we diligently invest in our colds businesses, including ARVs, injectables, topicals and oral solid dosage forms. This is especially the case with our injectable portfolio as we are seeing more approvals come through for these products. 
As you recall, we acquired Agila with the goal of becoming a reliable, global source of high-quality injectables for patients. With the period of enhancements to the acquired facilities behind us, this goal is now a reality. This year alone, we received more than 20 approvals of injectables in U.S. and more than 70 products are in our pipeline or pending approval. Complex and hard-to-make products especially require substantial R&D resources and investments, a strong regulatory and intellectual property expertise, along with an ability to invest significant capital to manufacture and commercialize these products. We believe Mylan is well positioned in all of these areas to execute on our other pipeline opportunities. 
Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs. Starting with our biosimilar programs. The regulatory environment continues to be active over the last few months. While we believe additional changes are still needed to enable the U.S. biosimilar market, we are encouraged by the commitments expressed by Commissioner Gottlieb and steps being taken by U.S. FDA in facilitating the views as well as their recent initiation of their efforts to educate physicians on the benefits and the cost savings of biosimilars. 
We are also very pleased at the steps we saw last week on the [ CMS ] for the Medicare. Regarding our Biocon partnership, we continue to see progress with the submission and regulatory process. With our pegfilgrastim application in the U.S.A., you will recall that FDA issued a CRL relating to certain CMC data from drug product facility inspection. It is important to highlight the fact that the CRL did not raise any questions on biosimilarity, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic data, clinical data or immunogenicity. We remain very confident that we will be able to respond to the CRL in the next few weeks. 
On the GMP side, Mylan and Biocon have been in close collaboration with FDA, and we have a clear path towards it -- clear path forward to resolve issues identified in the inspection. For trastuzumab in the U.S.A., we continue to work with the FDA to resolve all outstanding issues, and we are hopeful to get this very important product approved very soon. Our BsUFA goal date for this product is December 3, 2017. 
With respect to our pegfilgrastim and trastuzumab application in Europe, Mylan, along with our partner, Biocon, has completed the corrective actions for the inspection of durations and continue to make good progress toward a reinspection of the Bangalore site. We are also making progress on the Marketing Authorization Applications. As for the administrative protocol, we have resubmitted both applications to EMA to restart the review. We'll keep you posted on the progress on these programs as we go along. 
I also note that for pegfilgrastim, we have also completed our regulatory submission for Canada, Australia and South Africa. And for trastuzumab, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 32 additional countries. And we have already received approvals in another 19 countries.
With respect to Insulin Glargine, in the U.S., we submitted our 505(b)(2) application, which is under active review with the FDA. You have seen that we have been sued by Sanofi, which triggered a 30-month stay on our approval. This 505(b)(2) application includes vials and disposable pens with cartridges. For our part, we'll continue to work on this submission with FDA to bring an interchangeable alternative Glargine to the patients as soon as possible. 
For Europe, the insulin manufacturing facility in Malaysia has been given GMP clearance by EMA, and we continue to have an ongoing and productive interaction with EMA on our application. In addition to the submission in U.S. and Europe, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 41 additional countries. We have already received approval in 6 other countries.
Moving to our Momenta partnership. Our biosimilar of ORENCIA received initial top line results from its Phase I study last week, and unfortunately, it did not meet primary PK endpoints. We are disappointed by these results, and we'll work closely with Momenta to fully analyze the data and determine next steps. Additionally, with respect to our next biosimilar candidate in this partnership, M710, we continue to plan for it to enter clinics in 2018. 
On the respiratory front, you will recall that we have confirmed with FDA that no further clinical or device-related studies are required for our generic Advair program. We have responded to the CRL and continue to work with FDA for this very important product. Also, we are encouraged that FDA is treating this complex product as a high priority. We remain ready from a manufacturing and commercial perspective and are optimistic to bring this very important product to patients as soon as possible.
Our revefenacin collaboration with Theravance Biopharma continues to make progress. And just last week, we announced a presentation to the additional positive efficacy data from the 3-month pivotal Phase III study at 2017 CHEST annual meeting. We are expecting to file this NDA for a novel nebulized LAMA treatment for COPD very shortly. 
If you recall, we announced previously that we have entered into a partnership with 3M for the development of generic version of Symbicort for the U.S. market. We are excited about the progress we are making in the development of this product and are confident that we are on track towards a 2018 ANDA 505(j) submission. Pivotal PK studies are now complete with (b) demonstrated for both low- and high-strength products. 
Regarding our generic form of prosthesis, we have made good progress on our application. And we believe that we have a product that adheres to the FDA's latest new guidance. Our bridging goal date is December 31 of this year. With this District Court verdict behind us, we look forward to bring this very important product to patients soon. 
In summary, I remain confident that we are poised for future growth with this incredibly unique and durable platform. And I'm excited about the progress we are making within our pipeline, our continued commercial diversification breaking across different channels and geographies and our ability to mean more to our customers around the globe. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tony."

As Heather and Rajiv commented, the strong global diversified business we have built over the past decade gives us more confidence than ever about our future and our ability to be a key supplier to customers and patient",880,"Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning. As Heather and Rajiv commented, the strong global diversified business we have built over the past decade gives us more confidence than ever about our future and our ability to be a key supplier to customers and patients around the world. Our unique commercial platform is fit to withstand change in our industry and continues to distinguish Mylan as a partner of choice during a time of further customer consolidation and globalization. 
One of the most important drivers behind our confidence is the daily effort made by our commercial team of nearly 7,000 people around the world. Without them, our products wouldn't reach the patients and providers who need them most. We are beginning to reap the rewards of the long-term and significant investments in science and innovation that Rajiv outlined in his remarks with the much anticipated U.S. launch of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as the generic version of the Copaxone 20-milligram. We are particularly pleased with our prescription uptake to date for the 40-milligram strength. 
For the week ending October 27, our share of new prescriptions was 16.2%, and total prescriptions was approximately 8%. We also are encouraged by the number of patients who are utilizing our comprehensive support services through our MS Advocate program. Some of these services include in-home injection trainings with an experienced MS nurse, educational resources and a 24/7 patient support center. We view this launch as a critical opportunity to provide an affordable alternative for patients and payers while still optimizing conversion and delivering value for Mylan. We look forward to successfully commercializing both strengths of this product in other key markets around the world as we receive appropriate regulatory approvals. 
In addition to generic Copaxone in the U.S., we are pleased with the strong performance of some of our global key brands around the world such as Dymista, Dona, Betadine and Elavil. These important products, which were acquired through our Meda transaction, experienced significant growth this quarter and continue to exceed our original expectations. We expect this growth to continue as we leverage our strong commercial infrastructure in key markets like Italy, France, Germany and the emerging and expansion markets.
I'd now like to provide an overview of our regional performances beginning with North America. As anticipated and outlined last quarter, this segment declined about 22% to just under $1.2 billion. Sales of EpiPen declined by $245 million this quarter as the overall market contracted when compared to the robust growth from the same quarter the prior year as well as experiencing additional competition. 
Excluding EpiPen, North America declined 6% as anticipated and as outlined last quarter, primarily due to the impact of significant first-to-market products losing exclusivity over the prior year as well as increased competition. We are still estimating annualized price erosion in the high single digits for the region for 2017.
Despite these challenges, we continue to see momentum and be excited about the future for this region. We've been pleased with the launches of several limited competition products this quarter. Most notably, the launch of Imatinib tablets further strengthen our robust U.S. oncology portfolio, which now contains more than 40 products. This is a very important therapeutic area for Mylan globally, which would be bolstered even further in the coming years with the introduction of several biosimilars to treat cancer. That said, I am pleased to report that the geographic diversity of our platform, which we have been building over the last 10 years, also has been balancing pressure in North America. 
In Europe, sales totaled more than $1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24%. These strong results were due to incremental sales from our Meda acquisition and favorable pricing and volume trends in the region. This includes mid-single-digit organic growth in the region, specifically in some of our largest markets such as France, Italy, Germany, U.K. and the Nordics. 
We also continue to be excited about the stability and performance of our strong brands in the region such as Creon and Influvac as well as new growth from brands like Betadine and Dymista. This quarter's growth from our acquired assets reinforces our confidence that building scale in Europe under our One Mylan approach has us well positioned within the region. 
In our Rest of World segment, sales totaled $740 million, a year-over-year increase of 9% driven primarily by our new Meda assets and strong performance in emerging markets. We are also seeing strong performance from some of our key brands in this region. Amitiza, for instance, delivered robust growth of more than 20% for the quarter in Japan. And we will continue to seek ways to optimize our assets and partnerships in this market. Overall, for the third quarter, we saw as expected global generic price deflation in the mid-single digits, and we continue to anticipate this for the full year 2017. 
In summary, we believe our unique product mix of generics, brands and over-the-counter medications across a range of therapeutic categories and sold in multiple sales channels, combined with an expansive geographic reach and strong commercial platform, position Mylan better than any other company in the industry to serve our customers and deliver better health for patients. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."
290203,540834470,1355502,"Mylan N.V., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2017",2017-11-06,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues in the quarter declined slightly year-over-year to approximately $3 billion. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through our top line result",1074,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues in the quarter declined slightly year-over-year to approximately $3 billion. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through our top line results for Mylan in total and our segments. I'll now take you through the rest of our financial performance, which was in line with our expectations.
In the third quarter, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to approximately 57% in the same period last year. The decline is the result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, primarily EpiPen, partially mitigated by new product introductions and contributions from last year's acquisitions.
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D was approximately 6% of total revenues, which was in line with our expectations and down slightly from the prior year period due to the timing of clinical activities related primarily to our respiratory programs. 
SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, declined 3% to $586 million or approximately 20% of total revenues and also in line with our expectations. In the quarter, the benefits from our ongoing Mylan integration activities more than offset the incremental SG&A from our Meda acquisition. Our adjusted tax rate was 17.5% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 18%. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. 
Moving on to segment profitability. As a result of the declines in third party sales, including EpiPen, segment profitability in North America declined 27% in the quarter to $576 million. Partially offsetting this decline, segment profitability expanded in the Europe and Rest of World segments, reflecting contributions from the Meda acquisition as well as new product sales. When compared to the prior year period, Europe segment profitability was up 15%, and Rest of World segment profitability was up 16%. Adjusted net earnings in the quarter declined to $590 million, and adjusted diluted EPS declined 20% to $1.10. 
Briefly turning to our results for the 9 months ended September 30. Total revenues increased to approximately $8.7 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of 11%. Acquisitions contributed approximately $1.4 billion in net sales during the 9-month period, and adjusted earnings for the 9 months ended September 30 decreased by $26 million to $1.7 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS decreased 5% to $3.13.
Now turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.1 billion for the 9 months ended September 30 compared to approximately $1.9 billion in the prior year period. Capital expenditures totaled $156 million compared to approximately $240 million in the prior year.
As we said previously, we're fully committed to continuing to deleverage and have demonstrated that by paying down our debt by approximately $1.2 billion in the first 9 months of the year, which includes approximately $420 million in the third quarter. As a result of our continued strong cash flow generation, for the full year, we expect to deliver on our initial cash flow guidance of between $2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow net of our revised capital expenditures range of $300 million to $350 million. 
Our ability to generate strong cash flows reflects the strength and durability of our portfolio, resulting from the decade-long transformation of our business into a global diversified player and is supported by the power of our balance sheet, which provides us with the financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business. 
At the end of Q3 2017, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio as calculated under our credit agreement was 3.6x and was in compliance with our covenant requirements. You may recall that following the Meda acquisition, we elected to increase the leverage ratio covenant as permitted under our credit agreement to 4.25x through the second quarter of 2017. 
Just last week, on November 3, we entered into amendments to the agreements for the 2016 term loans and 2016 revolving facility to extend the leverage ratio covenant of 4.25x through the December 31, 2018, reporting period. These amendments provide us with the additional financial flexibility as we manage our capital structure during 2018. This does not change in any way our commitment to our deleveraging strategy or maintaining our investment-grade credit rating as we continue to work towards our long-term average debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3.0x.
Moving on to the revised guidance. Primarily due to the approval and subsequent launch of generic Copaxone in the U.S. market, we've increased the low end of both our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS 2017 guidance ranges. Our revised total revenue guidance range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full year 2016.
Our new adjusted EPS guidance range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share. That's a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. This year-over-year decline reflects the ongoing North America generic business dynamics as well as the more than $500 million impact from the rebasing of our EpiPen brand. 
Moving to 2018. As Heather mentioned, we're continuing to target at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS, which is an increase of more than 18% from the midpoint of our new guidance range for 2017. This target factors in the launch of generic Copaxone as well as the deferred launches of complex products from 2017, including generic Advair. It also includes incremental savings from integration activities and cost actions, continued growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments as well as the continuation of a challenging North American environment. We'll provide further details of our 2018 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Before I turn it over to Q&A, I urge all of you to take a closer look at the Built to Last presentation that Heather spoke about earlier and which is posted on our website this morning. We're very proud of the business that we've built over the last decade, and this presentation highlights our transformational journey as well as the path we plan to take to fully realize the value transformation and our differentiated portfolio. We believe that our differentiated business model, our performance and our stable, durable cash flow generation are not yet reflected in our stock price valuation.
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

I think all the weaknesses you just laid out are all primarily U.S.-driven. And as we continue to show, both from our European as well as our Rest of World segment, our ability to continue to grow at double digit in the case of Europe and high single-digit in Rest of World, that as we continue to leverage our assets, our products in these areas and continue to bring complex generics as we'll be launching Copaxone throughout Europe, I think those are very important to telling the story of how we're continuing to be able to absorb the volatility in this U.S. Generics market and which is why I made the commentary that -- just to remind everyone that we moved out of the neighborhood of just U.S. Generics and Specialty and into this global community that's helping us absorb that. And the Mylan that we've built today is able to continue to deliver and on our growth profile as we continue to bring these products to market. As far as the U.S. Generics, we continue to see those headwinds are going to continue for the foreseeable future. But I think again, the dynamics of our portfolio of the products we're launching, Rajiv spoke of the multiple injectable products we've launched and the [ 70 ] that are in our pipeline. So the durability again of what we are launching from complex to injectables as well as continuing to deliver on our outside of the U.S. platform is what's able to give us the confidence to say that at least [5 40 ] next year given all those things you just mentioned, taking into consideration. So what I would say is just again the message of the durability of our platform and our ability to absorb the volatility, which we believe really distinguishes us from our peers."

So I can assure you that the financial flexibility that we still have today and are maintaining because of our -- the generation of our cash flows that we're going to continue to be balanced as far as yes, paying down debt and staying committed to investment-grade but also have the flexibility to be able to bring the right products or dosage forms into our mix, both whether it's U.S., Europe or Rest of World. And I think you're going to continue to see us execute on that. And the last thing I'd say because I think your point about the decimation of the industry. I think one thing I would just ask, and I've said this before, but I think it's continuing to play out is the continuity of our management team and the tenure of it. We've been together a decade as we've continued to not only manage at the peaks but in the valleys. And I think that's where you see a management team that has had a strategy out there. We've executed to it. We've continued to navigate the waters, I think, better than anybody else out there. So hopefully, that differentiation is what continues to put investors at ease with not only the credibility we've now hopefully amassed on a scientific side, but also just being able to continue to maximize this global platform and absorb what the industry is going through here in the U.S."

And the banking group supports us, and that's why we have continued to delever but have asked for that extension at 4.25.

And I don't believe that's rooted or grounded in governance. I think that as we continue to have shareholder meetings and certainly stay open-minded and have these discussions, again what I can say is we look at companies out there around the globe with a whole host of governance issues from family-owned to a whole wide array of how they're on the public markets. We really believe it's the fundamentals that should drive that valuation. And we believe that the shareholder outreach program is going to go a long way to help rebase and have honestly us get credit of the company we've built over the last decade and believe that we've got a real strong lead ahead of anybody else out there and have a real opportunity to really be the bellwether of this industry."

Before we get started, I'd like to send a special message to our employees in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and thank them for their perseverance following the devastating h",1383,"Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Before we get started, I'd like to send a special message to our employees in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and thank them for their perseverance following the devastating hurricanes that struck there during the quarter. 
We're extremely grateful that all of them are safely accounted for and are proud of how we all came together to support one another and people in surrounding communities in the storm's aftermath. So we recognize that the journey to rebuild will be a long one, especially in Puerto Rico, which was affected most severely. We're glad to report that our plant there is operational, and we have not experienced any shortages of the drugs we manufacture at the facility. 
Turning now to our business. I'm personally very grateful to say that after years of hopeful anticipation, it finally happened. Early last month, we received FDA approval of our Glatiramer Acetate product for both the 20- and 40-milligram strengths and immediately launched them into the U.S. marketplace. Being first to market with the 40-milligram strength as well as offering the 20 is a milestone in many regards. 
First and foremost, it underscores our scientific and regulatory capabilities to develop, secure approval of, manufacture and bring to market an extremely complex product despite an arduous multiyear process. Second, and equally as important, is our ability to continue to deliver on our mission of providing access to more affordable products to patients, and that's where our new Mylan MS Advocate program comes in. It's designed to help patients get started and stay on track with their physician's treatment plan for either dosage strength. It should be noted that this program also paves the way for the many other products in our pipeline that have special commercialization needs. 
Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention how proud we are of all of our employees here at Mylan. Our success in launching this very important product, one of the largest generic launches in recent history, which could not have come at a better time, only stands as a reminder of why we get up every day and what we fight and stand for. This single launch alone could have the effect of saving billions of dollars cumulatively for MS patients, taxpayers and the overall health care system. 
This launch should also serve as an important reminder to all stakeholders in the health care system about the importance of our industry and the role that we play, especially as our industry continues to come under attack by those whom we believe may not fully understand or appreciate how our industry works and all that's involved in bringing very important products like this to market. Because of this, we applaud our industry's trade group, the Association for Affordable Medicine, for their hard work in helping educate all stakeholders interested in our health care system. 
With that said and while the U.S. health care system rebases itself, there are some fundamentals that will not change. The demand for high-quality generics will not be going away. Generics already fill 90% of all prescriptions dispensed within the U.S. as well as a growing proportion of scripts filled around the world. Meeting this global demand is exactly what we envision and have executed on over the last decade. This is exactly why we moved out of the U.S. Generics and Specialty neighborhood and into a much larger and more resilient path in the global community. We've built our global platform to absorb and withstand geographic volatility, and it's through our product and channel diversification that Mylan has truly transformed itself from a single market, high-risk, first-to-file company into a resilient global business with strong durable cash flows. 
To put a number to it, we now believe that approximately 75% of our more than $2 billion adjusted operating cash flows stem from predictable, recurring revenues across all markets around the world, leaving a 25% basket of smaller, less predictable products, primarily in the U.S. Generics market. This model provides Mylan with a unique opportunity to meet the demands of individual markets around the world much more reliably, and as a result, it positions us very differently from our peers. 
We believe there is a real disconnect between our current valuation and the global business we've built. I believe our depressed share price is reflective of investor sentiment regarding a U.S.-only marketplace, which, therefore, provides us an opportunity to educate and expand shareholders' knowledge base and therefore, our multiple. 
I am personally committed to helping shareholders fully understand our transformation and who Mylan is today, so that we can reach our intended goal of fully realizing Mylan's value through total shareholder return accretion. As a part of that commitment, we will be embarking on an investor outreach program that will lay out how we intend to address this disconnect. 
Specifically, we intend to effectively deploy capital for future growth while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue investing on our existing pipeline and additional opportunities to further enhance our pipeline. We will continue to look for and execute on opportunistic bolt-on transactions to add to our existing platform. And finally, we will do all of this while continuing to grow the top and bottom line. 
Above all, the key message we'll be delivering is that we have built Mylan to last, and that what makes us different is what makes us durable. As a result, we now have a substantial number of opportunities that are unique to Mylan's growth profile. 
Having begun our transformation a decade ago, we have a huge start. And going forward, you can be absolutely sure we'll be executing to the best of our ability to use our strengths to matter even more to our customers, patients and health care systems around the world and therefore, continue delivering growth and value to our shareholders. 
You can find our presentation called Built to Last in the Investor Relations section of our website at mylan.com. When you arrive at this site, you will also see an invitation to learn more about Mylan's story and our global impact by providing access to medicine, innovation and science and public health policy. It's part of the campaign we recently launched called Better Health for a Better World, and through it, we intend to better tell our story to a much broader audience. 
Turning to the third quarter. Our results, which included adjusted EPS of $1.10, were especially strong considering the ongoing challenges we experienced in the U.S., including accelerated deceleration of EpiPen sales, both from our launch of an authorized generic as well as the contraction of the overall epinephrine auto-injector market. 
Substantially moderating those challenges were our Rest of World and European segments, which together accounted for 60% of our third party net sales during the quarter. Both segments showed continued strength, with our business in Europe again posting double-digit growth, a great example of the ability of our highly diversified global platform to absorb our industry's inevitable headwinds wherever they occur. 
As for the fourth quarter, given our GA launch and the stability of our platform, we see a strong finish ahead. We are, thus, increasing the low end of our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. 
Our new 2017 revenue range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full year 2016. Our new 2017 adjusted EPS range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share, a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. 
What's more, we believe the momentum and growth we see ahead is sustainable, which is why we remain confident in our 2018 target of at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS. We look forward to bringing you detailed guidance for 2018 during our 4Q call. 
We're once again continuing to deliver and differentiate Mylan in a rapidly changing industry. And for our third quarter performance, I'd like on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution and for their commitment to delivering better health for a better world. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv."

Before I begin, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and unwavering focus on our mission, especially those who were affected recently by natural disasters. We are very proud of our employees who, despite personally going through this ordeal, were able to ensure that there was no significant disruption and drug shortages from our facilities.
Let me briefly turn to our third quarter results. I will provide an overview of our top line performance, and Ken will cover segment profitability. Overall, we delivered nearly $3 billion in total revenues for the quarter, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year. We saw strong performance in our Europe and Rest of the World regions, which again represent more than half of our revenue. This helped to partially mitigate the expected decline in North America. 
All regions benefited from contributions from our acquisition of Meda businesses, which continue to perform well and meet our expectations. Mylan's integration is going strong, and we are excited to see that integrated platform come to life with no business disruption while we brought various assets from Meda and Renaissance together. Now we are continuing to optimize the assets we have acquired and identify additional cost-saving as well as revenue opportunities beyond what we have previously stated and are expected to generate additional annual saving of more than $200 million.
In North America, our robust portfolio, rich pipeline, commercial infrastructure and our long-standing relationships we have fostered with our customers give us the unique ability to face the turbulence of this market. We expect to see sustainable cash flows from our hard-to-make, complex product portfolio, which generally have a high regulatory hurdle to climb and oftentimes, require clinical trials and thus, give relatively better visibility of emerging new competition. 
Also, such complex products usually provide more predictable and durable cash flows. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from North America. We also anticipate that our growing portfolio of injectables, OTC as well as Topicals Business will also further contribute to our stability and future growth in this market. I will also note that EpiPen, the one big reason for decline this year, is projected to be less than 3% of total revenue and is not a meaningful contributor as we go into 2018. 
A strong and sustainable performance in Europe is being delivered from our well-executed integrated platform of Mylan's legacy Abbott EPD and Meda businesses. Our European business is no longer primarily generic but has approximately 2/3 of revenue coming from our Rx and OTC channels. 
Our portfolio of key brands like Creon, Influvac, Dymista, Dona, Betadine, Saugella and EpiPen belongs to a class of hard-to-make, complex products and provide us predictable and durable cash flows. These brands have a great brand equity in these markets and also given the nature of these markets, do not get genericized overnight. About 40% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from Europe. We will be further focusing on our global key brand portfolio, and we'll continue to make sustainable efforts to further grow and expand these across other countries. 
Also, we're excited by the growth opportunities we see to further strengthen our business in our key markets like France, Italy, Germany, Poland, U.K. and Nordics, where we are now in position to add many more exciting products from our pipeline like biosimilars and through a cross-pollination of our vast portfolio as we go along. 
Our Rest of the World business currently represents approximately 60% of revenues from generics, with the rest from Rx and OTC. This business not only is a significant source of durable cash flows but will be a significant contributor for sustained growth in the future. We are focusing on expansion of our strong global portfolio into various markets, which came along with Meda acquisition like China, Russia, Turkey, Mexico as well as Brazil. 
Our Australia and Japanese businesses will continue to show a sustained performance. Also, we'll continue to build on our successful track record of our ARV performance and explore -- and expand this further globally beyond emerging markets of sub-Saharan Africa. 
For example, we recently announced a 3-year volume-based contract with a consortium constituting UNAIDS, CHAI, Gates Foundation, PEPFAR and Global Fund to provide the new antiretroviral therapy of TLD for more than 90 countries. This is a significant step to accelerate treatment rollout as part of global efforts to reach all 36.7 million people living with HIV. This initiative will give this otherwise relatively volatile business more predictability, stability and growth over a period of time. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from the Rest of the World. 
Before I review our key pipeline programs, let me start by saying that we are very pleased to have received FDA approval of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as another much needed alternative to the Copaxone 20-milligram. 
We have always believed in our science, regulatory and intellectual property capabilities, and we are excited to bring this affordable and substitutable product ultimately to the patients who are dealing with this very difficult disease. This approval is a perfect example of how Mylan's mission of providing high-quality medicines to those who need them is consistent with FDA's focus on access to complex Generics. 
We also are excited about the opportunity to launch the generic version of Copaxone 40-milligram with our partner, Synthon, in certain key European countries as we receive EMA approval in October. Each country will now follow its own process to obtain marketing authorizations to launch in their country. We have already launched generic version of Copaxone 20-milligram in certain European markets. 
From the future pipeline investments point of view, we'll continue to focus on the development and manufacturing of complex products while we diligently invest in our colds businesses, including ARVs, injectables, topicals and oral solid dosage forms. This is especially the case with our injectable portfolio as we are seeing more approvals come through for these products. 
As you recall, we acquired Agila with the goal of becoming a reliable, global source of high-quality injectables for patients. With the period of enhancements to the acquired facilities behind us, this goal is now a reality. This year alone, we received more than 20 approvals of injectables in U.S. and more than 70 products are in our pipeline or pending approval. Complex and hard-to-make products especially require substantial R&D resources and investments, a strong regulatory and intellectual property expertise, along with an ability to invest significant capital to manufacture and commercialize these products. We believe Mylan is well positioned in all of these areas to execute on our other pipeline opportunities. 
Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs. Starting with our biosimilar programs. The regulatory environment continues to be active over the last few months. While we believe additional changes are still needed to enable the U.S. biosimilar market, we are encouraged by the commitments expressed by Commissioner Gottlieb and steps being taken by U.S. FDA in facilitating the views as well as their recent initiation of their efforts to educate physicians on the benefits and the cost savings of biosimilars. 
We are also very pleased at the steps we saw last week on the [ CMS ] for the Medicare. Regarding our Biocon partnership, we continue to see progress with the submission and regulatory process. With our pegfilgrastim application in the U.S.A., you will recall that FDA issued a CRL relating to certain CMC data from drug product facility inspection. It is important to highlight the fact that the CRL did not raise any questions on biosimilarity, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic data, clinical data or immunogenicity. We remain very confident that we will be able to respond to the CRL in the next few weeks. 
On the GMP side, Mylan and Biocon have been in close collaboration with FDA, and we have a clear path towards it -- clear path forward to resolve issues identified in the inspection. For trastuzumab in the U.S.A., we continue to work with the FDA to resolve all outstanding issues, and we are hopeful to get this very important product approved very soon. Our BsUFA goal date for this product is December 3, 2017. 
With respect to our pegfilgrastim and trastuzumab application in Europe, Mylan, along with our partner, Biocon, has completed the corrective actions for the inspection of durations and continue to make good progress toward a reinspection of the Bangalore site. We are also making progress on the Marketing Authorization Applications. As for the administrative protocol, we have resubmitted both applications to EMA to restart the review. We'll keep you posted on the progress on these programs as we go along. 
I also note that for pegfilgrastim, we have also completed our regulatory submission for Canada, Australia and South Africa. And for trastuzumab, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 32 additional countries. And we have already received approvals in another 19 countries.
With respect to Insulin Glargine, in the U.S., we submitted our 505(b)(2) application, which is under active review with the FDA. You have seen that we have been sued by Sanofi, which triggered a 30-month stay on our approval. This 505(b)(2) application includes vials and disposable pens with cartridges. For our part, we'll continue to work on this submission with FDA to bring an interchangeable alternative Glargine to the patients as soon as possible. 
For Europe, the insulin manufacturing facility in Malaysia has been given GMP clearance by EMA, and we continue to have an ongoing and productive interaction with EMA on our application. In addition to the submission in U.S. and Europe, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 41 additional countries. We have already received approval in 6 other countries.
Moving to our Momenta partnership. Our biosimilar of ORENCIA received initial top line results from its Phase I study last week, and unfortunately, it did not meet primary PK endpoints. We are disappointed by these results, and we'll work closely with Momenta to fully analyze the data and determine next steps. Additionally, with respect to our next biosimilar candidate in this partnership, M710, we continue to plan for it to enter clinics in 2018. 
On the respiratory front, you will recall that we have confirmed with FDA that no further clinical or device-related studies are required for our generic Advair program. We have responded to the CRL and continue to work with FDA for this very important product. Also, we are encouraged that FDA is treating this complex product as a high priority. We remain ready from a manufacturing and commercial perspective and are optimistic to bring this very important product to patients as soon as possible.
Our revefenacin collaboration with Theravance Biopharma continues to make progress. And just last week, we announced a presentation to the additional positive efficacy data from the 3-month pivotal Phase III study at 2017 CHEST annual meeting. We are expecting to file this NDA for a novel nebulized LAMA treatment for COPD very shortly. 
If you recall, we announced previously that we have entered into a partnership with 3M for the development of generic version of Symbicort for the U.S. market. We are excited about the progress we are making in the development of this product and are confident that we are on track towards a 2018 ANDA 505(j) submission. Pivotal PK studies are now complete with (b) demonstrated for both low- and high-strength products. 
Regarding our generic form of RESTASIS, we have made good progress on our application. And we believe that we have a product that adheres to the FDA's latest new guidance. Our bridging goal date is December 31 of this year. With this District Court verdict behind us, we look forward to bring this very important product to patients soon. 
In summary, I remain confident that we are poised for future growth with this incredibly unique and durable platform. And I'm excited about the progress we are making within our pipeline, our continued commercial diversification breaking across different channels and geographies and our ability to mean more to our customers around the globe. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tony."
290203,540834470,1355513,"Mylan N.V., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2017",2017-11-06,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning. As Heather and Rajiv commented, the strong global diversified business we have built over the past decade gives us more confidence than ever about our future and our ability to be a key supplier to customers and patient",880,"Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning. As Heather and Rajiv commented, the strong global diversified business we have built over the past decade gives us more confidence than ever about our future and our ability to be a key supplier to customers and patients around the world. Our unique commercial platform is fit to withstand change in our industry and continues to distinguish Mylan as a partner of choice during a time of further customer consolidation and globalization. 
One of the most important drivers behind our confidence is the daily effort made by our commercial team of nearly 7,000 people around the world. Without them, our products wouldn't reach the patients and providers who need them most. We are beginning to reap the rewards of the long-term and significant investments in science and innovation that Rajiv outlined in his remarks with the much anticipated U.S. launch of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as the generic version of the Copaxone 20-milligram. We are particularly pleased with our prescription uptake to date for the 40-milligram strength. 
For the week ending October 27, our share of new prescriptions was 16.2%, and total prescriptions was approximately 8%. We also are encouraged by the number of patients who are utilizing our comprehensive support services through our MS Advocate program. Some of these services include in-home injection trainings with an experienced MS nurse, educational resources and a 24/7 patient support center. We view this launch as a critical opportunity to provide an affordable alternative for patients and payers while still optimizing conversion and delivering value for Mylan. We look forward to successfully commercializing both strengths of this product in other key markets around the world as we receive appropriate regulatory approvals. 
In addition to generic Copaxone in the U.S., we are pleased with the strong performance of some of our global key brands around the world such as Dymista, Dona, Betadine and Elavil. These important products, which were acquired through our Meda transaction, experienced significant growth this quarter and continue to exceed our original expectations. We expect this growth to continue as we leverage our strong commercial infrastructure in key markets like Italy, France, Germany and the emerging and expansion markets.
I'd now like to provide an overview of our regional performances beginning with North America. As anticipated and outlined last quarter, this segment declined about 22% to just under $1.2 billion. Sales of EpiPen declined by $245 million this quarter as the overall market contracted when compared to the robust growth from the same quarter the prior year as well as experiencing additional competition. 
Excluding EpiPen, North America declined 6% as anticipated and as outlined last quarter, primarily due to the impact of significant first-to-market products losing exclusivity over the prior year as well as increased competition. We are still estimating annualized price erosion in the high single digits for the region for 2017.
Despite these challenges, we continue to see momentum and be excited about the future for this region. We've been pleased with the launches of several limited competition products this quarter. Most notably, the launch of Imatinib tablets further strengthen our robust U.S. oncology portfolio, which now contains more than 40 products. This is a very important therapeutic area for Mylan globally, which would be bolstered even further in the coming years with the introduction of several biosimilars to treat cancer. That said, I am pleased to report that the geographic diversity of our platform, which we have been building over the last 10 years, also has been balancing pressure in North America. 
In Europe, sales totaled more than $1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24%. These strong results were due to incremental sales from our Meda acquisition and favorable pricing and volume trends in the region. This includes mid-single-digit organic growth in the region, specifically in some of our largest markets such as France, Italy, Germany, U.K. and the Nordics. 
We also continue to be excited about the stability and performance of our strong brands in the region such as Creon and Influvac as well as new growth from brands like Betadine and Dymista. This quarter's growth from our acquired assets reinforces our confidence that building scale in Europe under our One Mylan approach has us well positioned within the region. 
In our Rest of World segment, sales totaled $740 million, a year-over-year increase of 9% driven primarily by our new Meda assets and strong performance in emerging markets. We are also seeing strong performance from some of our key brands in this region. Amitiza, for instance, delivered robust growth of more than 20% for the quarter in Japan. And we will continue to seek ways to optimize our assets and partnerships in this market. Overall, for the third quarter, we saw as expected global generic price deflation in the mid-single digits, and we continue to anticipate this for the full year 2017. 
In summary, we believe our unique product mix of generics, brands and over-the-counter medications across a range of therapeutic categories and sold in multiple sales channels, combined with an expansive geographic reach and strong commercial platform, position Mylan better than any other company in the industry to serve our customers and deliver better health for patients. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."
290203,540834470,1355513,"Mylan N.V., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2017",2017-11-06,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues in the quarter declined slightly year-over-year to approximately $3 billion. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through our top line result",1074,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues in the quarter declined slightly year-over-year to approximately $3 billion. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through our top line results for Mylan in total and our segments. I'll now take you through the rest of our financial performance, which was in line with our expectations.
In the third quarter, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to approximately 57% in the same period last year. The decline is the result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, primarily EpiPen, partially mitigated by new product introductions and contributions from last year's acquisitions.
Moving on to our operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, R&D was approximately 6% of total revenues, which was in line with our expectations and down slightly from the prior year period due to the timing of clinical activities related primarily to our respiratory programs. 
SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, declined 3% to $586 million or approximately 20% of total revenues and also in line with our expectations. In the quarter, the benefits from our ongoing Mylan integration activities more than offset the incremental SG&A from our Meda acquisition. Our adjusted tax rate was 17.5% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 18%. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. 
Moving on to segment profitability. As a result of the declines in third party sales, including EpiPen, segment profitability in North America declined 27% in the quarter to $576 million. Partially offsetting this decline, segment profitability expanded in the Europe and Rest of World segments, reflecting contributions from the Meda acquisition as well as new product sales. When compared to the prior year period, Europe segment profitability was up 15%, and Rest of World segment profitability was up 16%. Adjusted net earnings in the quarter declined to $590 million, and adjusted diluted EPS declined 20% to $1.10. 
Briefly turning to our results for the 9 months ended September 30. Total revenues increased to approximately $8.7 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of 11%. Acquisitions contributed approximately $1.4 billion in net sales during the 9-month period, and adjusted earnings for the 9 months ended September 30 decreased by $26 million to $1.7 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS decreased 5% to $3.13.
Now turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.1 billion for the 9 months ended September 30 compared to approximately $1.9 billion in the prior year period. Capital expenditures totaled $156 million compared to approximately $240 million in the prior year.
As we said previously, we're fully committed to continuing to deleverage and have demonstrated that by paying down our debt by approximately $1.2 billion in the first 9 months of the year, which includes approximately $420 million in the third quarter. As a result of our continued strong cash flow generation, for the full year, we expect to deliver on our initial cash flow guidance of between $2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow net of our revised capital expenditures range of $300 million to $350 million. 
Our ability to generate strong cash flows reflects the strength and durability of our portfolio, resulting from the decade-long transformation of our business into a global diversified player and is supported by the power of our balance sheet, which provides us with the financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business. 
At the end of Q3 2017, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio as calculated under our credit agreement was 3.6x and was in compliance with our covenant requirements. You may recall that following the Meda acquisition, we elected to increase the leverage ratio covenant as permitted under our credit agreement to 4.25x through the second quarter of 2017. 
Just last week, on November 3, we entered into amendments to the agreements for the 2016 term loans and 2016 revolving facility to extend the leverage ratio covenant of 4.25x through the December 31, 2018, reporting period. These amendments provide us with the additional financial flexibility as we manage our capital structure during 2018. This does not change in any way our commitment to our deleveraging strategy or maintaining our investment-grade credit rating as we continue to work towards our long-term average debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3.0x.
Moving on to the revised guidance. Primarily due to the approval and subsequent launch of generic Copaxone in the U.S. market, we've increased the low end of both our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS 2017 guidance ranges. Our revised total revenue guidance range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full year 2016.
Our new adjusted EPS guidance range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share. That's a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. This year-over-year decline reflects the ongoing North America generic business dynamics as well as the more than $500 million impact from the rebasing of our EpiPen brand. 
Moving to 2018. As Heather mentioned, we're continuing to target at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS, which is an increase of more than 18% from the midpoint of our new guidance range for 2017. This target factors in the launch of generic Copaxone as well as the deferred launches of complex products from 2017, including generic Advair. It also includes incremental savings from integration activities and cost actions, continued growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments as well as the continuation of a challenging North American environment. We'll provide further details of our 2018 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Before I turn it over to Q&A, I urge all of you to take a closer look at the Built to Last presentation that Heather spoke about earlier and which is posted on our website this morning. We're very proud of the business that we've built over the last decade, and this presentation highlights our transformational journey as well as the path we plan to take to fully realize the value transformation and our differentiated portfolio. We believe that our differentiated business model, our performance and our stable, durable cash flow generation are not yet reflected in our stock price valuation.
With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

I think all the weaknesses you just laid out are all primarily U.S.-driven. And as we continue to show, both from our European as well as our Rest of World segment, our ability to continue to grow at double digit in the case of Europe and high single-digit in Rest of World, that as we continue to leverage our assets, our products in these areas and continue to bring complex generics as we'll be launching Copaxone throughout Europe, I think those are very important to telling the story of how we're continuing to be able to absorb the volatility in this U.S. Generics market and which is why I made the commentary that -- just to remind everyone that we moved out of the neighborhood of just U.S. Generics and Specialty and into this global community that's helping us absorb that. And the Mylan that we've built today is able to continue to deliver and on our growth profile as we continue to bring these products to market. As far as the U.S. Generics, we continue to see those headwinds are going to continue for the foreseeable future. But I think again, the dynamics of our portfolio of the products we're launching, Rajiv spoke of the multiple injectable products we've launched and the [ 70 ] that are in our pipeline. So the durability again of what we are launching from complex to injectables as well as continuing to deliver on our outside of the U.S. platform is what's able to give us the confidence to say that at least [5 40 ] next year given all those things you just mentioned, taking into consideration. So what I would say is just again the message of the durability of our platform and our ability to absorb the volatility, which we believe really distinguishes us from our peers."

We've been together a decade as we've continued to not only manage at the peaks but in the valleys. And I think that's where you see a management team that has had a strategy out there. We've executed to it. We've continued to navigate the waters, I think, better than anybody else out there. So hopefully, that differentiation is what continues to put investors at ease with not only the credibility we've now hopefully amassed on a scientific side, but also just being able to continue to maximize this global platform and absorb what the industry is going through here in the U.S."

We did say and I did say in this call that we've asked and obtained an extension from our banks at 4.25 for the balance of 2017 and 2018, and that doesn't mean we're not committed to continuing to delever. But it actually speaks to the strength of our cash flows, and we talked about that a lot during the call today as well as the fact that as Heather said, in this environment, there are assets out in the marketplace that we just are going to continue to take a look at for potential bolt-on opportunities. And the banking group supports us, and that's why we have continued to delever but have asked for that extension at 4.25. So there is a little bit of flexibility in our financial decision there but, obviously, with the discipline that over the long term, we target a 3.0x EBITDA leverage ratio number."

And I don't believe that's rooted or grounded in governance. I think that as we continue to have shareholder meetings and certainly stay open-minded and have these discussions, again what I can say is we look at companies out there around the globe with a whole host of governance issues from family-owned to a whole wide array of how they're on the public markets. We really believe it's the fundamentals that should drive that valuation. And we believe that the shareholder outreach program is going to go a long way to help rebase and have honestly us get credit of the company we've built over the last decade and believe that we've got a real strong lead ahead of anybody else out there and have a real opportunity to really be the bellwether of this industry."
