Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. I'm delighted that Tiffany's Chairman of the Board and interim CEO, Mike Kowalski; and our CFO, Mark Erceg, are on today's call. We'll review actual results and comments on the 2017 outlook and then we'll allow time to answer some questions. 
Before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation. 
Okay. By now, I hope you've had a chance to read today's news release, which indicated fourth quarter and full year results that were in line with the guidance that we provided in January and reaffirmed last month. Worldwide net sales rose slightly in the fourth quarter and earnings per diluted share declined slightly. For the full year, worldwide net sales declined 3%, diluted EPS declined 1% on a GAAP basis and 2% when excluding charges in both years, and we managed our balance sheet effectively generating strong cash flow in the year. 
So let's review the results starting with the top line. First, there were no meaningful changes in regional sales mix in 2016, with the Americas representing 46% of worldwide sales, Asia-Pacific at 25%, Japan at 15% and Europe at 11%. In the Americas, total sales and comparable store sales declined in both the fourth quarter of the year as a result of lower jewelry units sold. In the U.S., we experienced softness across most of the countries for the year although at lesser rates in some stores as the year progressed. In addition to the full year, sales weakness in Canada was partly offset by growth in Latin America. We attributed a portion of the softness in the U.S. throughout the year to local customers which we believe was tied to macro, market and political uncertainties. Sales attributed to foreign visitors decline in the full year which we attribute to lower spending by Chinese visitors, but we believe total sales benefited in the second half of the year due to increased spending by Japanese tourists. We estimate that U.S. sales in 2016 to foreign tourists remained at approximately 20%. 
We've previously spoken about the impact of postelection activities near our New York flagship store, which represents less than 10% of worldwide sales. While we typically do not discuss individual store results, we are, for at least this quarter, reporting its sales results because of the unique situation and level of investor interest. Sales in the New York flagship declined 11% in the full year and 7% in the entire fourth quarter versus the 14% decline in the November, December holiday period due to some large transactions in January. In addition, we estimate spending by foreign tourists in that store remained at roughly 40% of its annual sales. 
Elsewhere during 2016, we opened one store in Canada in the department store in Toronto, relocated our store in Vancouver and relocated our store in King of Prussia mall outside Philadelphia. Of course, we also continued to renovate many stores, highlighted by magnificent upgrades to our stores in Beverly Hills and San Francisco. 
Turning to Asia-Pacific. While total sales were roughly unchanged in the year, we were pleased to see a healthy rate of growth in the second half and fourth quarter that was generated by increases in jewelry units sold. During the year, we were very pleased with strong total and comparable store sales growth in Mainland China as we believe the Tiffany & Co. brand continues to gain recognition and prominence with customers. I should add that lower spending that we attributed to Chinese tourists in other regions in 2016 may have led to some of the higher spending that we saw by local consumers within China. 
Also in the Greater China market, we were pleased to see smaller sequential sales declines in Hong Kong as the year progressed. However, there was noteworthy softness in much of the year in Australia and Taiwan. 
We significantly enhanced our store presence in Asia-Pacific in 2016. We opened 7 stores, relocated 2 and closed 3. In China, we opened 3 stores in Ningbo Heyi, in Tianjin Hisense and in, and we closed 2 stores, one in Beijing in the Peninsula Hotel and one at the Tianjin Friendship store. We finished the year with 31 stores in Mainland China. 
In addition, we opened our 15th store in Korea in the Shinsegae Hanam department store. We opened our first store in New Zealand in Auckland's magnificent Britomart precinct. And we opened 2 stores in Australia, one in the Gold Coast Pacific Fair and one in the Sydney airport. In Singapore, we relocated our store at Changi Airport and closed our store in Raffles Hotel. 
In Japan, we achieved healthy retail sales growth in 2016 even excluding the favorable translation benefit from the stronger yen and finished the year on a strong note. We were pleased to have an increased in jewelry units sold in the fourth quarter and full year in Japan that span most categories. Anecdotally, we believe our already strong presence in Japan further benefited from the brand exposure we received on a popular television show called For The Romantic which aired in the July-September time frame. In addition, we believe that the stronger yen has been a factor contributing to the increased purchasing attributed to Japanese tourists that we've experienced in other regions. Conversely, that stronger yen has likely been the reason for less tourist spending in Japan, primarily attributed to Chinese visitors, would converse the trend we saw in 2015. However, we believe our sales in Japan are made largely by Japanese customers and we continue to estimate that spending by foreign tourists represented less than 10% of sales in Japan. Lastly in Japan, we had a net reduction of 1 store in 2016 as we closed the store in the Takashimaya department store, while we relocated 2 stores during the year in Nagoya and Kagoshima. 
Conversely, it was a challenging year in Europe. Total sales declined on a reported basis in the fourth quarter and full year, primarily reflecting weakening European currencies. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined to a lesser extent in the year and actually rose slightly in the fourth quarter. The sales weakness arose largely from lower jewelry unit volume across all categories. Throughout the year, we experienced varying degrees of soft demands, partly attributed to local customers that we believe is the result of economic and political conditions and also attributed to lower spending by foreign tourists likely tied to the effects of the tragic events in Paris and elsewhere. We estimate that spending attributed to foreign tourists generally represents in the neighborhood of 1/4 to 1/3 of total European sales. In both the fourth quarter and the full year, results were soft across much of Continental Europe, while sales on a constant exchange rate basis in the U.K., which represents roughly 40% of European sales -- sales rose in the U.K. which represents about 40% of European sales. In fact, we believe the sales lift that we saw in the U.K. in the second half of the year was from spending attributed to foreign tourists after the British pound declined following the Brexit vote. We opened 3 stores in Europe in 2016 including 2 in Italy on Rome's Condotti and in Venice and a second store in Amsterdam in the BM Court department store, and we closed a small store at the Frankfurt airport. 
I commented several times on the significant spending attributed to foreign tourists in most regions. In general, tourism flows up from one region to another may be affected by changes in currency values as well as geopolitical and other external factors. Therefore, we believe that creating and reinforcing local and global brand recognition is most relevant to growing our business regardless of where the spending might occur in the short term. Lastly, lower sales in our other segment in both fourth quarter and full year resulted from comp store sales declines in our 5 stores in the United Arab Emirates. Also sales increased in the full year but were roughly unchanged in the fourth quarter. In terms of store productivity, worldwide gross sales per gross square foot for company-operated stores was $2,700 in 2016 compared with $2,900 in 2015, resulting from the 3% increase in worldwide gross square footage and the modest worldwide sales decline. By region, sales productivity in 2016 ranged from $3,800 in Asia-Pacific to $3,700 in Japan to $2,500 in Europe and to $2,200 in the Americas. Keep in mind that these productivity levels are calculated in US dollars, and therefore, year-to-year differences also reflect foreign currency changes. 
Our strategies partly revolve Art Deco optimizing our worldwide store base through openings, relocations and renovations and closings. We expect this to result in an increase in global square footage by approximately 2% a year for the foreseeable future. This initiative goes hand in hand with our strategy to more proactively reach customers to deliver more engaging shopping experience, to deepen long-term relationships with customers and, ultimately, to increase the frequency of store visits and conversion rates. 
Beyond the Tiffany & Co. stores we operate in 28 countries, we also serve customers through e-commerce-enabled websites in 13 of those countries. Worldwide e-commerce sales were approximately unchanged in the year and continued to represent 6% of Tiffany's worldwide sales but were a somewhat higher percentage in the U.S. alone. As we've said many times, our website serves an important dual function of generating online sales but also delivering marketing communication that drives awareness and store traffic. That covers regional sales results. 
Looking at the product side, from a sales perspective, trends indicated general softness across all jewelry categories to varying degrees. Despite that, there were some noteworthy product-related highlights in 2016. During the year, we introduced some new designs, refreshed some existing collections and, importantly, have said that we intend to accelerate the pace of newness going forward. The relative improvements that we've seen in fashion jewelry sales can be attributed to higher gold jewelry sales, exemplified by the T Collection which we have continued to build upon with new designs. We also saw relative improvement in fashion silver jewelry in 2016, led by the popularity of the new Return to Tiffany Love collection with silver jewelry sales approaching stabilization after years of decline. We focused on product newness in silver jewelry in 2016 and grew the number of new items under $500 by more than 10%. 
I should also mention success in our designer jewelry category which we are now disclosing on its own, driven by Elsa Peretti's jewelry collections highlighted in 2016 by her exquisite Diamonds by the Yard and the open heart designs and the designs of Paloma Picasso, highlighted by her popular Olive Leaf and her new Paloma's Melody collection. 
Engagement jewelry and wedding bands category posted mixed sales performance by region during the year, although we were pleased to see unit volume growth in the quarter and the full year on a worldwide basis. Relatively speaking, the softness product category was high fine and solitaire jewelry. We continue to be pleased with the success of our Victoria collections in platinum and diamonds. However, there was some softness at the highest end of this category. We had held our Blue Book event this spring attended by a global audience as we do every year, and the results, while strong, did not measure up to the huge success of those events in the prior 2 years. You should note that the term high jewelry now replaces the former term, statement jewelry. 
Lastly, I'll just mention that we continue to see healthy sales growth in the watch category in 2016. While watch sales have grown, albeit off at a low single-digit percentage of sales base, we see considerable opportunity over the longer term to expand that business through a combination of product development and marketing communication. 
That covers the top line review. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg."
35576,421618126,1159241,"Tiffany & Co., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 17, 2017",2017-03-17,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and welcome, everyone. Let me start by stating that while fourth quarter and full year GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share both were in line with our expectations, Tiffany's financial performance over the past couple of years has be",1401,"Thanks, Mark, and welcome, everyone. Let me start by stating that while fourth quarter and full year GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share both were in line with our expectations, Tiffany's financial performance over the past couple of years has been disappointing which is why I'm so pleased to be working with Mike Kowalski, the board and all Tiffany's dedicated and talented employees to accelerate the execution of our key strategies in the years ahead. 
One of those strategies is expanding our e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities which require us to upgrade certain IT systems. So I want to briefly comment on the $25.4 million impairment of capitalized software development costs we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016. Simply put, as part of the comprehensive system review, we identified a solution which negated the need to install a separate inventory management and merchandising system which work had already begun on. By further leveraging our existing ERP system and in order management system we were in the process of implementing, we expect to be able to access the full range of capabilities we originally seeking but at a lower cost. This project, now that it has been recast, along with the rapid investments we are making information systems, will we believe make our supply chain more efficient, improve the customers' in-store experience and generate incremental sales by expanding and leveraging both our CRM and omnichannel capabilities. 
Let's now look at the rest of income statement. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.1% which was up 110 basis points versus a year ago. In fact, gross margin increased year-over-year in every quarter as we benefited from favorable product input costs, 2015 pricing actions which carried over into 2016 and a favorable shift in product sales mix. For the full year, gross margin was 62.2% versus 60.7% last year, but unfortunately, the 150 basis points of gross margin expansion generated during 2016 was more than offset by increases in SG&A expense. SG&A expense as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter was 43.2%, up 170 basis points versus a year ago, and for the year, it was 44.2% which was up 200 basis points. The increases in SG&A expense as a percent of sales reflected sales deleveraging due to higher store occupancy and depreciation costs as well as higher labor and incentive compensation costs. Lowering the rate of SG&A expense growth as a percent of sales remains a top priority for the company going forward. 
Marketing spending as a percent of sales was roughly unchanged from the prior year. We continue to broaden Tiffany's presence in a variety of media and, as an example, appeared on television in February for our first Super Bowl commercial. The 62nd ad, which ran 10 key markets, featured Lady Gaga in order to set the stage for our new hardware jewelry collection which is launching next month. 
Net interest and other expenses in the fourth quarter and for the full year were below prior year due to both reduced foreign currency transactional losses and lower interest expense. Tiffany's full year effective tax rate was 34.1% which was down from last year's rate of 34.7% due to the favorable impact from the conclusion of a tax examination in the first quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. We finished the year with reasonable debt levels and generated strong cash flow, both of which gives us the ability to continue investing in our business while also returning excess cash to shareholders. Inventory finished the year 3% below a year ago at $2.2 billion. Accounts receivable at January 31 were 10% higher than the previous year-end with the increase partly tied to the timing of collections driven by sales growth in Japan since the majority of our stores' net market are operated within department stores. A portion of the increase was also currency-related. 
Capital expenditures for the year came in at $223 million with more than half of the spending related to the opening, renovation and/or relocation of stores. CapEx represented approximately 6% of worldwide sales during both 2016 and 2015. It's also worth pointing out that we made an unplanned and voluntary contribution of $120 million to Tiffany's U.S. pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect this to lower our 2017 pension expense as a result of incremental returns expected to be generated on the investments made with that contribution and lower premiums owed to the PBGC. Putting it all together we generated $702 million of operating cash flow and $479 million of free cash flow in 2016 after giving effect to the $120 million voluntary pension contribution. Importantly, this was well above our initial goal of generating at least $400 of free cash flow for the year. In terms of share repurchases, we spent $184 million and bought more than 2 million shares in 2016. 
Turning to dividends. We increased the quarterly dividend by 12.5% in May which marked the 15th dividend increase in the past 14 years. We finished fiscal 2016 with $986 million of cash and short-term investments versus $1.1 billion of short-term and long-term debt, so total debt representing just 37% of stockholders' equity which was unchanged from the prior year. Tiffany's return on assets was 9% and return on stockholders' equity was 15%, both of which are generally consistent with our long-term objectives which call for a return of assets of at least 10% and a return on equity of at least 15%. 
Looking into 2017, our financial expectations recognize 2 import external challenges. First, we remain mindful of economic and geopolitical uncertainties and their potential effects on both local and foreign tourist spending. Second, since over half our sales continue to be outside the United States and we expect the U.S. dollar to be stronger on average than the prior year, we should be facing a sizable headwind in terms of translating our non-U.S. sales into dollars. In addition, we'll have to overcome the negative effect of stronger dollar they have on foreign tourists spending in the United States. Of course, we do openly acknowledge that we will partly benefit from the translation effect of non-U.S. expenses into dollars, but that positive impact is expected to be relatively minor compared to the 2 foreign exchange headwinds I just mentioned. We plan to open 11 stores in 2017, half in Asia-Pacific, relocate 9 and close, 6 representing a net 3% increase in global square footage. As part of our strategy to optimize the global store base, we will also continue to renovate some over existing stores. With this in mind, we expect total sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year which, importantly, translates into a mid-single-digit increase over the prior year on a constant exchange rate basis. 
Moving further into the P&L. Our 2017 outlook assumes an increase in operating margin entirely due to an increase in gross margin, with SG&A expense growth just slightly higher than sales growth. The assumption of a higher gross margin is tied to favorable product input costs and proactive expense management. In addition, after not taking any meaningful price increases in 2016, except for currency changes, we took modest price increases in the past month that vary by country but average out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis. Our 2017 outlook further assumes interest and other expense in of approximately $40 million, an effective tax rate consistent with the prior year and that we continue buying shares under our existing share repurchase program, although we expect minimal benefit to diluted earnings per share from the currently planned repurchases. 
Taking all this into account, our outlook falls for net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single-digit percentage from last year's $3.55 per share on a GAAP basis and to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage over the adjusted $3.75 per share last year. We also plan to manage the balance sheet efficiently with a particular focus on not growing net inventories in order to generate net cash from operating activities of approximately $700 million and free cash flow of approximately $450 million for the full year. The difference of $250 million represents our plans on capital expenditures. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike Kowalski for some brief comments before we open the call to your questions."

I just want to address a few matters and then we'll be happy to take your questions. First, we began an external search in early February to fill the role of Chief Executive Officer when Frederic Cumenal stepped down from that position and I agreed to become interim CEO. We assumed that it may take time to find the right person with broad experience and brand management with a global perspective and who possess the strong leadership skills to motivate and inspire our Tiffany colleagues around the world. 
Second, although Tiffany in the luxury industry faced numerous macro challenges in 2016, we have not been pleased with our financial performance. While we were able to realize important improvement in gross margin and generate a healthy level of free cash flow, sales results were disappointing and we were unable to generate sales leverage on our fixed costs. 
Third, and most importantly, we believe that Tiffany has a set of powerful strategies that can propel our business forward in the long term. With the right leadership and pace of execution, we believe there are substantial opportunities to grow our business. Specifically, we are focused on increasing the rate of new product introductions and innovations and we recently announced the hiring of Reed Krakoff to serve as Chief Artistic Officer. We're also focused on maximizing our marketing effectiveness and building stronger relationships with customers, optimizing our store network and improving our business operations and processes all while effectively managing our capital and costs. And we remain absolutely committed to our industry-leading effort through our corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability, an area of great importance and relevance to us and, we believe, to our customers as well. In essence, we are committed to executing with excellence the strategies that are within our control and pursuing long-term growth opportunities. 
This May 5, we'll mark the 30th anniversary of Tiffany's initial public offering in 1987. Since then, our company has generally produced strong returns for shareholders, and we intend to pursue opportunities that can continue to generate attractive total shareholder returns in the future. 
In my role as interim CEO, I have been actively engaged with the management teams and employees across our business, and I have no doubt that my colleagues at all levels share an extraordinary sense of dedication and passion for our company.

A lot of this is just basic blocking and tackling. We have a global procurement group that's relatively early in its formation which are doing simply good work. We have to get our arms around those global spend goals where we will negotiate harder and better with more visibility and more impact. That's the key initiative I mentioned earlier the jewelry design center. I don't want to overplay it, but I certainly don't want to undersell it either, the new fast prototyping on the idea and that Reed and his team are generating is going to put as well down the path of being able to design for efficiency in all of our internal processes. And frankly, it will also allow us for those items that we do choose put up to external bid be a lot tighter in that process as well. Clearly, the systems that we have available to us today are going to be optimized in the years ahead, and that's going to allow us to do better assortment planning. With better assortment planning, we'll be better to do more high level analytics that goes along with that. We'll be able to get pricing in a lot more discrete ways and we're going to be able to make sure that each store we have the right product at the right time or as much as practical versus what we have today. We have several pretty exciting initiatives all earmarked in that regard. The planned structure, as I indicated earlier, is also doing a lot of really good work to cross-train so that we have the ability to do multiple operation multiple sites, and that's allowing us to extract a lot more value. And we're starting to play with some different technologies as well, which we think over time leads to some additional productivity gains. SO there's a broad-based back to the things that we're aggressively pursuing.

As I think everyone on the call knows, part of the magic of Tiffany over the very, very many years has been our ability to balance that -- those categories and to move forward with them all simultaneously. Critical to that has always been our ability to drive lower price point sales because of the very favorable margin profile of that category. And once again, as you've heard before, we've stabilized that segment. We also feel very good about the fashion segment gold -- the fashion part of the segment. And once again, due to the entire mix, that also has favorable gross margin profile.

And of course, as we've said now many times on the phone, we have the work in progress on watches which we're pleased with and, of course, the upcoming gift collection which also should be additive incremental to gross margin.

Kind of any further color on how you're thinking about that, either from a SKU perspective or an actual category perspective? Because when I look historically about over the last 17 years or at least over the last 10, you guys had done a great job when you announced Tiffany T Collection, the keys collection, the marketing around the Celebration Rings? So when you basically come out with the new category, it does very well. And I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about launching new collections and versus launching just additional SKUs within existing collections. And then lastly, around SKU count, do you think about increasing gross SKU counts but basically leaving net SKU counts flat to increase SKU count productivity? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you think this all plays out from a product newness perspective."

So probably more or less, your suggestion that, combined with the pace of new product introductions, an increased pace of new product, new collection introductions, net SKU count probably will stay where it is. It might even need to decline a bit. But the key will be building -- growth is going to come from a combination of one new collection. And if you look at the evolution of our assortment over the past 10 years, far more concentrated today in important collections than it was 10 years ago in multiple smaller collections. So we want new collections but they have to be big and they need to be impactful. And of course, Tiffany T is -- would be the model -- one of the models going forward for that. At the same time, we need to be mindful that existing collections Return to Tiffany Love, they have to be renewed and we have to continue to animate and increase and inject energy into those. So it's going to be, as it always is, a very careful balance of making sure that we have significant new collections that marketing can drive at the same time making sure that the core collections that are still the -- that will always be the majority of sales continue to grow at the same time. So it's a complex balancing act."

Before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation. 
Okay. By now, I hope you've had a chance to read today's news release, which indicated fourth quarter and full year results that were in line with the guidance that we've provided in January and reaffirmed last month. Worldwide net sales rose slightly in the fourth quarter, and earnings per diluted share declined slightly. For the full year, worldwide net sales declined 3%, diluted EPS declined 1% on a GAAP basis and 2% when excluding charges in both years. And we managed our balance sheet effectively generating strong cash flow in the year. 
So let's review the results starting with the top line. First, there were no meaningful changes in regional sales mix in 2016 with the Americas representing 46% of worldwide sales, Asia Pacific at 25%, Japan at 15% and Europe at 11%. In the Americas, total sales and comparable store sales declined in both the fourth quarter and the year as a result of lower jewelry units sold. In the U.S., we experienced softness across most of the country for the year, although at lesser rates in some stores as the year progressed. 
In addition to the full year, sales weakness in Canada was partly offset by growth in Latin America. We attributed a portion of the softness in the U.S. throughout the year to local customers, which, we believe, was tied to macro, market and political uncertainties. Sales attributed to foreign visitors declined in the full year, which we attribute to lower spending by Chinese visitors. But we believe total sales benefited in the second half of the year due to increased spending by Japanese tourists. We estimate that U.S. sales in 2016 to foreign tourists remained at approximately 20%. 
We've previously spoken about the impact of postelection activities near our New York flagship store, which represents less than 10% of worldwide sales. While we typically do not discuss individual store results, we are, for at least this quarter, reporting its sales results because of the unique situation and level of investor interest. Sales in the New York flagship declined 11% in the full year and 7% in the entire fourth quarter versus the 14% decline in the November, December holiday period due to some large transactions in January. In addition, we estimate spending by foreign tourists in that store remained at roughly 40% of its annual sales. 
Elsewhere during 2016, we opened one store in Canada in the Holt-Renfrew department store in Toronto, relocated our store in the Holt-Renfrew in Vancouver and relocated our store in the King of Prussia mall outside Philadelphia. Of course, we also continued to renovate many stores, highlighted by magnificent upgrades to our stores in Beverly Hills and San Francisco. 
Turning to Asia Pacific. While total sales were roughly unchanged in the year, we were pleased to see a healthy rate of growth in the second half and fourth quarter that was generated by increases in jewelry units sold. During the year, we were very pleased with strong total and comparable store sales growth in Mainland China as we believe the Tiffany & Co. brand continues to gain recognition and prominence with customers. I should add that lower spending that we attributed to Chinese tourists in other regions in 2016 may have led to some of the higher spending that we saw by local consumers within China. 
Also in the Greater China market, we were pleased to see smaller sequential sales declines in Hong Kong as the year progressed. However, there was noteworthy softness in much of the year in Australia and Taiwan. 
We significantly enhanced our store presence in Asia Pacific in 2016. We opened 7 stores, relocated 2 and closed 3. In China, we opened 3 stores in Ningbo-Heyi, in Tianjin-Hisense and in Shenyang MixC. And we closed 2 stores, one in Beijing in the Peninsula Hotel and one in the Tianjin Friendship store. We finished the year with 31 stores in Mainland China. 
In addition, we opened our 15th store in Korea in the Shinsegae Hanam department store. We opened our first store in New Zealand in Auckland's magnificent Britomart Precinct. And we opened 2 stores in Australia, one in the Gold Coast Pacific Fair and one in the Sydney Airport. In Singapore, we relocated our store at Changi Airport and closed our store in Raffles Hotel. 
In Japan, we achieved healthy retail sales growth in 2016 even excluding the favorable translation benefit from the stronger yen and finished the year on a strong note. We were pleased to have an increase in jewelry units sold in the fourth quarter and full year in Japan that spanned most categories. Anecdotally, we believe our already strong presence in Japan further benefited from the brand exposure we received on a popular television show called For The Romantic, which aired in the July-September time frame. In addition, we believe that the stronger yen has been a factor contributing to the increased purchasing attributed to Japanese tourists that we've experienced in other regions. Conversely, that stronger yen has likely been the reason for less tourist spending in Japan, primarily attributed to Chinese visitors, which reversed the trend we saw in 2015. However, we believe our sales in Japan are made largely by Japanese customers, and we continue to estimate that spending by foreign tourists represented less than 10% of sales in Japan. Lastly in Japan, we had a net reduction of one store in 2016 as we closed the store in the Takashimaya department store in Yonago, while we relocated 2 stores during the year in Nagoya and Kagoshima. 
Conversely, it was a challenging year in Europe. Total sales declined on a reported basis in the fourth quarter and full year, partly reflecting weakening European currencies. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined to a lesser extent in the year and actually rose slightly in the fourth quarter. The sales weakness arose largely from lower jewelry unit volume across all categories. Throughout the year, we experienced varying degrees of soft demands, partly attributed to local customers that, we believe, is the result of economic and political conditions and also attributed to lower spending by foreign tourists, likely tied to the effects of the tragic events in Paris and elsewhere. We estimate that spending attributed to foreign tourists generally represents in the neighborhood of 1/4 to 1/3 of total European sales. In both the fourth quarter and the full year, results were soft across much of Continental Europe, while sales on a constant exchange rate basis in the U.K., which represents roughly 40% of European sales -- sales rose in the U.K. which represents about 40% of European sales. In fact, we believe the sales lift that we saw in the U.K. in the second half of the year was from spending attributed to foreign tourists after the British pound declined following the Brexit vote. We opened 3 stores in Europe in 2016, including 2 in Italy on Rome's Via dei Condotti and in Venice, and a second store in Amsterdam in De Bijenkorf department store. And we closed a small store in the Frankfurt Airport. 
I commented several times on the significant spending attributed to foreign tourists in most regions. In general, tourism flows up from one region to another may be affected by changes in currency values as well as geopolitical and other external factors. Therefore, we believe that creating and reinforcing local and global brand recognition is most relevant to growing our business regardless of where the spending might occur in the short term. 
Lastly, lower sales in our other segment in both the fourth quarter and full year resulted from comp store sales declines in our 5 stores in the United Arab Emirates. Wholesale sales of diamonds increased in the full year, but were roughly unchanged in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of store productivity, worldwide gross -- worldwide sales per gross square foot for company-operated stores was $2,700 in 2016 compared with $2,900 in 2015, resulting from the 3% increase in worldwide gross square footage and a modest worldwide sales decline. By region, sales productivity in 2016 ranged from $3,800 in Asia Pacific to $3,700 in Japan to $2,500 in Europe and to $2,200 in the Americas. Keep in mind that these productivity levels are calculated in U.S. dollars. And therefore, year-to-year differences also reflect foreign currency changes. 
Our strategies partly revolve around optimizing our worldwide store base through openings, relocations, renovations and closings. We expect this to result in increasing global square footage by approximately 2% a year for the foreseeable future. This initiative goes hand in hand with our strategy to more proactively reach customers to deliver a more engaging shopping experience, to deepen long-term relationships with customers and, ultimately, to increase the frequency of store visits and conversion rates. 
Beyond the Tiffany & Co. stores we operate in 28 countries, we also serve customers through e-commerce-enabled websites in 13 of those countries. Worldwide e-commerce sales were approximately unchanged in the year and continued to represent 6% of Tiffany's worldwide sales, but were somewhat higher percentage in the U.S. alone. As we've said many times, our website serves an important dual function of generating online sales, but also in delivering marketing communication that drives awareness and store traffic. That covers regional sales results. 
Looking at the product side. From a sales perspective, trends indicated general softness across all jewelry categories to varying degrees. Despite that, there were some noteworthy product-related highlights in 2016. During the year, we introduced some new designs, refreshed some existing collections and, importantly, have said that we intend to accelerate the pace of newness going forward. Relative improvements that we've seen in fashion jewelry sales can be attributed to higher gold jewelry sales, exemplified by the T collection, which we have continued to build upon with new designs. We also saw a relative improvement in fashion silver jewelry in 2016, led by the popularity of the new Return to Tiffany Love collection with silver jewelry sales approaching stabilization after years of decline. We focused on product newness in silver jewelry in 2016 and grew the number of new items under $500 by more than 10%. 
I should also mention success in our designer jewelry category, which we are now disclosing on its own, driven by Elsa Peretti's jewelry collections highlighted in 2016 by her exquisite Diamonds by the Yard and the open heart designs and the designs of Paloma Picasso, highlighted by her popular Olive Leaf and her new Paloma's Melody collection. 
Engagement jewelry and wedding bands category posted mixed sales performance by region during the year, although we were pleased to see unit volume growth in the quarter and the full year on a worldwide basis. Relatively speaking, the softness product category was high fine and solitaire jewelry. We continue to be pleased with the success of our Victoria collections in platinum and diamonds. However, there was some softness at the highest end of this category. We had held our Blue Book event this spring attended by a global audience as we do every year. And the results, while strong, did not measure up to the huge success of those events in the prior 2 years. You should note that the term high jewelry now replaces the former term statement jewelry. 
Lastly, I'll just mention that we continue to see healthy sales growth in the watch category in 2016. While watch sales have grown, albeit off at a low single-digit percentage of sales base, we see considerable opportunity over the longer term to expand that business through a combination of product development and marketing communications.
That covers the top line review. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg."
35576,421618126,1159371,"Tiffany & Co., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 17, 2017",2017-03-17,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and welcome, everyone. Let me start by stating that while fourth quarter and full year GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share both were in line with our expectations, Tiffany's financial performance over the past couple of years has be",1410,"Thanks, Mark, and welcome, everyone. Let me start by stating that while fourth quarter and full year GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share both were in line with our expectations, Tiffany's financial performance over the past couple of years has been disappointing, which is why I'm so pleased to be working with Mike Kowalski, the board and all Tiffany's dedicated and talented employees to accelerate the execution of our key strategies in the years ahead. 
One of those strategies is expanding our e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, which require us to upgrade certain IT systems. So I want to briefly comment on the $25.4 million impairment of capitalized software development costs we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016. Simply put, as part of a comprehensive system review, we identified a solution, which negated the need to install a separate inventory management and merchandising system, which work had already begun on. By further leveraging our existing ERP system and in order management system we were in the process of implementing, we expect to be able to access the full range of capabilities we are originally seeking, but at a lower cost. This project, now that it has been recast, along with the rapid investments we are making in information systems will, we believe, make our supply chain more efficient, improve the customers' in-store experience and generate incremental sales by expanding and leveraging both our CRM and omnichannel capabilities. 
Let's now look at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.1%, which was up 110 basis points versus a year ago. In fact, gross margin increased year-over-year in every quarter as we benefited from favorable product input costs, 2015 pricing actions, which carried over into 2016 and a favorable shift in product sales mix. For the full year, gross margin was 62.2% versus 60.7% last year. But unfortunately, the 150 basis points of gross margin expansion generated during 2016 was more than offset by increases in SG&A expense. SG&A expense as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter was 43.2%, up 170 basis points versus a year ago. And for the year, it was 44.2%, which was up 200 basis points. The increases in SG&A expense as a percent of sales reflected sales deleveraging due to higher store occupancy and depreciation costs as well as higher labor and incentive compensation costs. Lowering the rate of SG&A expense growth as a percent of sales remains a top priority for the company going forward. 
Marketing spending as a percent of sales was roughly unchanged from the prior year. We continue to broaden Tiffany's presence in a variety of media and, as an example, appeared on television in February with our first Super Bowl commercial. The 62nd ad, which ran 10 key markets, featured Lady Gaga in order to set the stage for our new hardware jewelry collection, which is launching next month. 
Net interest and other expenses in the fourth quarter and for the full year were below prior year due to both reduced foreign currency transaction losses and lower interest expense. Tiffany's full year effective tax rate was 34.1%, which was down from last year's rate of 34.7% due to the favorable impact from the conclusion of a tax examination in the first quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. We finished the year with reasonable debt levels and generated strong cash flow, both of which gives us the ability to continue investing in our business while also returning excess cash to shareholders. Inventory finished the year 3% below a year ago at $2.2 billion. Accounts receivable at January 31 were 10% higher than the previous year-end with the increase partly tied to the timing of collections driven by sales growth in Japan since the majority of our stores' net market are operated within department stores. A portion of the increase was also currency related. 
Capital expenditures for the year came in at $223 million with more than half of the spending related to the opening, renovation and/or relocation of stores. CapEx represented approximately 6% of worldwide sales during both 2016 and 2015. 
It's also worth pointing out that we made an unplanned and voluntary contribution of $120 million to Tiffany's U.S. pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect this to lower our 2017 pension expense as a result of incremental returns expected to be generated on the investments made with that contribution and lower premiums owed to the PBGC. 
Putting it all together we generated $702 million of operating cash flow and $479 million of free cash flow in 2016 after giving effect to the $120 million voluntary pension contribution. Importantly, this was well above our initial goal of generating at least $400 million [ph] of free cash flow for the year. In terms of share repurchases, we spent $184 million and bought more than 2 million shares in 2016. 
Turning to dividends. We increased the quarterly dividend by 12.5% in May, which marked the 15th dividend increase in the past 14 years. We finished fiscal 2016 with $986 million of cash and short-term investments versus $1.1 billion of short-term and long-term debt. So total debt represented just 37% of stockholders' equity, which was unchanged from the prior year. Tiffany's return on assets was 9% and return on stockholders' equity was 15%, both of which are generally consistent with our long-term objectives, which call for a return on assets of at least 10% and a return on equity of at least 15%. 
Looking into 2017. Our financial expectations recognize 2 import external challenges. First, we remain mindful of economic and geopolitical uncertainties, and their potential effects on both local and forest -- foreign tourist spending. Second, since over half our sales continue to be outside the United States, and we expect the U.S. dollar to be stronger on average than the prior year, we should be facing a sizable headwind in terms of translating our non-U.S. sales into dollars. In addition, we'll have to overcome the negative effect of stronger dollar we have on foreign tourists spending in the United States. Of course, we do openly acknowledge that we will partly benefit from the translation effect of non-U.S. expenses into dollars, but that positive impact is expected to be relatively minor compared to the 2 foreign exchange headwinds I just mentioned. 
We plan to open 11 stores in 2017, half in Asia Pacific, relocate 9 and close 6, representing a net 3% increase in global square footage. As part of our strategy to optimize the global store base, we will also continue to renovate some of our existing stores. With this in mind, we expect total sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year which, importantly, translates into a mid-single-digit increase over the prior year on a constant exchange rate basis. 
Moving further into the P&L. Our 2017 outlook assumes an increase in operating margin entirely due to an increase in gross margin, with SG&A expense growth just slightly higher than sales growth. The assumption of a higher gross margin is tied to favorable product input costs and proactive expense management. In addition, after not taking any meaningful price increases in 2016, except for currency changes, we took modest price increases in the past month that vary by country, but averaged out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis. 
Our 2017 outlook further assumes interest and other expenses net of approximately $40 million, an effective tax rate consistent with the prior year and that we continue buying shares under our existing share repurchase program, although we expect minimal benefit to diluted earnings per share from the currently planned repurchases. 
Taking all this into account, our outlook falls for net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single-digit percentage from last year's $3.55 per share on a GAAP basis and to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage over the adjusted $3.75 per share last year. We also plan to manage the balance sheet efficiently with the particular focus on not growing net inventories in order to generate net cash from operating activities of approximately $700 million and free cash flow of approximately $450 million for the full year. The difference of $250 million represents our planned capital expenditures. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike Kowalski for some brief comments before we open the call to your questions."

I just want to address a few matters, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. 
First, we began an external search in early February to fill the role of Chief Executive Officer when Frederic Cumenal stepped down from that position, and I agreed to become interim CEO. We assumed that it may take time to find the right person with broad experience in brand management with a global perspective and who possesses strong leadership skills to motivate and inspire our Tiffany colleagues around the world. 
Second, although Tiffany and the luxury industry faced numerous macro challenges in 2016, we have not been pleased with our financial performance. While we were able to realize important improvement in gross margin and generate a healthy level of free cash flow, sales results were disappointing, and we were unable to generate sales leverage on our fixed costs. 
Third, and most importantly, we believe that Tiffany has a set of powerful strategies that can propel our business forward in the long term. With the right leadership and pace of execution, we believe there are substantial opportunities to grow our business. Specifically, we are focused on increasing the rate of new product introductions and innovations. And we recently announced the hiring of Reed Krakoff to serve as Chief Artistic Officer. We're also focused on maximizing our marketing effectiveness and building stronger relationships with customers, optimizing our store network and improving our business operations and processes, all while effectively managing our capital and costs. And we remain absolutely committed to our industry-leading effort through our corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability, an area of great important and relevant to us and, we believe, to our customers as well. In essence, we are committed to executing with excellence the strategies that with -- are within our control and pursuing long-term growth opportunities. 
This May 5, we'll mark the 30th anniversary of Tiffany's initial public offering in 1987. Since then, our company has generally produced strong returns for shareholders. And we intend to pursue opportunities that can continue to generate attractive total shareholder returns in the future. 
In my role as interim CEO, I have been actively engaged with the management teams and employees across our business. And I have no doubt that my colleagues at all levels share an extraordinary sense of dedication and passion for our company. I truly appreciate their efforts.

We've also had increased success with sales under the $500 price point. And once again, as we indicated on the call, we've stabilized that segment and we hope to grow it. We have put -- we have begun to put into place many of the innovations that we spoke of earlier to bring product to market. It's still relatively early stages, but we're seeing progress in the speed of bringing product to market and the efficiency with which we do it. And then of course, most importantly, the arrival of Reed several weeks ago, we believe, will be yet another way to increase the pace of newness and new product introduction.

A lot of this is just basic blocking and tackling. We have a global procurement group that's relatively early in its formation, which is doing extremely good work. As we have get our arms around those global spend goals, we're able to negotiate harder and better and with more visibility and with more impact. That's a key initiative. I mentioned earlier the jewelry design center. I don't want to overplay it, but I certainly don't want to undersell it either. Being able to do fast prototyping on the idea that Reed and his team are generating is going to put us well down the path of being able to design for efficiency in all of our internal production processes. And frankly, it will also allow us for those items that we do choose put out to external bid be a lot tighter in that process as well. Clearly, the systems that we have available to us today are going to be optimized in the years ahead. And that's going to allow us to do better assortment planning. And with better assortment planning, we'll be able to do more high-level analytics that go along with that. We'll be able to get pricing in a lot more discrete ways. And we're going to be able to make sure that in each store, we have the right product at the right time or as much as practical versus what we have today. And we have several pretty exciting initiatives all earmarked in that regard. The planned structure, as I indicated earlier, is also doing a lot of really good work to cross-train, so that we have the ability to do multiple operation in multiple sites, and that's allowing us to extract a lot more value. And we're starting to play with some different technologies as well, which, we think, over time, could lead to some additional productivity gains. So there's a broad-based back to the things that we're aggressively pursuing. And I'm confident that we're going to be able to affect our cost structures in a favorable way, which will allow us then to fuel additional monies into other investment areas going forward."

Because when I look historically about over the last 17 years or at least over the last 10, you guys have done a great job when you announced Tiffany T Collection, the keys collection, the marketing around the Celebration Rings. So when you basically come out with the new category, it does very well. And I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about launching new collections and versus launching just additional SKUs within existing collections. And then lastly, around SKU count, do you think about increasing gross SKU counts but basically leaving net SKU counts flat to increase SKU count productivity? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you think this all plays out from a product newness perspective."

So probably more or less, your suggestion that, combined with the pace of new product introductions, an increased pace of new product, new collection introductions, net SKU count probably will stay where it is. It might even continue to decline a bit. But the key will be building -- growth is going to come from a combination of one new collection. And if you look at the evolution of our assortment over the past 10 years, far more concentrated today in important collections than it was 10 years ago in multiple smaller collections. So we want new collections but they have to be big and they need to be impactful. And of course, Tiffany T is -- would be the model -- one of the models going forward for that. At the same time, we need to be mindful that existing collections Return to Tiffany and Return to Tiffany Love, they have to be renewed and we have to continue to animate and increase and inject energy into those. So it's going to be, as it always is, a very careful balance of making sure that we have significant new collections that marketing can drive at the same time making sure that the core collections that are still the -- that will always be the majority of sales, continue to grow at the same time. So it's a complex balancing act."

Thank you, Jennifer. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. I'm delighted that Tiffany's Chairman of the Board and interim CEO, Mike Kowalski; and our CFO, Mark Erceg, are on today's call.

Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation. 
Okay. By now, I hope you've had a chance to read today's news release, which indicated fourth quarter and full year results that were in line with the guidance that we've provided in January and reaffirmed last month. Worldwide net sales rose slightly in the fourth quarter, and earnings per diluted share declined slightly. For the full year, worldwide net sales declined 3%, diluted EPS declined 1% on a GAAP basis and 2% when excluding charges in both years. And we managed our balance sheet effectively generating strong cash flow in the year. 
So let's review the results starting with the top line. First, there were no meaningful changes in regional sales mix in 2016 with the Americas representing 46% of worldwide sales, Asia Pacific at 25%, Japan at 15% and Europe at 11%. In the Americas, total sales and comparable store sales declined in both the fourth quarter and the year as a result of lower jewelry units sold. In the U.S., we experienced softness across most of the country for the year, although at lesser rates in some stores as the year progressed. 
In addition to the full year, sales weakness in Canada was partly offset by growth in Latin America. We attributed a portion of the softness in the U.S. throughout the year to local customers, which, we believe, was tied to macro, market and political uncertainties. Sales attributed to foreign visitors declined in the full year, which we attribute to lower spending by Chinese visitors. But we believe total sales benefited in the second half of the year due to increased spending by Japanese tourists. We estimate that U.S. sales in 2016 to foreign tourists remained at approximately 20%. 
We've previously spoken about the impact of postelection activities near our New York flagship store, which represents less than 10% of worldwide sales. While we typically do not discuss individual store results, we are, for at least this quarter, reporting its sales results because of the unique situation and level of investor interest. Sales in the New York flagship declined 11% in the full year and 7% in the entire fourth quarter versus the 14% decline in the November, December holiday period due to some large transactions in January. In addition, we estimate spending by foreign tourists in that store remained at roughly 40% of its annual sales. 
Elsewhere during 2016, we opened one store in Canada in the Holt-Renfrew department store in Toronto, relocated our store in the Holt-Renfrew in Vancouver and relocated our store in the King of Prussia mall outside Philadelphia. Of course, we also continued to renovate many stores, highlighted by magnificent upgrades to our stores in Beverly Hills and San Francisco. 
Turning to Asia Pacific. While total sales were roughly unchanged in the year, we were pleased to see a healthy rate of growth in the second half and fourth quarter that was generated by increases in jewelry units sold. During the year, we were very pleased with strong total and comparable store sales growth in Mainland China as we believe the Tiffany & Co. brand continues to gain recognition and prominence with customers. I should add that lower spending that we attributed to Chinese tourists in other regions in 2016 may have led to some of the higher spending that we saw by local consumers within China. 
Also in the Greater China market, we were pleased to see smaller sequential sales declines in Hong Kong as the year progressed. However, there was noteworthy softness in much of the year in Australia and Taiwan. 
We significantly enhanced our store presence in Asia Pacific in 2016. We opened 7 stores, relocated 2 and closed 3. In China, we opened 3 stores in Ningbo-Heyi, in Tianjin-Hisense and in Shenyang MixC. And we closed 2 stores, one in Beijing in the Peninsula Hotel and one in the Tianjin Friendship store. We finished the year with 31 stores in Mainland China. 
In addition, we opened our 15th store in Korea in the Shinsegae Hanam department store. We opened our first store in New Zealand in Auckland's magnificent Britomart Precinct. And we opened 2 stores in Australia, one in the Gold Coast Pacific Fair and one in the Sydney Airport. In Singapore, we relocated our store at Changi Airport and closed our store in Raffles Hotel. 
In Japan, we achieved healthy retail sales growth in 2016 even excluding the favorable translation benefit from the stronger yen and finished the year on a strong note. We were pleased to have an increase in jewelry units sold in the fourth quarter and full year in Japan that spanned most categories. Anecdotally, we believe our already strong presence in Japan further benefited from the brand exposure we received on a popular television show called For The Romantic, which aired in the July-September time frame. In addition, we believe that the stronger yen has been a factor contributing to the increased purchasing attributed to Japanese tourists that we've experienced in other regions. Conversely, that stronger yen has likely been the reason for less tourist spending in Japan, primarily attributed to Chinese visitors, which reversed the trend we saw in 2015. However, we believe our sales in Japan are made largely by Japanese customers, and we continue to estimate that spending by foreign tourists represented less than 10% of sales in Japan. Lastly in Japan, we had a net reduction of one store in 2016 as we closed the store in the Takashimaya department store in Yonago, while we relocated 2 stores during the year in Nagoya and Kagoshima. 
Conversely, it was a challenging year in Europe. Total sales declined on a reported basis in the fourth quarter and full year, partly reflecting weakening European currencies. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined to a lesser extent in the year and actually rose slightly in the fourth quarter. The sales weakness arose largely from lower jewelry unit volume across all categories. Throughout the year, we experienced varying degrees of soft demands, partly attributed to local customers that, we believe, is the result of economic and political conditions and also attributed to lower spending by foreign tourists, likely tied to the effects of the tragic events in Paris and elsewhere. We estimate that spending attributed to foreign tourists generally represents in the neighborhood of 1/4 to 1/3 of total European sales. In both the fourth quarter and the full year, results were soft across much of Continental Europe, while sales on a constant exchange rate basis in the U.K., which represents roughly 40% of European sales -- sales rose in the U.K. which represents about 40% of European sales. In fact, we believe the sales lift that we saw in the U.K. in the second half of the year was from spending attributed to foreign tourists after the British pound declined following the Brexit vote. We opened 3 stores in Europe in 2016, including 2 in Italy on Rome's Via dei Condotti and in Venice, and a second store in Amsterdam in De Bijenkorf department store. And we closed a small store in the Frankfurt Airport. 
I commented several times on the significant spending attributed to foreign tourists in most regions. In general, tourism flows from one region to another maybe affected by changes in currency values as well as geopolitical and other external factors. Therefore, we believe that creating and reinforcing local and global brand recognition is most relevant to growing our business regardless of where the spending might occur in the short term. 
Lastly, lower sales in our other segment in both the fourth quarter and full year resulted from comp store sales declines in our 5 stores in the United Arab Emirates. Wholesale sales of diamonds increased in the full year, but were roughly unchanged in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of store productivity, worldwide gross -- worldwide sales per gross square foot for company-operated stores was $2,700 in 2016 compared with $2,900 in 2015, resulting from the 3% increase in worldwide gross square footage and a modest worldwide sales decline. By region, sales productivity in 2016 ranged from $3,800 in Asia Pacific to $3,700 in Japan to $2,500 in Europe and to $2,200 in the Americas. Keep in mind that these productivity levels are calculated in U.S. dollars. And therefore, year-to-year differences also reflect foreign currency changes. 
Our strategies partly revolve around optimizing our worldwide store base through openings, relocations, renovations and closings. We expect this to result in increasing global square footage by approximately 2% a year for the foreseeable future. This initiative goes hand in hand with our strategy to more proactively reach customers to deliver a more engaging shopping experience, to deepen long-term relationships with customers and, ultimately, to increase the frequency of store visits and conversion rates. 
Beyond the Tiffany & Co. stores we operate in 28 countries, we also serve customers through e-commerce-enabled websites in 13 of those countries. Worldwide e-commerce sales were approximately unchanged in the year and continued to represent 6% of Tiffany's worldwide sales, but were somewhat higher percentage in the U.S. alone. As we've said many times, our website serves an important dual function of generating online sales, but also in delivering marketing communication that drives awareness and store traffic. That covers regional sales results. 
Looking at the product side. From a sales perspective, trends indicated general softness across all jewelry categories to varying degrees. Despite that, there were some noteworthy product-related highlights in 2016. During the year, we introduced some new designs, refreshed some existing collections and, importantly, have said that we intend to accelerate the pace of newness going forward. Relative improvements that we've seen in fashion jewelry sales can be attributed to higher gold jewelry sales, exemplified by the T collection, which we have continued to build upon with new designs. We also saw a relative improvement in fashion silver jewelry in 2016, led by the popularity of the new Return to Tiffany Love collection with silver jewelry sales approaching stabilization after years of decline. We focused on product newness in silver jewelry in 2016 and grew the number of new items under $500 by more than 10%. 
I should also mention success in our designer jewelry category, which we are now disclosing on its own, driven by Elsa Peretti's jewelry collections highlighted in 2016 by her exquisite Diamonds by the Yard and the open heart designs and the designs of Paloma Picasso, highlighted by her popular Olive Leaf and her new Paloma's Melody collection. 
Engagement jewelry and wedding bands category posted mixed sales performance by region during the year, although we were pleased to see unit volume growth in the quarter and the full year on a worldwide basis. Relatively speaking, the softness product category was high fine and solitaire jewelry. We continue to be pleased with the success of our Victoria collections in platinum and diamonds. However, there was some softness at the highest end of this category. We had held our Blue Book event this spring attended by a global audience as we do every year. And the results, while strong, did not measure up to the huge success of those events in the prior 2 years. You should note that the term high jewelry now replaces the former term statement jewelry. 
Lastly, I'll just mention that we continue to see healthy sales growth in the watch category in 2016. While watch sales have grown, albeit off of a low single-digit percentage of sales base, we see considerable opportunity over the longer term to expand that business through a combination of product development and marketing communications.
That covers the top line review. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg."

Thanks, Mark, and welcome, everyone. Let me start by stating that while fourth quarter and full year GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share both were in line with our expectations, Tiffany's financial performance over the past couple of years has been disappointing, which is why I'm so pleased to be working with Mike Kowalski, the board and all Tiffany's dedicated and talented employees to accelerate the execution of our key strategies in the years ahead. 
One of those strategies is expanding our e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, which require us to upgrade certain IT systems. So I want to briefly comment on the $25.4 million impairment of capitalized software development costs we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016. Simply put, as part of a comprehensive system review, we identified a solution, which negated the need to install a separate inventory management and merchandising system, which work had already begun on. By further leveraging our existing ERP system and an order management system we were in the process of implementing, we expect to be able to access the full range of capabilities we are originally seeking, but at a lower cost. This project, now that it has been recast, along with the rapid investments we are making in information systems will, we believe, make our supply chain more efficient, improve the customers' in-store experience and generate incremental sales by expanding and leveraging both our CRM and omnichannel capabilities. 
Let's now look at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.1%, which was up 110 basis points versus a year ago. In fact, gross margin increased year-over-year in every quarter as we benefited from favorable product input costs, 2015 pricing actions, which carried over into 2016 and a favorable shift in product sales mix. For the full year, gross margin was 62.2% versus 60.7% last year. But unfortunately, the 150 basis points of gross margin expansion generated during 2016 was more than offset by increases in SG&A expense. SG&A expense as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter was 43.2%, up 170 basis points versus a year ago. And for the year, it was 44.2%, which was up 200 basis points. The increases in SG&A expense as a percent of sales reflected sales deleveraging due to higher store occupancy and depreciation costs as well as higher labor and incentive compensation costs. Lowering the rate of SG&A expense growth as a percent of sales remains a top priority for the company going forward. 
Marketing spending as a percent of sales was roughly unchanged from the prior year. We continue to broaden Tiffany's presence in a variety of media and, as an example, appeared on television in February with our first Super Bowl commercial. The 62nd ad, which ran 10 key markets, featured Lady Gaga in order to set the stage for our new hardware jewelry collection, which is launching next month. 
Net interest and other expenses in the fourth quarter and for the full year were below prior year due to both reduced foreign currency transaction losses and lower interest expense. Tiffany's full year effective tax rate was 34.1%, which was down from last year's rate of 34.7% due to the favorable impact from the conclusion of a tax examination in the first quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. We finished the year with reasonable debt levels and generated strong cash flow, both of which gives us the ability to continue investing in our business while also returning excess cash to shareholders. Inventory finished the year 3% below a year ago at $2.2 billion. Accounts receivable at January 31 were 10% higher than the previous year-end with the increase partly tied to the timing of collections driven by sales growth in Japan since the majority of our stores' net market are operated within department stores. A portion of the increase was also currency related. 
Capital expenditures for the year came in at $223 million with more than half of the spending related to the opening, renovation and/or relocation of stores. CapEx represented approximately 6% of worldwide sales during both 2016 and 2015. 
It's also worth pointing out that we made an unplanned and voluntary contribution of $120 million to Tiffany's U.S. pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect this to lower our 2017 pension expense as a result of incremental returns expected to be generated on the investments made with that contribution and lower premiums owed to the PBGC. 
Putting it all together we generated $702 million of operating cash flow and $479 million of free cash flow in 2016 after giving effect to the $120 million voluntary pension contribution. Importantly, this was well above our initial goal of generating at least $400 million [ph] of free cash flow for the year. In terms of share repurchases, we spent $184 million and bought more than 2 million shares in 2016. 
Turning to dividends. We increased the quarterly dividend by 12.5% in May, which marked the 15th dividend increase in the past 14 years. We finished fiscal 2016 with $986 million of cash and short-term investments versus $1.1 billion of short-term and long-term debt. So total debt represented just 37% of stockholders' equity, which was unchanged from the prior year. Tiffany's return on assets was 9% and return on stockholders' equity was 15%, both of which are generally consistent with our long-term objectives, which call for a return on assets of at least 10% and a return on equity of at least 15%. 
Looking into 2017. Our financial expectations recognize 2 import external challenges. First, we remain mindful of economic and geopolitical uncertainties, and their potential effects on both local and forest -- foreign tourist spending. Second, since over half our sales continue to be outside the United States, and we expect the U.S. dollar to be stronger on average than the prior year, we should be facing a sizable headwind in terms of translating our non-U.S. sales into dollars. In addition, we'll have to overcome the negative effect of stronger dollar may have on foreign tourists spending in the United States. Of course, we do openly acknowledge that we will partly benefit from the translation effect of non-U.S. expenses into dollars, but that positive impact is expected to be relatively minor compared to the 2 foreign exchange headwinds I just mentioned. 
We plan to open 11 stores in 2017, half in Asia Pacific, relocate 9 and close 6, representing a net 3% increase in global square footage. As part of our strategy to optimize the global store base, we will also continue to renovate some of our existing stores. With this in mind, we expect total sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year which, importantly, translates into a mid-single-digit increase over the prior year on a constant exchange rate basis. 
Moving further into the P&L. Our 2017 outlook assumes an increase in operating margin entirely due to an increase in gross margin, with SG&A expense growth just slightly higher than sales growth. The assumption of a higher gross margin is tied to favorable product input costs and proactive expense management. In addition, after not taking any meaningful price increases in 2016, except for currency changes, we took modest price increases in the past month that vary by country, but averaged out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis. 
Our 2017 outlook further assumes interest and other expenses net of approximately $40 million, an effective tax rate consistent with the prior year and that we continue buying shares under our existing share repurchase program, although we expect minimal benefit to diluted earnings per share from the currently planned repurchases. 
Taking all this into account, our outlook calls for net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single-digit percentage from last year's $3.55 per share on a GAAP basis and to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage over the adjusted $3.75 per share last year. We also plan to manage the balance sheet efficiently with the particular focus on not growing net inventories in order to generate net cash from operating activities of approximately $700 million and free cash flow of approximately $450 million for the full year. The difference of $250 million represents our planned capital expenditures. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike Kowalski for some brief comments before we open the call to your questions."

Thank you, gentlemen, for providing everyone with a thorough understanding of Tiffany's performance in 2016. I just want to address a few matters, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. 
First, we began an external search in early February to fill the role of Chief Executive Officer when Frederic Cumenal stepped down from that position, and I agreed to become interim CEO. We assumed that it may take time to find the right person with broad experience in brand management with a global perspective and who possesses strong leadership skills to motivate and inspire our Tiffany colleagues around the world. 
Second, although Tiffany and the luxury industry faced numerous macro challenges in 2016, we have not been pleased with our financial performance. While we were able to realize important improvement in gross margin and generate a healthy level of free cash flow, sales results were disappointing, and we were unable to generate sales leverage on our fixed costs. 
Third, and most importantly, we believe that Tiffany has a set of powerful strategies that can propel our business forward in the long term. With the right leadership and pace of execution, we believe there are substantial opportunities to grow our business. Specifically, we are focused on increasing the rate of new product introductions and innovations. And we recently announced the hiring of Reed Krakoff to serve as Chief Artistic Officer. We're also focused on maximizing our marketing effectiveness and building stronger relationships with customers, optimizing our store network and improving our business operations and processes, all while effectively managing our capital and costs. And we remain absolutely committed to our industry-leading effort around corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability, an area of great importance and relevance to us and, we believe, to our customers as well. In essence, we are committed to executing with excellence the strategies that with -- are within our control and pursuing long-term growth opportunities. 
This May 5, we'll mark the 30th anniversary of Tiffany's initial public offering in 1987. Since then, our company has generally produced strong returns for shareholders. And we intend to pursue opportunities that can continue to generate attractive total shareholder returns in the future. 
In my role as interim CEO, I have been actively engaged with the management teams and employees across our business. And I have no doubt that my colleagues at all levels share an extraordinary sense of dedication and passion for our company. I truly appreciate their efforts. And to all of you on this call, I appreciate your ongoing interest in Tiffany's progress. And now we'd be happy to answer some of your questions."

Well, certainly -- this is Mike. Certainly, the portion of the product assortment in which we delivered new -- greater newness at a greater pace is in fashion product. And I think we've seen the sales results to the extent that fashion has grown faster. So we certainly continue our emphasis on that segment of the assortment. We've also had increased success with sales under the $500 price point. And once again, as we indicated on the call, we've stabilized that segment and we hope to grow it. We have put -- we have begun to put into place many of the innovations that we spoke of earlier to bring product to market. It's still relatively early stages, but we're seeing progress in the speed of bringing product to market and the efficiency with which we do it. And then of course, most importantly, the arrival of Reed several weeks ago, we believe, will be yet another way to increase the pace of newness and new product introduction. So at this point, we're feeling good about 2017 and beyond."

We have been looking at ways for us to maximize the efficiency of the team that we have in all areas. And we've been doing a lot of additional training, which is allowing us to cross use the capacity that we do have within our internal system more efficiently and more effectively each and every year.

Certainly. No. Thank you very much for the question. I mean, as with Mike, he made the comment that he was very pleased to see the -- an enormous number of initiatives that were being actioned when he kind of parachuted back in. I will tell you that there was a lot of things being done in a lot of good regards by a lot of really talented people, which I'm going to now, hopefully, be a partial beneficiary along with all the shareholders that are out there and those of you on the call today. A lot of this is just basic blocking and tackling. We have a global procurement group that's relatively early in its formation, which is doing extremely good work. As we have get our arms around those global spend pools, we're able to negotiate harder and better and with more visibility and with more impact. That's a key initiative. I mentioned earlier the jewelry design center. I don't want to overplay it, but I certainly don't want to undersell it either. Being able to do fast prototyping on the idea that Reed and his team are generating is going to put us well down the path of being able to design for efficiency in all of our internal production processes. And frankly, it will also allow us for those items that we do choose put out to external bid be a lot tighter in that process as well. Clearly, the systems that we have available to us today are going to be optimized in the years ahead. And that's going to allow us to do better assortment planning. And with better assortment planning, we'll be able to do more high-level analytics that go along with that. We'll be able to get pricing in a lot more discrete ways. And we're going to be able to make sure that in each store, we have the right product at the right time or as much as practical versus what we have today. And we have several pretty exciting initiatives all earmarked in that regard. The plant structure, as I indicated earlier, is also doing a lot of really good work to cross-train, so that we have the ability to do multiple operation in multiple sites, and that's allowing us to extract a lot more value. And we're starting to play with some different technologies as well, which, we think, over time, could lead to some additional productivity gains. So there's a broad-based basket of things that we're aggressively pursuing. And I'm confident that we're going to be able to affect our cost structures in a favorable way, which will allow us then to fuel additional monies into other investment areas going forward."

          Two good questions. So, with respect to the loans that we had previously made in order to be able to access supply, the good news is that, that's all largely past us at this point. We have one loan that's outstanding as a performing loan. And after this quarter, it's very de minimis, a couple of million dollars, and as I said, it's a performing loan. That should be all that remains with us. So we think that we have processed through all of that. With respect to your other question, I don't want to evade it because it's a fair question but I think for me, there's just an abundance of opportunities there are [indiscernible]  for us. So a lot of work has been done, a lot of really good work has been done. But that said and despite the fact it's a 180-year-old company, there's still enormous opportunities going forward that we have the ability to access. So maybe one thing I would offer is the state of the IT systems because of the company's rapid growth phase is an opportunity for us now and that we have the ability to stitch that together in a seamless way and that's going to give us a lot of additional capabilities going forward. So maybe one thing is -- I would have thought that maybe there's a little bit more -- an evolved IT infrastructure and research related to the financial cube, but this is something that's easily addressed and we're going to get after in short order, and again, that will become an opportunity."

          Let me try to answer the first question, Janet, around the overall going forward direction of product assortment, product categories. As I think everyone on the call knows, part of the magic of Tiffany over the very, very many years has been our ability to balance that -- those categories and to move forward with them all simultaneously. Critical to that has always been our ability to drive lower-price-point sales because of the very favorable margin profile of that category. And once again, as you've heard before, we've stabilized that segment. We also feel very good about the fashion segment gold -- the fashion part of the segment. And once again, due to the entire mix, that also has -- adds favorable gross margin profile. So I think we're not finished certainly, but right now we're feeling relatively good about the direction of category evolution. And of course, as we've said now many times on the phone, we have the work in progress on watches which we're pleased with and, of course, the upcoming gift collection which also should be additive incremental to gross margin. So on that score, a product balance, relative category growth going forward, we're in a pretty good spot right now."

          And what I would offer is, at the end of the day when you ask questions about gross margin and things, we're really focused on operating margin. We really are trying put together a sustainable business model that lets us eke out about 50 basis points on the operating line each and every year. Certainly, within our product offerings, certain groupings within that have higher gross margins than others, silver fashion, as an example. That said, we enjoy pretty attractive gross margins in the absolute across all of our product offerings. And I don't want us to become fixated on gross margin as it relates to product mix because at the end of the day, I'm happy to sell an incremental item across any of our offerings because in the absolute, they're very accretive and attractive to us. So product mix does play into it, but I don't want to overplay the role of that in our overall business model."

Kind of any further color on how you're thinking about that, either from a SKU count perspective or an actual category perspective? Because when I look historically about over the last 17 years or at least over the last 10, you guys have done a great job when you announced Tiffany T Collection, the keys collection, the marketing around the Celebration Rings. So when you basically come out with the new category, it does very well. And I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about launching new collections and versus launching just additional SKUs within existing collections.

So probably more or less, your suggestion that, combined with the pace of new product introductions, an increased pace of new product, new collection introductions, net SKU count probably will stay where it is. It might even continue to decline a bit. But the key will be building -- growth is going to come from a combination of one new collection. And if you look at the evolution of our assortment over the past 10 years, far more concentrated today in important collections than it was 10 years ago in multiple smaller collections. So we want new collections but they have to be big and they need to be impactful. And of course, Tiffany T is -- would be the model -- one of the models going forward for that. At the same time, we need to be mindful that existing collections Return to Tiffany and Return to Tiffany Love, they have to be renewed and we have to continue to animate and increase and inject energy into those. So it's going to be, as it always is, a very careful balance of making sure that we have significant new collections that marketing can drive at the same time making sure that the core collections that are still the -- that will always be the majority of sales, continue to grow at the same time.

Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. I'm delighted that Tiffany's Chairman of the Board and interim CEO, Mike Kowalski; and our CFO, Mark Erceg, are on today's call. We'll review actual results and comment on the 2017 outlook, and then we'll allow time to answer some questions. 
Before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation. 
Okay. By now, I hope you've had a chance to read today's news release, which indicated fourth quarter and full year results that were in line with the guidance that we've provided in January and reaffirmed last month. Worldwide net sales rose slightly in the fourth quarter, and earnings per diluted share declined slightly. For the full year, worldwide net sales declined 3%, diluted EPS declined 1% on a GAAP basis and 2% when excluding charges in both years. And we managed our balance sheet effectively generating strong cash flow in the year. 
So let's review the results starting with the top line. First, there were no meaningful changes in regional sales mix in 2016 with the Americas representing 46% of worldwide sales, Asia Pacific at 25%, Japan at 15% and Europe at 11%. In the Americas, total sales and comparable store sales declined in both the fourth quarter and the year as a result of lower jewelry units sold. In the U.S., we experienced softness across most of the country for the year, although at lesser rates in some stores as the year progressed. 
In addition to the full year, sales weakness in Canada was partly offset by growth in Latin America. We attributed a portion of the softness in the U.S. throughout the year to local customers, which, we believe, was tied to macro, market and political uncertainties. Sales attributed to foreign visitors declined in the full year, which we attribute to lower spending by Chinese visitors. But we believe total sales benefited in the second half of the year due to increased spending by Japanese tourists. We estimate that U.S. sales in 2016 to foreign tourists remained at approximately 20%. 
We've previously spoken about the impact of postelection activities near our New York flagship store, which represents less than 10% of worldwide sales. While we typically do not discuss individual store results, we are, for at least this quarter, reporting its sales results because of the unique situation and level of investor interest. Sales in the New York flagship declined 11% in the full year and 7% in the entire fourth quarter versus the 14% decline in the November, December holiday period due to some large transactions in January. In addition, we estimate spending by foreign tourists in that store remained at roughly 40% of its annual sales. 
Elsewhere during 2016, we opened one store in Canada in the Holt-Renfrew department store in Toronto, relocated our store in the Holt-Renfrew in Vancouver and relocated our store in the King of Prussia mall outside Philadelphia. Of course, we also continued to renovate many stores, highlighted by magnificent upgrades to our stores in Beverly Hills and San Francisco. 
Turning to Asia Pacific. While total sales were roughly unchanged in the year, we were pleased to see a healthy rate of growth in the second half and fourth quarter that was generated by increases in jewelry units sold. During the year, we were very pleased with strong total and comparable store sales growth in Mainland China as we believe the Tiffany & Co. brand continues to gain recognition and prominence with customers. I should add that lower spending that we attributed to Chinese tourists in other regions in 2016 may have led to some of the higher spending that we saw by local consumers within China. 
Also in the Greater China market, we were pleased to see smaller sequential sales declines in Hong Kong as the year progressed. However, there was noteworthy softness in much of the year in Australia and Taiwan. 
We significantly enhanced our store presence in Asia Pacific in 2016. We opened 7 stores, relocated 2 and closed 3. In China, we opened 3 stores in Ningbo-Heyi, in Tianjin-Hisense and in Shenyang MixC. And we closed 2 stores, one in Beijing in the Peninsula Hotel and one in the Tianjin Friendship store. We finished the year with 31 stores in Mainland China. 
In addition, we opened our 15th store in Korea in the Shinsegae Hanam department store. We opened our first store in New Zealand in Auckland's magnificent Britomart Precinct. And we opened 2 stores in Australia, one in the Gold Coast Pacific Fair and one in the Sydney Airport. In Singapore, we relocated our store at Changi Airport and closed our store in Raffles Hotel. 
In Japan, we achieved healthy retail sales growth in 2016 even excluding the favorable translation benefit from the stronger yen and finished the year on a strong note. We were pleased to have an increase in jewelry units sold in the fourth quarter and full year in Japan that spanned most categories. Anecdotally, we believe our already strong presence in Japan further benefited from the brand exposure we received on a popular television show called For The Romantic, which aired in the July-September time frame. In addition, we believe that the stronger yen has been a factor contributing to the increased purchasing attributed to Japanese tourists that we've experienced in other regions. Conversely, that stronger yen has likely been the reason for less tourist spending in Japan, primarily attributed to Chinese visitors, which reversed the trend we saw in 2015. However, we believe our sales in Japan are made largely by Japanese customers, and we continue to estimate that spending by foreign tourists represented less than 10% of sales in Japan. Lastly in Japan, we had a net reduction of one store in 2016 as we closed the store in the Takashimaya department store in Yonago, while we relocated 2 stores during the year in Nagoya and Kagoshima. 
Conversely, it was a challenging year in Europe. Total sales declined on a reported basis in the fourth quarter and full year, partly reflecting weakening European currencies. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined to a lesser extent in the year and actually rose slightly in the fourth quarter. The sales weakness arose largely from lower jewelry unit volume across all categories. Throughout the year, we experienced varying degrees of soft demands, partly attributed to local customers that, we believe, is the result of economic and political conditions and also attributed to lower spending by foreign tourists, likely tied to the effects of the tragic events in Paris and elsewhere. We estimate that spending attributed to foreign tourists generally represents in the neighborhood of 1/4 to 1/3 of total European sales. In both the fourth quarter and the full year, results were soft across much of Continental Europe, while sales on a constant exchange rate basis in the U.K., which represents roughly 40% of European sales -- sales rose in the U.K. which represents about 40% of European sales. In fact, we believe the sales lift that we saw in the U.K. in the second half of the year was from spending attributed to foreign tourists after the British pound declined following the Brexit vote. We opened 3 stores in Europe in 2016, including 2 in Italy on Rome's Via dei Condotti and in Venice, and a second store in Amsterdam in De Bijenkorf department store. And we closed a small store in the Frankfurt Airport. 
I commented several times on the significant spending attributed to foreign tourists in most regions. In general, tourism flows from one region to another may be affected by changes in currency values as well as geopolitical and other external factors. Therefore, we believe that creating and reinforcing local and global brand recognition is most relevant to growing our business regardless of where the spending might occur in the short term. 
Lastly, lower sales in our other segment in both the fourth quarter and full year resulted from comp store sales declines in our 5 stores in the United Arab Emirates. Wholesale sales of diamonds increased in the full year, but were roughly unchanged in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of store productivity, worldwide gross -- worldwide sales per gross square foot for company-operated stores was $2,700 in 2016 compared with $2,900 in 2015, resulting from the 3% increase in worldwide gross square footage and a modest worldwide sales decline. By region, sales productivity in 2016 ranged from $3,800 in Asia Pacific to $3,700 in Japan to $2,500 in Europe and to $2,200 in the Americas. Keep in mind that these productivity levels are calculated in U.S. dollars. And therefore, year-to-year differences also reflect foreign currency changes. 
Our strategies partly revolve around optimizing our worldwide store base through openings, relocations, renovations and closings. We expect this to result in increasing global square footage by approximately 2% a year for the foreseeable future. This initiative goes hand in hand with our strategy to more proactively reach customers to deliver a more engaging shopping experience, to deepen long-term relationships with customers and, ultimately, to increase the frequency of store visits and conversion rates. 
Beyond the Tiffany & Co. stores we operate in 28 countries, we also serve customers through e-commerce-enabled websites in 13 of those countries. Worldwide e-commerce sales were approximately unchanged in the year and continued to represent 6% of Tiffany's worldwide sales, but were somewhat higher percentage in the U.S. alone. As we've said many times, our website serves an important dual function of generating online sales, but also in delivering marketing communication that drives awareness and store traffic. That covers regional sales results. 
Looking at the product side. From a sales perspective, trends indicated general softness across all jewelry categories to varying degrees. Despite that, there were some noteworthy product-related highlights in 2016. During the year, we introduced some new designs, refreshed some existing collections and, importantly, have said that we intend to accelerate the pace of newness going forward. Relative improvements that we've seen in fashion jewelry sales can be attributed to higher gold jewelry sales, exemplified by the T collection, which we have continued to build upon with new designs. We also saw a relative improvement in fashion silver jewelry in 2016, led by the popularity of the new Return to Tiffany Love collection with silver jewelry sales approaching stabilization after years of decline. We focused on product newness in silver jewelry in 2016 and grew the number of new items under $500 by more than 10%. 
I should also mention success in our designer jewelry category, which we are now disclosing on its own, driven by Elsa Peretti's jewelry collections highlighted in 2016 by her exquisite Diamonds by the Yard and the open heart designs and the designs of Paloma Picasso, highlighted by her popular Olive Leaf and her new Paloma's Melody collection. 
Engagement jewelry and wedding bands category posted mixed sales performance by region during the year, although we were pleased to see unit volume growth in the quarter and the full year on a worldwide basis. Relatively speaking, the softness product category was high fine and solitaire jewelry. We continue to be pleased with the success of our Victoria collections in platinum and diamonds. However, there was some softness at the highest end of this category. We had held our Blue Book event this spring attended by a global audience as we do every year. And the results, while strong, did not measure up to the huge success of those events in the prior 2 years. You should note that the term high jewelry now replaces the former term statement jewelry. 
Lastly, I'll just mention that we continue to see healthy sales growth in the watch category in 2016. While watch sales have grown, albeit off of a low single-digit percentage of sales base, we see considerable opportunity over the longer term to expand that business through a combination of product development and marketing communications.
That covers the top line review. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg."
35576,421618126,1159597,"Tiffany & Co., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 17, 2017",2017-03-17,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and welcome, everyone. Let me start by stating that while fourth quarter and full year GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share both were in line with our expectations, Tiffany's financial performance over the past couple of years has be",1410,"Thanks, Mark, and welcome, everyone. Let me start by stating that while fourth quarter and full year GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share both were in line with our expectations, Tiffany's financial performance over the past couple of years has been disappointing, which is why I'm so pleased to be working with Mike Kowalski, the board and all Tiffany's dedicated and talented employees to accelerate the execution of our key strategies in the years ahead. 
One of those strategies is expanding our e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, which require us to upgrade certain IT systems. So I want to briefly comment on the $25.4 million impairment of capitalized software development costs we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016. Simply put, as part of a comprehensive system review, we identified a solution, which negated the need to install a separate inventory management and merchandising system, which work had already begun on. By further leveraging our existing ERP system and an order management system we were in the process of implementing, we expect to be able to access the full range of capabilities we are originally seeking, but at a lower cost. This project, now that it has been recast, along with the rapid investments we are making in information systems will, we believe, make our supply chain more efficient, improve the customers' in-store experience and generate incremental sales by expanding and leveraging both our CRM and omnichannel capabilities. 
Let's now look at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.1%, which was up 110 basis points versus a year ago. In fact, gross margin increased year-over-year in every quarter as we benefited from favorable product input costs, 2015 pricing actions, which carried over into 2016 and a favorable shift in product sales mix. For the full year, gross margin was 62.2% versus 60.7% last year. But unfortunately, the 150 basis points of gross margin expansion generated during 2016 was more than offset by increases in SG&A expense. SG&A expense as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter was 43.2%, up 170 basis points versus a year ago. And for the year, it was 44.2%, which was up 200 basis points. The increases in SG&A expense as a percent of sales reflected sales deleveraging due to higher store occupancy and depreciation costs as well as higher labor and incentive compensation costs. Lowering the rate of SG&A expense growth as a percent of sales remains a top priority for the company going forward. 
Marketing spending as a percent of sales was roughly unchanged from the prior year. We continue to broaden Tiffany's presence in a variety of media and, as an example, appeared on television in February with our first Super Bowl commercial. The 62nd ad, which ran 10 key markets, featured Lady Gaga in order to set the stage for our new hardware jewelry collection, which is launching next month. 
Net interest and other expenses in the fourth quarter and for the full year were below prior year due to both reduced foreign currency transaction losses and lower interest expense. Tiffany's full year effective tax rate was 34.1%, which was down from last year's rate of 34.7% due to the favorable impact from the conclusion of a tax examination in the first quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. We finished the year with reasonable debt levels and generated strong cash flow, both of which gives us the ability to continue investing in our business while also returning excess cash to shareholders. Inventory finished the year 3% below a year ago at $2.2 billion. Accounts receivable at January 31 were 10% higher than the previous year-end with the increase partly tied to the timing of collections driven by sales growth in Japan since the majority of our stores' net market are operated within department stores. A portion of the increase was also currency related. 
Capital expenditures for the year came in at $223 million with more than half of the spending related to the opening, renovation and/or relocation of stores. CapEx represented approximately 6% of worldwide sales during both 2016 and 2015. 
It's also worth pointing out that we made an unplanned and voluntary contribution of $120 million to Tiffany's U.S. pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect this to lower our 2017 pension expense as a result of incremental returns expected to be generated on the investments made with that contribution and lower premiums owed to the PBGC. 
Putting it all together we generated $702 million of operating cash flow and $479 million of free cash flow in 2016 after giving effect to the $120 million voluntary pension contribution. Importantly, this was well above our initial goal of generating at least $400 million [ph] of free cash flow for the year. In terms of share repurchases, we spent $184 million and bought more than 2 million shares in 2016. 
Turning to dividends. We increased the quarterly dividend by 12.5% in May, which marked the 15th dividend increase in the past 14 years. We finished fiscal 2016 with $986 million of cash and short-term investments versus $1.1 billion of short-term and long-term debt. So total debt represented just 37% of stockholders' equity, which was unchanged from the prior year. Tiffany's return on assets was 9% and return on stockholders' equity was 15%, both of which are generally consistent with our long-term objectives, which call for a return on assets of at least 10% and a return on equity of at least 15%. 
Looking into 2017. Our financial expectations recognize 2 import external challenges. First, we remain mindful of economic and geopolitical uncertainties, and their potential effects on both local and forest -- foreign tourist spending. Second, since over half our sales continue to be outside the United States, and we expect the U.S. dollar to be stronger on average than the prior year, we should be facing a sizable headwind in terms of translating our non-U.S. sales into dollars. In addition, we'll have to overcome the negative effect of stronger dollar may have on foreign tourists spending in the United States. Of course, we do openly acknowledge that we will partly benefit from the translation effect of non-U.S. expenses into dollars, but that positive impact is expected to be relatively minor compared to the 2 foreign exchange headwinds I just mentioned. 
We plan to open 11 stores in 2017, half in Asia Pacific, relocate 9 and close 6, representing a net 3% increase in global square footage. As part of our strategy to optimize the global store base, we will also continue to renovate some of our existing stores. With this in mind, we expect total sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year which, importantly, translates into a mid-single-digit increase over the prior year on a constant exchange rate basis. 
Moving further into the P&L. Our 2017 outlook assumes an increase in operating margin entirely due to an increase in gross margin, with SG&A expense growth just slightly higher than sales growth. The assumption of a higher gross margin is tied to favorable product input costs and proactive expense management. In addition, after not taking any meaningful price increases in 2016, except for currency changes, we took modest price increases in the past month that vary by country, but averaged out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis. 
Our 2017 outlook further assumes interest and other expenses net of approximately $40 million, an effective tax rate consistent with the prior year and that we continue buying shares under our existing share repurchase program, although we expect minimal benefit to diluted earnings per share from the currently planned repurchases. 
Taking all this into account, our outlook calls for net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single-digit percentage from last year's $3.55 per share on a GAAP basis and to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage over the adjusted $3.75 per share last year. We also plan to manage the balance sheet efficiently with the particular focus on not growing net inventories in order to generate net cash from operating activities of approximately $700 million and free cash flow of approximately $450 million for the full year. The difference of $250 million represents our planned capital expenditures. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike Kowalski for some brief comments before we open the call to your questions."

I just want to address a few matters, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. 
First, we began an external search in early February to fill the role of Chief Executive Officer when Frederic Cumenal stepped down from that position, and I agreed to become interim CEO. We assumed that it may take time to find the right person with broad experience in brand management with a global perspective and who possesses strong leadership skills to motivate and inspire our Tiffany colleagues around the world. 
Second, although Tiffany and the luxury industry faced numerous macro challenges in 2016, we have not been pleased with our financial performance. While we were able to realize important improvement in gross margin and generate a healthy level of free cash flow, sales results were disappointing, and we were unable to generate sales leverage on our fixed costs. 
Third, and most importantly, we believe that Tiffany has a set of powerful strategies that can propel our business forward in the long term. With the right leadership and pace of execution, we believe there are substantial opportunities to grow our business. Specifically, we are focused on increasing the rate of new product introductions and innovations. And we recently announced the hiring of Reed Krakoff to serve as Chief Artistic Officer. We're also focused on maximizing our marketing effectiveness and building stronger relationships with customers, optimizing our store network and improving our business operations and processes, all while effectively managing our capital and costs. And we remain absolutely committed to our industry-leading effort around corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability, an area of great importance and relevance to us and, we believe, to our customers as well. In essence, we are committed to executing with excellence the strategies that with -- are within our control and pursuing long-term growth opportunities. 
This May 5, we'll mark the 30th anniversary of Tiffany's initial public offering in 1987. Since then, our company has generally produced strong returns for shareholders. And we intend to pursue opportunities that can continue to generate attractive total shareholder returns in the future. 
In my role as interim CEO, I have been actively engaged with the management teams and employees across our business. And I have no doubt that my colleagues at all levels share an extraordinary sense of dedication and passion for our company. I truly appreciate their efforts.

A lot of this is just basic blocking and tackling. We have a global procurement group that's relatively early in its formation, which is doing extremely good work. As we have get our arms around those global spend pools, we're able to negotiate harder and better and with more visibility and with more impact. That's a key initiative. I mentioned earlier the jewelry design center. I don't want to overplay it, but I certainly don't want to undersell it either. Being able to do fast prototyping on the idea that Reed and his team are generating is going to put us well down the path of being able to design for efficiency in all of our internal production processes. And frankly, it will also allow us for those items that we do choose put out to external bid be a lot tighter in that process as well. Clearly, the systems that we have available to us today are going to be optimized in the years ahead. And that's going to allow us to do better assortment planning. And with better assortment planning, we'll be able to do more high-level analytics that go along with that. We'll be able to get pricing in a lot more discrete ways. And we're going to be able to make sure that in each store, we have the right product at the right time or as much as practical versus what we have today. And we have several pretty exciting initiatives all earmarked in that regard. The plant structure, as I indicated earlier, is also doing a lot of really good work to cross-train, so that we have the ability to do multiple operation in multiple sites, and that's allowing us to extract a lot more value. And we're starting to play with some different technologies as well, which, we think, over time, could lead to some additional productivity gains.

As I think everyone on the call knows, part of the magic of Tiffany over the very, very many years has been our ability to balance that -- those categories and to move forward with them all simultaneously. Critical to that has always been our ability to drive lower-price-point sales because of the very favorable margin profile of that category. And once again, as you've heard before, we've stabilized that segment. We also feel very good about the fashion segment gold -- the fashion part of the segment.

Because when I look historically about over the last 17 years or at least over the last 10, you guys have done a great job when you announced Tiffany T Collection, the keys collection, the marketing around the Celebration Rings. So when you basically come out with the new category, it does very well. And I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about launching new collections and versus launching just additional SKUs within existing collections. And then lastly, around SKU count, do you think about increasing gross SKU counts but basically leaving net SKU counts flat to increase SKU count productivity? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you think this all plays out from a product newness perspective."

So probably more or less, your suggestion that, combined with the pace of new product introductions, an increased pace of new product, new collection introductions, net SKU count probably will stay where it is. It might even continue to decline a bit. But the key will be building -- growth is going to come from a combination of one new collection. And if you look at the evolution of our assortment over the past 10 years, far more concentrated today in important collections than it was 10 years ago in multiple smaller collections. So we want new collections but they have to be big and they need to be impactful. And of course, Tiffany T is -- would be the model -- one of the models going forward for that. At the same time, we need to be mindful that existing collections Return to Tiffany and Return to Tiffany Love, they have to be renewed and we have to continue to animate and increase and inject energy into those. So it's going to be, as it always is, a very careful balance of making sure that we have significant new collections that marketing can drive at the same time making sure that the core collections that are still the -- that will always be the majority of sales, continue to grow at the same time.

Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances except as required by applicable law or regulation. 
Now let's proceed. As an overview, Tiffany's first quarter results showed a slight increase in worldwide net sales and higher growth in net earnings, and our balance sheet remains strong. We believe that those results keep us on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance in light of an expectation for continued challenges from macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical uncertainty and a strong U.S. dollar. 
In terms of the first quarter, starting with the top line, regional results included a total sales increase in Asia-Pacific, contrasting with modest declines in the Americas, Japan and Europe, although sales in Europe actually increased on a constant exchange rate basis. 
In our largest region, the Americas, total and comparable store sales declined in the first quarter primarily due to lower jewelry unit volume. The U.S. experienced geographically mixed but generally soft performance across the country, which we attributed to varying degrees of weakness in both local and foreign tourist demand. Elsewhere, our business in Canada was soft while we were pleased to experience solid growth in our stores in Latin America. During the first quarter, we completed the major renovation of our store on Union Square in San Francisco, and earlier this month, we relaunched our renovated and expanded store on Burrard Street in Vancouver. Both stores have extraordinary new presentations to serve customers in those important markets. 
Our second largest region is Asia-Pacific, where an increase in total sales was due to higher wholesale sales and the effect of new store openings over the past year while comps declined slightly. The regional sales growth was entirely driven by increased jewelry unit volume, with the decline in the average price per unit sold. We attributed the continuation of strong sales growth in Mainland China to local customers spending. Sales in Hong Kong continued to decline, which we attribute to lower Chinese tourist spending, but the sales decline was only modest due to our increased focus on local clientele in that market. And we continue to experience varying degrees of softness elsewhere in the region. During the quarter, we closed 1 store in China that had temporarily overlapped with a new store opened last year, and we relocated a store in Korea. 
Turning to Japan. Total sales and comparable store sales declined slightly in the first quarter with minimal changes in jewelry unit volume and average price. Total sales also declined in part due to lower wholesale sales. We were pleased to see higher spending attributed to local customers that we believe represent about 90% of our sales in Japan. As part of our efforts to further strengthen local customer sales in the important bridal category, we've recently expanded the presence of our major Ginza store in Tokyo by opening a nearby boutique dedicated to that category. We've been pleased with customer's reaction to this type of experience. 
On the other hand, we continued to see a decline in sales attributed to Chinese tourists in Japan. However, as you may recall, we benefited in the first quarter of 2016 from higher sales attributed to Chinese tourists in Japan, which then tapered off in the second quarter. During the first quarter, we closed 1 store in Japan. 
Our business continues to gradually improve in Europe. Total and comp store sales in the quarter declined modestly as reported. As we saw in 2016, there were varying degrees of softness across Continental Europe, but we were pleased to see a resumption of sales growth in France in the first quarter. Total and comp store sales rose modestly on a constant exchange rate basis as we have been seeing healthy local currency sales growth in the U.K. that we attribute partly to increased demand by local customers and partly to multinational foreign tourist spending in London tied to the weak British pound. There were modest changes in the average price per jewelry unit sold and unit volume. Sales in the other segment had a big increase in the quarter but that was mostly due to an increase in our wholesale sales of diamonds with comp store sales roughly unchanged. 
Given our focus on improving top line growth going forward, it's worth reiterating 4 important global strategies to do so: first, continuing to pursue clienteling and CRM strategies to more effectively engage with customers and enhance their Tiffany experience; second, adding newness to the product assortment at a faster pace; third, optimizing the global distribution base through store openings, renovations, relocations and, in limited cases, some closings; and fourth, enhancing brand awareness through effective marketing communication. We believe these are the key ingredients to achieve better sales growth in the future by increasing the frequency of customer store visit and improvement with conversion rate. 
Rounding out the sales review, global e-commerce sales were roughly unchanged in the first quarter, but as we've said before, our website served an important dual function of generating online sales while also delivering marketing communication that drives awareness and store traffic. 
From a product perspective in the first quarter, we were pleased with fashion jewelry sales which, once again, performed relatively better than our other categories. Fashion jewelry, which represented 33% of worldwide sales in 2016, primarily consists of non-gemstone gold and silver jewelry. In the first quarter, while gold jewelry sales led the category's growth, highlighted by the Tiffany T collection, we were pleased that fashion silver jewelry sales were modestly above last year led by the return to Tiffany collection. Sales of the 1837 collection were also up nicely. 
And a few weeks ago, we launched the new hardware collection, which spanned gold and silver in a range of styles and price points, and customer feedback has been positive. Looking forward, additional designs in the T and hardware collections are planned for this fall. 
Designer jewelry sales, which represented 12% of worldwide sales in 2016, posted healthy growth in the quarter. The category consists of the designs with Elsa Peretti, highlighted by her Diamonds by the Yard and open heart designs; and the designs of Paloma Picasso which include her new Paloma's Melody collection. 
The engagement jewelry and wedding bands category, which represented 28% of worldwide sales in 2016, continued to underperform relative to our expectation and to the prior year. And performance in the high fine and solitaire jewelry category, which represented approximately 20% of worldwide sales in 2016, was mixed. Our Victoria collection continued to perform well, though this performance was offset by softness in other collections in this category. 
And regarding high jewelry, we were pleased with our annual Blue Book event that we held in New York in April. The event serves to highlight our extraordinary designs and craftsmanship and to strengthen our relationships with our top clients from around the world. We were pleased with the response to the event. 
I should add that our sales growth in the watch category is encouraging, albeit off of a low single-digit percentage of sales base, as we continue to expand brand awareness in that category through advertising and by introducing new designs that are planned for later this year. 
Rounding out the product overview, I'll just add that we are looking forward to this fall when we plan to launch our luxury accessories collection and a new signature fragrance for women. And now mark Erceg will comment on additional financial highlights as well as our outlook. Mark?"
35576,428847931,1213593,"Tiffany & Co., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, May 24, 2017",2017-05-24,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Welcome, everyone. Looking at the rest of the income statement, gross margin improved by 80 basis points in the first quarter despite an increase in wholesale diamond sales. Several factors accounted for the increase. First, we continue to b",1068,"Thanks, Mark. Welcome, everyone. Looking at the rest of the income statement, gross margin improved by 80 basis points in the first quarter despite an increase in wholesale diamond sales. Several factors accounted for the increase. First, we continue to benefit from favorable product input costs, particularly lower diameter acquisition costs, where we have seen favorable trends over the past couple of years. Second, after not taking any meaningful price increases in 2016, expect to adjust for weakening foreign currencies, we took modest pricing actions in the quarter that varied by country but which averaged out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis. Finally, we also benefited from favorable product sales mix as a percentage of total sales coming from fashion jewelry rose during the quarter. 
With respect to SG&A, you may recall that during our last call, we commented that one of our priorities is to lower the rate of SG&A expense growth as a percent of sales. And while it goes without saying that we need better sales growth to achieve that objective on a sustainable basis, we were very pleased to see that first quarter SG&A expense, which included some severance costs, rose less than 1%. Now with that said, we do expect higher rates of SG&A expense growth throughout the remaining quarters of the year as we invest in various growth initiatives. With improvement in both gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio, Tiffany's operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 16.2% in the quarter from 15.1% last year. Net interest and other expenses declined in the first quarter due to lower interest expense. 
Our effective tax rate was 31.7% in the quarter which is lower than expected largely due to the implementation of a new accounting standard related to the treatment of the excess tax benefits associated with divesting or exercise of stock-based compensation. Importantly, this new standard has the potential to create some level of additional earnings volatility in our future results as the amount of the excess tax benefit or shortfall will vary with changes in the stock price. 
And finally, before leaving the income statement, it is probably worth mentioning that our tax rate last year was 29%, which you may recall benefited from the conclusion of a tax examination in the first quarter of 2016. 
Turning to the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. At April 30, we had $960 million of cash and short-term investments which was up $170 million versus a year ago. Lower inventory contributed to that increase with net inventory at April 30 down 5% versus a year ago, although we still expect full year inventory to finish flat versus the prior year-end. As we've stated in the past, we're focused on managing inventories more efficiently both through process improvements and by leveraging a new inventory management system which we anticipate will be fully implemented over the next several years. Receivables were 5% higher than a year ago. Much of that was timing of collections related to the quarter ending on a Sunday. About 1/3 of our receivables are related to our in-house customer financing offerings, while the majority of our accounts receivable balances are related to other third parties such as credit card companies, department store operators and wholesale customers. 
There's nothing particularly noteworthy regarding capital expenditures in the first quarter outside of saying we remain on track to spend about $250 million for the full year. We spent approximately $12 million in purchasing 123,000 shares during the quarter. And as of April 30, 2017, we had $299 million remaining available under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
We're pleased with our strong balance sheet and high rate of cash conversion, which collectively enables us to continue investing in our business while also providing us with an opportunity to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
And now that we've pretty much built out our manufacturing and diamond supply chain, which we believe provides us with important strategic and competitive advantages in the areas of the supply availability, product innovation, product cost and corporate social responsibility, we are well positioned to maintain a strong balance sheet and generate strong cash flow going forward. 
Finally, in terms of our outlook, first quarter results have not fundamentally changed our view for the full year. Specifically, our annual forecast calls for total sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year and we are still assuming an increase in operating margin just at a slower rate of growth than in the first quarter. We expect that the increase in operating margin will be entirely due to an increase in gross margin with SG&A expense growing slightly above sales growth. We also expect net interest and other expenses of approximately $40 million, an all-in effective income tax rate consistent with the prior year and the continued repurchasing of shares, although for the full year, we expect minimal benefits to diluted earnings per share growth from those repurchases. Our 2017 outlook continues to call for net earnings per diluted share to increase by high single-digit percentage from last year's $3.55 on a GAAP basis and to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage over last year's adjusted EPS of $3.25 per share. 
So to summarize today's call, while our first quarter bottom line results slightly exceeded our near-term expectations, they certainly do not satisfy our longer-term ambition. We believe this is an important distinction because tight cost control and disciplined cash management are prerequisites for a well-run business, but sustainable long-term success can only be achieved when the top line is growing consistently. 
With this in mind, we are not overly focused on macroeconomic factors we cannot directly influence. Instead, we remain focused on and excited about the top line growth initiatives we are pursuing, namely our efforts to bring more product newness and innovation to our customers while simultaneously enhancing the customer experience, sharpening our marketing efforts and optimizing our store network. We also believe we have the potential to improve our financial performance by further leveraging our vertically integrated supply chain and by capitalizing on what we believe is a growing global awareness and affinity for the Tiffany brand by consumers all around the world. We continue to strongly believe that executing our strategies in a disciplined way will create sustainable shareholder value in the years ahead. I'll now turn the call back to Mark."

Total and comp store sales rose modestly on a constant exchange rate basis as we have been seeing healthy local currency sales growth in the U.K. that we attribute partly to increased demand by local customers and partly to multinational foreign tourist spending in London tied to the weak British pound. There were modest changes in the average price per jewelry unit sold and unit volume. Sales in the other segment had a big increase in the quarter but that was mostly due to an increase in our wholesale sales of diamonds with comp store sales roughly unchanged. 
Given our focus on improving top line growth going forward, it's worth reiterating 4 important global strategies to do so: first, continuing to pursue clienteling and CRM strategies to more effectively engage with customers and enhance their Tiffany experience; second, adding newness to the product assortment at a faster pace; third, optimizing the global distribution base through store openings, renovations, relocations and, in limited cases, some closings; and fourth, enhancing brand awareness through effective marketing communication. We believe these are the key ingredients to achieve better sales growth in the future by increasing the frequency of customer store visit and improvement with conversion rate. 
Rounding out the sales review, global e-commerce sales were roughly unchanged in the first quarter, but as we've said before, our website served an important dual function of generating online sales while also delivering marketing communication that drives awareness and store traffic. From a product perspective in the first quarter, we were pleased with fashion jewelry sales which, once again, performed relatively better than our other categories. Fashion jewelry, which represented 33% of worldwide sales in 2016, primarily consists of non-gemstone gold and silver jewelry. 
In the first quarter, while gold jewelry sales led the category's growth, highlighted by the Tiffany T collection, we were pleased that fashion silver jewelry sales were modestly above last year led by the return to Tiffany collection. Sales of the 1837 collection were also up nicely. And a few weeks ago, we launched the new hardware collection, which spanned gold and silver in a range of styles and price points, and customer feedback has been positive. Looking forward, additional designs in the T and hardware collections are planned for this fall. 
Designer jewelry sales, which represented 12% of worldwide sales in 2016, posted healthy growth in the quarter. The category consists of the designs of Elsa Peretti, highlighted by her Diamonds by the Yard and open heart designs; and the designs of Paloma Picasso which include her new Paloma's Melody collection. 
The engagement jewelry and wedding bands category, which represented 28% of worldwide sales in 2016, continued to underperform relative to our expectation and to the prior year. And performance in the high fine and solitaire jewelry category, which represented approximately 20% of worldwide sales in 2016, was mixed. Our Victoria collection continued to perform well, though this performance was offset by softness in other collections in this category. 
And regarding high jewelry, we were pleased with our annual Blue Book event that we held in New York in April. The event serves to highlight our extraordinary designs and craftsmanship and to strengthen our relationships with our top clients from around the world. We were pleased with the response to the event. 
I should add that our sales growth in the watch category is encouraging, albeit off of a low single-digit percentage of sales base, as we continue to expand brand awareness in that category through advertising and by introducing new designs that are planned for later this year. 
Rounding out the product overview, I'll just add that we are looking forward to this fall when we plan to launch our luxury accessories collection and a new signature fragrance for women. 
And now Mark Erceg will comment on additional financial highlights as well as our outlook. Mark?"

Looking at the rest of the income statement, gross margin improved by 80 basis points in the first quarter despite an increase in wholesale diamond sales. Several factors accounted for the increase. First, we continue to b",1066,"Thanks, Mark. Welcome, everyone. Looking at the rest of the income statement, gross margin improved by 80 basis points in the first quarter despite an increase in wholesale diamond sales. Several factors accounted for the increase. First, we continue to benefit from favorable product input costs, particularly lower diamond acquisition costs, where we have seen favorable trends over the past couple of years. Second, after not taking any meaningful price increases in 2016, expect to adjust for weakening foreign currencies, we took modest pricing actions in the quarter that varied by country but which averaged out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis. Finally, we also benefited from favorable product sales mix as the percentage of total sales coming from fashion jewelry rose during the quarter. 
With respect to SG&A, you may recall that during our last call, we commented that one of our priorities is to lower the rate of SG&A expense growth as a percent of sales. And while it goes without saying that we need better sales growth to achieve that objective on a sustainable basis, we were very pleased to see that first quarter SG&A expense, which included some severance costs, rose less than 1%. Now with that said, we do expect higher rates of SG&A expense growth throughout the remaining quarters of the year as we invest in various growth initiatives. 
With improvement in both gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio, Tiffany's operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 16.2% in the quarter from 15.1% last year. 
Net interest and other expenses declined in the first quarter due to lower interest expense. Our effective tax rate was 31.7% in the quarter, which was lower than expected largely due to the implementation of a new accounting standard related to the treatment of the excess tax benefits associated with divesting or exercise of stock-based compensation. Importantly, this new standard has the potential to create some level of additional earnings volatility in our future results as the amount of the excess tax benefit or shortfall will vary with changes in the stock price. 
And finally, before leaving the income statement, it is probably worth mentioning that our tax rate last year was 29%, which you may recall benefited from the conclusion of a tax examination in the first quarter of 2016. 
Turning to the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. At April 30, we had $960 million of cash and short-term investments, which was up $170 million versus a year ago. Lower inventory contributed to that increase with net inventory at April 30 down 5% versus a year ago, although we still expect full year inventory to finish flat versus the prior year-end. 
As we've stated in the past, we're focused on managing inventories more efficiently both through process improvements and by leveraging a new inventory management system, which we anticipate will be fully implemented over the next several years. 
Receivables were 5% higher than a year ago. Much of that was timing of collections related to the quarter ending on a Sunday. About 1/3 of our receivables are related to our in-house customer financing offerings, while the majority of our accounts receivable balances are related to other third parties such as credit card companies, department store operators and wholesale customers. 
There's nothing particularly noteworthy regarding capital expenditures in the first quarter outside of saying we remain on track to spend about $250 million for the full year. We spent approximately $12 million repurchasing 123,000 shares during the quarter. And as of April 30, 2017, we had $299 million remaining available under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
We're pleased with our strong balance sheet and high rate of cash conversion, which collectively enables us to continue investing in our business while also providing us with an opportunity to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
And now that we've pretty much built out our manufacturing and diamond supply chain, which we believe provides us with important strategic and competitive advantages in the areas of supply availability, product innovation, product cost and corporate social responsibility, we are well positioned to maintain a strong balance sheet and generate strong cash flow going forward. 
Finally, in terms of our outlook, first quarter results have not fundamentally changed our view for the full year. Specifically, our annual forecast calls for total sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year, and we are still assuming an increase in operating margin just at a slower rate of growth than in the first quarter. We expect that the increase in operating margin will be entirely due to an increase in gross margin with SG&A expense growing slightly above sales growth. 
We also expect net interest and other expenses of approximately $40 million, an all-in effective income tax rate consistent with the prior year and the continued repurchasing of shares, although for the full year, we expect minimal benefits to diluted earnings per share growth from those repurchases. 
Our 2017 outlook continues to call for net earnings per diluted share to increase by high single-digit percentage from last year's $3.55 on a GAAP basis and to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage over last year's adjusted EPS of $3.25 per share. 
So to summarize today's call, while our first quarter bottom line results slightly exceeded our near-term expectations, they certainly do not satisfy our longer-term ambition. We believe this is an important distinction because tight cost control and disciplined cash management are prerequisites for a well-run business, but sustainable long-term success can only be achieved when the top line is growing consistently. 
With this in mind, we are not overly focused on macroeconomic factors we cannot directly influence. Instead, we remain focused on and excited about the top line growth initiatives we are pursuing, namely our efforts to bring more product newness and innovation to our customers while simultaneously enhancing the customer experience, sharpening our marketing efforts and optimizing our store network. 
We also believe we have the potential to improve our financial performance by further leveraging our vertically integrated supply chain and by capitalizing on what we believe is a growing global awareness and affinity for the Tiffany brand by consumers all around the world. We continue to strongly believe that executing our strategies in a disciplined way will create sustainable shareholder value in the years ahead.

Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances except as required by applicable law or regulation. 
Now let's proceed. As an overview, Tiffany's first quarter results showed a slight increase in worldwide net sales and higher growth in net earnings, and our balance sheet remains strong. We believe that those results keep us on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance in light of an expectation for continued challenges from macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical uncertainty and a strong U.S. dollar. 
In terms of the first quarter, starting with the top line, regional results included a total sales increase in Asia-Pacific, contrasting with modest declines in the Americas, Japan and Europe, although sales in Europe actually increased on a constant exchange rate basis. 
In our largest region, the Americas, total and comparable store sales declined in the first quarter primarily due to lower jewelry unit volume. The U.S. experienced geographically mixed but generally soft performance across the country, which we attributed to varying degrees of weakness in both local and foreign tourist demand. Elsewhere, our business in Canada was soft while we were pleased to experience solid growth in our stores in Latin America. 
During the first quarter, we completed the major renovation of our store on Union Square in San Francisco, and earlier this month, we relaunched our renovated and expanded store on Burrard Street in Vancouver. Both stores have extraordinary new presentations to serve customers in those important markets. 
Our second largest region is Asia-Pacific, where an increase in total sales was due to higher wholesale sales and the effect of new store openings over the past year while comps declined slightly. The regional sales growth was entirely driven by increased jewelry unit volume, with the decline in the average price per unit sold. We attributed the continuation of strong sales growth in Mainland China to local customer spending. 
Sales in Hong Kong continued to decline, which we attribute to lower Chinese tourist spending, but the sales decline was only modest due to our increased focus on local clientele in that market. And we continued to experience varying degrees of softness elsewhere in the region. During the quarter, we closed 1 store in China that had temporarily overlapped with a new store opened last year, and we relocated a store in Korea. 
Turning to Japan. Total sales and comparable store sales declined slightly in the first quarter with minimal changes in jewelry unit volume and average price. Total sales also declined in part due to lower wholesale sales. We were pleased to see higher spending attributed to local customers who we believe represent about 90% of our sales in Japan. As part of our efforts to further strengthen local customer sales in the important bridal category, we've recently expanded the presence of our major Ginza store in Tokyo by opening a nearby boutique dedicated to that category. We've been pleased with customer's reaction to this heightened experience. 
On the other hand, we continued to see a decline in sales attributed to Chinese tourists in Japan. However, as you may recall, we benefited in the first quarter of 2016 from higher sales attributed to Chinese tourists in Japan, which then tapered off in the second quarter. During the first quarter, we closed 1 store in Japan. 
Our business continues to gradually improve in Europe. Total and comp store sales in the quarter declined modestly as reported. As we saw in 2016, there were varying degrees of softness across Continental Europe, but we were pleased to see a resumption of sales growth in France in the first quarter. Total and comp store sales rose modestly on a constant exchange rate basis as we have been seeing healthy local currency sales growth in the U.K. that we attribute partly to increased demand by local customers and partly to multinational foreign tourist spending in London tied to the weak British pound.

We've been pleased with customer's reaction to this heightened experience. 
On the other hand, we continued to see a decline in sales attributed to Chinese tourists in Japan. However, as you may recall, we benefited in the first quarter of 2016 from higher sales attributed to Chinese tourists in Japan, which then tapered off in the second quarter. During the first quarter, we closed 1 store in Japan. 
Our business continues to gradually improve in Europe. Total and comp store sales in the quarter declined modestly as reported. As we saw in 2016, there were varying degrees of softness across Continental Europe, but we were pleased to see a resumption of sales growth in France in the first quarter. Total and comp store sales rose modestly on a constant exchange rate basis as we have been seeing healthy local currency sales growth in the U.K. that we attribute partly to increased demand by local customers and partly to multinational foreign tourist spending in London tied to the weak British pound. There were modest changes in the average price per jewelry unit sold and unit volume. Sales in the other segments had a big increase in the quarter but that was mostly due to an increase in our wholesale sales of diamonds with comp store sales roughly unchanged. 
Given our focus on improving top line growth going forward, it's worth reiterating 4 important global strategies to do so: first, continuing to pursue clienteling and CRM strategies to more effectively engage with customers and enhance their Tiffany experience; second, adding newness to the product assortment at a faster pace; third, optimizing the global distribution base through store openings, renovations, relocations and, in limited cases, some closings; and fourth, enhancing brand awareness through effective marketing communication. We believe these are the key ingredients to achieve better sales growth in the future by increasing the frequency of customer store visit and improving the conversion rate. 
Rounding out the sales review, global e-commerce sales were roughly unchanged in the first quarter, but as we've said before, our website served an important dual function of generating online sales while also delivering marketing communication that drives awareness and store traffic. From a product perspective in the first quarter, we were pleased with fashion jewelry sales which, once again, performed relatively better than our other categories. Fashion jewelry, which represented 33% of worldwide sales in 2016, primarily consists of non-gemstone gold and silver jewelry. 
In the first quarter, while gold jewelry sales led the category's growth, highlighted by the Tiffany T collection, we were pleased that fashion silver jewelry sales were modestly above last year led by the Return to Tiffany collection. Sales of the 1837 collection were also up nicely. And a few weeks ago, we launched the new hardware collection, which spanned gold and silver in a range of styles and price points, and customer feedback has been positive. Looking forward, additional designs in the T and hardware collections are planned for this fall. 
Designer jewelry sales, which represented 12% of worldwide sales in 2016, posted healthy growth in the quarter. The category consists of the designs of Elsa Peretti, highlighted by her Diamonds by the Yard and open heart designs; and the designs of Paloma Picasso which include her new Paloma's Melody collection. 
The engagement jewelry and wedding bands category, which represented 28% of worldwide sales in 2016, continued to underperform relative to our expectation and to the prior year. And performance in the high fine and solitaire jewelry category, which represented approximately 20% of worldwide sales in 2016, was mixed. Our Victoria collection continued to perform well, though this performance was offset by softness in other collections in this category. 
And regarding high jewelry, we were pleased with our annual Blue Book event that we held in New York in April. The event serves to highlight our extraordinary designs and craftsmanship and to strengthen our relationships with our top clients from around the world. We were pleased with the response to the event. 
I should add that our sales growth in the watch category is encouraging, albeit off of a low single-digit percentage of sales base, as we continue to expand brand awareness in that category through advertising and by introducing new designs that are planned for later this year. 
Rounding out the product overview, I'll just add that we are looking forward to this fall when we plan to launch our luxury accessories collection and a new signature fragrance for women. 
And now Mark Erceg will comment on additional financial highlights as well as our outlook. Mark?"

Looking at the rest of the income statement, gross margin improved by 80 basis points in the first quarter despite an increase in wholesale diamond sales. Several factors accounted for the increase. First, we continue to b",1066,"Thanks, Mark. Welcome, everyone. Looking at the rest of the income statement, gross margin improved by 80 basis points in the first quarter despite an increase in wholesale diamond sales. Several factors accounted for the increase. First, we continue to benefit from favorable product input costs, particularly lower diamond acquisition costs, where we have seen favorable trends over the past couple of years. Second, after not taking any meaningful price increases in 2016, expect to adjust for weakening foreign currencies, we took modest pricing actions in the quarter that varied by country but which averaged out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis. Finally, we also benefited from favorable product sales mix as the percentage of total sales coming from fashion jewelry rose during the quarter. 
With respect to SG&A, you may recall that during our last call, we commented that one of our priorities is to lower the rate of SG&A expense growth as a percent of sales. And while it goes without saying that we need better sales growth to achieve that objective on a sustainable basis, we were very pleased to see that first quarter SG&A expense, which included some severance costs, rose less than 1%. Now with that said, we do expect higher rates of SG&A expense growth throughout the remaining quarters of the year as we invest in various growth initiatives. 
With improvement in both gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio, Tiffany's operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 16.2% in the quarter from 15.1% last year. 
Net interest and other expenses declined in the first quarter due to lower interest expense. Our effective tax rate was 31.7% in the quarter, which was lower than expected largely due to the implementation of a new accounting standard related to the treatment of the excess tax benefits associated with divesting or exercise of stock-based compensation. Importantly, this new standard has the potential to create some level of additional earnings volatility in our future results as the amount of the excess tax benefit or shortfall will vary with changes in the stock price. 
And finally, before leaving the income statement, it is probably worth mentioning that our tax rate last year was 29%, which you may recall benefited from the conclusion of a tax examination in the first quarter of 2016. 
Turning to the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. At April 30, we had $960 million of cash and short-term investments, which was up $170 million versus a year ago. Lower inventory contributed to that increase with net inventory at April 30 down 5% versus a year ago, although we still expect full year inventory to finish flat versus the prior year-end. 
As we've stated in the past, we're focused on managing inventories more efficiently both through process improvements and by leveraging a new inventory management system, which we anticipate will be fully implemented over the next several years. 
Receivables were 5% higher than a year ago. Much of that was timing of collections related to the quarter ending on a Sunday. About 1/3 of our receivables are related to our in-house customer financing offerings, while the majority of our accounts receivable balances are related to other third parties such as credit card companies, department store operators and wholesale customers. 
There's nothing particularly noteworthy regarding capital expenditures in the first quarter outside of saying we remain on track to spend about $250 million for the full year. We spent approximately $12 million repurchasing 123,000 shares during the quarter. And as of April 30, 2017, we had $299 million remaining available under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
We're pleased with our strong balance sheet and high rate of cash conversion, which collectively enables us to continue investing in our business while also providing us with an opportunity to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
And now that we've pretty much built out our manufacturing and diamond supply chain, which we believe provides us with important strategic and competitive advantages in the areas of supply availability, product innovation, product cost and corporate social responsibility, we are well positioned to maintain a strong balance sheet and generate strong cash flow going forward. 
Finally, in terms of our outlook, first quarter results have not fundamentally changed our view for the full year. Specifically, our annual forecast calls for total sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year, and we are still assuming an increase in operating margin just at a slower rate of growth than in the first quarter. We expect that the increase in operating margin will be entirely due to an increase in gross margin with SG&A expense growing slightly above sales growth. 
We also expect net interest and other expenses of approximately $40 million, an all-in effective income tax rate consistent with the prior year and the continued repurchasing of shares, although for the full year, we expect minimal benefits to diluted earnings per share growth from those repurchases. 
Our 2017 outlook continues to call for net earnings per diluted share to increase by high single-digit percentage from last year's $3.55 on a GAAP basis and to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage over last year's adjusted EPS of $3.25 per share. 
So to summarize today's call, while our first quarter bottom line results slightly exceeded our near-term expectations, they certainly do not satisfy our longer-term ambition. We believe this is an important distinction because tight cost control and disciplined cash management are prerequisites for a well-run business, but sustainable long-term success can only be achieved when the top line is growing consistently. 
With this in mind, we are not overly focused on macroeconomic factors we cannot directly influence. Instead, we remain focused on and excited about the top line growth initiatives we are pursuing, namely our efforts to bring more product newness and innovation to our customers while simultaneously enhancing the customer experience, sharpening our marketing efforts and optimizing our store network. 
We also believe we have the potential to improve our financial performance by further leveraging our vertically integrated supply chain and by capitalizing on what we believe is a growing global awareness and affinity for the Tiffany brand by consumers all around the world. We continue to strongly believe that executing our strategies in a disciplined way will create sustainable shareholder value in the years ahead. 
I'll now turn the call back to Mark."

I believe we can now proceed. 
In broad terms, we achieved modest top line growth in the second quarter due to higher wholesale sales in the Asia Pacific region, increased wholesale sales of diamonds and solid growth in e-commerce sales. However, with the exception of Japan, our region did not achieve comp store sales growth and we will obviously not be satisfied until they are meaningfully in positive territory. Having said that, the 3% worldwide net sales growth in the quarter, combined with a slightly higher operating margin, a reduction in other expenses and a lower tax rate, contributed to 9% net earnings growth that achieved our expectation. In addition, we added net of 2 stores during the quarter, opening 3 and closing 1. We moved forward with some exciting product initiatives, and of course, we announced the appointment of a new CEO. 
In terms of regional performance, let's start with the Americas where total sales rose slightly in the quarter and comparable store sales declined slightly. We were pleased with the strong increase in e-commerce sales which are not included in comps and we were also pleased to see an increase in total jewelry unit volume propelled by increases in the fashion and designer jewelry categories, even though there was a decline in average price tied to a shift in sales mix toward those categories. 
Sales performance across the region was varied with no significant geographical deviations but we've attributed the overall comp store sales weakness this year to lower foreign tourist spending. I should add that our New York flagship store has returned to; a relatively normal flow of customer traffic following the disruption immediately after the 2016 election and was not a drag on overall sales in the quarter. 
Rounding out the region, our sales in Canada were down just slightly while we experienced reasonably good growth in Latin America. During the quarter, we completed the renovation of our important store on Burrard Street in Vancouver, and we were pleased to relocate our store in the International Plaza in Tampa, Florida. And the fourth floor of our New York flagship store is currently closed and being renovated to house our exciting new luxury accessories collection in an enticing environment when it debuts this fall. 
In the Asia Pacific region, a modest increase in total sales largely reflected higher wholesale sales and new store openings over the past year as well as higher jewelry units sold, primarily in the fashion and designer categories, though this increase in units was mostly offset by lower average price per unit sold. Comp store sales declined in the quarter as strong sales growth in Mainland China was more than offset by softness in most other countries which we attribute at least in part to lower Chinese tourist spending. We attribute the growth in Mainland China to local customer spending where we continue to build brand awareness. 
During the quarter, we opened 2 stores in the region, 1 in Korea in the Shinsegae Department Store; and one in Australia, in Sydney's Westfield Center, and we closed a store in Taiwan. 
In Japan, total sales and comps rose modestly on a GAAP basis and rose at a higher rate on a constant exchange rate basis. Total sales growth in the quarter was more than entirely due to the increase in comp store sales, while wholesale sales declined in the quarter. There was an increase in jewelry units sold. We also attribute the sales growth to increased spending by local customers, who represent the vast majority of our sales in Japan, while spending attributed to foreign tourists was roughly unchanged. The bridal category represents almost 40% of our sales in Japan, and as we noted on last quarter's call, we expanded the presence of our major Ginza store in Tokyo by opening a nearby boutique dedicated to bridal sales, and customers' reactions to the heightened experience have been very favorable. 
We were pleased with improving sales results in Europe in the quarter, driven by wholesale sales and new stores. It was growth in jewelry units sold across all categories. Comps were positive in several continental European countries. However, total European comps were down slightly including modestly lower sales in the U.K., which we attribute at least partly to a difficult year-over-year comparison. Keep in mind the spending that we attribute to foreign tourists in London had begun to accelerate near the end of the second quarter last year following the Brexit vote and the drop in the value of the pound. During the quarter, we were delighted to open another store in Italy, our third store in Milan and located at the Duomo. 
Rounding out the segments, the other segment posted a large increase in the quarter but it entirely resulted from an increase in our wholesale sale of diamonds. Comp store sales declined for our stores in the United Arab Emirates. 
We remain determined to improve top line growth by pursuing several important strategies. One relates to an accelerated pace of product introductions in the future across all categories. Another is pursuing clienteling to more effectively engage with customers and deliver an enhanced Tiffany experience. We also believe that further optimizing the global distribution base through store openings, renovations, relocations and some select closings is important. And lastly, we are focused on enhancing brand awareness through impactful marketing communications. The ultimate objective is to accelerate sales growth through the frequency of customer visits and improvement in the conversion rate. 
Lastly, I mentioned higher e-commerce sales from the Americas and we're pleased that it occurred globally as well. We are continually making enhancements to our website that add additional interesting content are visually appealing and that improve functionality. We continue to believe that our website serves a dual function by generating online sales and also effectively delivering our messaging. 
In terms of merchandising highlights, the second quarter reflected the continuation of the trends experienced in the first quarter. In essence, solid sales growth in both the fashion jewelry and designer jewelry categories contrasted with lower sales in both the engagement jewelry and the high fine and solitaire categories. Fashion jewelry primarily consists of non-gemstone gold and silver jewelry, and there was growth across the category. From a collection perspective, we especially call out the initial success of the new Tiffany hardware collection that we launched in April as well as relatively strong performance in our Tiffany T and 1837 collection. We also saw broad-based growth in designer jewelry sales for both Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso. Elsa's legendary designs include our open heart and Diamonds by the Yard collections. Paloma's designs are also long-standing favorites and customers have recently been especially excited about Paloma's Melody, which is her new chic and modern collection in gold and silver. As I mentioned, the high fine and solitaire jewelry category was again soft in the quarter with mixed results by collection, and the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category also underperformed again in the quarter. 
We're still in the early stages of growing our watch business and are progressing as we expand brand and product awareness in that category through advertising and by introducing new designs. In fact, we plan to introduce a new women's watch collection later this year. 
So those are a few highlights of jewelry and watch performance in the quarter. In the coming months, we have many new jewelry designs and styles across all categories scheduled for introduction. We've also just recently begun the rollout of our new signature fragrance collection and we look forward to the upcoming launch of our luxury accessories collection which we believe will entice customers with both functional and whimsical designs. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg who's joining us from overseas. Mark, before commenting on the financials, are there any observations from your travels that you'd like to share?"
35576,532892066,1286884,"Tiffany & Co., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2017",2017-08-24,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and yes. Thank you, Mark. I would like to say a few words which are unrelated to our quarterly results which I think might be instructive. Over these past months, it's been my honor and privilege to spend time with many of Tiffany'",1329,"Good morning, everyone, and yes. Thank you, Mark. I would like to say a few words which are unrelated to our quarterly results which I think might be instructive. Over these past months, it's been my honor and privilege to spend time with many of Tiffany's passionate and dedicated employees as I seek to learn as much as possible about the business. Right now, I'm touring several of our major Asian markets and I must say I've been very impressed by our stores, our product offerings and the professionalism of our sales associates, this energy which speaks to the tremendous growth opportunities Tiffany has in this vibrant and exciting part of the world. In addition to visiting many of our retail locations, I spent considerable time in our diamond cutting and polishing facilities which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage, our jewelry manufacturing plants. And very recently, I have the good fortune to attend and participate in our 2-day retail diamond authority training program for sales professionals. These experiences have given me a deeper appreciation for the level of craftsmanship and care that goes into making a Tiffany quality diamond from our exceedingly stringent standards for color and clarity and our selection of rough stones to the cutting, polishing and setting of diamonds in our own facilities with our own highly skilled and caring craftspeople and the presentation of each diamond to our valued customers by highly trained sales professionals in an iconic Tiffany Blue Box. 
And now having seen and experienced all this firsthand, I have a great deal of pride as well as a deeply held belief in Tiffany's ability to delight customers all around the world for at least another 180 years. 
So with that, let's review our second quarter financial results. As Mark mentioned, worldwide net sales increased 3% but comparable store sales declined slightly both on an as-reported and in constant currency. So clearly, we have more work to do in that regard. However, despite these comp store sales numbers, diluted earnings per share growth was strong at 10%. 
We were pleased to see gross margin expand by 40 basis points in the quarter particularly in light of the increase we had in wholesale diamond sales which, as we've indicated in the past, is gross margin dilutive. Lower product input costs, primarily from lower diamond acquisition costs; modest first quarter price adjustments, which averaged out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis; and favorable product mix all contributed to the improvement in gross margins. In addition, we continue to reengineer our global information system architecture and redesign our internal work processes in order to free up investment dollars. For example, we just implemented an automated transportation management system in the United States which is reducing store-to-store freight transportation costs. So taking all these factors into account, we continue to believe there will be a modest year-over-year increase in gross margin for the full year. 
Importantly, while we're very committed to effective cost control, our top priority remains achieving a higher rate of sustainable sales growth. Consistent with this, we will continue to redeploy a significant portion of any statements generated back into the business. We were also pleased with SG&A expenses during the quarter, which as a percentage of sales were essentially flat versus year ago, coming in at 43.4% in the second quarter versus 43.2% a year ago. As previously discussed, we remain committed to managing SG&A expense prudently by reducing costs where feasible while also reinvesting in the growth of our business. Thus, for the full year, we continue to assume SG&A expenses will increase at a slightly faster rate than sales growth as we invest behind our new signature women's fragrance, the launch of our new luxury accessories offerings and additional jewelry SKUs. 
Taken together, gross margin and SG&A expands a lot. Operating margin expanded 10 basis points in the second quarter. Net interest and other expenses were both lower the second quarter as with our effective tax rate. That said, our second quarter effective tax rate was higher than the first quarter due to a new accounting standard related to the treatment of the excess tax benefits associated with the vesting or exercise of stock-based compensation which we adopted in the first quarter. While this new accounting standard has the potential to create some level of additional earnings volatility in our future results as the amount of excess tax benefit or shortfall will vary with changes in the stock price, our outlook currently assumes a full year effective tax rate of approximately 33%. In addition to posting strong growth in diluted earnings per share, we generated a significant amount of free cash flow in the quarter bringing our first half total to roughly $200 million. Inventory performance contributed to our robust cash flow with net inventory at July 31 coming in at 4% below a year ago as we continue to optimize finished goods levels. However, due to the second half product introductions referenced earlier, we continue to plan for full year inventory to be flat versus prior year-end. Accounts receivable were up just 3% from a year ago, in line with our reported sales growth. Capital expenditures in the first half have been modestly lower than last year due to timing differences, so we remain on track to spend about $250 million for the full year. We invested $21 million to repurchase 230,000 shares of our common stock in the quarter which was slightly higher than the previous quarter. As of July 31, 2017, we had $278 million remaining available under our existing share repurchase authorization. Adding it all up, our balance sheet is in very good regard, with over $1 billion of cash and short-term investments at July 31 and a reasonable ratio of total debt to stockholders' equity which provide us with an opportunity to invest behind our strategic growth initiatives in order to achieve better top line growth while continuing to return excess cash to shareholders. 
Since we already commented on share repurchase, let's quickly remind everyone that we recently increased the quarterly cash dividend by 11% which was our 16th increase in the past 15 years. Finally, in terms of our outlook, results in the first and second quarter have not fundamentally changed our view for the full year. We have a number of strategic initiatives in place related to new products, marketing campaigns and enhancing the in-store experience for customers, all of which we believe can contribute to this modest and gradual top line improvement as the year progresses. So while we have confidence in our growth plans, we remain mindful of an uncertain external environment. So as a result, we continue to expect total sales for the full year to increase by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year. 
On the bottom line we continue to expect net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single digit percentage from last year's $3.55 on a GAAP basis and to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage over last year's adjusted EPS of $3.75 per share. For the second half of the year, we expect an increase in net earnings per diluted share versus a year ago with all of the increase coming in the fourth quarter. 
Relative to cash, we remain on pace with our expectations to deliver approximately $700 million of net operating cash flow and approximately $450 million of free cash flow for the full year. 
So in closing, we continue to believe strongly that executing our top line growth strategies in a disciplined way while simultaneously reengineering our global information system architecture and redesigning our internal work processes to free up investment dollars is the right path forward in order to delight our customers and create sustainable shareholder value in the years ahead, and we'll be looking forward to updating you on our progress during future calls. I'll now turn the call back over to Mark."

Having said that, the 3% worldwide net sales growth in the quarter, combined with a slightly higher operating margin, a reduction in other expenses and a lower tax rate, contributed to 9% net earnings growth that achieved our expectation. 
In addition, we added net of 2 stores during the quarter, opening 3 and closing 1. We moved forward with some exciting product initiatives, and of course, we announced the appointment of a new CEO. 
In terms of regional performance, let's start with the Americas where total sales rose slightly in the quarter and comparable store sales declined slightly. We were pleased with the strong increase in e-commerce sales, which are not included in comps, and we were also pleased to see an increase in total jewelry unit volume propelled by increases in the fashion and designer jewelry categories even though there was a decline in average price tied to a shift in sales mix toward those categories. 
Sales performance across the region was varied with no significant geographical deviations, but we've attributed the overall comp store sales weakness this year to lower foreign tourist spending. I should add that our New York flagship store has returned to a relatively normal flow of customer traffic following the disruption immediately after the 2016 election and was not a drag on overall sales in the quarter. 
Rounding out the region, our sales in Canada were down just slightly while we experienced reasonably good growth in Latin America. During the quarter, we completed the renovation of our important store on Burrard Street in Vancouver, and we were pleased to relocate our store in the International Plaza in Tampa, Florida. And the fourth floor of our New York flagship store is currently closed and being renovated to house our exciting new luxury accessories collection in an enticing environment when it debuts this fall. 
In the Asia Pacific region, a modest increase in total sales largely reflected higher wholesale sales and new store openings over the past year as well as higher jewelry units sold, primarily in the fashion and designer categories, though this increase in units was mostly offset by lower average price per unit sold. Comp store sales declined in the quarter as strong sales growth in Mainland China was more than offset by softness in most other countries, which we attribute at least in part to lower Chinese tourist spending. We attribute the growth in Mainland China to local customer spending where we continue to build brand awareness. 
During the quarter, we opened 2 stores in the region, one in Korea in the Shinsegae Department Store, and one in Australia in Sydney's Westfield center, and we closed a store in Taiwan. 
In Japan, total sales and comps rose modestly on a GAAP basis and rose at a higher rate on a constant exchange rate basis. Total sales growth in the quarter was more than entirely due to the increase in comp store sales while wholesale sales declined in the quarter. There was an increase in jewelry units sold. We also attribute the sales growth to increased spending by local customers who represent the vast majority of our sales in Japan while spending attributed to foreign tourists was roughly unchanged. The bridal category represents almost 40% of our sales in Japan, and as we noted on last quarter's call, we expanded the presence of our major Ginza store in Tokyo by opening a nearby boutique dedicated to bridal sales, and customers' reactions to the heightened experience have been very favorable. 
We were pleased with improving sales results in Europe in the quarter, driven by wholesale sales and new stores. There was growth in jewelry units sold across all categories. Comps were positive in several Continental European countries. However, total European comps were down slightly including modestly lower sales in the U.K., which we attribute at least partly to a difficult year-over-year comparison. Keep in mind the spending that we attribute to foreign tourists in London had begun to accelerate near the end of the second quarter last year following the Brexit vote and the drop in the value of the pound. During the quarter, we were delighted to open another store in Italy, our third store in Milan and located at the Duomo. 
Rounding out the segments, the other segment posted a large increase in the quarter, but it entirely resulted from an increase in our wholesale sale of diamonds. Comp store sales declined for our stores in United Arab Emirates. 
We remain determined to improve top line growth by pursuing several important strategies. One relates to an accelerated pace of product introductions in the future across all categories. Another is pursuing clienteling to more effectively engage with customers and deliver an enhanced Tiffany experience. We also believe that further optimizing the global distribution base through store openings, renovations, relocations and some select closings is important. And lastly, we are focused on enhancing brand awareness through impactful marketing communications. The ultimate objective is to accelerate sales growth through the frequency of customer visits and improvement in the conversion rate. 
Lastly, I mentioned higher e-commerce sales from the Americas and we're pleased that it occurred globally as well. We are continually making enhancements to our website that add additional interesting content, are visually appealing and that improve functionality. We continue to believe that our website serves a dual function by generating online sales and also effectively delivering our messaging. 
In terms of merchandising highlights, the second quarter reflected a continuation of the trends experienced in the first quarter. In essence, solid sales growth in both the fashion jewelry and designer jewelry categories contrasted with lower sales in both the engagement jewelry and the high fine and solitaire categories. 
Fashion jewelry primarily consists of non-gemstone gold and silver jewelry and there was growth across the category. From a collection perspective, we especially call out the initial success of the new Tiffany HardWear collection that we launched in April as well as relatively strong performance in our Tiffany T and 1837 collection. 
We also saw broad-based growth in designer jewelry sales for both Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso. Elsa's legendary designs include our Open Heart and Diamonds by the Yard collections. Paloma's designs are also long-standing favorites and customers have recently been especially excited about Paloma's Melody, which is her new chic and modern collection in gold and silver. 
As I mentioned, the high fine and solitaire jewelry category was again soft in the quarter with mixed results by collection. And the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category also underperformed again in the quarter. 
We're still in the early stages of growing our watch business and are progressing as we expand brand and product awareness in that category through advertising and by introducing new designs. In fact, we plan to introduce a new women's watch collection later this year. 
So those are a few highlights of jewelry and watch performance in the quarter. In the coming months, we have many new jewelry designs and styles across all categories scheduled for introduction. 
We have also just recently begun the rollout of our new signature fragrance collection, and we look forward to the upcoming launch of our luxury accessories collection, which we believe will entice customers with both functional and whimsical designs. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg who is joining us from overseas. Mark, before commenting on the financials, are there any observations from your travels that you'd like to share?"
35576,532892066,1286919,"Tiffany & Co., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2017",2017-08-24,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and yes. Thank you, Mark. I would like to say a few words, which are unrelated to our quarterly results, which I think might be instructive. Over these past months, it's been my honor and privilege to spend time with many of Tiff",1333,"Good morning, everyone, and yes. Thank you, Mark. I would like to say a few words, which are unrelated to our quarterly results, which I think might be instructive. 
Over these past months, it's been my honor and privilege to spend time with many of Tiffany's passionate and dedicated employees as I seek to learn as much as possible about the business. Right now, I'm touring several of our major Asian markets and I must say I've been very impressed by our stores, our product offerings and the professionalism of our sales associates, [ their ] energy which speaks to the tremendous growth opportunities Tiffany has in this vibrant and exciting part of the world. 
In addition to visiting many of our retail locations, I spent considerable time in our diamond cutting and polishing facilities, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage, our jewelry manufacturing plants, and very recently, I have the good fortune to attend and participate in our 2-day retail diamond authority training program for sales professionals. These experiences have given me a deeper appreciation for the level of craftsmanship and care that goes into making a Tiffany quality diamond from our exceedingly stringent standards for color and clarity and our selection of rough stones to the cutting, polishing and setting of diamonds in our own facilities with our own highly skilled and caring craftspeople to the presentation of each diamond to our valued customers by our highly trained sales professionals in an iconic Tiffany Blue Box. 
And now having seen and experienced all this firsthand, I have a great deal of pride as well as a deeply held belief in Tiffany's ability to delight customers all around the world for at least another 180 years. 
So with that, let's review our second quarter financial results. As Mark mentioned, worldwide net sales increased 3%, but comparable store sales declined slightly both on an as-reported and in constant currency. So clearly, we have more work to do in that regard. However, despite disappointing comp store sales numbers, diluted earnings per share growth was strong at 10%. 
We were pleased to see gross margin expand by 40 basis points in the quarter particularly in light of the increase we had in wholesale diamond sales, which, as we'd indicated in the past, is gross margin dilutive. Lower product input costs, primarily from lower diamond acquisition costs; modest first quarter price adjustments, which averaged out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis; and favorable product mix all contributed to the improvement in gross margins. 
In addition, we continued to reengineer our global information system architecture and redesign our internal work processes in order to free up investment dollars. For example, we just implemented an automated transportation management system in the United States, which is reducing store-to-store freight transfer costs. So taking all these factors into account, we continue to believe there will be a modest year-over-year increase in gross margin for the full year. 
Importantly, while we're very committed to effective cost control, our top priority remains achieving a higher rate of sustainable sales growth. Consistent with this, we will continue to redeploy a significant portion of any savings generated back into the business. 
We were also pleased with SG&A expenses during the quarter, which as a percentage of sales were essentially flat versus year ago, coming in at 43.4% in the second quarter versus 43.2% a year ago. As previously discussed, we remain committed to managing SG&A expense prudently by reducing costs where feasible while also reinvesting in the growth of our business. Thus, for the full year, we continue to assume SG&A expenses will increase at a slightly faster rate than sales growth as we invest behind our new signature women's fragrance, the launch of our new luxury accessories offerings and additional jewelry SKUs. 
Taken together, gross margin and SG&A expense allowed operating margin to expand 10 basis points in the second quarter. 
Net interest and other expenses were both lower in the second quarter as with our effective tax rate. That said, our second quarter effective tax rate was higher than the first quarter due to a new accounting standard related to the treatment of the excess tax benefits associated with the vesting or exercise of stock-based compensation, which we adopted in the first quarter. While this new accounting standard has the potential to create some level of additional earnings volatility in our future results as the amount of the excess tax benefit or shortfall will vary with changes in the stock price, our outlook currently assumes a full year effective tax rate of approximately 33%. 
In addition to posting strong growth in diluted earnings per share, we generated a significant amount of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our first half total to roughly $200 million. Inventory performance contributed to our robust cash flow with net inventory at July 31 coming in 4% below a year ago as we continue to optimize finished goods levels. However, due to the second half product introductions referenced earlier, we continue to plan for full year inventory to be flat versus prior year-end. 
Accounts receivable were up just 3% from a year ago, in line with our reported sales growth. 
Capital expenditures in the first half have been modestly lower than last year due to timing differences, so we remain on track to spend about $250 million for the full year. 
We invested $21 million to repurchase 230,000 shares of our common stock in the quarter, which was slightly higher than the previous quarter. 
As of July 31, 2017, we had $278 million remaining available under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
Adding it all up, our balance sheet is in very good regard, with over $1 billion of cash and short-term investments at July 31 and a reasonable ratio of total debt to stockholders' equity, which provides us with an opportunity to invest behind our strategic growth initiatives in order to achieve better top line growth while continuing to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Since we already commented on share repurchase, let us quickly remind everyone that we recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by 11%, which was our 16th increase in the past 15 years. 
Finally, in terms of our outlook, results in the first and second quarter have not fundamentally changed our view for the full year. We have a number of strategic initiatives in place related to new products, marketing campaigns and enhancing the in-store experience for customers, all of which we believe can contribute towards modest and gradual top line improvement as the year progresses. 
So while we have confidence in our growth plans, we remain mindful of an uncertain external environment. So as a result, we continue to expect total sales for the full year to increase by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year. 
On the bottom line, we continue to expect net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single-digit percentage from last year's $3.55 on a GAAP basis and to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage over last year's adjusted EPS of $3.75 per share. 
For the second half of the year, we expect an increase in net earnings per diluted share versus a year ago with all of the increase coming in the fourth quarter. 
Relative to cash, we remain on pace with our expectations to deliver approximately $700 million of net operating cash flow and approximately $450 million of free cash flow for the full year. 
So in closing, we continue to believe strongly that executing our top line growth strategies in a disciplined way while simultaneously reengineering our global information system architecture and redesigning our internal work processes to free up investment dollars is the right path forward in order to delight our customers and create sustainable shareholder value in the years ahead, and we'll be looking forward to updating you on our progress during future calls. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Mark."

I should add that our New York flagship store has returned to a relatively normal flow of customer traffic following the disruption immediately after the 2016 election and was not a drag on overall sales in the quarter.

I believe we can now proceed.
In broad terms, we achieved modest top line growth in the second quarter due to higher wholesale sales in the Asia Pacific region, increased wholesale sales of diamonds and solid growth in e-commerce sales. However, with the exception of Japan, our regions did not achieve comp store sales growth and we will obviously not be satisfied until they are meaningfully in positive territory. Having said that, the 3% worldwide net sales growth in the quarter, combined with a slightly higher operating margin, a reduction in other expenses and a lower tax rate, contributed to 9% net earnings growth that achieved our expectations. 
In addition, we added net of 2 stores during the quarter, opening 3 and closing 1. We moved forward with some exciting product initiatives, and of course, we announced the appointment of a new CEO. 
In terms of regional performance, let's start with the Americas, where total sales rose slightly in the quarter and comparable store sales declined slightly. We were pleased with the strong increase in e-commerce sales, which are not included in comps, and we were also pleased to see an increase in total jewelry unit volume propelled by increases in the fashion and designer jewelry categories even though there was a decline in average price tied to a shift in sales mix toward those categories. 
Sales performance across the region was varied with no significant geographical deviations, but we've attributed the overall comp store sales weakness this year to lower foreign tourist spending. I should add that our New York flagship store has returned to a relatively normal flow of customer traffic following the disruption immediately after the 2016 election and was not a drag on overall sales in the quarter. 
Rounding out the region, our sales in Canada were down just slightly while we experienced reasonably good growth in Latin America. During the quarter, we completed the renovation of our important store on Burrard Street in Vancouver, and we were pleased to relocate our store in the International Plaza in Tampa, Florida. And the fourth floor of our New York flagship store is currently closed and being renovated to house our exciting new luxury accessories collection in an enticing environment when it debuts this fall. 
In the Asia Pacific region, a modest increase in total sales largely reflected higher wholesale sales and new store openings over the past year as well as higher jewelry units sold, primarily in the fashion and designer categories, though this increase in units was mostly offset by lower average price per unit sold. Comp store sales declined in the quarter as strong sales growth in Mainland China was more than offset by softness in most other countries, which we attribute at least in part to lower Chinese tourist spending. We attribute the growth in Mainland China to local customer spending where we continue to build brand awareness. 
During the quarter, we opened 2 stores in the region, one in Korea in the Shinsegae Department Store, and one in Australia in Sydney's Westfield center, and we closed a store in Taiwan. 
In Japan, total sales and comps rose modestly on a GAAP basis and rose at a higher rate on a constant exchange rate basis. Total sales growth in the quarter was more than entirely due to the increase in comp store sales while wholesale sales declined in the quarter. There was an increase in jewelry units sold. We also attribute the sales growth to increased spending by local customers who represent the vast majority of our sales in Japan while spending attributed to foreign tourists was roughly unchanged. The bridal category represents almost 40% of our sales in Japan, and as we noted on last quarter's call, we expanded the presence of our major Ginza store in Tokyo by opening a nearby boutique dedicated to bridal sales, and customers' reactions to the heightened experience have been very favorable. 
We were pleased with improving sales results in Europe in the quarter, driven by wholesale sales and new stores. There was growth in jewelry units sold across all categories. Comps were positive in several Continental European countries. However, total European comps were down slightly including modestly lower sales in the U.K., which we attribute at least partly to a difficult year-over-year comparison. Keep in mind the spending that we attribute to foreign tourists in London had begun to accelerate near the end of the second quarter last year following the Brexit vote and the drop in the value of the pound. During the quarter, we were delighted to open another store in Italy, our third store in Milan and located at the Duomo. 
Rounding out the segments, the other segment posted a large increase in the quarter, but it entirely resulted from an increase in our wholesale sales of diamonds. Comp store sales declined for our stores in United Arab Emirates. 
We remain determined to improve top line growth by pursuing several important strategies. One relates to an accelerated pace of product introductions in the future across all categories. Another is pursuing clienteling to more effectively engage with customers and deliver an enhanced Tiffany experience. We also believe that further optimizing the global distribution base through store openings, renovations, relocations and some select closings is important. And lastly, we are focused on enhancing brand awareness through impactful marketing communications. The ultimate objective is to accelerate sales growth through the frequency of customer visits and improvement in the conversion rate. 
Lastly, I mentioned higher e-commerce sales from the Americas and we're pleased that it occurred globally as well. We are continually making enhancements to our website that add additional interesting content, are visually appealing and that improve functionality. We continue to believe that our website serves a dual function by generating online sales and also effectively delivering our messaging. 
In terms of merchandising highlights, the second quarter reflected a continuation of the trends experienced in the first quarter. In essence, solid sales growth in both the fashion jewelry and designer jewelry categories contrasted with lower sales in both the engagement jewelry and the high fine and solitaire categories. 
Fashion jewelry primarily consists of non-gemstone gold and silver jewelry and there was growth across the category. From a collection perspective, we especially call out the initial success of the new Tiffany HardWear collection that we launched in April as well as relatively strong performance in our Tiffany T and 1837 collections. 
We also saw broad-based growth in designer jewelry sales for both Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso. Elsa's legendary designs include our Open Heart and Diamonds by the Yard collections. Paloma's designs are also long-standing favorites and customers have recently been especially excited about Paloma's Melody, which is her new chic and modern collection in gold and silver. 
As I mentioned, the high fine and solitaire jewelry category was again soft in the quarter with mixed results by collection. And the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category also underperformed again in the quarter. 
We're still in the early stages of growing our watch business and are progressing as we expand brand and product awareness in that category through advertising and by introducing new designs. In fact, we plan to introduce a new women's watch collection later this year. 
So those are a few highlights of jewelry and watch performance in the quarter. In the coming months, we have many new jewelry designs and styles across all categories scheduled for introduction. 
We have also just recently begun the rollout of our new signature fragrance collection, and we look forward to the upcoming launch of our luxury accessories collection, which we believe will entice customers with both functional and whimsical designs. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg who is joining us from overseas. Mark, before commenting on the financials, are there any observations from your travels that you'd like to share?"
35576,532892066,1287354,"Tiffany & Co., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 24, 2017",2017-08-24,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and yes. Thank you, Mark. I would like to say a few words, which are unrelated to our quarterly results, which I think might be instructive. Over these past months, it's been my honor and privilege to spend time with many of Tiff",1328,"Good morning, everyone, and yes. Thank you, Mark. I would like to say a few words, which are unrelated to our quarterly results, which I think might be instructive. 
Over these past months, it's been my honor and privilege to spend time with many of Tiffany's passionate and dedicated employees as I seek to learn as much as possible about the business. Right now, I'm touring several of our major Asian markets and I must say, I've been very impressed by our stores, our product offerings and the professionalism of our sales associates. There's energy, which speaks to the tremendous growth opportunities Tiffany has in this vibrant and exciting part of the world. 
In addition to visiting many of our retail locations, I spent considerable time in our diamond cutting and polishing facilities, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage; our jewelry manufacturing plants; and very recently, I have the good fortune to attend and participate in our 2-day retail diamond authority training program for sales professionals. These experiences have given me a deeper appreciation for the level of craftsmanship and care that goes into making a Tiffany-quality diamond from our exceedingly stringent standards for color and clarity and our selection of rough stones to the cutting, polishing and setting of diamonds in our own facilities with our own highly skilled and caring craftspeople to the presentation of each diamond to our valued customers by our highly trained sales professionals in an iconic Tiffany Blue Box. 
And now having seen and experienced all this firsthand, I have a great deal of pride as well as a deeply held belief in Tiffany's ability to delight customers all around the world for at least another 180 years. 
So with that, let's review our second quarter financial results. As Mark mentioned, worldwide net sales increased 3%, but comparable store sales declined slightly both on an as-reported and in constant currency. So clearly, we have more work to do in that regard. However, despite disappointing comp store sales numbers, diluted earnings per share growth was strong at 10%. 
We were pleased to see gross margin expand by 40 basis points in the quarter, particularly in light of the increase we had in wholesale diamond sales, which, as we'd indicated in the past, is gross margin dilutive. Lower product input costs, primarily from lower diamond acquisition costs; modest first quarter price adjustments, which averaged out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis; and favorable product mix all contributed to the improvement in gross margins. 
In addition, we continued to reengineer our global information system architecture and redesign our internal work processes in order to free up investment dollars. For example, we just implemented an automated transportation management system in the United States, which is reducing store-to-store freight transfer costs. So taking all these factors into account, we continue to believe there will be a modest year-over-year increase in gross margin for the full year. 
Importantly, while we're very committed to effective cost control, our top priority remains achieving a higher rate of sustainable sales growth. Consistent with this, we will continue to redeploy a significant portion of any savings generated back into the business. 
We were also pleased with SG&A expenses during the quarter, which as a percentage of sales were essentially flat versus year ago, coming in at 43.4% in the second quarter versus 43.2% a year ago. As previously discussed, we remain committed to managing SG&A expense prudently and reducing costs where feasible, while also reinvesting in the growth of our business. Thus, for the full year, we continue to assume SG&A expenses will increase at a slightly faster rate than sales growth as we invest behind our new signature women's fragrance, the launch of our new luxury accessories offerings and additional jewelry SKUs. 
Taken together, gross margin and SG&A expense allowed operating margin to expand 10 basis points in the second quarter. 
Net interest and other expenses were both lower in the second quarter as was our effective tax rate. That said, our second quarter effective tax rate was higher than the first quarter due to a new accounting standard related to the treatment of the excess tax benefits associated with the vesting or exercise of stock-based compensation, which we adopted in the first quarter. While this new accounting standard has the potential to create some level of additional earnings volatility in our future results as the amount of the excess tax benefit or shortfall will vary with changes in the stock price, our outlook currently assumes a full year effective tax rate of approximately 33%. 
In addition to posting strong growth in diluted earnings per share, we generated a significant amount of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our first half total to roughly $200 million. Inventory performance contributed to our robust cash flow with net inventory at July 31 coming in 4% below a year ago as we continue to optimize finished goods levels. However, due to the second half product introductions referenced earlier, we continue to plan for full year inventory to be flat versus prior year-end. 
Accounts receivable were up just 3% from a year ago, in line with our reported sales growth. 
Capital expenditures in the first half have been modestly lower than last year due to timing differences, so we remain on track to spend about $250 million for the full year. 
We invested $21 million to repurchase 230,000 shares of our common stock in the quarter, which was slightly higher than the previous quarter. 
As of July 31, 2017, we had $278 million remaining available under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
Adding it all up, our balance sheet is in very good regard, with over $1 billion of cash and short-term investments at July 31 and a reasonable ratio of total debt-to-stockholders' equity, which provides us with an opportunity to invest behind our strategic growth initiatives in order to achieve better top line growth while continuing to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Since we already commented on share repurchase, let us quickly remind everyone that we recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by 11%, which was our 16th increase in the past 15 years. 
Finally, in terms of our outlook, results in the first and second quarter have not fundamentally changed our view for the full year. We have a number of strategic initiatives in place related to new products, marketing campaigns and enhancing the in-store experience for customers, all of which we believe can contribute towards modest and gradual top line improvement as the year progresses. 
So while we have confidence in our growth plans, we remain mindful of an uncertain external environment. So as a result, we continue to expect total sales for the full year to increase by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year. 
On the bottom line, we continue to expect net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single-digit percentage from last year's $3.55 on a GAAP basis and to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage over last year's adjusted EPS of $3.75 per share. 
For the second half of the year, we expect an increase in net earnings per diluted share versus a year ago with all of the increase coming in the fourth quarter. 
Relative to cash, we remain on pace with our expectations to deliver approximately $700 million of net operating cash flow and approximately $450 million of free cash flow for the full year. 
So in closing, we continue to believe strongly that executing our top line growth strategies in a disciplined way while simultaneously reengineering our global information system architecture and redesigning our internal work processes to free up investment dollars is the right path forward in order to delight our customers and create sustainable shareholder value in the years ahead, and we'll be looking forward to updating you on our progress during future calls. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Mark."

I'm pleased to have this opportunity to briefly introduce myself to you and I look forward to meeting many of you in the coming months. Let me begin by saying that I'm very excited to be here at Tiffany. I spent many years in the jewelry business at Bulgari and I've long respected Tiffany as a extraordinary design and as a formidable competitor. 
In my first set of weeks at Tiffany, I've met with many members of our HQ and regional teams and I'm impressed with the skills and passion for our unique brand. I've traveled and visited so far about 40 stores in the Americas, Asia Pacific and Japan, and I'm very glad I also visited 3 of our manufacturing and logistic sites in the United States, in New York, in Rhode Island and in New Jersey. We have powerful internal operations with hundreds of truly exceptional jewelry outfits, form factors and engravers. It's thanks to them, to their skills, their hands, that Tiffany can offer such a vast assortment from multimillion dollar one-of-a-kind creations to everyday jewelry, we pick consistent and supreme quality. 
I accepted this position because I strongly believe that the Tiffany & Co. brand is healthy with tremendous opportunities to grow. As we move forward, we will leverage our core strength and adapt as appropriate while, of course, we will always remain true to our heritage and brand integrity. We will be accelerating the pace of product innovation. We are focused on the most effective marketing communications. We will continue to enhance the in-store and online experience and our growth is reinforced by our strong supply chain capabilities and a solid financial position. I believe our company has the capabilities to further delight our customers, inspire our employees and reward our shareholders. At the same time, we acknowledge that some of our competitors have recently posted stronger sales growth than ours, which I can assure you will not be acceptable in the long term. 
I'm increasingly passionate about Tiffany and I'm honored to be given this great opportunity. As I further study our business, I will be reviewing my thoughts with our Board of Directors and will then have more to say to you in the coming months. I appreciate your interest in this great company. I can assure you that we will continue to work very persistently to achieve the healthy long-term financial performance that you have come to expect from us. Thank you, and now I will turn the call back to Mark."

Now let's look at the results. As an overview, we were pleased with some of the underlying factors reflected in the third quarter results. Important to us was that total sales growth was again",1499,"Okay. Thanks, Alessandro, for sharing those thoughts with us. Now let's look at the results. As an overview, we were pleased with some of the underlying factors reflected in the third quarter results. Important to us was that total sales growth was again driven largely by higher jewelry unit volume and not price. We were pleased to see a continuation of growth in fashion jewelry and also encouraged to see a resumption of growth in the high fine and solitaire jewelry category. 
Comparable store sales rose in the Americas and Asia Pacific with declines in Japan in Europe. Gross margin was up. SG&A expense growth was roughly in line with sales growth. Other expenses were unchanged and the effective tax rate was a bit lower. The result was a 5% increase in net earnings which was a bit higher than what we had expected. We added net of 3 stores and introduced some new jewelry designs, a new watch collection and a new fragrance. And organizationally, Alessandro joined Tiffany and our Board of Directors elected Roger Farah as its Chairman. It was indeed a very active quarter.
Let's look at performance in each region. In the Americas, sales rose slightly due to an increase in the number of jewelry units sold across all categories except engagement jewelry. 
In terms of the region's customer mix in the quarter, we attribute sales growth to higher spending by local customers while sales to foreign tourists continued to trend lower. It will be interesting in coming quarters to see whether there is any impact from the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies. 
Comp store sales rose 1% in the quarter. Results on a constant exchange rate basis were not materially different than as reported, and around the region, there were no significant variations in geographical performance worth highlighting.
There's been quite a bit of recent store activity. During the quarter, in the U.S., we opened a store in Fort Worth, Texas, representing our third store in the Dallas Fort Worth market, and we relocated our store in Century City California. In our New York flagship store, we recently reopened our newly renovated fourth floor, offering a dramatic new presentation and experience. The floor showcases our new home and accessories collection, and we're pleased to say that you can now enjoy your breakfast or lunch and tea at Tiffany's in our newly opened Blue Box Café on the fourth floor. Based on the long queues every day, the café is fast becoming a New York tradition.  
For the first time ever, we recently opened 2 pop-up shops in Manhattan, in Rockefeller Center and in Grand Central Station, which are important hubs for both New Yorkers and tourists. These shops offer a curated selection by our Chief Artistic Officer, Reed Krakoff, of jewelry including the new HardWear collection; and gifts including the new home and accessories collection, and we are excited about the sales potential and brand exposure from those 2 shops.
We also opened 4 pop-up shops in Holt Renfrew department stores in Canada. 
Now let's turn to the Asia-Pacific region which experienced growth in the quarter due to increased unit volume across jewelry categories. The region sales increase came from the continuation of very strong comparable store sales growth in Mainland China, increased wholesale sales in Korea to support strong duty-free sales and the effect of new stores. Comp store up 2% on a constant exchange rate basis. While we were pleased with sales growth in Mainland China, we were also encouraged to see sales in Hong Kong almost flat with last year after 3 years of substantial declines. However, comp declines in some other countries, which we attribute at least in part to lower Chinese tourist spending, affected the region's overall results.
During the quarter, we opened one store in Wuxi, China and have several openings and relocations planned in the fourth quarter. 
The picture was reasonably good in Japan. Sales declined on a GAAP basis due to a weakening of the yen versus the dollar. However, third quarter sales were equal to last year on a constant exchange rate basis. A decline in jewelry units sold was offset by an increase in average price, though as a reminder, the number of units sold had a large increased last year. Comp store sales decreased on a GAAP basis but on a constant exchange rate basis were flat. We are planning for a tough comparison in the fourth quarter when we go up against the comp store sales increase last year that we believe was at least partly tied to extensive favorable publicity from a popular television show. There were no store openings or closings during the quarter.
Turning to Europe. We saw mixed results. Total sales were up on a GAAP basis due to the increased price and volume. The pound and euro have strengthened in recent months which bolstered GAAP results. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales were up slightly and comps declined. In Continental Europe, total sales rose in most countries. Sales declined in the U.K. but keep in mind that very strong growth at this time last year when spending that we attributed to foreign tourists in London was surging in reaction to the weaker pound. 
During the quarter, we added to our successful business in Russia when we opened a second store in the heart of Moscow on Petrovka Street, and we also opened a store in Birmingham, England in Selfridge's department store, representing our 11th store in the U.K. 
Lastly, sales in our Other segment declined in the quarter entirely due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds. This segment also includes 4 stores that we operate in the UAE, and we were pleased to see that their comps improved with a 7% increase in the third quarter. We closed our store in the Abu Dhabi Mall during the quarter but expect to replace it with a new store in the Abu Dhabi Galleria next year.
In addition to these sales highlights, I should point out that e-commerce sales increased at a slightly faster pace than overall sales growth. We will certainly continue to invest in the online channel and digital marketing but believe that most customers, after getting their information online, still are and will continue to be attracted to the in-store experience.
Looking at product categories in total for the quarter, we continued to see solid growth in the fashion jewelry category. We're very pleased with the results in the Tiffany HardWear Collection which we launched earlier in the year, and we recently added new SKUs to the collection. We also recently expanded our very successful Tiffany T collection. 
Near the end of the quarter, we launched an interesting build your own program on our website that allows customers to construct and personalize their own charm bracelets and the tourists pointing out the growth in our Tiffany T collection, would span both fashion and fine jewelry and includes new fleur de lis designs in earrings, pendants and rings.
In the high fine and solitaire jewelry category, we were pleased to see a resumption of growth in the quarter led by iconic diamond jewelry designs which included extensions of some existing collections. In that regard, it's worth mentioning the popular Victoria, Yellow Diamond and Celeste collections, and we had a solid increase in the high jewelry sales in the quarter. 
Partly offsetting growth in those categories was engagement jewelry where sales continue to underperform in the quarter. While Tiffany offers a wide ranging and we believe dominant diamond ring assortment, we've also observed that some customers wanted to customize their own rings. As a result, we recently introduced the program in our stores in the U.S. and Canada that allows customers to personalize their rings by separately choosing a diamond cut, setting and metal. 
We're pleased with progress in several non-jewelry categories as well. In watches, we saw good growth in the quarter and there's been very favorable initial reaction to our new Tiffany Metro watch collection for women. We also launched our new signature fragrance in the quarter which is now available in Tiffany stores as well as in other select stores globally. And as I mentioned earlier, we recently introduced our new home and accessories collection both online and in our stores. The already popular collection spans more than 300 items, both functional and whimsical, in a wide range of price points and is now being distributed worldwide.
We've met with many of you in recent months and I want to reiterate that Tiffany's top strategic priority is to drive solid comparable store sales growth. While we expect square footage to increase modestly each year in the future, it is comparable store and e-commerce sales growth through increased frequency of customer visits and the conversion rates that will ultimately contribute to driving higher margins and earnings growth. With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg."

Worldwide sales growth o",817,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter results reflect continued progress towards our long-term financial goals, which include mid-single-digit sales growth and high-single-digit diluted earnings per share growth. Worldwide sales growth of 3% in the third quarter is obviously below that range, but importantly, some sequential progress was made in comp store sales, which were down 1% in the third quarter after being down 3% in the first quarter and down 2% in the second quarter. And that earnings growth of 5% in the third quarter brings fiscal year-to-date diluted earnings per share growth to plus 7% versus year ago. 
So while we're encouraged with third quarter results, we also acknowledge that we have a lot more work to do and at the risk of stating the obvious, we will not be satisfied until we achieve meaningful and sustainable comparable sales growth across all regions. 
Moving to gross margin. Gross margin increased by 30 basis points due in part -- due to a decline in wholesale diamond sales. Sales mix was not a meaningful contributor to the increase as sales growth was generally balanced across a wide range of price points and product categories. Also, while we have continued to benefit from lower commodity input costs, we are seeing that benefit diminish as the year goes on, which is consistent with our prior expectations. We now expect gross margin to be roughly unchanged for the full year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were roughly in line with sales growth in the third quarter with the increase tied to increased labor and incentive compensation costs as well as higher store depreciation and occupancy costs partly offset by various ongoing cost savings initiatives. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A expenses have grown 2.4% versus reported sales growth of 2.3%.
Consistent with what's been previously stated, we remain committed to managing SG&A expense prudently and reducing cost where feasible in order to free up investment dollars to reinvest in the growth of our business. Modest gross margin expansion, coupled with SG&A expenses growing in line with sales, allowed third quarter operating margin to expand by 10 basis points. Our full year forecast calls for operating margin to increase over last year as reported but to be roughly in line with last year's margin when charges are excluded.
Interest and other expenses were essentially unchanged in the quarter and we expect it to be in the range of $35 million to $37 million for the full year. 
From a tax standpoint, the third quarter effective tax rate was 33.4% which was more than a full point below last year's rate of 34.6%. Nonetheless, 2017's full year effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 33%.
Net inventories at October 31 were only 1% above last year, which is below the rate of sales growth. But you may recall that at July 31 of this year, inventory was a 4% below year ago. Simply put, we've increased our internal manufacturing targets over the past couple of months for several key gold products that have been selling faster than expected which, in turn, has pushed up raw material and working process inventory levels. Because of this change, we now expect net inventories for the year to increase at approximately the same rate as sales growth. 
Capital expenditures year-to-date were $146 million and our full year forecast, which assumed approximately $250 million in spending, has been revised slightly downward with our best estimate now being somewhere in the $235 million to $250 million range. The revision is solely due to timing of expenditures as we continue to anticipate annual CapEx spending of somewhere between 6% and 7% of sales. We invested $28 million in the third quarter to buy shares at an average top of $92 per share, which is slightly up from the $21 million we invested during the second quarter and double the $11 million we invested during the first quarter. 
Tiffany's balance sheet remains strong, having finished the third quarter with $1 billion of cash and short-term investments and total debt representing only 1/3 of stockholders' equity. 
Putting it all together, we continue to expect total sales for the full year to increase by low-single digits and our forecast for diluted EPS continues to call for a high single-digit increase over last year's $3.55 per share on a GAAP basis and a mid-single-digit increase over last year's $3.75 per share excluding charges.
Relative to cash, we remain on pace with our expectations to deliver approximately $700 million of net operating cash flow and approximately $450 million of free cash flow for the full year. 
So in closing, while progress was made in the quarter, we remain focused on sharpening our strategies and improving our execution in order to generate sustainable comp store sales growth and consistent diluted earnings per share growth. I'll now turn the call back over to Mark."

I'm pleased to have this opportunity to briefly introduce myself to you and I look forward to meeting many of you in the coming months. Let me begin by saying that I'm very excited to be here at Tiffany. I spent many years in the jewelry business at Bulgari and I've long respected Tiffany as a house of extraordinary design and as a formidable competitor.
In my first set of weeks at Tiffany, I've met with many members of our HQ and regional teams and I'm impressed with the skills and passion for our unique brand. I've traveled and visited so far about 40 stores in the Americas, Asia Pacific and Japan, and I'm very glad I also visited 3 of our manufacturing and logistic sites in the United States, in New York, in Rhode Island and in New Jersey. We have powerful internal operations with hundreds of truly exceptional jewelry outfits, form factors and engravers. It's thanks to them, to their skills, their hands, that Tiffany can offer such a vast assortment from multimillion dollar one-of-a-kind creations to everyday jewelry, we pick consistent and supreme quality.
I accepted this position because I strongly believe that the Tiffany & Co. brand is healthy with tremendous opportunities to grow. As we move forward, we will leverage our core strength and adapt as appropriate while, of course, we will always remain true to our heritage and brand integrity. We will be accelerating the pace of product innovation. We are focused on the most effective marketing communications. We will continue to enhance the in-store and online experience and our growth is reinforced by our strong supply chain capabilities and a solid financial position. I believe our company has the capabilities to further delight our customers, inspire our employees and reward our shareholders. At the same time, we acknowledge that some of our competitors have recently posted stronger sales growth than ours, which I can assure you will not be acceptable in the long term.
I'm increasingly passionate about Tiffany and I'm honored to be given this great opportunity. As I further study our business, I will be reviewing my thoughts with our Board of Directors and will then have more to say to you in the coming months. I appreciate your interest in this great company. I can assure you that we will continue to work very persistently to achieve the healthy long-term financial performance that you have come to expect from us. Thank you, and now I will turn the call back to Mark."

Now let's look at the results. As an overview, we were pleased with some of the underlying factors reflected in the third quarter results. Important to us was that total sales growth was again",1494,"Okay. Thanks, Alessandro, for sharing those thoughts with us. Now let's look at the results. As an overview, we were pleased with some of the underlying factors reflected in the third quarter results. Important to us was that total sales growth was again driven largely by higher jewelry unit volume and not price. We were pleased to see a continuation of growth in fashion jewelry and also encouraged to see a resumption of growth in the high fine and solitaire jewelry category. 
Comparable store sales rose in the Americas and Asia Pacific with declines in Japan and Europe. Gross margin was up. SG&A expense growth was roughly in line with sales growth. Other expenses were unchanged and the effective tax rate was a bit lower. The result was a 5% increase in net earnings which was a bit higher than what we had expected. We added net of 3 stores and introduced some new jewelry designs, a new watch collection and a new fragrance. And organizationally, Alessandro joined Tiffany and our Board of Directors elected Roger Farah as its Chairman. It was indeed a very active quarter.
Let's look at performance in each region. In the Americas, sales rose slightly due to an increase in the number of jewelry units sold across all categories except engagement jewelry.
In terms of the region's customer mix in the quarter, we attribute sales growth to higher spending by local customers while sales to foreign tourists continued to trend lower. It will be interesting in coming quarters to see whether there is any impact from the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies.
Comp store sales rose 1% in the quarter. Results on a constant exchange rate basis were not materially different than as reported, and around the region, there were no significant variations in geographical performance worth highlighting.
There's been quite a bit of recent store activity. During the quarter, in the U.S., we opened a store in Fort Worth, Texas, representing our third store in the Dallas Fort Worth market, and we relocated our store in Century, City California. In our New York flagship store, we recently reopened our newly renovated fourth floor, offering a dramatic new presentation and experience. The floor showcases our new home and accessories collection, and we're pleased to say that you can now enjoy your breakfast or lunch and tea at Tiffany's in our newly opened Blue Box Cafe on the fourth floor. Based on the long queues every day, the café is fast becoming a New York tradition.
For the first time ever, we recently opened 2 pop-up shops in Manhattan, in Rockefeller Center and in Grand Central Station, which are important hubs for both New Yorkers and tourists. These shops offer a curated selection by our Chief Artistic Officer, Reed Krakoff, of jewelry including the new HardWear collection; and gifts including the new home and accessories collection, and we are excited about the sales potential and brand exposure from those 2 shops.
We also opened 4 pop-up shops in Holt Renfrew department stores in Canada.
Now let's turn to the Asia-Pacific region which experienced growth in the quarter due to increased unit volume across jewelry categories. The region sales increase came from the continuation of very strong comparable store sales growth in Mainland China, increased wholesale sales in Korea to support strong duty-free sales and the effect of new stores. Comp store up 2% on a constant exchange rate basis. While we were pleased with sales growth in Mainland China, we were also encouraged to see sales in Hong Kong almost flat with last year after 3 years of substantial declines. However, comp declines in some other countries, which we attribute at least in part to lower Chinese tourist spending, affected the region's overall results.
During the quarter, we opened one store in Wuxi, China and have several openings and relocations planned in the fourth quarter.
The picture was reasonably good in Japan. Sales declined on a GAAP basis due to a weakening of the yen versus the dollar. However, third quarter sales were equal to last year on a constant exchange rate basis. A decline in jewelry units sold was offset by an increase in average price, though as a reminder, the number of units sold had a large increase last year. Comp store sales decreased on a GAAP basis but on a constant exchange rate basis were flat. We are planning for a tough comparison in the fourth quarter when we go up against the comp store sales increase last year that we believe was at least partly tied to extensive favorable publicity from a popular television show. There were no store openings or closings during the quarter.
Turning to Europe. We saw mixed results. Total sales were up on a GAAP basis due to increased price and volume. The pound and euro have strengthened in recent months which bolstered GAAP results. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales were up slightly and comps declined. On Continental Europe, total sales rose in most countries. Sales declined in the U.K. but keep in mind that very strong growth at this time last year when spending that we attributed to foreign tourists in London was surging in reaction to the weaker pound.
During the quarter, we added to our successful business in Russia when we opened a second store in the heart of Moscow on Petrovka Street, and we also opened a store in Birmingham, England in Selfridges department store, representing our 11th store in the U.K.
Lastly, sales in our Other segment declined in the quarter entirely due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds. This segment also includes 4 stores that we operate in the UAE, and we were pleased to see that their comps improved with a 7% increase in the third quarter. We closed our store in the Abu Dhabi Mall during the quarter but expect to replace it with a new store in the Abu Dhabi Galleria next year.
In addition to these sales highlights, I should point out that e-commerce sales increased at a slightly faster pace than overall sales growth. We will certainly continue to invest in the online channel and digital marketing but believe that most customers, after getting their information online, still are and will continue to be attracted to the in-store experience.
Looking at product categories in total for the quarter, we continued to see solid growth in the fashion jewelry category. We're very pleased with the results in the Tiffany HardWear collection which we launched earlier in the year, and we recently added new SKUs to the collection. We also recently expanded our very successful Tiffany T collection.
Near the end of the quarter, we launched an interesting build-your-own program on our website that allows customers to construct and personalize their own charm bracelets and the tourists pointing out the growth in our Tiffany Keys collection, would span both fashion and fine jewelry and includes new fleur-de-lis designs in earrings, pendants and rings.
In the high fine and solitaire jewelry category, we were pleased to see a resumption of growth in the quarter led by iconic diamond jewelry designs which included extensions of some existing collections. In that regard, it's worth mentioning the popular Victoria, Yellow Diamond and Soleste collections, and we had a solid increase in the high jewelry sales in the quarter.
Partly offsetting growth in those categories was engagement jewelry where sales continue to underperform in the quarter. While Tiffany offers a wide ranging and we believe dominant diamond ring assortment, we've also observed that some customers wanted to customize their own rings. As a result, we recently introduced the program in our stores in the U.S. and Canada that allows customers to personalize their ring by separately choosing a diamond cut, setting and metal.
We're pleased with progress in several non-jewelry categories as well. In watches, we saw good growth in the quarter and there's been very favorable initial reaction to our new Tiffany Metro Watch collection for women. We also launched our new signature fragrance in the quarter which is now available in Tiffany stores as well as in other select stores globally. And as I mentioned earlier, we recently introduced our new home and accessories collection both online and in our stores. The already popular collection spans more than 300 items, both functional and whimsical, in a wide range of price points and is now being distributed worldwide.
We've met with many of you in recent months and I want to reiterate that Tiffany's top strategic priority is to drive solid comparable store sales growth. While we expect square footage to increase modestly each year in the future, it is comparable store and e-commerce sales growth through increased frequency of customer visits and the conversion rate that will ultimately contribute to driving higher margins and earnings growth. With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg."

Worldwide sales growth of 3% in the quarter is obviously below that range, but importantly, some sequential progress was made in comp store sales, which were down 1% in the third quarter after being down 3% in the first quarter and down 2% in the second quarter. And that earnings growth of 5% in the third quarter brings fiscal year-to-date diluted earnings per share growth to plus 7% versus year ago.
So while we're encouraged with third quarter results, we also acknowledge that we have a lot more work to do and at the risk of stating the obvious, we will not be satisfied until we achieve meaningful and sustainable comparable store sales growth across all regions.
Moving to gross margin. Gross margin increased by 30 basis points due in part -- due to a decline in wholesale diamond sales. Sales mix was not a meaningful contributor to the increase as sales growth was generally balanced across a wide range of price points and product categories. Also, while we have continued to benefit from lower commodity input costs, we are seeing that benefit diminish as the year goes on, which is consistent with our prior expectations. We now expect gross margin to be roughly unchanged for the full year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were roughly in line with sales growth in the third quarter with the increase tied to increased labor and incentive compensation costs as well as higher store depreciation and occupancy costs partly offset by various ongoing cost savings initiatives. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A expenses have grown 2.4% versus reported sales growth of 2.3%.
Consistent with what's been previously stated, we remain committed to managing SG&A expense prudently and reducing costs where feasible in order to free up investment dollars to reinvest in the growth of our business. Modest gross margin expansion, coupled with SG&A expenses growing in line with sales, allowed third quarter operating margin to expand by 10 basis points. Our full year forecast calls for operating margin to increase over last year as reported but to be roughly in line with last year's margin when charges are excluded.
Interest and other expenses were essentially unchanged in the quarter and we expect it to be in the range of $35 million to $37 million for the full year.
From a tax standpoint, the third quarter effective tax rate was 33.4% which was more than a full point below last year's rate of 34.6%. Nonetheless, 2017's full year effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 33%.
Net inventories at October 31 were only 1% above last year, which is below the rate of sales growth. But you may recall that at July 31 of this year, inventory was a 4% below a year ago. Simply put, we've increased our internal manufacturing targets over the past couple of months for several key gold products that have been selling faster than expected which, in turn, has pushed up raw material and working process inventory levels. Because of this change, we now expect net inventories for the year to increase at approximately the same rate as sales growth.
Capital expenditures year-to-date were $146 million and our full year forecast, which assumed approximately $250 million in spending, has been revised slightly downward with our best estimate now being somewhere in the $235 million to $250 million range. The revision is solely due to timing of expenditures as we continue to anticipate annual CapEx spending of somewhere between 6% and 7% of sales. We invested $28 million in the third quarter to buy shares at an average top of $92 per share, which is slightly up from the $21 million we invested during the second quarter and more than doubled the $11 million we invested during the first quarter.
Tiffany's balance sheet remains strong, having finished the third quarter with $1 billion of cash and short-term investments and total debt representing only 1/3 of stockholders' equity.
Putting it all together, we continue to expect total sales for the full year to increase by low-single digits and our forecast for diluted EPS continues to call for a high single-digit increase over last year's $3.55 per share on a GAAP basis and a mid-single-digit increase over last year's $3.75 per share excluding charges.
Relative to cash, we remain on pace with our expectations to deliver approximately $700 million of net operating cash flow and approximately $450 million of free cash flow for the full year.
So in closing, while progress was made in the quarter, we remain focused on sharpening our strategies and improving our execution in order to generate sustainable comp store sales growth and consistent diluted earnings per share growth. I'll now turn the call back over to Mark."

Important to us was that total sales growth was again",1495,"Okay. Thanks, Alessandro, for sharing those thoughts with us. Now let's look at the results. As an overview, we were pleased with some of the underlying factors reflected in the third quarter results. Important to us was that total sales growth was again driven largely by higher jewelry unit volume and not price. We were pleased to see a continuation of growth in fashion jewelry and also encouraged to see a resumption of growth in the high fine and solitaire jewelry category. 
Comparable store sales rose in the Americas and Asia Pacific, with declines in Japan and Europe. Gross margin was up. SG&A expense growth was roughly in line with sales growth. Other expenses were unchanged and the effective tax rate was a bit lower. The result was a 5% increase in net earnings which was a bit higher than what we had expected. 
We added net of 3 stores and introduced some new jewelry designs, a new watch collection and a new fragrance. And organizationally, Alessandro joined Tiffany and our Board of Directors elected Roger Farah as its Chairman. It was indeed a very active quarter.
Let's look at performance in each region. In the Americas, sales rose slightly due to an increase in the number of jewelry units sold across all categories except engagement jewelry.
In terms of the region's customer mix in the quarter, we attribute sales growth to higher spending by local customers, while sales to foreign tourists continued to trend lower. It will be interesting in coming quarters to see whether there is any impact from the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies.
Comp store sales rose 1% in the quarter. Results on a constant exchange rate basis were not materially different than as reported, and around the region, there were no significant variations in geographical performance worth highlighting.
There's been quite a bit of recent store activity. During the quarter, in the U.S., we opened a store in Fort Worth, Texas, representing our third store in the Dallas Fort Worth market, and we relocated our store in Century City, California. In our New York flagship store, we recently reopened our newly renovated fourth floor, offering a dramatic new presentation and experience. The floor showcases our new home and accessories collection, and we're pleased to say that you can now enjoy your breakfast or lunch and tea at Tiffany's in our newly opened Blue Box Cafe on the fourth floor. Based on the long queues every day, the café is fast becoming a New York tradition.
For the first time ever, we recently opened 2 pop-up shops in Manhattan, in Rockefeller Center and in Grand Central station, which are important hubs for both New Yorkers and tourists. These shops offer a curated selection by our Chief Artistic Officer, Reed Krakoff, of jewelry including the new HardWear collection; and gifts including the new home and accessories collection, and we are excited about the sales potential and brand exposure from those 2 shops.
We also opened 4 pop-up shops in Holt Renfrew department stores in Canada.
Now let's turn to the Asia-Pacific region which experienced growth in the quarter due to increased unit volume across jewelry categories. The region's sales increase came from the continuation of very strong comparable store sales growth in Mainland China, increased wholesale sales in Korea to support strong duty-free sales and the effect of new stores. Comp store up 2% on a constant exchange rate basis. 
While we were pleased with sales growth in Mainland China, we were also encouraged to see sales in Hong Kong almost flat with last year after 3 years of substantial declines. However, comp declines in some other countries, which we attribute at least in part to lower Chinese tourist spending, affected the region's overall results.
During the quarter, we opened one store in Wuxi, China and have several openings and relocations planned in the fourth quarter.
The picture was reasonably good in Japan. Sales declined on a GAAP basis due to a weakening of the yen versus the dollar. However, third quarter sales were equal to last year on a constant exchange rate basis. A decline in jewelry units sold was offset by an increase in average price, though, as a reminder, the number of units sold had a large increase last year. Comp store sales decreased on a GAAP basis but on a constant exchange rate basis were flat. We are planning for a tough comparison in the fourth quarter when we go up against the comp store sales increase last year that we believe was at least partly tied to extensive favorable publicity from a popular television show. 
There were no store openings or closings during the quarter.
Turning to Europe. We saw mixed results. Total sales were up on a GAAP basis due to increased price and volume. The pound and euro have strengthened in recent months which bolstered GAAP results. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales were up slightly and comps declined. On Continental Europe, total sales rose in most countries. Sales declined in the U.K. but keep in mind the very strong growth at this time last year when spending that we attributed to foreign tourists in London was surging in reaction to the weaker pound.
During the quarter, we added to our successful business in Russia when we opened a second store in the heart of Moscow on Petrovka Street; and we opened a store in Birmingham, England in Selfridges department store, representing our 11th store in the U.K.
Lastly, sales in our Other segment declined in the quarter entirely due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds. This segment also includes 4 stores that we operate in the UAE, and we were pleased to see that their comps improved with a 7% increase in the third quarter. We closed our store in the Abu Dhabi Mall during the quarter but expect to replace it with a new store in the Abu Dhabi Galleria next year.
In addition to these sales highlights, I should point out that e-commerce sales increased at a slightly faster pace than overall sales growth. We will certainly continue to invest in the online channel and digital marketing but believe that most customers, after getting their information online, still are and will continue to be attracted to the in-store experience.
Looking at product categories in total for the quarter. We continue to see solid growth in the fashion jewelry category. We're very pleased with the results in the Tiffany HardWear collection which we launched earlier in the year, and we recently added new SKUs to the collection. We also recently expanded our very successful Tiffany T collection.
Near the end of the quarter, we launched an interesting build-your-own program on our website that allows customers to construct and personalize their own charm bracelets and it's worth pointing out the growth in our Tiffany Keys collection which spans both fashion and fine jewelry and includes new Fleur de Lis designs in earrings, pendants and rings.
In the high fine and solitaire jewelry category, we were pleased to see a resumption of growth in the quarter led by iconic diamond jewelry designs which included extensions of some existing collections. In that regard, it's worth mentioning the popular Victoria, Yellow Diamond and Soleste collections, and we had a solid increase in the high jewelry sales in the quarter.
Partly offsetting growth in those categories was engagement jewelry where sales continued to underperform in the quarter. While Tiffany offers a wide ranging and we believe dominant diamond ring assortment, we've also observed that some customers wanted to customize their own rings. As a result, we recently introduced a program in our stores in the U.S. and Canada that allows customers to personalize their ring by separately choosing a diamond cut, setting and metal.
We're pleased with progress in several non-jewelry categories as well. In watches, we saw good growth in the quarter and there's been very favorable initial reaction to our new Tiffany Metro Watch collection for women. We also launched our new signature fragrance in the quarter which is now available in Tiffany stores as well as in other select stores globally. And as I mentioned earlier, we recently introduced our new home and accessories collection both online and in our stores. The already popular collection spans more than 300 items, both functional and whimsical, in a wide range of price points and is now being distributed worldwide.
We've met with many of you in recent months and I want to reiterate that Tiffany's top strategic priority is to drive solid comparable store sales growth. While we expect square footage to increase modestly each year in the future, it is comparable store and e-commerce sales growth, through increased frequency of customer visits and the conversion rate, that will ultimately contribute to driving higher margins and earnings growth. 
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg."
35576,543063218,1354570,"Tiffany & Co., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 29, 2017",2017-11-29,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter results reflect continued progress towards our long-term financial goals, which include mid-single-digit sales growth and high single-digit diluted earnings per share growth. Worldwide sales growth o",819,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter results reflect continued progress towards our long-term financial goals, which include mid-single-digit sales growth and high single-digit diluted earnings per share growth. Worldwide sales growth of 3% in the quarter is obviously below that range, but importantly, some sequential progress was made in comp store sales, which were down 1% in the third quarter after being down 3% in the first quarter and down 2% in the second quarter. And net earnings growth of 5% in the third quarter brings fiscal year-to-date diluted earnings per share growth to plus 7% versus year ago.
So while we're encouraged with third quarter results, we also acknowledge that we have a lot more work to do and at the risk of stating the obvious, we will not be satisfied until we achieve meaningful and sustainable comparable store sales growth across all regions.
Moving to gross margin. Gross margin increased by 30 basis points due -- in part due to a decline in wholesale diamond sales. Sales mix was not a meaningful contributor to the increase as sales growth was generally balanced across a wide range of price points and product categories. Also, while we have continued to benefit from lower commodity input costs, we are seeing that benefit diminish as the year goes on, which is consistent with our prior expectations. We now expect gross margin to be roughly unchanged for the full year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were roughly in line with sales growth in the third quarter with the increase tied to increased labor and incentive compensation costs as well as higher store depreciation and occupancy costs, partly offset by various ongoing cost savings initiatives. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A expenses have grown 2.4% versus reported sales growth of 2.3%.
Consistent with what's been previously stated, we remain committed to managing SG&A expense prudently and reducing costs where feasible in order to free up investment dollars to reinvest in the growth of our business. Modest gross margin expansion, coupled with SG&A expenses growing in line with sales, allowed third quarter operating margin to expand by 10 basis points. Our full year forecast calls for operating margin to increase over last year as reported but to be roughly in line with last year's margin when charges are excluded.
Interest and other expenses were essentially unchanged in the quarter and we expect it to be in the range of $35 million to $37 million for the full year.
From a tax standpoint, the third quarter effective tax rate was 33.4% which was more than a full point below last year's rate of 34.6%. Nonetheless, 2017's full year effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 33%.
Net inventories at October 31 were only 1% above last year, which is below the rate of sales growth. But you may recall that at July 31 of this year, inventory was 4% below a year ago. Simply put, we've increased our internal manufacturing targets over the past couple of months for several key gold products that have been selling faster than expected which, in turn, has pushed up raw material and work-in-process inventory levels. Because of this change, we now expect net inventories for the year to increase at approximately the same rate as sales growth.
Capital expenditures year-to-date were $146 million and our full year forecast, which assumed approximately $250 million in spending, has been revised slightly downward with our best estimate now being somewhere in the $235 million to $250 million range. The revision is solely due to timing of expenditures as we continue to anticipate annual CapEx spending of somewhere between 6% and 7% of sales. 
We invested $28 million in the third quarter to buy shares at an average cost of $92 per share, which is slightly up from the $21 million we invested during the second quarter and more than double the $11 million we invested during the first quarter.
Tiffany's balance sheet remains strong, having finished the third quarter with $1 billion of cash and short-term investments and total debt representing only 1/3 of stockholders' equity.
Putting it all together, we continue to expect total sales for the full year to increase by low-single digits and our forecast for diluted EPS continues to call for a high single-digit increase over last year's $3.55 per share on a GAAP basis and a mid-single-digit increase over last year's $3.75 per share excluding charges.
Relative to cash, we remain on pace with our expectations to deliver approximately $700 million of net operating cash flow and approximately $450 million of free cash flow for the full year.
So in closing, while progress was made in the quarter, we remain focused on sharpening our strategies and improving our execution in order to generate sustainable comp store sales growth and consistent diluted earnings per share growth. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Mark."

I'm pleased to have this opportunity to briefly introduce myself to you and I look forward to meeting many of you in the coming months. 
Let me begin by saying that I'm very excited to be here at Tiffany. I spent many years in the jewelry business at Bulgari and I've long respected Tiffany as a house of extraordinary design and as a formidable competitor.
In my first 7 weeks at Tiffany, I've met with many members of our HQ and regional teams and I'm impressed with the skills and passion for our unique brand. I've traveled and visited, so far, about 40 stores in the Americas, Asia Pacific and Japan, and I'm very glad I also visited 3 of our manufacturing and logistic sites in the United States, in New York, in Rhode Island and in New Jersey. We have powerful internal operations with hundreds of truly exceptional jewelry outfits, form factors and engravers. It's thanks to them, to their skills, their hands, that Tiffany can offer such a vast assortment. From multimillion dollar one-of-a-kind creations to everyday jewelry, we pick consistent and supreme quality.
I accepted this position because I strongly believe that the Tiffany & Co. brand is healthy with tremendous opportunities to grow. As we move forward, we will leverage our core strength and adapt as appropriate while, of course, we will always remain true to our heritage and brand integrity. We will be accelerating the pace of product innovation. We are focused on the most effective marketing communications. We will continue to enhance the in-store and online experience and our growth is reinforced by our strong supply chain capabilities and a solid financial position. I believe our company has the capabilities to further delight our customers, inspire our employees and reward our shareholders. At the same time, we acknowledge that some of our competitors have recently posted stronger sales growth than us, which I can assure you will not be acceptable in the long term.
I'm increasingly passionate about Tiffany and I'm honored to be given this great opportunity. As I further study our business, I will be reviewing my thoughts with our Board of Directors and will then have more to say to you in the coming months. I appreciate your interest in this great company. I can assure you that we will continue to work very persistently to achieve the healthy long-term financial performance that you have come to expect from us.

We invested $28 million in the third quarter to buy shares at an average cost of $92 per share, which is slightly up from the $21 million we invested during the second quarter and more than double the $11 million we invested during the first quarter.
Tiffany's balance sheet remains strong, having finished the third quarter with $1 billion of cash and short-term investments and total debt representing only 1/3 of stockholders' equity.
Putting it all together, we continue to expect total sales for the full year to increase by low-single digits and our forecast for diluted EPS continues to call for a high single-digit increase over last year's $3.55 per share on a GAAP basis and a mid-single-digit increase over last year's $3.75 per share excluding charges.
Relative to cash, we remain on pace with our expectations to deliver approximately $700 million of net operating cash flow and approximately $450 million of free cash flow for the full year.
So in closing, while progress was made in the quarter, we remain focused on sharpening our strategies and improving our execution in order to generate sustainable comp store sales growth and consistent diluted earnings per share growth. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Mark."
