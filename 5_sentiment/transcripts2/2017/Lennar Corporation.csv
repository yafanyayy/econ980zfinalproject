This morning, I'm out West with Rick Beckwitt, our President. Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; and Eric Feder, from our Rialto group.

Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; and Eric Feder, from our Rialto group. We're going to begin our trade partners Summit later tonight, that's why we're out here. And this is where we invite many of our manufacturers, suppliers and distributors to discuss the homebuilding landscape and to consider better ways to partner and to keep cost and profitability properly aligned.
On the call from Miami, we have Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and of course, David Collins, our controller, who delivered our forward-looking statement. And we also have Jeff Krasnoff, our CEO of Rialto. I want to apologize in advance if we're a little disjointed as we're going to attempt to coordinate from different locations. As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview and Bruce will deliver further detail in guidance, as always, after our prepared overview, we'll open to Q&A. And I'd liked to request again that you limit your time to one question, one follow-up, so we can enable as many participants as possible within the hour that we've allotted.
So let me go ahead and begin and start by saying that market conditions certainly feel like they are strong and strengthening. The slow and steady, though sometimes erratic, market improvement that we've seen for the entirety of this recovery seems to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal. 
While our first quarter operating results, particularly gross margins, reflect some of the sluggishness seen at the end of last year, our sales results went from tepid, to better, to strong as the quarter progressed. Limited supply and production deficits are now intersecting with land and labor shortage, and this suggest, though not yet seen, but suggest, that pricing power is on the horizon as we move through the year.
So what are the factors that are driving the change in market sentiment and condition? They're certainly not apparent if you listen to the news stations. As our traffic has increased, we're getting some very direct feedback from our customers as they tell us what they are looking for, their timing and sometimes, their motivation. There's clearly a sense of general optimism in the market. There's a perception that jobs are being created, and that wages are actually starting to move upward. There's a solidifying sense that the government has adopted a business from the posture, and that will result in real changes to tax rates and to the regulatory environment. The banking world is making more overtures to small businesses and to mortgage borrowers, and there's a sense that borrowers can make their way through the process. 
Additionally, the upward direction of interest rates has encouraged some to get off the fence and consider purchasing a home rather than renting. Rents have risen and the prospect of higher purchase prices and higher interest rate makes a compelling case that today's opportunity might be the best opportunity to leave those annual increases in monthly payments behind.
Although there's also a lot of negative noise at the same time, it seems so far that the market is looking through the noise and is injecting optimism about the future in its purchase consideration. Additionally, the economic realities of a constraint supply of housing options and the economic realities of rental rates are beginning to have a rational impact on decision-making for the first-time buyer as millennials are coming to market. Interestingly, the front page of USA Today reports today that 60% of millennials ages 18 to 35 are living with parents, relatives and roommates, and that is a 115-year high.
Across our platform, each of our business segments bends [ph] from the improved -- improvement in the market. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, we're expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve and will exceed expectations, particularly in the back half of the year.
Although our first quarter earnings were lower compared to the first quarter of 2016, that is primarily due to a higher tax rate, some onetime WCI closing costs and a fully expected decline in gross margins. While some of the same pressures will exist in the second quarter as well, the acceleration in sales pace against the limited supply and constrained capacity for the market to quickly increase production portends [ph] pricing power and a very strong second half of the year.
Against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. Our for-sale core homebuilding operations are extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017. Our sales were up 11% year-over-year before WCI, 12% including WCI, driven by our strategy of driving better quality traffic through our digital marketing efforts. Interestingly, our Internet leads were up 18% year-over-year to about $100,000 for the quarter. Our social media followers were up 17% year-over-year to 2.8 million on an annual basis, and YouTube views were up by 10 million for the year.
Fueled by our digital marketing efforts and other initiatives as well, we continue to focus on operational efficiency as our SG&A as at -- is at a historic low for our first quarter. Again, interestingly, our marketing and advertising spend is now down year-over-year for 9 consecutive quarters.
We continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency, and we are improving. And while we match production with sales pace, we continue to maximize our gross to net margin at 21.1% and 10.8%, respectively, as we maintain higher sales price in order to maximize returns on our valuable land asset, and we manage costs by striving to be the builder of choice to the trade in each of our markets. Our trade partner, Summit, that I mentioned earlier, is a big part of that effort.
Though some might be concerned by our lower gross margin, we are exactly where we expected to be in the first part of this year, and our year-end margin will still be right on top of our guidance. Of course, we closed on the WCI acquisition in the first quarter, and that transaction is going very well, being guided by Rick Beckwitt and his team, led by Fred Rothman and Darin McMurray. And I advised Rick to speak specifically to this transaction. So let me turn it over briefly to Rick."
30763,422963363,1160244,"Lennar Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 21, 2017",2017-03-21,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart. On February 10, 2017, Lennar closed on the acquisition of WCI Communities that was previously announced in September 2016. The purchase price for WCI totaled approximately $643 million, which we funded with cash, and we also assumed $250 m",983,"Thanks, Stuart. On February 10, 2017, Lennar closed on the acquisition of WCI Communities that was previously announced in September 2016. The purchase price for WCI totaled approximately $643 million, which we funded with cash, and we also assumed $250 million in senior notes. The transaction combined 2 of the largest homebuilders in Florida and significantly expands Lennar's product offerings to include luxury, single-family and multifamily homes.
WCI is focused on amenity rich, lifestyle master-planned communities, catering to the move-up, active adult and second-home buyers, truly complements Lennar's leading market position in the entry-level and move-up markets in Florida.
During our extensive due diligence period, we identified 5 main drivers of value creation and synergies. I will go through each of these drivers in a second, but I'm happy to say that the WCI integration has gone very smoothly, and that we're ahead of schedule, which will lead to a timely realization of this value creation for our shareholders.
The first driver was WCI's portfolio of low-cost land located in most of the highest growth and largest Florida coastal markets. We acquired over 13,500 homesites, adding 51 actively selling communities and an additional pipeline of future community openings for the next several years. This land portfolio will produce strong gross margins going forward.
The portfolio included many large amenity rich, A+ master-planned communities that would be impossible to purchase in today's land-constrained market. We have great confidence that we will produce extremely strong returns from these assets as they will be managed by some of the best-performing and most profitable positions in our company.
When we closed the acquisition, we acquired 361 homes in backlog with an average sales price of $516,000, totaling $188 million in near-term revenue and cash flow. In addition, at the end of the first quarter, we had 942 WCI homes in various stages of construction.
The second driver was the value maximization of the communities through the reallocation of the WCI and Lennar product and branding. During the due diligence period, we analyzed [ph] each community to determine whether we would make higher returns and profits by building WCI product or Lennar product. Approximately 1/3 of the communities that we acquired will be converted to the Lennar brand. In these communities, Lennar has product that is very similar to WCI. And by converting these communities to the Lennar brand, we will significantly lower our build cost with very little, if any, impact on the sales price of the home. We will also significantly increase sales pace and reduce cycle times. These changes will increase both profitability and IRR.
We've also identified several Lennar communities that we will be building WCI product. In these communities, we will be able to achieve much higher sales prices with the WCI brand. We are also planning to build both WCI and Lennar brands in some of our larger communities that benefit from a dual marketing strategy. This will allow us to increase absorptions and maximize the value of our underlying land positions. This is something we've done very successfully with our higher price village builders brand in Texas. 
The third driver is utilizing our efficient homebuilding operating platform and leveraging our purchasing power. Included in this is streamlining WCI's approach to options, but we will still offer WCI homebuyers a selection of high-quality options and upgrades, we will be restructuring the design studio to include more streamlined selection of options and upgrades. This is similar to what we do in Texas and has allowed us to offer options and upgrades with a more cost-effective G&A structure. Given our leading national and Florida position, Lennar can purchase materials and labor at a much lower price than WCI. This will not only lower build cost, but provide greater value to the WCI homebuyers. Cost savings will also flow from reduced cycle time.
We've been working with our trade partners to rebid the WCI floor plan and make them more efficient to build. We expect to have this completed by the end of our second quarter. However, you will not see the full benefits of lower cost per square foot until 2018 when all of the acquired inventory homes under construction are delivered. Based on our due diligence and work to date, we expect to stay between $8 to $12 per square foot or 200 to 300 basis points on new starts once the rebidding process is completed. 
And finally, given the strides we made in late and digital marketing, we expect lower sales and marketing costs associated with these WCI communities as well. 
The fourth driver was the synergies associated with lowering G&A costs. This include the elimination of costs associated with running 2 public companies as well as headcount reductions associated with overlapping core BRIC and operating functions. While there may be -- while there will be some upfront costs associated with implementing these changes, we anticipate annualized savings of approximately $30 million beginning in late 2017. I'm say to say that Keith Fast, the CEO of WCI, will not be moving forward with Lennar. While I'd hope that Keith would join us and be a big part of our growth going forward, he has chosen to take some time off and explore some other opportunities. We wish Keith great success going forward and thank him and the entire WCI team for building such an incredible company. 
Finally, the last driver was capturing incremental profits during the rollout of our mortgage entitle operations to WCI's homebuilding operation and its Bircher halfway home services operation. This process has begun, and we should see a meaningful pickup in activity in Financial Services as we move into 2018. 
In conclusion, we're very excited about this acquisition. And while we're focused on these 5 value creation ideas, we are certain that we'll find other areas that will benefit our shareholders. I'll turn it back over to Stuart"

As you can see, I think we've got our WCI transaction well in hand, and we're very enthusiastic about it. So to wrap up homebuilding. Let's say, we've noted before that our strategy remains a clear pivot in land strategy towards a shorter term land acquisition and towards a 7% to 10% growth strategy. Given the WCI addition, our 2017 growth rate should be on the higher side of our goals or a little over that goal. 
We've also refocused on expanding our first-time buyer offering with our mix now standing at right around 40%. Combined, these strategic elements will continue to produce very strong cash flow for the company and will result in continued balance sheet improvement. Now let me turn briefly to our other segments. 
As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is also off to a great start in 2017. Of course, the business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and will expand with the addition of the WCI acquisition, but it's also expanding its nonlennar business reach and growing bottom line. Financial Services results exceeded last year's first quarter results by 38%, driven in part by increased profitability and title operation. And Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in his portion. Lennar Multifamily. We couldn't be more pleased with the evolution and performance of LMC. Our entry into the apartment development business was timed perfectly, and LMC continues to execute flawlessly. 
LMC, under the leadership of Todd Farrell, has reached maturity and is poised for continuous annual profitability. As noted in our press release, this segment generated $19.2 million in pretax income, up 57% from last year, as we sold another 2 communities under our merchant build program. 
During the first quarter, we started some 1,373 apartments in 5 communities with a total development cost of approximately $600 million. As of February 28, 2017, we had a geographically diverse pipeline of 74 communities, totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes with a total development cost of almost $8 billion. We are gearing up our build-to-core program that we've discussed in the past with some 20 communities for 6,000 apartments already under construction to fill the $2.2 billion equity bucket with geographically diversified A-located, brand-new and modern apartment communities in a generally shelter constrained environment.
Rialto also turned in an excellent quarter. Rialto contributed $12 million to the bottom line this quarter as market conditions favored this business segment as well. The various settlements of Rialto are starting to take shape as we continue to work through the remaining legacy assets on book. And this quarter, we have started to book some of the long-awaited promote from Fund 1, which reflects the work of the extraordinary team of professionals investing and managing third-party capital and generating industry-leading returns. 
Additionally, market conditions particularly favored Rialto Mortgage Finance as that exceptionally run team, which is focused on the commercial mortgage conduit business, exceeded expectations and closed 3 transactions totaling $478 million. The intersection of an outstanding operating team and strong market conditions produced an industry-leading net margin for the company.
Finally, FivePoint remains poised as a self-sufficient, stand-alone, large-scale community builder in California. This company manages and controls some of the best positioned properties in some of the most land-constrained markets in the country. The current market optimism raises the possibility that this company that's been waiting for market conditions to reopen the IPO market might just find a window to go public. We'll see if the current sweep of optimism in the capital and stock market sets the stage for FivePoint's future. 
So in conclusion, across the platform of our company, we're feeling pretty optimistic about this year ahead. We're clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on the strong market conditions that seem apparent. Each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform in strengthening market condition. People, assets and operations are all aligned to perform in 2017, and we look forward to keeping you updated. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bruce."
30763,422963363,1160244,"Lennar Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 21, 2017",2017-03-21,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the first quarter, driven by a 13% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a consistent average selling price of $365,000.

Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the first quarter, driven by a 13% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a consistent average selling price of $365,000. WCI had a minimal impact to revenues in the first quarter as there were only 51 deliveries from the acquisition date until the end of the quarter. 
Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 21.1%. And as Stuart mentioned, we're still on track with our previously stated gross margin goal of 22% to 22.5% for the full year. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land and construction cost. 
Our gross margin percentage was impacted 10 basis points due to the write-up of WCI backlog inventory that closed during the first quarter. Sales incentives were 5.9% this quarter compared to 5.6% in the prior year, but it improved sequentially from our fourth quarter total of 6.2%. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our homebuilding East segment. Direct construction cost were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $55 per square foot, and that was driven by approximately a 6% increase in labor and 3% in material cost.
SG&A percentage, as a percent of home sale revenue in the first quarter, was 10.3%. We're continuing to improve SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and benefiting from the focus on technology investments that Stuart mentioned. Included in SG&A in the first quarter were one-time expenses related to the WCI acquisition, mainly offset by one-time legal and insurance benefits, resulting in a net one-time charge of approximately $2.7 million or 10 basis points impact to SG&A percent during the quarter.
Other income was $5.7 million compared to other expense of $600,000 in the same period last year. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $11.5 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they encourage G&A costs while ramping up for future land sales. 
During the quarter, we opened 58 new communities and added 51 net communities from the WCI acquisition to end the quarter with 752 net active communities. New home orders increased 12% and new order dollar value increased 16% for the quarter. WCI had a minimal impact to this number, as there were only 70 new home orders from this acquisition since we only had a couple of weeks in that first quarter post acquisition. 
Our sales pace was higher compared to the prior year at 3 sales per community per month versus 2.9, and that improved sequentially throughout the quarter. The cancellation rate was 16%. 
In the first quarter, we purchased approximately 8,300 homesites, totaling $659 million. And just a note, the first quarter usually has the largest dollar amount of land purchases for the year. Including the homesites from the WCI acquisition, our homesites owned and controlled now total 173,000 homesites, of which 137,000 are owned and 36,000 are controlled. We now have approximately 4.6 years supply of land owned based on this year's projected deliveries. 
We expect the year supply of land to continue to define as we continue with our soft pivot land strategy. Our completed unsold homes at the end of the quarter were in our normal range of 1 to 2 per community totaling 1,342 homes. 
Turning to financial services. This segment had strong results with operating earnings of $20.7 million compared to $14.9 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased slightly to $13.4 million from $13 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by higher volume. Mortgage originations increased to $1.8 billion versus $1.7 billion in the prior year. And the capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 81% compared to 82% in the prior year.
Our title company's profit increased to $6.8 million during the quarter from $2 million in the prior year. And this was driven by a 15% increase in revenue during the quarter and the associated overhead leverage from this higher volume.
Turning to the Rialto segment and providing some more details. The operating earnings were $12 million compared to $1.9 million in the prior year, both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $34.4 million of earnings, primarily due to $33.4 million of management fees and other, and this included $10 million of carried interest received in the quarter related to Fund 1. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals approximately $125 million.
Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $478 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $33.2 million compared to $380 million and $3.9 million in the prior year, respectively. And these are both before their G&A expenses. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in volume and average net margin to the securitizations from 1.6% in the prior year to 7.1% in the first quarter. 
Our direct investments had a loss of $15.9 million during the quarter, as we continue to work towards monetizing the remaining assets purchased from early portfolios. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $33.3 million for the quarter and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was $6.4 million. 
Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $163 million of cash. Turning to the Multifamily segment. I'll just add a couple of comments to what Stuart mentioned. The $19.2 million of operating profit in the quarter was driven by the segment's $26 million share of gains from the sale of 2 operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 34%. The rate is higher than the prior year's rate of 28.1% because the prior year had one-time adjustments due to an IRS settlement and energy credits. We expect the tax rate to be 34% approximately for the remainder of 2017. 
Turning to the balance sheet, which remained strong, we had a net debt to total capital of 41.6%, which was an improvement of 370 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with over $640 million of cash and only $250 million of borrowings on our $1.5 billion committed revolving credit facility. 
Additionally, we grew stockholders equity by 24% year-over-year to $7.2 billion, and our book value per share grew to $30.70 per share. The preliminary goodwill estimate from the WCI acquisition is $150 million to $175 million, and that's subject to revision as it is still being reviewed both internally and externally. 
During the quarter, we issued $600 million of foreign aid senior notes due 2022 and we added $250 million of 6 7/8 senior notes due 2021 as part of the WCI acquisition, which we are likely to refinance at the next call date in August.
Finally, I would like to update our goals for 2017. Some of you already included WCI in your estimates for 2017 and all of the numbers that I'll be providing here include the full impact of the WCI acquisition, which will be accretive in 2017. 
Starting with deliveries. We are increasing our delivery goal to between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 75% to 80% for the second quarter, 75% to 80% for the third quarter and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We are still expecting an average sales price between $365,000 and $370,000 for the full year, and we are right on track with our operating margins of around 13% for the full year. There will be any impact to our second quarter gross margin from writing up WCI's backlog and purchase accounting. As a result, we expect our second quarter gross margin percentage to be between 21% and 21.5%. 
While the full year gross margin is still expected, as I mentioned, to be 22% to 22.5%. We still expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to between 9.1% to 9.3% for the full year. The second quarter will have some nonrecurring transition costs relating to the WCI integration. Therefore, we expect SG&A to be approximately 9.5% in Q2. The operating leverage will be in the second half for the year to match up with our highest-volume quarters.
Financial Services, we are increasing the goal to approximately $160 million for the year with the second quarter expected to be approximately $40 million. The increase is due to the partial year inclusion of the Berkshire Hathaway Realty services brokerage from the WCI acquisition as well as additional closings from the WCI deal. 
We are adding WCI to our mortgage platform, although keep in mind, 50% of the WCI buyers use all cash and we will focus on capturing a high percentage of the other 50% that require mortgage. 
Rialto is still expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year with the second quarter expected to be approximately $5 million. Multifamily is still expected to be between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. The second quarter is expected to be also approximately $5 million, which includes one apartment community sale. 
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income is still expected to be in a range of $70 million to $80 million of profits for the year. However, the second quarter is expected to have net expenses of $15 million to $20 million while the second half of 2017 is driving all the profit for this category.
Corporate G&A is still expected to be 2.2% to 2.3%. And our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities. 
And last, our balance sheet, we still continue to expect a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we accomplished in the prior year. With these updated goals in mind, we are well positioned for the remainder of 2017. And with that, let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

But what we are seeing and what we've heard a lot about is supply constraint across all kinds -- all dwelling product types, from rental to for sale. And we've also seen that we're line constrained and production constrained, and that's been the case for some time. The injection of some market optimism and what we saw in our sales pace as we went through the quarter really gives me reason to believe that as we look out ahead a couple of quarters, we are going to start to see prices move just as we would expect with a demand and supply imbalance, with demand increasing and supply somewhat constrained. So that's kind of where we are on that. Our guidance was really rooted in where we've seen things on more current basis."

And Stuart, maybe since you're on the verge of meeting with a bunch of your trades, hopefully, you'll get some more insights here. But if you look at it in California, there's been some pretty wet weather there. And I know there are some concern that we might see something similar to what happened in 2015 as an industry when, I think, Texas, in particular, felt some pretty significant headwinds from a wet spring. And as the year went on, I think a lot of builders struggled to get home closed and costs went up. And you guys obviously navigated that very well. But it certainly does create risk from the industry as concerned as far as cost going up. So A, I'm curious, what you're hearing there as far as the just general availability of labor and the industry's ability to deal with some of those weather headwinds. And second question, just California specifically, there's some news about a proposed bill out there that would potentially raise construction costs quite a bit with the prevailing wage requirement and communities there. So was curious if you looked at that at all, what impact that might have, given your pretty significant land position in California and what -- how you would handicap the likelihood of that passing at this point."

Let's start with the California question, and let's remember that there are always legislative moves a foot to alter the landscape in California. The legislation that's proposed at this point is just another one of those that comes down the pipe on a pretty regular basis. And we'll just have to see where it works out. It's a build that is implemented as it's described would have an impact on cost relative to residential construction. Some communities out there, including some of our larger scale communities in FivePoint, might be exempt from the legislation. So it would be a mixed bag of impacts, some of them positive, some of them negative. I think, overall, negative for affordability in California. And so this is going to be talked through or worked out and see where we actually end up. But this is the landscape in California. And I think that all of these type of legislative initiatives come with positive and negative impacts and we'll just have to see where this one shakes out. As it relates to construction cost overall. The story around construction cost has been one of increases over the past many quarters. You've heard us talk about that. I think that as we think about our numbers, construction costs as a percentage of our sales price has probably moved up around 100 basis points. And there's most certainly pressure on construction costs in the labor constrained market. And this is why we focus on our trade partners, Summit. Our; relationship with our trade partners; making sure that we are the builder of choice for our trade partners. We think that this is a strategic advantage for the company. And we spend a lot of time developing relationships throughout our trade. So let me just turn it over to Jon and ask him because Jon really spearhead this effort within the company and has done a remarkable job."

Lumber, for example, is up about 9% since December. We've seen an impact in there. A year ago, the commodities, they all have moved up in part in reaction to expected expenditures by the government infrastructure, and that's affecting the supply chain. But as Stuart mentioned, our focus is -- those cost pressures are going to be what they are. And we position ourselves to how we take advantage of the marketplace of what landscape is in front of us. And I think with excellent communication relationships with our trades to make sure we're well positioned, there will be a spike of activity once the weather dries up in California, as you know.

It seems to be coming up with conversations with investors that could be offset. And I was curious, if you might be able to opine on in general sense of order of magnitude how this one may come out in the wash, those are the 3 components being the reduction of interest deductibility, energy tax credits and perhaps, the manufacturer's deduction.

So I'm not really sure where you get your 7, but let's put that aside. And let's understand where my commentary comes from. Remember that when we're looking at our monthly year-over-year, we're are looking at comparison to last year. So let's take seasonality out of the equation because we're looking at December to December, January to January, February to February. So the seasonality is injected at both sides. And what we were seeing in terms of the numbers is a slower and lower comparison in December, a comparable comparison in January and the substantially higher comparison in February. So that's the numerical side of the commentary. But the empirical side is what I look to dovetail with the numbers side as I think about these things and I try to think about them in realtime and balance what we're hearing at the front line in the field from our customers and measure that up against what we're seeing in the numbers. And so the commentary really drives from the kind of traffic patterns, the questions that people are talking about and the kinds of people that are showing up. What we are starting to see, I think in my commentary, I noted that the millennials are doubled up at about a 60% rate living at home with parent, relatives or roommates. It's at 115-year high, as reported in USA Today. I don't know if that's exactly the right number, but it is directionally interesting. And we're starting to see some of that cohort start to come out to our sales centers and talk about the fact that rental rates are high, rental rates have been moving, rental rates create some instability and it's time to start thinking about buying a home, 30-year mortgage, fixing a monthly payment and looking at the possibilities and benefits of actual ownership, dovetailing that with the banks talking about coming back to market.

I was interested in -- you mentioned that there's a low cost basis there and attractive margins. At the same time, you're going to have the typical purchase accounting impact on 2Q. But once you work through that, from my understanding, purchase accounting typically does impact what's -- the overall lot position as well. What I was just curious to get a sense, maybe, Bruce, if you want to draw some pioneer or talk about what's been able to be work through or work out from an accounting perspective, how should we think about the gross margins from WCI because typically, from my understanding, those are rate enough as well. I don't know if there was different nuances or any asynchronies with this particular acquisition."

So the real purchase accounting impact is really in the second quarter as we write off backlog. And then as you get beyond the second quarter, for the most part, the integration cost, the write-up of backlog is all behind us, we expect. And then for the second half of the year and beyond, you get back to more normal type of margins at that we would expect in that marketplace, and that's probably the best way to think about it."

This morning, I at West with Rick Beckwitt, our President, Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, and Eric Feder from our Rialto. We're going to begin our Trade Partner Summit later tonight that's why we're out here. And this is where we invite many of our manufacturers, suppliers and distributors to discuss the homebuilding landscape and to consider better ways to partner and to keep costs and profitability property -- properly aligned.
On the call from Miami, we have Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and of course, Dave Collins, our Controller, to delivered our forward-looking statement. And we also have Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto. I want to apologize in advance if we're a little disjointed as we're going to attempt to coordinate from different locations.
As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview, and Bruce will deliver further detail and guidance. As always, after our prepared overview, we'll open to Q&A, and I'd like to request again that you limit your time to one question and one follow-up, so we can enable as many participants as possible within the hour that we've allotted.
So let me go ahead and begin and start by saying that market conditions certainly feel like they are strong and strengthening. The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we've seen for the entirety of this recovery seems to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal. While our first quarter operating results, particularly gross margins, reflects some of the sluggishness seen at the end of last year, our sales results went from tepid to better to strong as the quarter progressed. Limited supply and production deficits are now intersecting with land and labor shortage, and this suggests, though not yet seen but suggests, that pricing power is on the horizon as we move through the year.
So what are the factors that are driving the change in market sentiment and condition? They're certainly not apparent if you listen to the news stations. As our traffic has increased, we're getting some very direct feedback from our customers as they tell us what they are looking for, their timing and sometimes their motivation. There's clearly a sense of general optimism in the market. There's a perception that jobs are being created, and that wages are actually starting to move upward. There's a solidifying sense that the government has adopted a business-friendly posture, and that will result in real changes to tax rates and to the regulatory environment. The banking world is making more overtures to small businesses and to mortgage borrowers, and there's a sense that borrowers can make their way through the process.
Additionally, the upward direction of interest rates has encouraged some to get off the fence and consider purchasing a home rather than renting. Rents have risen, and the prospect of higher purchase prices and higher interest rates make the compelling case that today's opportunity might be the best opportunity to leave those annual increases and monthly payments behind. Although there are also a lot of negative noise at the same time, it seems so far that the market is looking through the noise and is injecting optimism about the future in its purchase consideration. Additionally, the economic reality is of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic realities of rental rates are beginning to have a rational impact on decision-making for the first-time buyers as millennials are coming to market.
Interestingly, the front page of USA TODAY reports today that 60% of millennials ages 18 to 35 are living with parents, relatives and roommates, and that is a 115-year high.
Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the improved -- improvement in the market. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, we're expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve and will exceed expectations, particularly in the back half of the year.
Although our first quarter earnings were lower compared to the first quarter of 2016, that is primarily due to a higher tax rate, some onetime WCI closing costs and a fully expected decline in gross margins. While some of the same pressures will exist in the second quarter as well, the acceleration in sales pace against the limited supply and constrained capacity for the market to quickly increase production portends pricing power and a very strong second half of the year.
Against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. Our for-sale core homebuilding operations are extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017. Our sales were up 11% year-over-year before WCI, 12% including WCI, driven by our strategy of driving better quality traffic through our digital marketing efforts. Interestingly, our Internet leads were up 18% year-over-year to about $100,000 for the quarter. Our social media followers were up 17% year-over-year to 2.8 million on an annual basis, and YouTube views were up by 10 million for the year.
Fueled by our digital marketing efforts and other initiatives as well, we continue to focus on operational efficiency as our SG&A as at -- is at a historic low for our first quarter. Again, interestingly, our marketing and advertising spend is now down year-over-year for 9 consecutive quarters.
We continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency, and we are improving. And while we match production with sales pace, we continue to maximize our gross to net margin at 21.1% and 10.8%, respectively, as we maintain higher sales price in order to maximize returns on our valuable land asset, and we manage costs by striving to be the builder of choice to the trade in each of our markets. Our trade partner, Summit, that I mentioned earlier, is a big part of that effort.
Though some might be concerned by our lower gross margin, we are exactly where we expected to be in the first part of this year, and our year-end margin will still be right on top of our guidance. Of course, we closed on the WCI acquisition in the first quarter, and that transaction is going very well, being guided by Rick Beckwitt and his team, led by Fred Rothman and Darin McMurray. And I advised Rick to speak specifically to this transaction. So let me turn it over briefly to Rick."

On February 10, 2017, Lennar closed on the acquisition of WCI Communities that was previously announced in September 2016. The purchase price for WCI totaled approximately $643 million, which we funded with cash, and we also assumed $250 m",983,"Thanks, Stuart. On February 10, 2017, Lennar closed on the acquisition of WCI Communities that was previously announced in September 2016. The purchase price for WCI totaled approximately $643 million, which we funded with cash, and we also assumed $250 million in senior notes. The transaction combined 2 of the largest homebuilders in Florida and significantly expands Lennar's product offerings to include luxury, single-family and multifamily homes.
WCI is focused on amenity rich, lifestyle master-planned communities, catering to the move-up, active adult and second-home buyers, truly complements Lennar's leading market position in the entry-level and move-up markets in Florida.
During our extensive due diligence period, we identified 5 main drivers of value creation and synergies. I will go through each of these drivers in a second, but I'm happy to say that the WCI integration has gone very smoothly, and that we're ahead of schedule, which will lead to a timely realization of this value creation for our shareholders.
The first driver was WCI's portfolio of low-cost land located in most of the highest growth and largest Florida coastal markets. We acquired over 13,500 homesites, adding 51 actively selling communities and an additional pipeline of future community openings for the next several years. This land portfolio will produce strong gross margins going forward.
The portfolio included many large amenity rich, A+ master-planned communities that would be impossible to purchase in today's land-constrained market. We have great confidence that we will produce extremely strong returns from these assets as they will be managed by some of the best-performing and most profitable positions in our company.
When we closed the acquisition, we acquired 361 homes in backlog with an average sales price of $516,000, totaling $188 million in near-term revenue and cash flow. In addition, at the end of the first quarter, we had 942 WCI homes in various stages of construction.
The second driver was the value maximization of the communities through the reallocation of the WCI and Lennar product and branding. During the due diligence period, we analyzed each community to determine whether we would make higher returns and profits by building WCI product or Lennar product. Approximately 1/3 of the communities that we acquired will be converted to the Lennar brand. In these communities, Lennar has product that is very similar to WCI. And by converting these communities to the Lennar brand, we will significantly lower our build cost with very little, if any, impact on the sales price of the home. We will also significantly increase sales pace and reduce cycle times. These changes will increase both profitability and IRR.
We've also identified several Lennar communities that we will be building WCI product. In these communities, we will be able to achieve much higher sales prices with the WCI brand. We are also planning to build both WCI and Lennar brands in some of our larger communities that benefit from a dual marketing strategy. This will allow us to increase absorptions and maximize the value of our underlying land positions. This is something we've done very successfully with our higher price village builders brand in Texas.
The third driver is utilizing our efficient homebuilding operating platform and leveraging our purchasing power. Included in this is streamlining WCI's approach to options. While we will still offer WCI homebuyers a selection of high-quality options and upgrades, we will be restructuring the design studio to include more streamlined selection of options and upgrades. This is similar to what we do in Texas and has allowed us to offer options and upgrades with a more cost-effective G&A structure. Given our leading national and Florida position, Lennar can purchase materials and labor at a much lower price than WCI. This will not only lower build cost but provide greater value to the WCI homebuyers. Cost savings will also flow from reduced cycle time.
We've been working with our trade partners to rebid the WCI floor plans and make them more efficient to build. We expect to have this completed by the end of our second quarter. However, you will not see the full benefits of lower cost per square foot until 2018 once all of the acquired inventory and homes under construction are delivered. Based on our due diligence and work to date, we expect to stay between $8 to $12 per square foot or 200 to 300 basis points on new starts once the rebidding process is completed. And finally, given the strides we made in late in digital marketing, we expect lower sales and marketing costs associated with these WCI communities as well.
The fourth driver was the synergies associated with lowering G&A costs. This include the elimination of costs associated with running 2 public companies as well as headcount reductions associated with overlapping core BRIC and operating functions. While there may be -- while there will be some upfront costs associated with implementing these changes, we anticipate annualized savings of approximately $30 million beginning in late 2017.
I'm sad to say that Keith Bass, the CEO of WCI, will not be moving forward with Lennar. While I'd hope that Keith would join us and be a big part of our growth going forward, he has chosen to take some time off and explore some other opportunities. We wish Keith great success going forward and thank him and the entire WCI team for building such an incredible company.
Finally, the last driver was capturing incremental profits through the rollout of our mortgage and title operations to WCI's homebuilding operation and its Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices operation. This process has begun, and we should see a meaningful pickup in activity in Financial Services as we move into 2018.
In conclusion, we're very excited about this acquisition. And while we're focused on these 5 value creation ideas, we are certain that we'll find other areas that will benefit our shareholders.
I'll turn it back over to Stuart."

As you can see, I think we've got our WCI transaction well in hand, and we're very enthusiastic about it. So to wrap up homebuilding, let's say, we've noted before that our strategy remains a clear pivot in land strategy towards a shorter term land acquisition and towards a 7% to 10% growth strategy. Given the WCI addition, our 2017 growth rate should be on the higher side of our goals or a little over that goal.
We've also refocused on expanding our first-time buyer offering with our mix now standing at right around 40%. Combined, these strategic elements will continue to produce very strong cash flow for the company and will result in continued balance sheet improvement.
Now let me turn briefly to our other segments. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is also off to a great start in 2017. Of course, the business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and will expand with the addition of the WCI acquisition, but it's also expanding its non-Lennar business reach and growing bottom line. Financial Services results exceeded last year's first quarter result by 38% driven in part by increased profitability and title operations. And Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in his portion.
Lennar Multifamily. We couldn't be more pleased with the evolution and performance of LMC. Our entry into the apartment development business was timed perfectly, and LMC continues to execute flawlessly. LMC, under the leadership of Todd Farrell, has reached maturity and is poised for continuous annual profitability. As noted in our press release, this segment generated $19.2 million in pretax income, up 57% from last year, as we sold another 2 communities under our merchant build program.
During the first quarter, we started some 1,373 apartments in 5 communities with a total development cost of approximately $600 million. As of February 28, 2017, we had a geographically diverse pipeline of 74 communities, totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes with a total development cost of almost $8 billion. We are gearing up our build-to-core program that we've discussed in the past with some 20 communities for 6,000 apartments already under construction to fill the $2.2 billion equity bucket with geographically diversified A-located, brand-new and modern apartment communities in a generally shelter-constrained environment.
Rialto also turned in an excellent quarter. Rialto contributed $12 million to the bottom line this quarter as market condition -- conditions favored this business segment as well. The various settlements of Rialto are starting to take shape as we continue to work through the remaining legacy assets on book. In this quarter, we have started to book some of the long-awaited promote from Fund 1, which reflects the work of the extraordinary team of professionals investing and managing third-party capital and generating industry-leading returns.
Additionally, market conditions particularly favored Rialto Mortgage Finance as that exceptionally run team, which is focused on the commercial mortgage conduit business, exceeded expectations and closed 3 transactions totaling $478 million. The intersection of an outstanding operating team and strong market conditions produced an industry-leading net margin for the company.
Finally, FivePoint remains poised as a self-sufficient, stand-alone, large-scale community builder in California. This company manages and controls some of the best-positioned properties in some of the most land-constrained markets in the country. The current market optimism raises the possibility that this company that's been waiting for market conditions to reopen the IPO market might just find a window to go public. We'll see if the current sweep of optimism in the capital and stock market sets the stage for FivePoint's future.
So in conclusion, across the platform of our company, we're feeling pretty optimistic about this year ahead. We're clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on the strong market conditions that seem apparent. Each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform in strengthening market conditions. People, assets and operations are all aligned to perform in 2017, and we look forward to keeping you updated.
With that, let me turn it over to Bruce."
30763,422963363,1160317,"Lennar Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 21, 2017",2017-03-21,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the first quarter driven by a 13% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a consistent average selling price of $365,000. WCI had a minimal impact to revenues in the first quarter",1912,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the first quarter driven by a 13% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a consistent average selling price of $365,000. WCI had a minimal impact to revenues in the first quarter as there were only 51 deliveries from the acquisition date until the end of the quarter.
Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 21.1%. And as Stuart mentioned, we're still on track with our previously stated gross margin goal of 22% to 22.5% for the full year. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land and construction costs. Our gross margin percentage was impacted 10 basis points due to the write-up of WCI backlog inventory that closed during the first quarter.
Sales incentives were 5.9% this quarter compared to 5.6% in the prior year, but it improved sequentially from our fourth quarter total of 6.2%. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our homebuilding East segment. Direct construction costs were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $55 per square foot, and that was driven by approximately a 6% increase in labor and 3% in material costs.
SG&A percentage as a percent of home sale revenue in the first quarter was 10.3%. We're continuing to improve SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and benefiting from the focus on technology investments that Stuart mentioned. Included in SG&A in the first quarter were onetime expenses related to the WCI acquisition, mainly offset by onetime legal and insurance benefits, resulting in a net onetime charge of approximately $2.7 million or 10 basis points impact to SG&A percent during the quarter.
Other income was $5.7 million compared to other expense of $600,000 in the same period last year. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $11.5 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they encourage G&A costs while ramping up for future land sales.
During the quarter, we opened 58 new communities and added 51 net communities from the WCI acquisition to end the quarter with 752 net active communities. New home orders increased 12% and new order dollar value increased 16% for the quarter. WCI had a minimal impact to this number as there were only 70 new home orders from this acquisition since we only had a couple of weeks in that first quarter post the acquisition.
Our sales pace was higher compared to the prior year at 3 sales per community per month versus 2.9, and that improved sequentially throughout the quarter. The cancellation rate was 16%.
In the first quarter, we purchased approximately 8,300 homesites, totaling $659 million. And just to note, the first quarter usually has the largest dollar amount of land purchases for the year. Including the homesites from the WCI acquisition, our homesites owned and controlled now total 173,000 homesites, of which 137,000 are owned and 36,000 are controlled. We now have approximately 4.6 years supply of land owned based on this year's projected deliveries. We expect the year supply of land to continue to define as we continue with our soft pivot land strategy.
Our completed unsold homes at the end of the quarter were in our normal range of 1 to 2 per community, totaling 1,342 homes.
Turning to Financial Services, this segment had strong results with operating earnings of $20.7 million compared to $14.9 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased slightly to $13.4 million from $13 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by higher volume. Mortgage originations increased to $1.8 billion versus $1.7 billion in the prior year. And the capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 81% compared to 82% in the prior year.
Our title company's profit increased to $6.8 million during the quarter from $2 million in the prior year. And this was driven by a 15% increase in revenue during the quarter and the associated overhead leverage from this higher volume.
Turning to the Rialto segment and providing some more details. The operating earnings were $12 million compared to $1.9 million in the prior year, both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $34.4 million of earnings, primarily due to $33.4 million of management fees and other, and this included $10 million of carried interest received in the quarter relating to Fund 1. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals approximately $125 million.
Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $478 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $33.2 million compared to $380 million and $3.9 million in the prior year, respectively. And these are both before their G&A expenses. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in volume and average net margin to the securitizations from 1.6% in the prior year to 7.1% in the first quarter.
Our direct investments had a loss of $15.9 million during the quarter, as we continue to work towards monetizing the remaining assets purchased from early portfolios. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $33.3 million for the quarter, and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was $6.4 million.
Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $163 million of cash.
Turning to the Multifamily segment. I'll just add a couple of comments to what Stuart mentioned. The $19.2 million of operating profit in the quarter was driven by the segment's $26 million share of gains from the sale of 2 operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 34%. The rate is higher than the prior year's rate of 28.1% because the prior year had onetime adjustments due to an IRS settlement and energy credits. We expect the tax rate to be 34% approximately for the remainder of 2017.
Turning to the balance sheet, which remained strong, we had a net debt to total capital of 41.6%, which was an improvement of 370 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with over $640 million of cash and only $250 million of borrowings on our $1.5 billion committed revolving credit facility.
Additionally, we grew stockholders equity by 24% year-over-year to $7.2 billion, and our book value per share grew to $30.70 per share.
The preliminary goodwill estimate from the WCI acquisition is $150 million to $175 million, and that's subject to revision as it is still being reviewed both internally and externally.
During the quarter, we issued $600 million of 4.125% senior notes due 2022, and we added $250 million of 6.875% senior notes due 2021 as part of the WCI acquisition, which we are likely to refinance at the next call date in August.
Finally, I would like to update our goals for 2017. Some of you already included WCI in your estimates for 2017 and all of the numbers that I'll be providing here include the full impact of the WCI acquisition, which will be accretive in 2017.
Starting with deliveries. We are increasing our delivery goal to between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 75% to 80% for the second quarter, 75% to 80%

Starting with deliveries. We are increasing our delivery goal to between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 75% to 80% for the second quarter, 75% to 80% for the third quarter and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We are still expecting an average sales price between $365,000 and $370,000 for the full year, and we are right on track with our operating margins of around 13% for the full year. There will be an impact to our second quarter gross margin from writing up WCI's backlog and purchase accounting. As a result, we expect our second quarter gross margin percentage to be between 21% and 21.5%, while the full year gross margin is still expected, as I mentioned, to be 22% to 22.5%.
We still expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to between 9.1% to 9.3% for the full year. The second quarter will have some nonrecurring transition costs relating to the WCI integration. Therefore, we expect SG&A to be approximately 9.5% in Q2. The operating leverage will be in the second half for the year to match up with our highest-volume quarters.
Financial Services, we are increasing the goal to approximately $160 million for the year with the second quarter expected to be approximately $40 million. The increase is due to the partial year inclusion of the Berkshire Hathaway Realty services brokerage operation from the WCI acquisition as well as additional closings from the WCI deal.
We are adding WCI to our mortgage platform, although keep in mind, 50% of the WCI buyers use all cash, and we will focus on capturing a high percentage of the other 50% that require a mortgage.
Rialto is still expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year with the second quarter expected to be approximately $5 million. Multifamily is still expected to be between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. The second quarter is expected to be also approximately $5 million, which includes 1 apartment community sale.
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income is still expected to be in a range of $70 million to $80 million of profit for the year. However, the second quarter is expected to have net expenses of $15 million to $20 million, while the second half of 2017 is driving all the profit for this category.
Corporate G&A is still expected to be 2.2% to 2.3%. And our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities.
And last, our balance sheet, we still continue to expect a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we accomplished in the prior year.
With these updated goals in mind, we are well positioned for the remainder of 2017.
And with that, let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

But what we are seeing and what we've heard a lot about is supply constraint across all kinds -- all dwelling product types, from rental to for-sale. And we've also seen that we're land constraint and production constraint, and that's been the case for some time. The injection of some market optimism and what we saw in our sales pace as we went through the quarter really gives me reason to believe that as we look out ahead a couple of quarters, we are going to start to see prices move just as we would expect with a demand and supply imbalance, with demand increasing and supply somewhat constrained. So that's kind of where we are on that. Our guidance was really rooted in where we've seen things on more current basis."

And Stuart, maybe since you're on the verge of meeting with a bunch of your trades, hopefully, you'll get some more insights here. But if you look at in California, there's been some pretty wet weather there. And I know there's some concern that we might see something similar to what happened in 2015 as an industry when, I think, Texas, in particular, felt some pretty significant headwinds from a wet spring. And as the year went on, I think a lot of builders struggled to get homes closed, and costs went up. And you guys obviously navigated that very well. But it certainly does create risk from the industry is concerned as far as costs going up. So a, I'm curious what you're hearing there as far as the just general availability of labor and the industry's ability to deal with some of those weather headwinds. And second question, just about California specifically, there's some news about a proposed bill-out there that would potentially raise construction costs quite a bit with the prevailing wage requirement and communities there. So was curious if you looked at that at all, what impact that might have, given your pretty significant land position in California and what -- how you would handicap the likelihood of that passing at this point."

Let's start with the California question, and let's remember that there are always legislative moves afoot to alter the landscape in California. The legislation that's proposed at this point is just another one of those that comes down the pipe on a pretty regular basis. And we'll just have to see where it works out. It's a build that is implemented as it's described would have an impact on costs relative to residential construction. Some communities out there, including some of our larger scale communities in FivePoint, might be exempt from the legislation. So it would be a mixed bag of impacts: some of them positive, some of them negative. I think, overall, negative for affordability in California. And so this is going to be talked through or worked out and see where we actually end up. But this is the landscape in California. And I think that all of these type of legislative initiatives come with positive and negative impacts, and we'll just have to see where this one shakes out. As it relates to construction costs overall, the story around construction costs has been one of increases over the past many quarters. You've heard us talk about that. I think that as we think about our numbers, construction costs as a percentage of our sales price has probably moved up around 100 basis points. And there's most certainly pressure on construction costs in a labor-constrained market. And this is why we focus on our Trade Partner Summit. Our relationship with our trade partners, making sure that we are the builder of choice for our trade partners. We think that this is a strategic advantage for the company. And we spend a lot of time developing relationships throughout our trade.
So let me just turn it over to Jon and ask him because Jon really spearhead this effort within the company and has done a remarkable job."

And we position ourselves to how we take advantage of the marketplace of what our landscapes in front of us.

It seems to be coming up in conversations with investors that could be offset. And I was curious if you might be able to opine on in general sense of order of magnitude how this one may come out in the wash, those are the 3 components being the reduction of interest deductibility, energy tax credits and perhaps, the manufacturer's deduction.

And as we went through the election season, as we went through some reconciliation in November, the market was a little bit slower than reported. And we saw that bleed into December. We went from kind of sluggish to better to strong in terms of sales. So as you see things from up, there's a little bit less incentive and a little bit more price. Construction costs have been moving up at the same pace. We feel pretty comfortable as we look at our numbers, as we look our backlog right now, that our margins come back up.

So I'm not really sure where you get your 7, but let's put that aside, and let's understand where my commentary comes from. Remember that when we're looking at our monthly year-over-year, we're looking at comparison to last year. So let's take seasonality out of the equation because we're looking at December to December, January to January, February to February. So the seasonality is injected at both sides. And what we were seeing in terms of the numbers is a slower and lower comparison in December, a comparable comparison in January and a substantially higher comparison in February. So that's the numerical side of the commentary. But the empirical side is what I look to dovetail with the numbers side, as I think about these things and I try to think about them in real time and balance what we're hearing at the front line in the field from our customers and measure that up against what we're seeing in the numbers. And so the commentary really derives from the kind of traffic patterns, the questions that people are talking about and the kinds of people that are showing up. What we are starting to see, I think, in my commentary, I noted that the millennials are doubled up at about a 60% rate living at home with parent, relatives or roommates. It's at 115-year high as reported in USA TODAY. I don't know if that's exactly the right number, but it is directionally interesting. And we're starting to see some of that cohort start to come out to our sale centers and talk about the fact that rental rates are high, rental rates have been moving, rental rates create some instability, and it's time to start thinking about buying a home, 30-year mortgage, fixing a monthly payment and looking at the possibilities and benefits of actual ownership, dovetailing that with the banks talking about coming back to market. These are the components that kind of makeup my sense that there's something afoot in the market that's broader than just 1 month in a row positive comparison. So that's kind of where it comes from, Mike."

I was interested in -- you mentioned that there's a low-cost basis there and attractive margins. At the same time, you're going to have the typical purchase accounting impact on 2Q. But once you work through that, from my understanding, purchase accounting typically does impact what's -- the overall lot position as well. And I was just curious to get a sense, maybe, Bruce, if you want to draw some pioneer or talk about what's been able to be worked through or worked out from an accounting perspective, how should we think about the gross margins from WCI because typically, from my understanding, those are written up as well.

This morning, I at West with Rick Beckwitt, our President, Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, and Eric Feder from our Rialto. We're going to begin our Trade Partner Summit later tonight that's why we're out here. And this is where we invite many of our manufacturers, suppliers and distributors to discuss the homebuilding landscape and to consider better ways to partner and to keep costs and profitability property -- properly aligned.

And we also have Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto. I want to apologize in advance if we're a little disjointed as we're going to attempt to coordinate from different locations.
As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview, and Bruce will deliver further detail and guidance. As always, after our prepared overview, we'll open to Q&A, and I'd like to request again that you limit your time to one question and one follow-up, so we can enable as many participants as possible within the hour that we've allotted.
So let me go ahead and begin and start by saying that market conditions certainly feel like they are strong and strengthening. The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we've seen for the entirety of this recovery seems to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal. While our first quarter operating results, particularly gross margins, reflects some of the sluggishness seen at the end of last year, our sales results went from tepid to better to strong as the quarter progressed. Limited supply and production deficits are now intersecting with land and labor shortage, and this suggests, though not yet seen but suggests, that pricing power is on the horizon as we move through the year.
So what are the factors that are driving the change in market sentiment and condition? They're certainly not apparent if you listen to the news stations. As our traffic has increased, we're getting some very direct feedback from our customers as they tell us what they are looking for, their timing and sometimes their motivation. There's clearly a sense of general optimism in the market. There's a perception that jobs are being created, and that wages are actually starting to move upward. There's a solidifying sense that the government has adopted a business-friendly posture, and that will result in real changes to tax rates and to the regulatory environment. The banking world is making more overtures to small businesses and to mortgage borrowers, and there's a sense that borrowers can make their way through the process.
Additionally, the upward direction of interest rates has encouraged some to get off the fence and consider purchasing a home rather than renting. Rents have risen, and the prospect of higher purchase prices and higher interest rates make the compelling case that today's opportunity might be the best opportunity to leave those annual increases and monthly payments behind. Although there are also a lot of negative noise at the same time, it seems so far that the market is looking through the noise and is injecting optimism about the future in its purchase consideration. Additionally, the economic reality is of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic realities of rental rates are beginning to have a rational impact on decision-making for the first-time buyers as millennials are coming to market.
Interestingly, the front page of USA TODAY reports today that 60% of millennials ages 18 to 35 are living with parents, relatives and roommates, and that is a 115-year high.
Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the improved -- improvement in the market. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, we're expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve and will exceed expectations, particularly in the back half of the year.
Although our first quarter earnings were lower compared to the first quarter of 2016, that is primarily due to a higher tax rate, some onetime WCI closing costs and a fully expected decline in gross margins. While some of the same pressures will exist in the second quarter as well, the acceleration in sales pace against the limited supply and constrained capacity for the market to quickly increase production portends pricing power and a very strong second half of the year.
Against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. Our for-sale core homebuilding operations are extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017. Our sales were up 11% year-over-year before WCI, 12% including WCI, driven by our strategy of driving better quality traffic through our digital marketing efforts. Interestingly, our Internet leads were up 18% year-over-year to about $100,000 for the quarter. Our social media followers were up 17% year-over-year to 2.8 million on an annual basis, and YouTube views were up by 10 million for the year.
Fueled by our digital marketing efforts and other initiatives as well, we continue to focus on operational efficiency as our SG&A as at -- is at a historic low for our first quarter. Again, interestingly, our marketing and advertising spend is now down year-over-year for 9 consecutive quarters.
We continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency, and we are improving. And while we match production with sales pace, we continue to maximize our gross to net margin at 21.1% and 10.8%, respectively, as we maintain higher sales price in order to maximize returns on our valuable land asset, and we manage costs by striving to be the builder of choice to the trade in each of our markets. Our trade partner, Summit, that I mentioned earlier, is a big part of that effort.
Though some might be concerned by our lower gross margin, we are exactly where we expected to be in the first part of this year, and our year-end margin will still be right on top of our guidance. Of course, we closed on the WCI acquisition in the first quarter, and that transaction is going very well, being guided by Rick Beckwitt and his team, led by Fred Rothman and Darin McMurray. And I advised Rick to speak specifically to this transaction. So let me turn it over briefly to Rick."

On February 10, 2017, Lennar closed on the acquisition of WCI Communities that was previously announced in September 2016. The purchase price for WCI totaled approximately $643 million, which we funded with cash, and we also assumed $250 m",983,"Thanks, Stuart. On February 10, 2017, Lennar closed on the acquisition of WCI Communities that was previously announced in September 2016. The purchase price for WCI totaled approximately $643 million, which we funded with cash, and we also assumed $250 million in senior notes. The transaction combined 2 of the largest homebuilders in Florida and significantly expands Lennar's product offerings to include luxury, single-family and multifamily homes.
WCI is focused on amenity rich, lifestyle master-planned communities, catering to the move-up, active adult and second-home buyers, truly complements Lennar's leading market position in the entry-level and move-up markets in Florida.
During our extensive due diligence period, we identified 5 main drivers of value creation and synergies. I will go through each of these drivers in a second, but I'm happy to say that the WCI integration has gone very smoothly, and that we're ahead of schedule, which will lead to a timely realization of this value creation for our shareholders.
The first driver was WCI's portfolio of low-cost land located in most of the highest growth and largest Florida coastal markets. We acquired over 13,500 homesites, adding 51 actively selling communities and an additional pipeline of future community openings for the next several years. This land portfolio will produce strong gross margins going forward.
The portfolio included many large amenity rich, A+ master-planned communities that would be impossible to purchase in today's land-constrained market. We have great confidence that we will produce extremely strong returns from these assets as they will be managed by some of the best-performing and most profitable positions in our company.
When we closed the acquisition, we acquired 361 homes in backlog with an average sales price of $516,000, totaling $188 million in near-term revenue and cash flow. In addition, at the end of the first quarter, we had 942 WCI homes in various stages of construction.
The second driver was the value maximization of the communities through the reallocation of the WCI and Lennar product and branding. During the due diligence period, we analyzed each community to determine whether we would make higher returns and profits by building WCI product or Lennar product. Approximately 1/3 of the communities that we acquired will be converted to the Lennar brand. In these communities, Lennar has product that is very similar to WCI. And by converting these communities to the Lennar brand, we will significantly lower our build cost with very little, if any, impact on the sales price of the home. We will also significantly increase sales pace and reduce cycle times. These changes will increase both profitability and IRR.
We've also identified several Lennar communities that we will be building WCI product. In these communities, we will be able to achieve much higher sales prices with the WCI brand. We are also planning to build both WCI and Lennar brands in some of our larger communities that benefit from a dual marketing strategy. This will allow us to increase absorptions and maximize the value of our underlying land positions. This is something we've done very successfully with our higher price village builders brand in Texas.
The third driver is utilizing our efficient homebuilding operating platform and leveraging our purchasing power. Included in this is streamlining WCI's approach to options. While we will still offer WCI homebuyers a selection of high-quality options and upgrades, we will be restructuring the design studio to include more streamlined selection of options and upgrades. This is similar to what we do in Texas and has allowed us to offer options and upgrades with a more cost-effective G&A structure. Given our leading national and Florida position, Lennar can purchase materials and labor at a much lower price than WCI. This will not only lower build cost but provide greater value to the WCI homebuyers. Cost savings will also flow from reduced cycle time.
We've been working with our trade partners to rebid the WCI floor plans and make them more efficient to build. We expect to have this completed by the end of our second quarter. However, you will not see the full benefits of lower cost per square foot until 2018 once all of the acquired inventory and homes under construction are delivered. Based on our due diligence and work to date, we expect to stay between $8 to $12 per square foot or 200 to 300 basis points on new starts once the rebidding process is completed. And finally, given the strides we made in late in digital marketing, we expect lower sales and marketing costs associated with these WCI communities as well.
The fourth driver was the synergies associated with lowering G&A costs. This include the elimination of costs associated with running 2 public companies as well as headcount reductions associated with overlapping core BRIC and operating functions. While there may be -- while there will be some upfront costs associated with implementing these changes, we anticipate annualized savings of approximately $30 million beginning in late 2017.
I'm sad to say that Keith Bass, the CEO of WCI, will not be moving forward with Lennar. While I'd hope that Keith would join us and be a big part of our growth going forward, he has chosen to take some time off and explore some other opportunities. We wish Keith great success going forward and thank him and the entire WCI team for building such an incredible company.
Finally, the last driver was capturing incremental profits through the rollout of our mortgage and title operations to WCI's homebuilding operation and its Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices operation. This process has begun, and we should see a meaningful pickup in activity in Financial Services as we move into 2018.
In conclusion, we're very excited about this acquisition. And while we're focused on these 5 value creation ideas, we are certain that we'll find other areas that will benefit our shareholders.
I'll turn it back over to Stuart."

As you can see, I think we've got our WCI transaction well in hand, and we're very enthusiastic about it. So to wrap up homebuilding, let's say, we've noted before that our strategy remains a clear pivot in land strategy towards a shorter term land acquisition and towards a 7% to 10% growth strategy. Given the WCI addition, our 2017 growth rate should be on the higher side of our goals or a little over that goal.
We've also refocused on expanding our first-time buyer offering with our mix now standing at right around 40%. Combined, these strategic elements will continue to produce very strong cash flow for the company and will result in continued balance sheet improvement.
Now let me turn briefly to our other segments. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is also off to a great start in 2017. Of course, the business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and will expand with the addition of the WCI acquisition, but it's also expanding its non-Lennar business reach and growing bottom line. Financial Services results exceeded last year's first quarter result by 38% driven in part by increased profitability and title operations. And Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in his portion.
Lennar Multifamily. We couldn't be more pleased with the evolution and performance of LMC. Our entry into the apartment development business was timed perfectly, and LMC continues to execute flawlessly. LMC, under the leadership of Todd Farrell, has reached maturity and is poised for continuous annual profitability. As noted in our press release, this segment generated $19.2 million in pretax income, up 57% from last year, as we sold another 2 communities under our merchant build program.
During the first quarter, we started some 1,373 apartments in 5 communities with a total development cost of approximately $600 million. As of February 28, 2017, we had a geographically diverse pipeline of 74 communities, totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes with a total development cost of almost $8 billion. We are gearing up our build-to-core program that we've discussed in the past with some 20 communities for 6,000 apartments already under construction to fill the $2.2 billion equity bucket with geographically diversified A-located, brand-new and modern apartment communities in a generally shelter-constrained environment.
Rialto also turned in an excellent quarter. Rialto contributed $12 million to the bottom line this quarter as market condition -- conditions favored this business segment as well. The various settlements of Rialto are starting to take shape as we continue to work through the remaining legacy assets on book. In this quarter, we have started to book some of the long-awaited promote from Fund 1, which reflects the work of the extraordinary team of professionals investing and managing third-party capital and generating industry-leading returns.
Additionally, market conditions particularly favored Rialto Mortgage Finance as that exceptionally run team, which is focused on the commercial mortgage conduit business, exceeded expectations and closed 3 transactions totaling $478 million. The intersection of an outstanding operating team and strong market conditions produced an industry-leading net margin for the company.
Finally, FivePoint remains poised as a self-sufficient, stand-alone, large-scale community builder in California. This company manages and controls some of the best-positioned properties in some of the most land-constrained markets in the country. The current market optimism raises the possibility that this company that's been waiting for market conditions to reopen the IPO market might just find a window to go public. We'll see if the current sweep of optimism in the capital and stock market sets the stage for FivePoint's future.
So in conclusion, across the platform of our company, we're feeling pretty optimistic about this year ahead. We're clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on the strong market conditions that seem apparent. Each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform in strengthening market conditions. People, assets and operations are all aligned to perform in 2017, and we look forward to keeping you updated.
With that, let me turn it over to Bruce."

Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the first quarter driven by a 13% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a consistent average selling price of $365,000. WCI had a minimal impact to revenues in the first quarter",1912,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the first quarter driven by a 13% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a consistent average selling price of $365,000. WCI had a minimal impact to revenues in the first quarter as there were only 51 deliveries from the acquisition date until the end of the quarter.
Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 21.1%. And as Stuart mentioned, we're still on track with our previously stated gross margin goal of 22% to 22.5% for the full year. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land and construction costs. Our gross margin percentage was impacted 10 basis points due to the write-up of WCI backlog inventory that closed during the first quarter.
Sales incentives were 5.9% this quarter compared to 5.6% in the prior year, but it improved sequentially from our fourth quarter total of 6.2%. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our homebuilding East segment. Direct construction costs were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $55 per square foot, and that was driven by approximately a 6% increase in labor and 3% in material costs.
SG&A percentage as a percent of home sale revenue in the first quarter was 10.3%. We're continuing to improve SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and benefiting from the focus on technology investments that Stuart mentioned. Included in SG&A in the first quarter were onetime expenses related to the WCI acquisition, mainly offset by onetime legal and insurance benefits, resulting in a net onetime charge of approximately $2.7 million or 10 basis points impact to SG&A percent during the quarter.
Other income was $5.7 million compared to other expense of $600,000 in the same period last year. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $11.5 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they encourage G&A costs while ramping up for future land sales.
During the quarter, we opened 58 new communities and added 51 net communities from the WCI acquisition to end the quarter with 752 net active communities. New home orders increased 12% and new order dollar value increased 16% for the quarter. WCI had a minimal impact to this number as there were only 70 new home orders from this acquisition since we only had a couple of weeks in that first quarter post the acquisition.
Our sales pace was higher compared to the prior year at 3 sales per community per month versus 2.9, and that improved sequentially throughout the quarter. The cancellation rate was 16%.
In the first quarter, we purchased approximately 8,300 homesites, totaling $659 million. And just to note, the first quarter usually has the largest dollar amount of land purchases for the year. Including the homesites from the WCI acquisition, our homesites owned and controlled now total 173,000 homesites, of which 137,000 are owned and 36,000 are controlled. We now have approximately 4.6 years supply of land owned based on this year's projected deliveries. We expect the year supply of land to continue to define as we continue with our soft pivot land strategy.
Our completed unsold homes at the end of the quarter were in our normal range of 1 to 2 per community, totaling 1,342 homes.
Turning to Financial Services, this segment had strong results with operating earnings of $20.7 million compared to $14.9 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased slightly to $13.4 million from $13 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by higher volume. Mortgage originations increased to $1.8 billion versus $1.7 billion in the prior year. And the capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 81% compared to 82% in the prior year.
Our title company's profit increased to $6.8 million during the quarter from $2 million in the prior year. And this was driven by a 15% increase in revenue during the quarter and the associated overhead leverage from this higher volume.
Turning to the Rialto segment and providing some more details. The operating earnings were $12 million compared to $1.9 million in the prior year, both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $34.4 million of earnings, primarily due to $33.4 million of management fees and other, and this included $10 million of carried interest received in the quarter relating to Fund 1. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals approximately $125 million.
Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $478 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $33.2 million compared to $380 million and $3.9 million in the prior year, respectively. And these are both before their G&A expenses. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in volume and average net margin to the securitizations from 1.6% in the prior year to 7.1% in the first quarter.
Our direct investments had a loss of $15.9 million during the quarter, as we continue to work towards monetizing the remaining assets purchased from early portfolios. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $33.3 million for the quarter, and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was $6.4 million.
Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $163 million of cash.
Turning to the Multifamily segment. I'll just add a couple of comments to what Stuart mentioned. The $19.2 million of operating profit in the quarter was driven by the segment's $26 million share of gains from the sale of 2 operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 34%. The rate is higher than the prior year's rate of 28.1% because the prior year had onetime adjustments due to an IRS settlement and energy credits. We expect the tax rate to be 34% approximately for the remainder of 2017.
Turning to the balance sheet, which remained strong, we had a net debt to total capital of 41.6%, which was an improvement of 370 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with over $640 million of cash and only $250 million of borrowings on our $1.5 billion committed revolving credit facility.
Additionally, we grew stockholders equity by 24% year-over-year to $7.2 billion, and our book value per share grew to $30.70 per share.
The preliminary goodwill estimate from the WCI acquisition is $150 million to $175 million, and that's subject to revision as it is still being reviewed both internally and externally.
During the quarter, we issued $600 million of 4.125% senior notes due 2022, and we added $250 million of 6.875% senior notes due 2021 as part of the WCI acquisition, which we are likely to refinance at the next call date in August.
Finally, I would like to update our goals for 2017. Some of you already included WCI in your estimates for 2017 and all of the numbers that I'll be providing here include the full impact of the WCI acquisition, which will be accretive in 2017.
Starting with deliveries. We are increasing our delivery goal to between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 75% to 80% for the second quarter, 75% to 80%

Starting with deliveries. We are increasing our delivery goal to between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 75% to 80% for the second quarter, 75% to 80% for the third quarter and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We are still expecting an average sales price between $365,000 and $370,000 for the full year, and we are right on track with our operating margins of around 13% for the full year. There will be an impact to our second quarter gross margin from writing up WCI's backlog and purchase accounting. As a result, we expect our second quarter gross margin percentage to be between 21% and 21.5%, while the full year gross margin is still expected, as I mentioned, to be 22% to 22.5%.
We still expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to between 9.1% to 9.3% for the full year. The second quarter will have some nonrecurring transition costs relating to the WCI integration. Therefore, we expect SG&A to be approximately 9.5% in Q2. The operating leverage will be in the second half for the year to match up with our highest-volume quarters.
Financial Services, we are increasing the goal to approximately $160 million for the year with the second quarter expected to be approximately $40 million. The increase is due to the partial year inclusion of the Berkshire Hathaway Realty services brokerage operation from the WCI acquisition as well as additional closings from the WCI deal.
We are adding WCI to our mortgage platform, although keep in mind, 50% of the WCI buyers use all cash, and we will focus on capturing a high percentage of the other 50% that require a mortgage.
Rialto is still expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year with the second quarter expected to be approximately $5 million. Multifamily is still expected to be between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. The second quarter is expected to be also approximately $5 million, which includes 1 apartment community sale.
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income is still expected to be in a range of $70 million to $80 million of profit for the year. However, the second quarter is expected to have net expenses of $15 million to $20 million, while the second half of 2017 is driving all the profit for this category.
Corporate G&A is still expected to be 2.2% to 2.3%. And our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities.
And last, our balance sheet, we still continue to expect a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we accomplished in the prior year.
With these updated goals in mind, we are well positioned for the remainder of 2017.
And with that, let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

But what we are seeing and what we've heard a lot about is supply constraint across all kinds -- all dwelling product types, from rental to for-sale. And we've also seen that we're land constraint and production constraint, and that's been the case for some time. The injection of some market optimism and what we saw in our sales pace as we went through the quarter really gives me reason to believe that as we look out ahead a couple of quarters, we are going to start to see prices move just as we would expect with a demand and supply imbalance, with demand increasing and supply somewhat constrained. So that's kind of where we are on that. Our guidance was really rooted in where we've seen things on more current basis."

And Stuart, maybe since you're on the verge of meeting with a bunch of your trades, hopefully, you'll get some more insights here. But if you look at in California, there's been some pretty wet weather there. And I know there's some concern that we might see something similar to what happened in 2015 as an industry when, I think, Texas, in particular, felt some pretty significant headwinds from a wet spring. And as the year went on, I think a lot of builders struggled to get homes closed, and costs went up. And you guys obviously navigated that very well. But it certainly does create risk from the industry is concerned as far as costs going up. So a, I'm curious what you're hearing there as far as the just general availability of labor and the industry's ability to deal with some of those weather headwinds. And second question, just about California specifically, there's some news about a proposed bill-out there that would potentially raise construction costs quite a bit with the prevailing wage requirement and communities there.

Let's start with the California question, and let's remember that there are always legislative moves afoot to alter the landscape in California. The legislation that's proposed at this point is just another one of those that comes down the pipe on a pretty regular basis. And we'll just have to see where it works out. It's a build that is implemented as it's described would have an impact on costs relative to residential construction. Some communities out there, including some of our larger scale communities in FivePoint, might be exempt from the legislation. So it would be a mixed bag of impacts: some of them positive, some of them negative. I think, overall, negative for affordability in California. And so this is going to be talked through or worked out and see where we actually end up. But this is the landscape in California. And I think that all of these type of legislative initiatives come with positive and negative impacts, and we'll just have to see where this one shakes out. As it relates to construction costs overall, the story around construction costs has been one of increases over the past many quarters. You've heard us talk about that. I think that as we think about our numbers, construction costs as a percentage of our sales price has probably moved up around 100 basis points. And there's most certainly pressure on construction costs in a labor-constrained market. And this is why we focus on our Trade Partner Summit. Our relationship with our trade partners, making sure that we are the builder of choice for our trade partners. We think that this is a strategic advantage for the company. And we spend a lot of time developing relationships throughout our trade.

I think as we approach to the back half of the year, you'll start to see an acceleration of community count. Clearly, into 2018, we'll be on a pretty good runway at that point."

It is the one number that is like 3 levels, the 3-dimensional chest, trying to figure out a lot of moving parts as you go through the year. There are some prediction, anticipation, some guesswork. And it's because as demand moves around a little bit, as weather impacts, as third-party participants, as we have moderated down our ownership of land, we're more dependent on third party, all of these pieces play a part in making a hard number to get your head around. And so we do conservatize it a little bit as well."

And I know the tax policy is certainly a very nebulous issue right now. However, it doesn't stop people from doing some -- running some hypotheticals, and I imagine your company is no different. So obviously, if the corporate tax rate were to drop, that will be fairly straightforward. However, in the case of builders, there's at least 3 things. It seems to be coming up in conversations with investors that could be offset. And I was curious if you might be able to opine on in general sense of order of magnitude how this one may come out in the wash, those are the 3 components being the reduction of interest deductibility, energy tax credits and perhaps, the manufacturer's deduction. Maybe I'm missing something else. But could you give us a sense for what the relative order of magnitude is in terms of the size of the significance of these 3 pieces to your tax rate?"

The other thing that I walked away with is a sense that he and this administration are listening carefully, knowing that there will be winners and losers, there will be ups and downs in any configuration of the tax revamp. And so there is virtually no ability to draw certainty today from what pieces and in what proportion they're going to be woven into a new tax program.
So with that, Bruce, why don't you take a swipe at giving some relative proportion to the various pieces?"

So in those markets, I'd say it affects both the starter price points and the move-up price points. In Texas, which is marked as more flattish from a sales pace standpoint.

So I'm not really sure where you get your 7, but let's put that aside, and let's understand where my commentary comes from. Remember that when we're looking at our monthly year-over-year, we're looking at comparison to last year. So let's take seasonality out of the equation because we're looking at December to December, January to January, February to February. So the seasonality is injected at both sides. And what we were seeing in terms of the numbers is a slower and lower comparison in December, a comparable comparison in January and a substantially higher comparison in February. So that's the numerical side of the commentary. But the empirical side is what I look to dovetail with the numbers side, as I think about these things and I try to think about them in real time and balance what we're hearing at the front line in the field from our customers and measure that up against what we're seeing in the numbers. And so the commentary really derives from the kind of traffic patterns, the questions that people are talking about and the kinds of people that are showing up. What we are starting to see, I think, in my commentary, I noted that the millennials are doubled up at about a 60% rate living at home with parent, relatives or roommates. It's at 115-year high as reported in USA TODAY. I don't know if that's exactly the right number, but it is directionally interesting. And we're starting to see some of that cohort start to come out to our sale centers and talk about the fact that rental rates are high, rental rates have been moving, rental rates create some instability, and it's time to start thinking about buying a home, 30-year mortgage, fixing a monthly payment and looking at the possibilities and benefits of actual ownership, dovetailing that with the banks talking about coming back to market. These are the components that kind of makeup my sense that there's something afoot in the market that's broader than just 1 month in a row positive comparison. So that's kind of where it comes from, Mike."

And I was just curious to get a sense, maybe, Bruce, if you want to draw some pioneer or talk about what's been able to be worked through or worked out from an accounting perspective, how should we think about the gross margins from WCI because typically, from my understanding, those are written up as well.

This morning, I out West with Rick Beckwitt, our President, Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, and Eric Feder from our Rialto Group. We're going to begin our Trade Partner Summit later tonight, that's why we're out here. And this is where we invite many of our manufacturers, suppliers and distributors to discuss the homebuilding landscape and to consider better ways to partner and to keep costs and profitability property -- properly aligned.
On the call from Miami, we have Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and of course, David Collins, our Controller, who delivered our forward-looking statement. And we also have Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto. I want to apologize in advance if we're a little disjointed as we're going to attempt to coordinate from different locations.
As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview, and Bruce will deliver further detail and guidance. As always, after our prepared overview, we'll open to Q&A, and I'd like to request again that you limit your time to one question, one follow-up, so we can enable as many participants as possible within the hour that we've allotted.
So let me go ahead and begin and start by saying that market conditions certainly feel like they are strong and strengthening. The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we've seen for the entirety of this recovery seems to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal. While our first quarter operating results, particularly gross margins, reflects some of the sluggishness seen at the end of last year, our sales results went from tepid to better to strong as the quarter progressed. Limited supply and production deficits are now intersecting with land and labor shortage, and this suggests, though not yet seen but suggests, that pricing power is on the horizon as we move through the year.
So what are the factors that are driving the change in market sentiment and condition? They're certainly not apparent if you listen to the news stations. As our traffic has increased, we're getting some very direct feedback from our customers as they tell us what they are looking for, their timing and sometimes their motivation. There's clearly a sense of general optimism in the market. There's a perception that jobs are being created, and that wages are actually starting to move upward. There's a solidifying sense that the government has adopted a business-friendly posture, and that will result in real changes to tax rates and to the regulatory environment. The banking world is making more overtures to small businesses and to mortgage borrowers, and there's a sense that borrowers can make their way through the process.
Additionally, the upward direction of interest rates has encouraged some to get off the fence and consider purchasing a home rather than renting. Rents have risen, and the prospect of higher purchase prices and higher interest rates makes a compelling case that today's opportunity might be the best opportunity to leave those annual increases and monthly payments behind. Although there are also a lot of negative noise at the same time, it seems so far that the market is looking through the noise and is injecting optimism about the future in its purchase consideration. Additionally, the economic reality is of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic realities of rental rates are beginning to have a rational impact on decision-making for the first-time buyer as millennials are coming to market.
Interestingly, the front page of USA TODAY reports today that 60% of millennials ages 18 to 35 are living with parents, relatives and roommates, and that is a 115-year high.
Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the improved -- improvement in the market. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, we're expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve and will exceed expectations, particularly in the back half of the year.
Although our first quarter earnings were lower compared to the first quarter of 2016, that is primarily due to a higher tax rate, some onetime WCI closing costs and a fully expected decline in gross margins. While some of the same pressures will exist in the second quarter as well, the acceleration in sales pace against the limited supply and constrained capacity for the market to quickly increase production portends pricing power and a very strong second half of the year.
Against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. Our for-sale core homebuilding operations are extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017. Our sales were up 11% year-over-year before WCI, 12% including WCI, driven by our strategy of driving better quality traffic through our digital marketing efforts. Interestingly, our Internet leads were up 18% year-over-year to about $100,000 for the quarter. Our social media followers were up 17% year-over-year to 2.8 million on an annual basis, and YouTube views were up by 10 million for the year.
Fueled by our digital marketing efforts and other initiatives as well, we continue to focus on operational efficiency as our SG&A as at -- is at an historic low for our first quarter. Again, interestingly, our marketing and advertising spend is now down year-over-year for 9 consecutive quarters.
We continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency, and we are improving. And while we match production with sales pace, we continue to maximize our gross to net margin at 21.1% and 10.8%, respectively, as we maintain higher sales price in order to maximize returns on our valuable land asset, and we manage costs by striving to be the builder of choice to the trades in each of our markets. Our Trade Partner Summit, that I mentioned earlier, is a big part of that effort.
Though some might be concerned by our lower gross margin, we are exactly where we expected to be in the first part of this year, and our year-end margin will still be right on top of our guidance. Of course, we closed on the WCI acquisition in the first quarter, and that transaction is going very well, is being guided by Rick Beckwitt and his team, led by Fred Rothman and Darin McMurray. And I've asked Rick to speak specifically to this transaction. So let me turn it over briefly to Rick."
30763,422963363,1160436,"Lennar Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 21, 2017",2017-03-21,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart. On February 10, 2017, Lennar closed on the acquisition of WCI Communities that was previously announced in September 2016. The purchase price for WCI totaled approximately $643 million, which we funded with cash, and we also assumed $250 m",983,"Thanks, Stuart. On February 10, 2017, Lennar closed on the acquisition of WCI Communities that was previously announced in September 2016. The purchase price for WCI totaled approximately $643 million, which we funded with cash, and we also assumed $250 million in senior notes. The transaction combined 2 of the largest homebuilders in Florida and significantly expands Lennar's product offerings to include luxury, single-family and multifamily homes.
WCI is focused on amenity rich, lifestyle master-planned communities, catering to the move-up, active adult and second-home buyers, truly complements Lennar's leading market position in the entry-level and move-up markets in Florida.
During our extensive due diligence period, we identified 5 main drivers of value creation and synergies. I will go through each of these drivers in a second, but I'm happy to say that the WCI integration has gone very smoothly, and that we're ahead of schedule, which will lead to a timely realization of this value creation for our shareholders.
The first driver was WCI's portfolio of low-cost land located in most of the highest growth and largest Florida coastal markets. We acquired over 13,500 homesites, adding 51 actively selling communities and an additional pipeline of future community openings for the next several years. This land portfolio will produce strong gross margins going forward.
The portfolio included many large amenity rich, A+ master-planned communities that would be impossible to purchase in today's land-constrained market. We have great confidence that we will produce extremely strong returns from these assets as they will be managed by some of the best-performing and most profitable divisions in our company.
When we closed the acquisition, we acquired 361 homes in backlog with an average sales price of $516,000, totaling $188 million in near-term revenue and cash flow. In addition, at the end of the first quarter, we had 942 WCI homes in various stages of construction.
The second driver was the value maximization of the communities through the reallocation of the WCI and Lennar product and branding. During the due diligence period, we analyzed each community to determine whether we would make higher returns and profits by building WCI product or Lennar product. Approximately 1/3 of the communities that we acquired will be converted to the Lennar brand. In these communities, Lennar has product that is very similar to WCI. And by converting these communities to the Lennar brand, we will significantly lower our build cost with very little, if any, impact on the sales price of the home. We will also significantly increase sales pace and reduce cycle times. These changes will increase both profitability and IRR.
We've also identified several Lennar communities that we will be building WCI product. In these communities, we will be able to achieve much higher sales prices with the WCI brand. We are also planning to build both WCI and Lennar brands in some of our larger communities that benefit from a dual marketing strategy. This will allow us to increase absorptions and maximize the value of our underlying land positions. This is something we've done very successfully with our higher price village builders brand in Texas.
The third driver is utilizing our efficient homebuilding operating platform and leveraging our purchasing power. Included in this is streamlining WCI's approach to options. While we will still offer WCI homebuyers a selection of high-quality options and upgrades, we will be restructuring the design studio to include a more streamlined selection of options and upgrades. This is similar to what we do in Texas and has allowed us to offer options and upgrades with a more cost-effective G&A structure. Given our leading national and Florida position, Lennar can purchase materials and labor at a much lower price than WCI. This will not only lower build costs but provide greater value to the WCI homebuyers. Cost savings will also flow from reduced cycle time.
We've been working with our trade partners to rebid the WCI floor plans and make them more efficient to build. We expect to have this completed by the end of our second quarter. However, you will not see the full benefits of lower cost per square foot until 2018 once all of the acquired inventory and homes under construction are delivered. Based on our due diligence and work to date, we expect to save between $8 to $12 per square foot or 200 to 300 basis points on new starts once the rebidding process is completed. And finally, given the strides we made in -- in digital marketing, we expect lower sales and marketing costs associated with these WCI communities as well.
The fourth driver was the synergies associated with lowering G&A costs. This include the elimination of costs associated with running 2 public companies as well as headcount reductions associated with overlapping corporate and operating functions. While there may be -- while there will be some upfront costs associated with implementing these changes, we anticipate annualized savings of approximately $30 million beginning in late 2017.
I'm sad to say that Keith Bass, the CEO of WCI, will not be moving forward with Lennar. While I'd hoped that Keith would join us and be a big part of our growth going forward, he has chosen to take some time off and explore some other opportunities. We wish Keith great success going forward and thank him and the entire WCI team for building such an incredible company.
Finally, the last driver was capturing incremental profits through the rollout of our mortgage and title operations to WCI's homebuilding operation and its Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices operation. This process has begun, and we should see a meaningful pickup in activity in Financial Services as we move into 2018.
In conclusion, we're very excited about this acquisition. And while we're focused on these 5 value creation ideas, we are certain that we'll find other areas that will benefit our shareholders.
I'll turn it back over to Stuart."

As you can see, I think we've got our WCI transaction well in hand, and we're very enthusiastic about it. So to wrap up homebuilding, let me say, we've noted before that our strategy remains a clear pivot in land strategy towards a shorter term land acquisition and towards a 7% to 10% growth strategy. Given the WCI addition, our 2017 growth rate should be on the higher side of our goals or a little over that goal.
We've also refocused on expanding our first-time buyer offering with our mix now standing at right around 40%. Combined, these strategic elements will continue to produce very strong cash flow for the company and will result in continued balance sheet improvement.
Now let me turn briefly to our other segments. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is also off to a great start in 2017. Of course, the business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and will expand with the addition of the WCI acquisition, but it's also expanding its non-Lennar business reach and growing bottom line. Financial Services results exceeded last year's first quarter result by 38% driven in part by increased profitability and title operations. And Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in his portion.
Lennar Multifamily. We couldn't be more pleased with the evolution and performance of LMC. Our entry into the apartment development business was timed perfectly, and LMC continues to execute flawlessly. LMC, under the leadership of Todd Farrell, has reached maturity and is poised for continuous annual profitability. As noted in our press release, this segment generated $19.2 million in pretax income, up 57% from last year, as we sold another 2 communities under our merchant build program.
During the first quarter, we started some 1,373 apartments in 5 communities with a total development cost of approximately $600 million. As of February 28, 2017, we had a geographically diverse pipeline of 74 communities, totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes with a total development cost of almost $8 billion. We are gearing up our build-to-core program that we've discussed in the past with some 20 communities for 6,000 apartments already under construction to fill the $2.2 billion equity bucket with geographically diversified A-located, brand-new and modern apartment communities in a generally shelter-constrained environment.
Rialto also turned in an excellent quarter. Rialto contributed $12 million to the bottom line this quarter as market condition -- conditions favored this business segment as well. The various settlements of Rialto are starting to take shape as we continue to work through the remaining legacy assets on book. In this quarter, we have started to book some of the long-awaited promote from Fund 1, which reflects the work of the extraordinary team of professionals investing and managing third-party capital and generating industry-leading returns.
Additionally, market conditions particularly favored Rialto Mortgage Finance as that exceptionally run team, which is focused on the commercial mortgage conduit business, exceeded expectations and closed 3 transactions totaling $478 million. The intersection of an outstanding operating team and strong market conditions produced an industry-leading net margin for the company.
Finally, FivePoint remains poised as a self-sufficient, stand-alone, large-scale community builder in California. This company manages and controls some of the best-positioned properties in some of the most land-constrained markets in the country. The current market optimism raises the possibility that this company that's been waiting for market conditions to reopen the IPO market might just find a window to go public. We'll see if the current sweep of optimism in the capital and stock market sets the stage for FivePoint's future.
So in conclusion, across the platform of our company, we're feeling pretty optimistic about this year ahead. We're clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on the strong market conditions that seem apparent. Each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform in strengthening market conditions. People, assets and operations are all aligned to perform in 2017, and we look forward to keeping you updated.
With that, let me turn it over to Bruce."

Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the first quarter driven by a 13% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a consistent average selling price of $365,000. WCI had a minimal impact to revenues in the first quarter",1920,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the first quarter driven by a 13% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a consistent average selling price of $365,000. WCI had a minimal impact to revenues in the first quarter as there were only 51 deliveries from the acquisition date until the end of the quarter.
Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 21.1%. And as Stuart mentioned, we're still on track with our previously stated gross margin goal of 22% to 22.5% for the full year. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land and construction costs. Our gross margin percentage was impacted 10 basis points due to the write-up of WCI backlog inventory that closed during the first quarter.
Sales incentives were 5.9% this quarter compared to 5.6% in the prior year, but it improved sequentially from our fourth quarter total of 6.2%. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our homebuilding East segment. Direct construction costs were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $55 per square foot, and that was driven by approximately a 6% increase in labor and 3% in material costs.
SG&A percentage as a percent of home sale revenue in the first quarter was 10.3%. We're continuing to improve SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and benefiting from the focus on technology investments that Stuart mentioned. Included in SG&A in the first quarter were onetime expenses related to the WCI acquisition, mainly offset by onetime legal and insurance benefits, resulting in a net onetime charge of approximately $2.7 million or 10 basis points impact to SG&A percent during the quarter.
Other income was $5.7 million compared to other expense of $600,000 in the same period last year. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $11.5 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they encourage G&A costs while ramping up for future land sales.
During the quarter, we opened 58 new communities and added 51 net communities from the WCI acquisition to end the quarter with 752 net active communities. New home orders increased 12% and new order dollar value increased 16% for the quarter. WCI had a minimal impact to this number as there were only 70 new home orders from this acquisition since we only had a couple of weeks in that first quarter post acquisition.
Our sales pace was higher compared to the prior year at 3 sales per community per month versus 2.9, and that improved sequentially throughout the quarter. The cancellation rate was 16%.
In the first quarter, we purchased approximately 8,300 homesites, totaling $659 million. And just to note, the first quarter usually has the largest dollar amount of land purchases for the year. Including the homesites from the WCI acquisition, our homesites owned and controlled now total 173,000 homesites, of which 137,000 are owned and 36,000 are controlled. We now have approximately 4.6 years supply of land owned based on this year's projected deliveries. We expect the year supply of land to continue to decline as we continue with our soft pivot land strategy.
Our completed unsold homes at the end of the quarter were in our normal range of 1 to 2 per community, totaling 1,342 homes.
Turning to Financial Services, this segment had strong results with operating earnings of $20.7 million compared to $14.9 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased slightly to $13.4 million from $13 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by higher volume. Mortgage originations increased to $1.8 billion versus $1.7 billion in the prior year. And the capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 81% compared to 82% in the prior year.
Our title company's profit increased to $6.8 million during the quarter from $2 million in the prior year. And this was driven by a 15% increase in revenue during the quarter and the associated overhead leverage from this higher volume.
Turning to the Rialto segment and providing some more details. The operating earnings were $12 million compared to $1.9 million in the prior year, both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $34.4 million of earnings, primarily due to $33.4 million of management fees and other, and this included $10 million of carried interest received in the quarter relating to Fund 1. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals approximately $125 million.
Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $478 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $33.2 million compared to $380 million and $3.9 million in the prior year, respectively. And these are both before their G&A expenses. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in volume and average net margin to the securitizations from 1.6% in the prior year to 7.1% in the first quarter.
Our direct investments had a loss of $15.9 million during the quarter, as we continue to work towards monetizing the remaining assets purchased from early portfolios. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $33.3 million for the quarter, and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was $6.4 million.
Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $163 million of cash.
Turning to the Multifamily segment. I'll just add a couple of comments to what Stuart mentioned. The $19.2 million of operating profit in the quarter was driven by the segment's $26 million share of gains from the sale of 2 operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 34%. The rate is higher than the prior year's rate of 28.1% because the prior year had onetime adjustments due to an IRS settlement and energy credits. We expect the tax rate to be 34% approximately for the remainder of 2017.
Turning to the balance sheet, which remained strong, we had a net debt to total capital of 41.6%, which was an improvement of 370 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with over $640 million of cash and only $250 million of borrowings on our $1.5 billion committed revolving credit facility.
Additionally, we grew stockholders equity by 24% year-over-year to $7.2 billion, and our book value per share grew to $30.70 per share.
The preliminary goodwill estimate from the WCI acquisition is $150 million to $175 million, and that's subject to revision as it is still being reviewed both internally and externally.
During the quarter, we issued $600 million of 4.125% senior notes due 2022, and we added $250 million of 6.875% senior notes due 2021 as part of the WCI acquisition, which we are likely to refinance at the next call date in August.
Finally, I would like to update our goals for 2017. Some of you already included WCI in your estimates for 2017 and all of the numbers that I'll be providing here include the full impact of the WCI acquisition, which will be accretive in 2017.
Starting with deliveries. We are increasing our delivery goal to between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 75% to 80% for the second quarter, 75% to 80% for the

Starting with deliveries. We are increasing our delivery goal to between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 75% to 80% for the second quarter, 75% to 80% for the third quarter and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We are still expecting an average sales price between $365,000 and $370,000 for the full year, and we are right on track with our operating margins of around 13% for the full year. There will be an impact to our second quarter gross margin from writing up WCI's backlog and purchase accounting. As a result, we expect our second quarter gross margin percentage to be between 21% and 21.5%, while the full year gross margin is still expected, as I mentioned, to be 22% to 22.5%.
We still expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to between 9.1% to 9.3% for the full year. The second quarter will have some nonrecurring transition costs relating to the WCI integration. Therefore, we expect SG&A to be approximately 9.5% in Q2. The operating leverage will be in the second half of the year to match up with our highest-volume quarters.
Financial Services, we are increasing the goal to approximately $160 million for the year with the second quarter expected to be approximately $40 million. The increase is due to the partial year inclusion of the Berkshire Hathaway Realty services brokerage operation from the WCI acquisition as well as additional closings from the WCI deal.
We are adding WCI to our mortgage platform, although keep in mind, 50% of the WCI buyers use all cash, and we will focus on capturing a high percentage of the other 50% that require a mortgage.
Rialto is still expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year with the second quarter expected to be approximately $5 million. Multifamily is still expected to be between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. The second quarter is expected to be also approximately $5 million, which includes 1 apartment community sale.
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income is still expected to be in a range of $70 million to $80 million of profit for the year. However, the second quarter is expected to have net expenses of $15 million to $20 million, while the second half of 2017 is driving all the profit for this category.
Corporate G&A is still expected to be 2.2% to 2.3%. And our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities.
And last, our balance sheet, we still continue to expect a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we accomplished in the prior year.
With these updated goals in mind, we are well positioned for the remainder of 2017.
And with that, let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

The discussion, the statements that I made on the conference -- on the -- my prepared comments and then our quote really are kind of forward-looking giving -- given the temperament of the market right now and kind of what we see around the corner or what we feel like we're seeing around the corner. I don't want to get too far out over our skis. We're not injecting that optimism in our guidance right now. But what we are seeing and what we've heard a lot about is supply constraint across all kinds of -- all dwelling product types, from rental to for-sale. And we've also seen that we're land constrained and production constrained, and that's been the case for some time. The injection of some market optimism and what we saw in our sales pace as we went through the quarter really gives me reason to believe that as we look out ahead a couple of quarters, we are going to start to see prices move just as we would expect with a demand and supply imbalance, with demand increasing and supply somewhat constrained. So that's kind of where we are on that. Our guidance was really rooted in where we've seen things on a more current basis."

And Stuart, maybe since you're on the verge of meeting with a bunch of your trades, hopefully, you'll get some more insights here. But if you look out in California, there's been some pretty wet weather there. And I know there's some concern that we might see something similar to what happened in 2015 as an industry when, I think, Texas, in particular, felt some pretty significant headwinds from a wet spring. And as the year went on, I think a lot of builders struggled to get homes closed, and costs went up. And you guys obviously navigated that very well. But it certainly does create risk from the industry is concerned as far as costs going up. So a, I'm curious what you're hearing there as far as the just general availability of labor and the industry's ability to deal with some of those weather headwinds. And second question, just on California specifically, there's some news about a proposed bill out there that would potentially raise construction costs quite a bit with the prevailing wage requirement and communities there. So was curious if you looked at that at all, what impact that might have, given your pretty significant land position in California and what -- how you would handicap the likelihood of that passing at this point."

Let's start with the California question, and let's remember that there are always legislative moves afoot to alter the landscape in California. The legislation that's proposed at this point is just another one of those that comes down the pipe on a pretty regular basis. And we'll just have to see where it works out. It's a bill that is implemented as it's described would have an impact on costs relative to residential construction. Some communities out there, including some of our larger scale communities in FivePoint, might be exempt from the legislation. So it would be a mixed bag of impacts: some of them positive, some of them negative. I think, overall, negative for affordability in California. And so this is going to be talked through, worked out and see where we actually end up. But this is the landscape in California. And I think that all of these type of legislative initiatives come with positive and negative impact, and we'll just have to see where this one shakes out. As it relates to construction costs overall, the story around construction costs has been one of increases over the past many quarters. You've heard us talk about that. I think that as we think about our numbers, construction costs as a percentage of our sales price has probably moved up around 100 basis points. And there's most certainly pressure on construction costs in a labor-constrained market. And this is why we focus on our Trade Partner Summit. Our relationship with our trade partners, making sure that we are the builder of choice for our trade partners. We think that this is a strategic advantage for the company. And we spend a lot of time developing relationships throughout our trade.
So let me just turn it over to Jon and ask him because Jon really spearheads this effort within the company and has done a remarkable job."

And we position ourselves to how we take advantage of the marketplace of whatever landscape's in front of us.

However, in the case of builders, there's at least 3 things that seem to be coming up in conversations with investors that could be offset. And I was curious if you might be able to opine on in general sense of order of magnitude how this all may come out in the wash, those other 3 components being the reduction of interest deductibility, energy tax credits and perhaps, the manufacturer's deduction.

The other thing that I walked away with is a sense that he and this administration are listening carefully, knowing that there will be winners and losers, there will be ups and downs in any configuration of the tax revamp.

So I'm not really sure where you get your 7, but let's put that aside, and let's understand where my commentary comes from. Remember that when we're looking at our monthly year-over-year, we're looking at comparison to last year. So let's take seasonality out of the equation because we're looking at December to December, January to January, February to February. So the seasonality is injected at both sides. And what we were seeing in terms of the numbers is a slower and lower comparison in December, a comparable comparison in January and a substantially higher comparison in February. So that's the numerical side of the commentary. But the empirical side is what I look to dovetail with the numbers side, as I think about these things and I try to think about them in real time and balance what we're hearing at the front line in the field from our customers and measure that up against what we're seeing in the numbers. And so the commentary really derives from the kind of traffic patterns, the questions that people are talking about and the kinds of people that are showing up. What we are starting to see, I think, in my commentary, I noted that the millennials are doubled up at about a 60% rate living at home with parent, relatives or roommates. It's at 115-year high as reported in USA TODAY. I don't know if that's exactly the right number, but it is directionally interesting. And we're starting to see some of that cohort start to come out to our sale centers and talk about the fact that rental rates are high, rental rates have been moving, rental rates create some instability, and it's time to start thinking about buying a home, 30-year mortgage, fixing a monthly payment and looking at the possibilities and benefits of actual ownership, dovetailing that with the banks talking about coming back to market. These are the components that kind of make up my sense that there's something afoot in the market that's broader than just 1 month in a row positive comparison. So that's kind of where it comes from, Mike."

I was interested in -- you mentioned that there's a low-cost basis there and attractive margins. At the same time, you're going to have the typical purchase accounting impact on 2Q.

And I was just curious to get a sense, maybe, Bruce, if you want to throw out some -- a [indiscernible]   here or talk about what's been able to be worked through or worked out from an accounting perspective, how should we think about the gross margins from WCI because typically, from my understanding, those are written up as well.

So the real purchase accounting impact is really in the second quarter as we write up backlog. And then, as you get beyond the second quarter, for the most part, the integration cost, the write-up of backlog is all behind us, we expect. And then, for the second half of the year and beyond, you get back to more normal type of margins that we would expect in that marketplace. And that's probably the best way to think about it."

This morning, I out West with Rick Beckwitt, our President, Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, and Eric Feder from our Rialto Group. We're going to begin our Trade Partner Summit later tonight, that's why we're out here. And this is where we invite many of our manufacturers, suppliers and distributors to discuss the homebuilding landscape and to consider better ways to partner and to keep costs and profitability property -- properly aligned.
On the call from Miami, we have Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and of course, David Collins, our Controller, who delivered our forward-looking statement. And we also have Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto. I want to apologize in advance if we're a little disjointed as we're going to attempt to coordinate from different locations.
As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview, and Bruce will deliver further detail and guidance. As always, after our prepared overview, we'll open to Q&A, and I'd like to request again that you limit your time to one question, one follow-up, so we can enable as many participants as possible within the hour that we've allotted.
So let me go ahead and begin and start by saying that market conditions certainly feel like they are strong and strengthening. The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we've seen for the entirety of this recovery seems to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal. While our first quarter operating results, particularly gross margins, reflects some of the sluggishness seen at the end of last year, our sales results went from tepid to better to strong as the quarter progressed. Limited supply and production deficits are now intersecting with land and labor shortage, and this suggests, though not yet seen but suggests, that pricing power is on the horizon as we move through the year.
So what are the factors that are driving the change in market sentiment and condition? They're certainly not apparent if you listen to the news stations. As our traffic has increased, we're getting some very direct feedback from our customers as they tell us what they are looking for, their timing and sometimes their motivation. There's clearly a sense of general optimism in the market. There's a perception that jobs are being created, and that wages are actually starting to move upward. There's a solidifying sense that the government has adopted a business-friendly posture, and that will result in real changes to tax rates and to the regulatory environment. The banking world is making more overtures to small businesses and to mortgage borrowers, and there's a sense that borrowers can make their way through the process.
Additionally, the upward direction of interest rates has encouraged some to get off the fence and consider purchasing a home rather than renting. Rents have risen, and the prospect of higher purchase prices and higher interest rates makes a compelling case that today's opportunity might be the best opportunity to leave those annual increases and monthly payments behind. Although there are also a lot of negative noise at the same time, it seems so far that the market is looking through the noise and is injecting optimism about the future in its purchase consideration. Additionally, the economic reality is of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic realities of rental rates are beginning to have a rational impact on decision-making for the first-time buyer as millennials are coming to market.
Interestingly, the front page of USA TODAY reports today that 60% of millennials ages 18 to 35 are living with parents, relatives and roommates, and that is a 115-year high.
Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the improved -- improvement in the market. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, we're expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve and will exceed expectations, particularly in the back half of the year.
Although our first quarter earnings were lower compared to the first quarter of 2016, that is primarily due to a higher tax rate, some onetime WCI closing costs and a fully expected decline in gross margins. While some of the same pressures will exist in the second quarter as well, the acceleration in sales pace against the limited supply and constrained capacity for the market to quickly increase production portends pricing power and a very strong second half of the year.
Against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. Our for-sale core homebuilding operations are extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017. Our sales were up 11% year-over-year before WCI, 12% including WCI, driven by our strategy of driving better quality traffic through our digital marketing efforts. Interestingly, our Internet leads were up 18% year-over-year to about $100,000 for the quarter. Our social media followers were up 17% year-over-year to 2.8 million on an annual basis, and YouTube views were up by 10 million for the year.
Fueled by our digital marketing efforts and other initiatives as well, we continue to focus on operational efficiency as our SG&A as at -- is at an historic low for our first quarter. Again, interestingly, our marketing and advertising spend is now down year-over-year for 9 consecutive quarters.
We continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency, and we are improving. And while we match production with sales pace, we continue to maximize our gross to net margin at 21.1% and 10.8%, respectively, as we maintain higher sales price in order to maximize returns on our valuable land asset, and we manage costs by striving to be the builder of choice to the trades in each of our markets. Our Trade Partner Summit, that I mentioned earlier, is a big part of that effort.
Though some might be concerned by our lower gross margin, we are exactly where we expected to be in the first part of this year, and our year-end margin will still be right on top of our guidance. Of course, we closed on the WCI acquisition in the first quarter, and that transaction is going very well, is being guided by Rick Beckwitt and his team, led by Fred Rothman and Darin McMurray. And I've asked Rick to speak specifically to this transaction. So let me turn it over briefly to Rick."

On February 10, 2017, Lennar closed on the acquisition of WCI Communities that was previously announced in September 2016.

On February 10, 2017, Lennar closed on the acquisition of WCI Communities that was previously announced in September 2016. The purchase price for WCI totaled approximately $643 million, which we funded with cash, and we also assumed $250 million in senior notes. The transaction combined 2 of the largest homebuilders in Florida and significantly expands Lennar's product offerings to include luxury, single-family and multifamily homes.
WCI is focused on amenity rich, lifestyle master-planned communities, catering to the move-up, active adult and second-home buyers, truly complements Lennar's leading market position in the entry-level and move-up markets in Florida.
During our extensive due diligence period, we identified 5 main drivers of value creation and synergies. I will go through each of these drivers in a second, but I'm happy to say that the WCI integration has gone very smoothly, and that we're ahead of schedule, which will lead to a timely realization of this value creation for our shareholders.
The first driver was WCI's portfolio of low-cost land located in most of the highest growth and largest Florida coastal markets. We acquired over 13,500 homesites, adding 51 actively selling communities and an additional pipeline of future community openings for the next several years. This land portfolio will produce strong gross margins going forward.
The portfolio included many large amenity rich, A+ master-planned communities that would be impossible to purchase in today's land-constrained market. We have great confidence that we will produce extremely strong returns from these assets as they will be managed by some of the best-performing and most profitable divisions in our company.
When we closed the acquisition, we acquired 361 homes in backlog with an average sales price of $516,000, totaling $188 million in near-term revenue and cash flow. In addition, at the end of the first quarter, we had 942 WCI homes in various stages of construction.
The second driver was the value maximization of the communities through the reallocation of the WCI and Lennar product and branding. During the due diligence period, we analyzed each community to determine whether we would make higher returns and profits by building WCI product or Lennar product. Approximately 1/3 of the communities that we acquired will be converted to the Lennar brand. In these communities, Lennar has product that is very similar to WCI. And by converting these communities to the Lennar brand, we will significantly lower our build cost with very little, if any, impact on the sales price of the home. We will also significantly increase sales pace and reduce cycle times. These changes will increase both profitability and IRR.
We've also identified several Lennar communities that we will be building WCI product. In these communities, we will be able to achieve much higher sales prices with the WCI brand. We are also planning to build both WCI and Lennar brands in some of our larger communities that benefit from a dual marketing strategy. This will allow us to increase absorptions and maximize the value of our underlying land positions. This is something we've done very successfully with our higher price village builders brand in Texas.
The third driver is utilizing our efficient homebuilding operating platform and leveraging our purchasing power. Included in this is streamlining WCI's approach to options. While we will still offer WCI homebuyers a selection of high-quality options and upgrades, we will be restructuring the design studio to include a more streamlined selection of options and upgrades. This is similar to what we do in Texas and has allowed us to offer options and upgrades with a more cost-effective G&A structure. Given our leading national and Florida position, Lennar can purchase materials and labor at a much lower price than WCI. This will not only lower build costs but provide greater value to the WCI homebuyers. Cost savings will also flow from reduced cycle time.
We've been working with our trade partners to rebid the WCI floor plans and make them more efficient to build. We expect to have this completed by the end of our second quarter. However, you will not see the full benefits of lower cost per square foot until 2018 once all of the acquired inventory and homes under construction are delivered. Based on our due diligence and work to date, we expect to save between $8 to $12 per square foot or 200 to 300 basis points on new starts once the rebidding process is completed. And finally, given the strides we made -- in digital marketing, we expect lower sales and marketing costs associated with these WCI communities as well.
The fourth driver was the synergies associated with lowering G&A costs. This include the elimination of costs associated with running 2 public companies as well as headcount reductions associated with overlapping corporate and operating functions. While there may be -- while there will be some upfront costs associated with implementing these changes, we anticipate annualized savings of approximately $30 million beginning in late 2017.
I'm sad to say that Keith Bass, the CEO of WCI, will not be moving forward with Lennar. While I'd hoped that Keith would join us and be a big part of our growth going forward, he has chosen to take some time off and explore some other opportunities. We wish Keith great success going forward and thank him and the entire WCI team for building such an incredible company.
Finally, the last driver was capturing incremental profits through the rollout of our mortgage and title operations to WCI's homebuilding operation and its Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices operation. This process has begun, and we should see a meaningful pickup in activity in Financial Services as we move into 2018.
In conclusion, we're very excited about this acquisition. And while we're focused on these 5 value creation ideas, we are certain that we'll find other areas that will benefit our shareholders.
I'll turn it back over to Stuart."

As you can see, I think we've got our WCI transaction well in hand, and we're very enthusiastic about it. So to wrap up homebuilding, let me say, we've noted before that our strategy remains a clear pivot in land strategy towards a shorter term land acquisition and towards a 7% to 10% growth strategy. Given the WCI addition, our 2017 growth rate should be on the higher side of our goals or a little over that goal.
We've also refocused on expanding our first-time buyer offering with our mix now standing at right around 40%. Combined, these strategic elements will continue to produce very strong cash flow for the company and will result in continued balance sheet improvement.
Now let me turn briefly to our other segments. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is also off to a great start in 2017. Of course, the business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and will expand with the addition of the WCI acquisition, but it's also expanding its non-Lennar business reach and growing bottom line. Financial Services results exceeded last year's first quarter result by 38% driven in part by increased profitability and title operations. And Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in his portion.
Lennar Multifamily. We couldn't be more pleased with the evolution and performance of LMC. Our entry into the apartment development business was timed perfectly, and LMC continues to execute flawlessly. LMC, under the leadership of Todd Farrell, has reached maturity and is poised for continuous annual profitability. As noted in our press release, this segment generated $19.2 million in pretax income, up 57% from last year, as we sold another 2 communities under our merchant build program.
During the first quarter, we started some 1,373 apartments in 5 communities with a total development cost of approximately $600 million. As of February 28, 2017, we had a geographically diverse pipeline of 74 communities, totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes with a total development cost of almost $8 billion. We are gearing up our build-to-core program that we've discussed in the past with some 20 communities for 6,000 apartments already under construction to fill the $2.2 billion equity bucket with geographically diversified A-located, brand-new and modern apartment communities in a generally shelter-constrained environment.
Rialto also turned in an excellent quarter. Rialto contributed $12 million to the bottom line this quarter as market condition -- conditions favored this business segment as well. The various settlements of Rialto are starting to take shape as we continue to work through the remaining legacy assets on book. In this quarter, we have started to book some of the long-awaited promote from Fund 1, which reflects the work of the extraordinary team of professionals investing and managing third-party capital and generating industry-leading returns.
Additionally, market conditions particularly favored Rialto Mortgage Finance as that exceptionally run team, which is focused on the commercial mortgage conduit business, exceeded expectations and closed 3 transactions totaling $478 million. The intersection of an outstanding operating team and strong market conditions produced an industry-leading net margin for the company.
Finally, FivePoint remains poised as a self-sufficient, stand-alone, large-scale community builder in California. This company manages and controls some of the best-positioned properties in some of the most land-constrained markets in the country. The current market optimism raises the possibility that this company that's been waiting for market conditions to reopen the IPO market might just find a window to go public. We'll see if the current sweep of optimism in the capital and stock market sets the stage for FivePoint's future.
So in conclusion, across the platform of our company, we're feeling pretty optimistic about this year ahead. We're clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on the strong market conditions that seem apparent. Each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform in strengthening market conditions. People, assets and operations are all aligned to perform in 2017, and we look forward to keeping you updated.
With that, let me turn it over to Bruce."

Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the first quarter driven by a 13% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a consistent average selling price of $365,000. WCI had a minimal impact to revenues in the first quarter",1920,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the first quarter driven by a 13% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a consistent average selling price of $365,000. WCI had a minimal impact to revenues in the first quarter as there were only 51 deliveries from the acquisition date until the end of the quarter.
Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 21.1%. And as Stuart mentioned, we're still on track with our previously stated gross margin goal of 22% to 22.5% for the full year. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land and construction costs. Our gross margin percentage was impacted 10 basis points due to the write-up of WCI backlog inventory that closed during the first quarter.
Sales incentives were 5.9% this quarter compared to 5.6% in the prior year, but it improved sequentially from our fourth quarter total of 6.2%. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our homebuilding East segment. Direct construction costs were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $55 per square foot, and that was driven by approximately a 6% increase in labor and 3% in material costs.
SG&A percentage as a percent of home sale revenue in the first quarter was 10.3%. We're continuing to improve SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and benefiting from the focus on technology investments that Stuart mentioned. Included in SG&A in the first quarter were onetime expenses related to the WCI acquisition, mainly offset by onetime legal and insurance benefits, resulting in a net onetime charge of approximately $2.7 million or 10 basis points impact to SG&A percent during the quarter.
Other income was $5.7 million compared to other expense of $600,000 in the same period last year. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $11.5 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they encourage G&A costs while ramping up for future land sales.
During the quarter, we opened 58 new communities and added 51 net communities from the WCI acquisition to end the quarter with 752 net active communities. New home orders increased 12% and new order dollar value increased 16% for the quarter. WCI had a minimal impact to this number as there were only 70 new home orders from this acquisition since we only had a couple of weeks in that first quarter post acquisition.
Our sales pace was higher compared to the prior year at 3 sales per community per month versus 2.9, and that improved sequentially throughout the quarter. The cancellation rate was 16%.
In the first quarter, we purchased approximately 8,300 homesites, totaling $659 million. And just to note, the first quarter usually has the largest dollar amount of land purchases for the year. Including the homesites from the WCI acquisition, our homesites owned and controlled now total 173,000 homesites, of which 137,000 are owned and 36,000 are controlled. We now have approximately 4.6 years supply of land owned based on this year's projected deliveries. We expect the year supply of land to continue to decline as we continue with our soft pivot land strategy.
Our completed unsold homes at the end of the quarter were in our normal range of 1 to 2 per community, totaling 1,342 homes.
Turning to Financial Services, this segment had strong results with operating earnings of $20.7 million compared to $14.9 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased slightly to $13.4 million from $13 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by higher volume. Mortgage originations increased to $1.8 billion versus $1.7 billion in the prior year. And the capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 81% compared to 82% in the prior year.
Our title company's profit increased to $6.8 million during the quarter from $2 million in the prior year. And this was driven by a 15% increase in revenue during the quarter and the associated overhead leverage from this higher volume.
Turning to the Rialto segment and providing some more details. The operating earnings were $12 million compared to $1.9 million in the prior year, both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $34.4 million of earnings, primarily due to $33.4 million of management fees and other, and this included $10 million of carried interest received in the quarter relating to Fund 1. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals approximately $125 million.
Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $478 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $33.2 million compared to $380 million and $3.9 million in the prior year, respectively. And these are both before their G&A expenses. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in volume and average net margin to the securitizations from 1.6% in the prior year to 7.1% in the first quarter.
Our direct investments had a loss of $15.9 million during the quarter, as we continue to work towards monetizing the remaining assets purchased from early portfolios. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $33.3 million for the quarter, and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was $6.4 million.
Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $163 million of cash.
Turning to the Multifamily segment. I'll just add a couple of comments to what Stuart mentioned. The $19.2 million of operating profit in the quarter was driven by the segment's $26 million share of gains from the sale of 2 operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 34%. The rate is higher than the prior year's rate of 28.1% because the prior year had onetime adjustments due to an IRS settlement and energy credits. We expect the tax rate to be 34% approximately for the remainder of 2017.
Turning to the balance sheet, which remained strong, we had a net debt to total capital of 41.6%, which was an improvement of 370 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with over $640 million of cash and only $250 million of borrowings on our $1.5 billion committed revolving credit facility.
Additionally, we grew stockholders equity by 24% year-over-year to $7.2 billion, and our book value per share grew to $30.70 per share.
The preliminary goodwill estimate from the WCI acquisition is $150 million to $175 million, and that's subject to revision as it is still being reviewed both internally and externally.
During the quarter, we issued $600 million of 4.125% senior notes due 2022, and we added $250 million of 6.875% senior notes due 2021 as part of the WCI acquisition, which we are likely to refinance at the next call date in August.
Finally, I would like to update our goals for 2017. Some of you already included WCI in your estimates for 2017 and all of the numbers that I'll be providing here include the full impact of the WCI acquisition, which will be accretive in 2017.
Starting with deliveries. We are increasing our delivery goal to between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 75% to 80% for the second quarter, 75% to 80% for the

Starting with deliveries. We are increasing our delivery goal to between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 75% to 80% for the second quarter, 75% to 80% for the third quarter and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We are still expecting an average sales price between $365,000 and $370,000 for the full year, and we are right on track with our operating margins of around 13% for the full year. There will be an impact to our second quarter gross margin from writing up WCI's backlog and purchase accounting. As a result, we expect our second quarter gross margin percentage to be between 21% and 21.5%, while the full year gross margin is still expected, as I mentioned, to be 22% to 22.5%.
We still expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to between 9.1% to 9.3% for the full year. The second quarter will have some nonrecurring transition costs relating to the WCI integration. Therefore, we expect SG&A to be approximately 9.5% in Q2. The operating leverage will be in the second half of the year to match up with our highest-volume quarters.
Financial Services, we are increasing the goal to approximately $160 million for the year with the second quarter expected to be approximately $40 million. The increase is due to the partial year inclusion of the Berkshire Hathaway Realty services brokerage operation from the WCI acquisition as well as additional closings from the WCI deal.
We are adding WCI to our mortgage platform, although keep in mind, 50% of the WCI buyers use all cash, and we will focus on capturing a high percentage of the other 50% that require a mortgage.
Rialto is still expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year with the second quarter expected to be approximately $5 million. Multifamily is still expected to be between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. The second quarter is expected to be also approximately $5 million, which includes 1 apartment community sale.
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income is still expected to be in a range of $70 million to $80 million of profit for the year. However, the second quarter is expected to have net expenses of $15 million to $20 million, while the second half of 2017 is driving all the profit for this category.
Corporate G&A is still expected to be 2.2% to 2.3%. And our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities.
And last, our balance sheet, we still continue to expect a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we accomplished in the prior year.
With these updated goals in mind, we are well positioned for the remainder of 2017.
And with that, let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

I don't want to get too far out over our skis. We're not injecting that optimism in our guidance right now. But what we are seeing and what we've heard a lot about is supply constraint across all kinds of -- all dwelling product types, from rental to for-sale. And we've also seen that we're land constrained and production constrained, and that's been the case for some time. The injection of some market optimism and what we saw in our sales pace as we went through the quarter really gives me reason to believe that as we look out ahead a couple of quarters, we are going to start to see prices move just as we would expect with a demand and supply imbalance, with demand increasing and supply somewhat constrained. So that's kind of where we are on that. Our guidance was really rooted in where we've seen things on a more current basis."

And Stuart, maybe since you're on the verge of meeting with a bunch of your trades, hopefully, you'll get some more insights here. But if you look out in California, there's been some pretty wet weather there. And I know there's some concern that we might see something similar to what happened in 2015 as an industry when, I think, Texas, in particular, felt some pretty significant headwinds from a wet spring. And as the year went on, I think a lot of builders struggled to get homes closed, and costs went up. And you guys obviously navigated that very well. But it certainly does create risk from the industry is concerned as far as costs going up. So a, I'm curious what you're hearing there as far as the just general availability of labor and the industry's ability to deal with some of those weather headwinds. And second question, just on California specifically, there's some news about a proposed bill out there that would potentially raise construction costs quite a bit with the prevailing wage requirement and communities there. So was curious if you looked at that at all, what impact that might have, given your pretty significant land position in California and what -- how you would handicap the likelihood of that passing at this point."

Let's start with the California question, and let's remember that there are always legislative moves afoot to alter the landscape in California. The legislation that's proposed at this point is just another one of those that comes down the pipe on a pretty regular basis. And we'll just have to see where it works out. It's a bill that is implemented as it's described would have an impact on costs relative to residential construction. Some communities out there, including some of our larger scale communities in FivePoint, might be exempt from the legislation. So it would be a mixed bag of impacts: some of them positive, some of them negative. I think, overall, negative for affordability in California. And so this is going to be talked through, worked out and see where we actually end up. But this is the landscape in California. And I think that all of these type of legislative initiatives come with positive and negative impact, and we'll just have to see where this one shakes out. As it relates to construction costs overall, the story around construction costs has been one of increases over the past many quarters. You've heard us talk about that. I think that as we think about our numbers, construction costs as a percentage of our sales price has probably moved up around 100 basis points. And there's most certainly pressure on construction costs in a labor-constrained market. And this is why we focus on our Trade Partner Summit. Our relationship with our trade partners, making sure that we are the builder of choice for our trade partners. We think that this is a strategic advantage for the company. And we spend a lot of time developing relationships throughout our trade.

And we position ourselves to how we take advantage of the marketplace of whatever landscape's in front of us.

However, in the case of builders, there's at least 3 things that seem to be coming up in conversations with investors that could be offset.

Even in Houston, we saw an improvement as we reduced our community count where our sales pace picked up a little bit year-over-year. So in those markets, I'd say it affects both the starter price points and the move-up price points. In Texas, which is marked as more flattish from a sales pace standpoint. There, you see a differential where the first-time buyer product moves at a faster pace than the move-up product."

Stuart, I wanted to go back to some of your opening remarks about sales pace being better than expected and referring to some optimism in the marketplace.

That's versus roughly 5%, 5.5% in 4Q, 5% in 3Q. So definitely a touch better. But I was interested in if the sales pace increased materially throughout the quarter, during the quarter. Obviously, you also have your typical spring selling season pickup. But on a year-over-year basis, if -- did the sales pace increase materially?

So I'm not really sure where you get your 7, but let's put that aside, and let's understand where my commentary comes from. Remember that when we're looking at our monthly year-over-year, we're looking at comparison to last year. So let's take seasonality out of the equation because we're looking at December to December, January to January, February to February. So the seasonality is injected at both sides. And what we were seeing in terms of the numbers is a slower and lower comparison in December, a comparable comparison in January and a substantially higher comparison in February. So that's the numerical side of the commentary. But the empirical side is what I look to dovetail with the numbers side, as I think about these things and I try to think about them in real time and balance what we're hearing at the front line in the field from our customers and measure that up against what we're seeing in the numbers. And so the commentary really derives from the kind of traffic patterns, the questions that people are talking about and the kinds of people that are showing up. What we are starting to see, I think, in my commentary, I noted that the millennials are doubled up at about a 60% rate living at home with parent, relatives or roommates. It's at 115-year high as reported in USA TODAY. I don't know if that's exactly the right number, but it is directionally interesting. And we're starting to see some of that cohort start to come out to our sale centers and talk about the fact that rental rates are high, rental rates have been moving, rental rates create some instability, and it's time to start thinking about buying a home, 30-year mortgage, fixing a monthly payment and looking at the possibilities and benefits of actual ownership, dovetailing that with the banks talking about coming back to market. These are the components that kind of make up my sense that there's something afoot in the market that's broader than just 1 month in a row positive comparison. So that's kind of where it comes from, Mike."

And we also have Jeff Krasnoff, CEO Rialto here, and Eric Feder from the Rialto group. John Jaffee, our Chief Financial Officer is also with us by phone from California and will participate in the Q&A portion. 
As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview. Bruce will deliver further detail and would like to ask that during the Q&A portion that you limit your questions to 1 question, 1 follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible in the hour allotted. 
So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we're very pleased to announce a very strong earnings for the second quarter with strong and balanced results being reported by each of our operating segments. While in our first quarter, we noted that the somewhat sluggish overhang from the end of 2016 had negatively impacted margins and therefore our operating results, we felt that the market was improving as sales picked up throughout the first quarter. We anticipated that the spring selling season would be solid and that we would, in fact, see improved results as the year progress. These are exactly the conditions that drove our results for the second quarter. 
We've continued to see strength in the housing market through the second quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins exceeded our initial expectations. Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market. There continues to be a perception that jobs are being created across the country and that we just are generally moving positively. We often discuss labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into a sense that many job sectors compensation is moving up. And while much of the data collected by the government doesn't seem to reflect significant wage growth, the customers visiting our welcome home centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment. 
There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that a governmental pro-business environment will result in at least job security and possibly some tax relief as well. Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the sense that we have, as business operators, that the economic environment in general is strong and stable and improving. The slow and study though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery continues to seem to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal. We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years are now intersecting with land and labor shortage and we started to see some pricing power as we move through the selling season somewhat offset, however, by construction cost increases. 
Additionally, the economic realities of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic reality of higher rental rates are beginning to have a rational impact on decision-making for the first time homebuyer as millennials are continuing to come to the housing markets. Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, we are expecting that each of our big business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve as we enter the back half of the year. 
Against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. To begin, our For Sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017. Deliveries for the first quarter increased 15% and our gross and net margins improved 40 basis points and 130 basis points sequentially. In the second quarter, new orders were up approximately 12% year-over-year, driven by a higher sales pace of 4 homes per community per month versus 3.9 last year, combined with the community count growth of some 6%. Interestingly, our strongest market, Portland, Seattle, Inland Empire, Coastal California, the Bay Area, Tampa and Southeast Florida all had a sales pace of over 5 homes per community per month. 
We continue to gain stronger results, powered by our focused strategy on driving better quality traffic to our digital marketing efforts. Today, our social media outreach generates Internet leads that now surpass 100,000 per quarter and that is driving our marketing and advertising spend, which is now down year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters. We continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency and we're continuing to focus on improving from here. 
Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool. This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently. We saw the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during this quarter as we exceeded home delivery expectation by reducing our completed unsold inventory by 17% without sacrificing margin. As you've heard from us in prior quarters, we're using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model. Fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives as well, we continue to focus on overall operational efficiency, driving our SG&A to historic lows for our first quarter and now for our second quarter as well. We're simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time. 
In addition, we closed on the WCI acquisition in the first quarter and the integration, which is being guided by Rick Beckwitt at his team led by Fred Rothman and Darin McMurray, is progressing exactly as planned. WCI will continue to contribute to earnings as expected as purchase accounting and nonrecurring cost dissipates and as cost benefits and SG&A savings accumulate. Overall, our core homebuilding strategy remains to pivot our land strategy towards shorter term land acquisitions and to maintain a 7% to 10% growth rate for the company while we enhance our operating platform by reducing SG&A. Parenthetically, given the WCI addition, our 2017 growth rate should be on the higher side or little bit over our goal for the year. Additionally, we have focused on expanding our first time homebuyer offering with our mix now standing right at around 40%. Combined, these strategic elements will produce a very strong cash flow for the company and will result in continued balance sheet improvement. 
Let me turn briefly to our Financial Services segment. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well on the second quarter as it contributed operating earnings of almost $44 million. Of course, the business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and with the addition of the WCI acquisition. As the refi business has diminished over the past year, Lennar Financial Services is continuing to expand its non-Lennar business reach and, bottom line, to replace those earnings. Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in just a few minutes. 
LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, our Multifamily Apartment segment, has continued to grow and exceed expectations. LMC generated $6.5 million of earnings in the second quarter, driven by the sale of one of our merchant build apartment communities. While we have continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we also have grown LMV, our build to co reprogram, which is cash flow focused on building and apartment portfolio. In the second quarter, we started 1,140 apartment homes in 4 communities with a total development cost of approximately $520 million. As of May 31, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 76 communities, totaling approximately 23,600 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.2 billion. These included 37 merchant build communities, totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion and 39 LMV build-to-core communities, totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $4.1 billion.  Our Multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations. 
Turning to Rialto. Rialto contributed $6.2 million to the bottom line this quarter versus a loss year ago. Rialto's investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base as well as harvest value for investors and for us. Our first 2 flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers. We're also pleased that our third opportunistic fund held its final closing with approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments and it has already invested or has under contract 33 transactions, involving the investment of over $600 million of equity. And to compliment our opportunistic funds, we also have over $1.1 billion of investor equity dedicated to investment grade CMBS mezzanine and traditional lending, which we also will be looking to grow this year. 
On the Rialto Mortgage Finance side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMS, which is maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable non-bank CMBS originators. RMS completed its 39th and 40th securitization transactions during this quarter with net margins averaging 5.8%, selling over $392 million of RMS originated loans. Our direct investments should be winding down over the next quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into a higher returning businesses. Going forward from that point, our focus will be solely on our investment management and RMS business segments there. 
Finally, FivePoint successfully completed its IPO this quarter and now enters the public market as a pure play California Master Plan Community developer. We expected over time the value embedded in the FivePoint management team and its extraordinary asset base will be realized as the appreciation cycle of these extremely well located communities will be revealed through transparency and public filings. Certainly, from a Lennar perspective, the new stock symbol SPH will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet. 
Finally, in conclusion, across the platform, our company's very pleased with the accomplishments of our second quarter and we're feeling very optimistic about the remainder of the year. We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across the platform on the strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market in the near feature. Each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform in strengthening market conditions. People, assets and operations are all in line to perform in 2017 and we look forward to keeping you updated. 
So with that, let me turn over for greater detail to Bruce."
30763,433559551,1231805,"Lennar Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 20, 2017",2017-06-20,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $213.6 million or $0.91 per diluted share and this compares to second quarter 2016 net earnings of $218.5 million or $0.95 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.02 p",1584,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $213.6 million or $0.91 per diluted share and this compares to second quarter 2016 net earnings of $218.5 million or $0.95 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.02 per diluted share impact due to a lower 32.2% tax rate as a result of energy credits available in the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 18% in the second quarter, driven by a 15% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 3% increase in average selling price to [ 374,000. ] 
As Stuart highlighted, our homebuilding team used our new technologies and a strong sales season to focus on selling deliverable inventory. This resulted in a significant increase in our expected backlog conversion ratio to 86% for the quarter. Additionally, our completed unsold home inventory dropped by 224 homes or 17% sequentially from the first quarter. This focus on deliverable inventory resulted in an acceleration of home deliveries that were previously expected in our third quarter. WCI contributed 388 deliveries to the quarter and that was about 7 being more than were expected. 
Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 21.5%. We are on track with our previously stated goal of 22% to 22.5% gross margins for the full year. The prior year's gross margin was 23.1% and the decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased lands and construction costs. Our gross margin percentage was impacted 20 basis points due to the write-up of WCI backlog inventory that closed during the quarter. Sales incentives year-over-year were consistent at 5.7%, but improved sequentially by 20 basis points from our first quarter. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our Homebuilding East segment. Direct construction costs were up 5% year-over-year to approximately $55 per square foot, driven by an approximate 7% increase in labor and 4% in material cost, driven primarily by lumber. 
Our SG&A percent in the second quarter was consistent with the prior year at 9.3%, which was record low. We are continuing to increase SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in existing homebuilding divisions and benefiting from our focus on our technology investments through the company. Included in our SG&A for the second quarter were transaction-related expenses to the WCI acquisition, which had a 20 basis point impact. 
Other income net was $3.8 million compared to $13.7 million in the prior year. In the prior year, we did have a profit participation from one of our homebuilding consolidated joint ventures that drove most of that profit. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $21.5 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incur general and administrative expenses while ramping up for future land sales. We opened 86 new communities during the quarter and closed 102 communities to end the quarter with 736 net active communities. We continue with our soft pivot strategy as purchased only 7,500 homesites, totaling $371 million in the second quarter. And our homesite count owned and controlled now totals 167,000, of which 136,000 are owned and 31,000 are controlled. 
Our Financial Services business had strong results with operating earnings of $43.7 million compared to $44.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income decreased slightly to $32 million from $36.8 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were $2.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year. Refinance volume was down 48% compared to the prior year, leading to a more competitive origination environment. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 80% compared to 83% in the prior year. Our titled company's profit increased to $9.7 million during the quarter from $7.4 million in the prior year, driven by an 8% increase in revenue and operating leverage from these higher revenues. And our new Florida Realty brokerage operation acquired from WCI generated $2.2 million of profit during the quarter. The spring selling season quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year for this business. 
More detail on Rialto. This segment produced $6.2 million compared to last year's loss of $13.8 million, both years are net of noncontrolling interests. The investment management business contributed $42 million of net earnings, which included $5.8 million of equity in earnings from the real estate funds and $36.3 million of management fees and other, which includes $11 million of carried interest distributions. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund 1 and 2 now totals $119 million. 
Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $392 million of commercial loans into 2 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $15.6 million compared with $386 million and $12.7 million in the prior year, respectively. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the average net margins and securitizations from 3.6% in the prior year to 4.2% in the current year. 
Our direct investments had a loss of $13 million as we continue to focus on monetizing the remaining assets from the early portfolio purchases. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $32.1 million for the quarter and interest expense was $6.3 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $120 million of cash. The Multifamily segment delivered a $6.5 million operating profit during the quarter, primarily driven by the segments $11.4 million share of gains from the 1 operating property that was sold as well as management fee income partially offset by G&A expenses. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 33.8%, which included a favorable resolution with the IRS. The rate is higher than the prior year's rate of 32.2% due to the energy credits in the prior year and we expect the tax rate to be approximately 34% for the remainder of this year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to total capital of 40.7%, a decline of 280 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with $748 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. This facility was amended during the quarter to expand out to 5 years and to increase the commitments to $2 billion, which includes a $400 million accordion feature. 
During the quarter, we retired our 12.25% senior note maturity of $400 million, which was due June 1, with the proceeds from our new issuance of $650 million, a 4.5% 7-year senior notes. This results in an annual net cash interest savings of $31 million per year. We intend to use the balance of the proceeds to redeem the 6.875% senior notes that were required with the WCI transaction. This redemption will likely occur at the next call date in August. Stockholders equity increased to $7.3 billion and our book value per share reached to $31.23 per share. 
Now I would like to update our goals for 2017. We are right on track to deliver between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. Given that we accelerated closings from Q3 into Q2, there is a smaller population of homes available for delivery in Q3 and therefore, we expect the backlog conversion ratio to be similar to the 2016 second half conversion ratios, which was 75% for the third quarter and close to 90% for the fourth quarter. We are increasing our average sales price guidance to between $370,000 and $375,000 for the year. We are still on track to hit our expected operating margins of around 13% for the full year. 
The full-year gross margin is still expected to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. We expect our third quarter gross margin percentage to be between 21.25% and 22%. We still expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line to be between 9.1% and 9.3% for the full year. The third quarter will have some nonrecurring transition costs relating to the WCI transaction. And therefore, we expect SG&A to be approximately 9.3% again in the third quarter. The fourth quarter, however, should realize the largest leverage given our highest expected volume for the fourth quarter. 
Financial Services, despite a large decline in refis, we are on track with the Financial Services goal of $160 million for the year, but the third quarter is expected to be $45 million to $50 million. 
Turning to Rialto. Rialto is now expected to generate profits of approximately $30 million for the year, with the third quarter expected to be in a range of $3 million to $5 million. Multifamily is still on track to be between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. The third quarter is expected to be approximately $5 million of that number. And joint ventures, land sales and other income, as we look at this combined category, we still expect the range of $70 million to $80 million profit for the full year. The third quarter is expected to be profitable in the range of 0 to $5 million and the fourth quarter will generate the bulk of the profits in this category. 
Corporate G&A is on track to still be 2.2% to 2.3% of total company revenues for the year and our community count is still expected to be approximately 770 to 780 communities. The balance sheet is well positioned to end the year with strong liquidity and similar leverage as 2016. So as you can see, we are well positioned to achieve our goals for the remainder of 2017. 
So with that, let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

And that can very well happen over the next couple of years. On the Rialto's side, you've seen the buildup of our investment management business. You've seen the buildup and execution around Rialto Mortgage Finance and you're seeing a very focused strategy on liquidating our core holdings, our assets that where we reinvested Rialto capital, so that we're going to reduce the business to just those 2 core business lines of RMS and investment management.

And would it make some sense for Lennar to develop its own external platform or partnership for finished lots, not withstanding the relationship with FivePoint in California."

In our plan is to get the markets there to continue to build and develop out that business. WCI is a powerhouse in that in those markets.

But within the digital marketing, I think you pointed that the marketing spend was down year-over-year for 10 straight quarters and the dynamic pricing that you reduced your standing into 17% without the negative margin impact. And I guess I was curious as to when you take those 2, digital marketing and dynamic pricing, are those the metrics that you are primarily monitoring that you think are the most important for assessing the effectiveness of your programs there or is there -- are there other very important metrics that we should be thinking about as it relates to those 2. And as he mentioned a set of those 2, are there any general areas that hold the most but you think to be focused on?"

And your question is a lit",397,"First of all, I'm so happy to hear that people are listening to my opening remarks and you did recite back to me, you've clearly listened. These initiatives are really core to what we're working on day to day inside the company. And your question is a little bit and the answer that those metrics are the starving metrics for those 2 initiatives, but they are not the only metrics for those 2 initiatives. There are other embedded metrics that we're working at. So relative to digital marketing, the very first thing was proving that we could improve our traffic, particularly the quality of traffic, put aside the quantity for a minute, but the quality of traffic while reducing the spend. So it was really, can we kept the spend by 50 basis points while we improve the quality of the traffic and continue to grow our business. And that was the beginning metric. But as we become more proficient at digital marketing and as we can expand the flow of qualified traffic, I highlighted 100,000 customers, qualified customers, coming to the doors driven by social media and Internet marketing. As we can expand the number coming through the doors, we're probably going to be able to see greater pricing power and other efficiencies as well. And I'm not going to go through and start articulating those metrics, but we think there's more firepower in the digital marketing strategy and we are very focused on that on a regular basis. Likewise, with the dynamic pricing tool, what you're seeing in production and standing inventory is a starter, but the ability to sell homes that are not standing inventory at the end of quarters helps alleviate the needs to use discounting mechanisms or incentives to move that inventory. And so as we move forward with those digital tools or technology tools, we think that there's more firepower in them. But we have a whole host of initiatives that we're working on that we don't articulate because we're simply not getting out of our skis, but we are telling you that we're working on these things everyday and we are committed and think we will build a better mousetrap. And I do want to say thank you to everybody for joining us. We look forward to keeping you updated as we move through the rest of 2017. Thank you."

Jon Jaffee, our Chief Operating Officer is also with us by phone from California and will participate in the Q&A portion. 
As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview. Bruce will deliver further detail. [Operator Instructions]
So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we're very pleased to announce a very strong earnings for the second quarter with strong and balanced results being reported by each of our operating segments. While in our first quarter, we noted that the somewhat sluggish overhang from the end of 2016 had negatively impacted margins, and therefore, our operating results, we felt that the market was improving as sales picked up throughout the first quarter. We anticipated that the spring selling season would be solid and that we would, in fact, see improved results as the year progress. These are exactly the conditions that drove our results for the second quarter.
We've continued to see strength in the housing market through the second quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins exceed our initial expectations. Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market. There continues to be a perception that jobs are being created across the country and that wages are generally moving positively. The often-discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into a sense that many job sector's compensation is moving up. And while much of the data collected by the government doesn't seem to reflect significant wage growth, the customers visiting our welcome home centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment.
There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that a governmental pro-business environment will result in at least job security and possibly some tax relief as well. Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the sense that we have, as business operators, that the economic environment in general is strong and stable and improving. The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery continues to seem to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal. We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years are now intersecting with land and labor shortage. And we started to see some pricing power as we moved through the selling season, somewhat offset, however, by construction cost increases.
Additionally, the economic realities of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic reality of higher rental rates are beginning to have a rational impact on decision-making for the first-time homebuyer as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market. Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, we are expecting that each of our business segment will continue to grow, to mature and to improve as we enter the back half of the year.
Against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. To begin, our for-sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017. Deliveries for the first quarter increased 15% and our gross and net margins improved 40 basis points and 130 basis points sequentially. In the second quarter, new orders were up approximately 12% year-over-year, driven by a higher sales pace of 4 homes per community per month versus 3.9 last year, combined with a community count growth of some 6%. Interestingly, our strongest markets, Portland, Seattle, Inland Empire, Coastal California, the Bay Area, Tampa and Southeast Florida, all had a sales pace of over 5 homes per community per month. 
We continue to gain stronger results, powered by our focused strategy on driving better quality traffic to our digital marketing efforts. Today, our social media outreach generates Internet leads that now surpass 100,000 per quarter, and that is driving our marketing and advertising spend, which is now down year-over-year for the -- for 10 consecutive quarters. We continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency, and we're continuing to focus on improving from here.
Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool. This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently. We saw the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during this quarter as we exceeded home delivery expectations by reducing our completed unsold inventory by 17% without sacrificing margin. As you've heard from us in prior quarters, we're using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model. Fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives as well, we continue to focus on overall operational efficiency, driving our SG&A to historic lows for our first quarter and now for our second quarter as well. We're simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time.
In addition, we closed on the WCI acquisition in the first quarter and the integration, which is being guided by Rick Beckwitt and his team led by Fred Rothman and Darin McMurray, is progressing exactly as planned. WCI will continue to contribute to earnings as expected as purchase accounting and nonrecurring costs dissipate and as cost benefit and SG&A savings accumulate.
Overall, our core homebuilding strategy remains to pivot our land strategy towards shorter-term land acquisitions and to maintain a 7% to 10% growth rate for the company while we enhance our operating platform by reducing SG&A. Parenthetically, given the WCI addition, our 2017 growth rate should be on the higher side or a little bit over our goal for the year. Additionally, we have focused on expanding our first-time homebuyer offering with our mix now standing right at around 40%.  Combined, these strategies -- these strategic elements will produce very strong cash flow for the company and will result in continued balance sheet improvement.
Let me turn briefly to our Financial Services segment. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well in the second quarter as it contributed operating earnings of almost $44 million. Of course, the business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and with the addition of the WCI acquisition. As the refi business has diminished over the past year, Lennar Financial Services is continuing to expand its non-Lennar business reach and bottom line to replace those earnings. Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in just a few minutes.
LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, our multifamily apartment segment, has continued to grow and exceed expectations. LMC generated $6.5 million of earnings in the second quarter driven by the sale of one of our merchant build apartment communities. While we have continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we also have grown LMV, our build-to-core program, which is cash flow focused on building and apartment portfolio. In the second quarter, we started 1,140 apartment homes in 4 communities with a total development cost of approximately $520 million. As of May 31, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 76 communities, totaling approximately 23,600 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.2 billion. These included 37 merchant build communities, totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion and 39 LMV build-to-core communities totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $4.1 billion. Our Multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations.
Turning to Rialto. Rialto contributed $6.2 million to the bottom line this quarter versus a loss year ago. Rialto's investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base as well as harvest value for investors and for us. Our first 2 flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers. We're also pleased that our third opportunistic fund held its final closing with approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments and it has already invested or has under contract 33 transactions, involving the investment of over $600 million of equity. And to complement our opportunistic funds, we also have over $1.1 billion of investor equity dedicated to investment-grade CMBS, mezzanine and transitional lending, which we also will be looking to grow this year.
On the Rialto Mortgage Finance side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF, which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable nonbank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 39th and 40th securitization transactions during this quarter with net margins averaging 5.8%, selling over $392 million of RMF originated loans. Our direct investments should be winding down over the next quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into a higher returning businesses. Going forward from that point, our focus will be solely on our investment management and RMF business segments there. 
Finally, FivePoint successfully completed its IPO this quarter and now enters the public market as a pure-play California master planned community developer. We expected over time the value embedded in the FivePoint management team and its extraordinary asset base will be realized as the appreciation cycle of these extremely well-located communities will be revealed through transparency and public filings. Certainly, from a Lennar perspective, the new stock symbol, FPH, will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet. 
Finally, in conclusion, across the platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our second quarter, and we're feeling very optimistic about the remainder of the year. We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across the platform on the strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market in the near feature. Each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform in strengthening market conditions. People, assets and operations are all aligned to perform in 2017, and we look forward to keeping you updated. 
So with that, let me turn over for greater detail to Bruce."
30763,433559551,1231952,"Lennar Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 20, 2017",2017-06-20,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $213.6 million or $0.91 per diluted share and this compares to second quarter 2016 net earnings of $218.5 million or $0.95 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.02 p",1587,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $213.6 million or $0.91 per diluted share and this compares to second quarter 2016 net earnings of $218.5 million or $0.95 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.02 per diluted share impact due to a lower 32.2% tax rate as a result of energy credits available in the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 18% in the second quarter, driven by a 15% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% increase in average selling price to $374,000.
As Stuart highlighted, our homebuilding team used our new technologies and a strong sales season to focus on selling deliverable inventory. This resulted in a significant increase in our expected backlog conversion ratio to 86% for the quarter. Additionally, our completed unsold home inventory dropped by 224 homes or 17% sequentially from the first quarter. This focus on deliverable inventory resulted in an acceleration of home deliveries that were previously expected in our third quarter. WCI contributed 388 deliveries to the quarter and that was about 7 being more than were expected.
Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 21.5%. We are on track with our previously stated goal of 22% to 22.5% gross margins for the full year. The prior year's gross margin was 23.1% and the decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased lands and construction costs. Our gross margin percentage was impacted 20 basis points due to the write-off of WCI backlog inventory that closed during the quarter. Sales incentives year-over-year were consistent at 5.7% but improved sequentially by 20 basis points from our first quarter. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our homebuilding east segment. Direct construction costs were up 5% year-over-year to approximately $55 per square foot, driven by an approximate 7% increase in labor and 4% in material costs, driven primarily by lumber. 
Our SG&A percent in the second quarter was consistent with the prior year at 9.3%, which was a record low. We are continuing to improve SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in existing homebuilding divisions and benefiting from our focus on our technology investments through the company. Included in our SG&A for the second quarter were transaction-related expenses to the WCI acquisition, which had a 20 basis point impact.
Other income net was $3.8 million compared to $13.7 million in the prior year. In the prior year, we did have a profit participation from one of our homebuilding consolidated joint ventures that drove most of that profit. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $21.5 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incur general and administrative expenses while ramping up for future land sales. We opened 86 new communities during the quarter and closed 102 communities to end the quarter with 736 net active communities. We continued with our soft pivot strategy as we purchased only 7,500 homesites, totaling $371 million in the second quarter. And our homesite count, owned and controlled, now totals 167,000, of which 136,000 are owned and 31,000 are controlled.
Our Financial Services business had strong results with operating earnings of $43.7 million compared to $44.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income decreased slightly to $32 million from $36.8 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were $2.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year. Refinance volume was down 48% compared to the prior year, leading to a more competitive origination environment. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 80% compared to 83% in the prior year. Our title company's profit increased to $9.7 million during the quarter from $7.4 million in the prior year, driven by an 8% increase in revenue and operating leverage from these higher revenues. And then our new Florida Realty brokerage operation acquired from WCI generated $2.2 million of profit during the quarter. The spring selling season quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year for this business.
More detail on Rialto. This segment produced $6.2 million compared to last year's loss of $13.8 million, both years are net of noncontrolling interests. The investment management business contributed $42 million of net earnings, which included $5.8 million of equity in earnings from the real estate funds and $36.3 million of management fees and other, which includes $11 million of carried interest distributions. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund I and II now totals $119 million. 
Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $392 million of commercial loans into 2 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $15.6 million compared with $386 million and $12.7 million in the prior year, respectively. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the average net margins and securitizations from 3.6% in the prior year to 4.2% in the current year.
Our direct investments had a loss of $13 million as we continue to focus on monetizing the remaining assets from the early portfolio purchases. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $32.1 million for the quarter and interest expense was $6.3 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $120 million of cash. The Multifamily segment delivered a $6.5 million operating profit during the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $11.4 million share of gains from the 1 operating property that was sold as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 33.8%, which included a favorable resolution with the IRS. The rate is higher than the prior year's rate of 32.2% due to the energy credits in the prior year, and we expect the tax rate to be approximately 34% for the remainder of this year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to total capital of 40.7%, a decline of 280 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with $748 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. This facility was amended during the quarter to extend out to 5 years and to increase the commitments to $2 billion, which includes a $400 million accordion feature.
During the quarter, we retired our 12.25% senior note maturity of $400 million, which was due June 1, with the proceeds from our new issuance of $650 million, a 4.5% 7-year senior notes. This results in an annual net cash interest savings of $31 million per year. We intend to use the balance of the proceeds to redeem the 6.875% senior notes that were acquired with the WCI transaction. This redemption will likely occur at the next call date in August. Stockholders' equity increased to $7.3 billion and our book value per share grew to $31.23 per share.
Now I would like to update our goals for 2017. We are right on track to deliver between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. Given that we accelerated closings from Q3 into Q2, there is a smaller population of homes available for delivery in Q3, and therefore, we expect the backlog conversion ratio to be similar to the 2016 second half conversion ratios, which was 75% for the third quarter and close to 90% for the fourth quarter. We are increasing our average sales price guidance to between $370,000 and $375,000 for the year. We are still on track to hit our expected operating margins of around 13% for the full year.
The full year gross margin is still expected to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. We expect our third quarter gross margin percentage to be between 21.75% and 22%. We still expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line to be between 9.1% and 9.3% for the full year. The third quarter will have some nonrecurring transition costs relating to the WCI transaction. And therefore, we expect SG&A to be approximately 9.3% again in the third quarter. The fourth quarter, however, should realize the largest leverage given our higher expected volume for the fourth quarter.
Financial Services, despite a large decline in refis, we are on track with our Financial Services goal of $160 million for the year with the third quarter expected to be $45 million to $50 million.
Turning to Rialto. Rialto is now expected to generate profits of approximately $30 million for the year with the third quarter expected to be in a range of $3 million to $5 million.
Multifamily is still on track to be between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. The third quarter is expected to be approximately $5 million of that number.
And joint ventures, land sales and other income, as we look at this combined category, we still expect a range of $70 million to $80 million of profit for the full year. The third quarter is expected to be profitable in the range of 0 to $5 million and the fourth quarter will generate the bulk of the profits in this category.
Corporate G&A is on track to still be 2.2% to 2.3% of total company revenues for the year and our community count is still expected to be approximately 770 to 780 communities.
The balance sheet is well positioned to end the year with strong liquidity and similar leverage as 2016. So as you can see, we are well positioned to achieve our goals for the remainder of 2017.
So with that, let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

From your perspective, is there a room and depth for now the industry all rushing to go to the B, E and even C rings of the market and give us some comfort that there's not going to get a crowding situation or saturation?"

I think that while demand is continuing to grow, I think there are some limiters on how quickly the production can keep up and can expand to meet that demand. The question as to whether there's going to be a flood to the B and C locations. There's certainly more demand for those locations as the market expands. As we've highlighted before, it's our strategy to stay inside those outskirts.

We think that there's a lot more leverage. I think it derives from a lot of smaller initiatives adding up over time. And as they become more provable, we'll start to put them on the table. I don't want to start getting out over my skis or creating false optimism. It has been done before. But as we prove these up, we're talking about them a little bit more.

You've heard us talk a lot about LMC, our multifamily apartment rental program. That program, as we move through our merchant build assets and migrate towards our build-to-core strategy, this sets up an opportunity for us to maintain the strategy within the company if it strategically makes sense as a core asset or to do some kind of alternative transaction, and that can very well happen over the next couple of years. On the Rialto's side, you've seen the buildup of our investment management business. You've seen the buildup and execution around Rialto Mortgage Finance. And you're seeing a very focused strategy on liquidating our core holdings, our assets that -- where we invested Rialto capital, so that we're going to reduce the business to just those 2 core business lines of RMF and investment management.

It's animal spirits. It's the notion that all of this is an inexact science. Interest rates and affordability and wages and pricing all play a part in what people can afford and how the mass actually works out. But the confidence that people bring with them to the table about whether their job is stable and whether there's going to be a wage increase or there's opportunity for them to move and be mobile to the next job opportunity, whether they've been able to accumulate a down payment or in excess of a down payment or whether there are family members that are able to help support with a gift or something else, all of these are moving parts that define this inexact science that we're all trying to kind of divine going forward. So it's kind of hard to wrap all of our heads around where the market is going. But the general trajectory is positive. And even at the first-time buyer level, as the millennials start to unwind, they're doubling up and come to the market realizing that rental rates have gone up and there's a real reason to go ahead and purchase, that first-time buyer segment is showing some optimism and some ability to be flexible in and around the affordability levels and as prices move up.

But within the digital marketing, I think you pointed that marketing spend was down year-over-year for 10 straight quarters; and in dynamic pricing, that you reduced your standing inventory 17% without a negative margin impact. And I guess, I was curious as to when you take those 2, digital marketing and dynamic pricing, are those the metrics that you're primarily monitoring that you think are the most important for assessing the effectiveness of your programs there? Or is there -- are there other very important metrics that we should be thinking about as it relates to those 2? And you mentioned other initiatives outside of those 2.

You've clearly listened. Look, these initiatives are really core to what we're working on day-to-day inside the company. And your question is a good one. The answer is that those metrics are the starting metrics for those 2 initiatives, but they are not the only metrics for those 2 initiatives. There are other embedded metrics that we're working at. So relative to digital marketing, the very first thing was proving that we could improve our traffic, particularly the quality of traffic, put aside the quantity for a minute, but the quality of traffic while reducing the spend. So it was really, can we cut the spend by 50 basis points while we improve the quality of the traffic and continue to grow our business? And that was the beginning metric. But as we become more proficient at digital marketing and as we can expand the flow of qualified traffic, I highlighted 100,000 customers -- qualified customers coming through the doors driven by social media and Internet marketing. As we can expand the number coming through the doors, we're probably going to be able to see greater pricing power and other efficiencies as well. And I'm not going to go through and start articulating those metrics, but we think there's more firepower in the digital marketing strategy, and we are very focused on that on a regular basis. Likewise, with the dynamic pricing tool, what you're seeing in a reduction in standing inventory is a starter, but the ability to sell homes that are not standing inventory at the end of quarters helps alleviate the need to use discounting mechanisms or incentives to move that inventory. And so as we move forward with those digital tools or technology tools, we think that there's more firepower in them. But we have a whole host of initiatives that we're working on that we don't articulate because we're simply not getting out of our skis, but we are telling you that we're working on these things every day and we are committed and think we will build a better mousetrap.

And we also have Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto here; and Eric Feder from the Rialto group. Jon Jaffee, our Chief Operating Officer is also with us by phone from California and will participate in the Q&A portion. 
As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview. Bruce will deliver further detail. [Operator Instructions]
So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we're very pleased to announce a very strong earnings for the second quarter with strong and balanced results being reported by each of our operating segments. While in our first quarter, we noted that the somewhat sluggish overhang from the end of 2016 had negatively impacted margins, and therefore, our operating results, we felt that the market was improving as sales picked up throughout the first quarter. We anticipated that the spring selling season would be solid and that we would, in fact, see improved results as the year progress. These are exactly the conditions that drove our results for the second quarter.
We've continued to see strength in the housing market through the second quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins exceed our initial expectations. Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market. There continues to be a perception that jobs are being created across the country and that wages are generally moving positively. The often-discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into a sense that many job sector's compensation is moving up. And while much of the data collected by the government doesn't seem to reflect significant wage growth, the customers visiting our welcome home centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment.
There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that a governmental pro-business environment will result in at least job security and possibly some tax relief as well. Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the sense that we have, as business operators, that the economic environment in general is strong and stable and improving. The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery continues to seem to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal. We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years are now intersecting with land and labor shortage. And we started to see some pricing power as we moved through the selling season, somewhat offset, however, by construction cost increases.
Additionally, the economic realities of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic reality of higher rental rates are beginning to have a rational impact on decision-making for the first-time homebuyer as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market. Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, we are expecting that each of our business segment will continue to grow, to mature and to improve as we enter the back half of the year.
Against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. To begin, our for-sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017. Deliveries for the first quarter increased 15% and our gross and net margins improved 40 basis points and 130 basis points sequentially. In the second quarter, new orders were up approximately 12% year-over-year, driven by a higher sales pace of 4 homes per community per month versus 3.9 last year, combined with a community count growth of some 6%. Interestingly, our strongest markets, Portland, Seattle, Inland Empire, Coastal California, the Bay Area, Tampa and Southeast Florida, all had a sales pace of over 5 homes per community per month. 
We continue to gain stronger results, powered by our focused strategy on driving better quality traffic through our digital marketing efforts. Today, our social media outreach generates Internet leads that now surpass 100,000 per quarter, and that is driving our marketing and advertising spend, which is now down year-over-year for the -- for 10 consecutive quarters. We continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency, and we're continuing to focus on improving from here.
Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool. This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently. We saw the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during this quarter as we exceeded home delivery expectations by reducing our completed unsold inventory by 17% without sacrificing margin. As you've heard from us in prior quarters, we're using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model. Fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives as well, we continue to focus on overall operational efficiency, driving our SG&A to historic lows for our first quarter and now for our second quarter as well. We're simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time.
In addition, we closed on the WCI acquisition in the first quarter and the integration, which is being guided by Rick Beckwitt and his team led by Fred Rothman and Darin McMurray, is progressing exactly as planned. WCI will continue to contribute to earnings as expected as purchase accounting and nonrecurring costs dissipate and as cost benefit and SG&A savings accumulate.
Overall, our core homebuilding strategy remains to pivot our land strategy towards shorter-term land acquisitions and to maintain a 7% to 10% growth rate for the company while we enhance our operating platform by reducing SG&A. Parenthetically, given the WCI addition, our 2017 growth rate should be on the higher side or a little bit over our goal for the year. Additionally, we have focused on expanding our first-time homebuyer offering with our mix now standing right at around 40%.  Combined, these strategies -- these strategic elements will produce very strong cash flow for the company and will result in continued balance sheet improvement.
Let me turn briefly to our Financial Services segment. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well in the second quarter as it contributed operating earnings of almost $44 million. Of course, the business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and with the addition of the WCI acquisition. As the refi business has diminished over the past year, Lennar Financial Services is continuing to expand its non-Lennar business reach and bottom line to replace those earnings. Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in just a few minutes.
LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, our multifamily apartment segment, has continued to grow and exceed expectations. LMC generated $6.5 million of earnings in the second quarter driven by the sale of one of our merchant build apartment communities. While we have continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we also have grown LMV, our build-to-core program, which is cash flow focused on building and apartment portfolio. In the second quarter, we started 1,140 apartment homes in 4 communities with a total development cost of approximately $520 million. As of May 31, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 76 communities, totaling approximately 23,600 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.2 billion. These included 37 merchant build communities, totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion and 39 LMV build-to-core communities totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $4.1 billion. Our Multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations.
Turning to Rialto. Rialto contributed $6.2 million to the bottom line this quarter versus a loss year ago. Rialto's investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base as well as harvest value for investors and for us. Our first 2 flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers. We're also pleased that our third opportunistic fund held its final closing with approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments and it has already invested or has under contract 33 transactions, involving the investment of over $600 million of equity. And to complement our opportunistic funds, we also have over $1.1 billion of investor equity dedicated to investment-grade CMBS, mezzanine and transitional lending, which we also will be looking to grow this year.
On the Rialto Mortgage Finance side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF, which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable nonbank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 39th and 40th securitization transactions during this quarter with net margins averaging 5.8%, selling over $392 million of RMF originated loans. Our direct investments should be winding down over the next quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into our higher returning businesses. Going forward from that point, our focus will be solely on our investment management and RMF business segments there. 
Finally, FivePoint successfully completed its IPO this quarter and now enters the public market as a pure-play California master planned community developer. We expected over time the value embedded in the FivePoint management team and its extraordinary asset base will be realized as the appreciation cycle of these extremely well-located communities will be revealed through transparency and public filings. Certainly, from a Lennar perspective, the new stock symbol, FPH, will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet. 
Finally, in conclusion, across the platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our second quarter, and we're feeling very optimistic about the remainder of the year. We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across the platform on the strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market in the near feature. Each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform in strengthening market conditions. People, assets and operations are all aligned to perform in 2017, and we look forward to keeping you updated. 
So with that, let me turn over for greater detail to Bruce."

Additionally, our completed unsold home inventory dropped by 224 homes or 17% sequentially from the first quarter. This focus on deliverable inventory resulted in an acceleration of home deliveries that were previously expected in our third quarter. WCI contributed 388 deliveries to the quarter and that was about 70 more than were expected.
Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 21.5%. We are on track with our previously stated goal of 22% to 22.5% gross margins for the full year. The prior year's gross margin was 23.1% and the decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased lands and construction costs. Our gross margin percentage was impacted 20 basis points due to the write-off of WCI backlog inventory that closed during the quarter. Sales incentives year-over-year were consistent at 5.7% but improved sequentially by 20 basis points from our first quarter. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our homebuilding east segment. Direct construction costs were up 5% year-over-year to approximately $55 per square foot, driven by an approximate 7% increase in labor and 4% in material costs, driven primarily by lumber. 
Our SG&A percent in the second quarter was consistent with the prior year at 9.3%, which was a record low. We are continuing to improve SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in existing homebuilding divisions and benefiting from our focus on our technology investments through the company. Included in our SG&A for the second quarter were transaction-related expenses [ due ] to the WCI acquisition, which had a 20 basis point impact.
Other income net was $3.8 million compared to $13.7 million in the prior year. In the prior year, we did have a profit participation from one of our homebuilding consolidated joint ventures that drove most of that profit. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $21.5 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incur general and administrative expenses while ramping up for future land sales. We opened 86 new communities during the quarter and closed 102 communities to end the quarter with 736 net active communities. We continued with our soft pivot strategy as we purchased only 7,500 homesites, totaling $371 million in the second quarter. And our homesite count, owned and controlled, now totals 167,000, of which 136,000 are owned and 31,000 are controlled.
Our Financial Services business had strong results with operating earnings of $43.7 million compared to $44.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income decreased slightly to $32 million from $36.8 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were $2.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year. Refinance volume was down 48% compared to the prior year, leading to a more competitive origination environment. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 80% compared to 83% in the prior year. Our title company's profit increased to $9.7 million during the quarter from $7.4 million in the prior year, driven by an 8% increase in revenue and operating leverage from these higher revenues. And then our new Florida Realty brokerage operation acquired from WCI generated $2.2 million of profit during the quarter. The spring selling season quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year for this business.
More detail on Rialto. This segment produced $6.2 million compared to last year's loss of $13.8 million, both years are net of noncontrolling interests. The investment management business contributed $42 million of net earnings, which included $5.8 million of equity in earnings from the real estate funds and $36.3 million of management fees and other, which includes $11 million of carried interest distributions. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund I and II now totals $119 million. 
Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $392 million of commercial loans into 2 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $15.6 million compared with $386 million and $12.7 million in the prior year, respectively. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the average net margins and [ with ] securitizations from 3.6% in the prior year to 4.2% in the current year.
Our direct investments had a loss of $13 million as we continue to focus on monetizing the remaining assets from the early portfolio purchases. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $32.1 million for the quarter and interest expense was $6.3 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $120 million of cash. The Multifamily segment delivered a $6.5 million operating profit during the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $11.4 million share of gains from the 1 operating property that was sold as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 33.8%, which included a favorable resolution with the IRS. The rate is higher than the prior year's rate of 32.2% due to the energy credits in the prior year, and we expect the tax rate to be approximately 34% for the remainder of this year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to total capital of 40.7%, a decline of 280 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with $748 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. This facility was amended during the quarter to extend out to 5 years and to increase the commitments to $2 billion, which includes a $400 million accordion feature.
During the quarter, we retired our 12.25% senior note maturity of $400 million, which was due June 1, with the proceeds from our new issuance of $650 million, a 4.5% 7-year senior notes. This results in an annual net cash interest savings of $31 million per year. We intend to use the balance of the proceeds to redeem the 6.875% senior notes that were acquired with the WCI transaction. This redemption will likely occur at the next call date in August. Stockholders' equity increased to $7.3 billion and our book value per share grew to $31.23 per share.
Now I would like to update our goals for 2017. We are right on track to deliver between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. Given that we accelerated closings from Q3 into Q2, there is a smaller population of homes available for delivery in Q3, and therefore, we expect the backlog conversion ratio to be similar to the 2016 second half conversion ratios, which was 75% for the third quarter and close to 90% for the fourth quarter. We are increasing our average sales price guidance to between $370,000 and $375,000 for the year. We are still on track to hit our expected operating margins of around 13% for the full year.
The full year gross margin is still expected to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. We expect our third quarter gross margin percentage to be between 21.75% and 22%. We still expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line to be between 9.1% and 9.3% for the full year. The third quarter will have some nonrecurring transition costs relating to the WCI transaction. And therefore, we expect SG&A to be approximately 9.3% again in the third quarter. The fourth quarter, however, should realize the largest leverage given our higher expected volume for the fourth quarter.
Financial Services, despite a large decline in refis, we are on track with our Financial Services goal of $160 million for the year with the third quarter expected to be $45 million to $50 million.
Turning to Rialto. Rialto is now expected to generate profits of approximately $30 million for the year with the third quarter expected to be in a range of $3 million to $5 million.
Multifamily is still on track to be between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. The third quarter is expected to be approximately $5 million of that number.
And joint ventures, land sales and other income, as we look at this combined category, we still expect a range of $70 million to $80 million of profit for the full year. The third quarter is expected to be profitable in the range of 0 to $5 million and the fourth quarter will generate the bulk of the profits in this category.
Corporate G&A is on track to still be 2.2% to 2.3% of total company revenues for the year and our community count is still expected to be approximately 770 to 780 communities.
The balance sheet is well positioned to end the year with strong liquidity and similar leverage as 2016. So as you can see, we are well positioned to achieve our goals for the remainder of 2017.
So with that, let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

You've heard us talk a lot about LMC, our multifamily apartment rental program. That program, as we move through our merchant build assets and migrate towards our build-to-core strategy, this sets up an opportunity for us to maintain the strategy within the company if it strategically makes sense as a core asset or to do some kind of alternative transaction, and that can very well happen over the next couple of years. On the Rialto's side, you've seen the buildup of our investment management business. You've seen the buildup and execution around Rialto Mortgage Finance.

Preferred customer approach to dealing with subcontractors is really going to benefit the WCI business going forward. And the SG&A leverage that we have been improving on the Lennar platform, we think, better than others is going to help leverage the additional volume that we see from WCI in the future.

It's animal spirits. It's the notion that all of this is an inexact science. Interest rates and affordability and wages and pricing all play a part in what people can afford and how the math actually works out. But the confidence that people bring with them to the table about whether their job is stable and whether there's going to be a wage increase or there's opportunity for them to move and be mobile to the next job opportunity, whether they've been able to accumulate a down payment or in excess of a down payment or whether there are family members that are able to help support with a gift or something else, all of these are moving parts that define this inexact science that we're all trying to kind of divine going forward. So it's kind of hard to wrap all of our heads around where the market is going. But the general trajectory is positive. And even at the first-time buyer level, as the millennials start to unwind, they're doubling up and come to the market realizing that rental rates have gone up and there's a real reason to go ahead and purchase, that first-time buyer segment is showing some optimism and some ability to be flexible in and around the affordability levels and as prices move up.

The second question I had related to technology, and I know you've done a lot of work there and it's come up a few times on this call. It's an area of great interest for us. I think that you had mentioned -- you called out 2 areas in particular, I think, digital marketing and dynamic pricing and you said there was some others. But within the digital marketing, I think you pointed that marketing spend was down year-over-year for 10 straight quarters; and in dynamic pricing, that you reduced your standing inventory 17% without a negative margin impact. And I guess, I was curious as to when you take those 2, digital marketing and dynamic pricing, are those the metrics that you're primarily monitoring that you think are the most important for assessing the effectiveness of your programs there? Or is there -- are there other very important metrics that we should be thinking about as it relates to those 2? And you mentioned other initiatives outside of those 2.

You've clearly listened. Look, these initiatives are really core to what we're working on day-to-day inside the company. And your question is a good one. The answer is that those metrics are the starting metrics for those 2 initiatives, but they are not the only metrics for those 2 initiatives. There are other embedded metrics that we're working at. So relative to digital marketing, the very first thing was proving that we could improve our traffic, particularly the quality of traffic, put aside the quantity for a minute, but the quality of traffic while reducing the spend. So it was really, can we cut the spend by 50 basis points while we improve the quality of the traffic and continue to grow our business? And that was the beginning metric. But as we become more proficient at digital marketing and as we can expand the flow of qualified traffic, I highlighted 100,000 customers -- qualified customers coming through the doors driven by social media and Internet marketing. As we can expand the number coming through the doors, we're probably going to be able to see greater pricing power and other efficiencies as well. And I'm not going to go through and start articulating those metrics, but we think there's more firepower in the digital marketing strategy, and we are very focused on that on a regular basis. Likewise, with the dynamic pricing tool, what you're seeing in a reduction in standing inventory is a starter, but the ability to sell homes that are not standing inventory at the end of quarters helps alleviate the need to use discounting mechanisms or incentives to move that inventory. And so as we move forward with those digital tools or technology tools, we think that there's more firepower in them. But we have a whole host of initiatives that we're working on that we don't articulate because we're simply not getting out of our skis, but we are telling you that we're working on these things every day and we are committed and think we will build a better mousetrap.
And do want to say thank you to everybody for joining us. We look forward to keeping you updated as we move through the rest of 2017. Thank you."

And we also have Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto here; and Eric Feder from the Rialto group. Jon Jaffee, our Chief Operating Officer is also with us by phone from California and will participate in the Q&A portion. 
As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview. Bruce will deliver further detail. [Operator Instructions]
So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we're very pleased to announce a very strong earnings for the second quarter with strong and balanced results being reported by each of our operating segments. While in our first quarter, we noted that the somewhat sluggish overhang from the end of 2016 had negatively impacted margins, and therefore, our operating results, we felt that the market was improving as sales picked up throughout the first quarter. We anticipated that the spring selling season would be solid and that we would, in fact, see improved results as the year progress. These are exactly the conditions that drove our results for the second quarter.
We've continued to see strength in the housing market through the second quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins exceed our initial expectations. Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market. There continues to be a perception that jobs are being created across the country and that wages are generally moving positively. The often-discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into a sense that many job sector's compensation is moving up. And while much of the data collected by the government doesn't seem to reflect significant wage growth, the customers visiting our welcome home centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment.
There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that a governmental pro-business environment will result in at least job security and possibly some tax relief as well. Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the sense that we have, as business operators, that the economic environment in general is strong and stable and improving. The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery continues to seem to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal. We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years are now intersecting with land and labor shortage. And we started to see some pricing power as we moved through the selling season, somewhat offset, however, by construction cost increases.
Additionally, the economic realities of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic reality of higher rental rates are beginning to have a rational impact on decision-making for the first-time homebuyer as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market. Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, we are expecting that each of our business segment will continue to grow, to mature and to improve as we enter the back half of the year.
Against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. To begin, our for-sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017. Deliveries for the first quarter increased 15% and our gross and net margins improved 40 basis points and 130 basis points sequentially. In the second quarter, new orders were up approximately 12% year-over-year, driven by a higher sales pace of 4 homes per community per month versus 3.9 last year, combined with a community count growth of some 6%. Interestingly, our strongest markets, Portland, Seattle, Inland Empire, Coastal California, the Bay Area, Tampa and Southeast Florida, all had a sales pace of over 5 homes per community per month. 
We continue to gain stronger results, powered by our focused strategy on driving better quality traffic through our digital marketing efforts. Today, our social media outreach generates Internet leads that now surpass 100,000 per quarter, and that is driving our marketing and advertising spend, which is now down year-over-year for the -- for 10 consecutive quarters. We continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency, and we're continuing to focus on improving from here.
Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool. This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently. We saw the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during this quarter as we exceeded home delivery expectations by reducing our completed unsold inventory by 17% without sacrificing margin. As you've heard from us in prior quarters, we're using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model. Fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives as well, we continue to focus on overall operational efficiency, driving our SG&A to historic lows for our first quarter and now for our second quarter as well. We're simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time.
In addition, we closed on the WCI acquisition in the first quarter and the integration, which is being guided by Rick Beckwitt and his team led by Fred Rothman and Darin McMurray, is progressing exactly as planned. WCI will continue to contribute to earnings as expected as purchase accounting and nonrecurring costs dissipate and as cost benefit and SG&A savings accumulate.
Overall, our core homebuilding strategy remains to pivot our land strategy towards shorter-term land acquisitions and to maintain a 7% to 10% growth rate for the company while we enhance our operating platform by reducing SG&A. Parenthetically, given the WCI addition, our 2017 growth rate should be on the higher side or a little bit over our goal for the year. Additionally, we have focused on expanding our first-time homebuyer offering with our mix now standing right at around 40%.  Combined, these strategies -- these strategic elements will produce very strong cash flow for the company and will result in continued balance sheet improvement.
Let me turn briefly to our Financial Services segment. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well in the second quarter as it contributed operating earnings of almost $44 million. Of course, the business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and with the addition of the WCI acquisition. As the refi business has diminished over the past year, Lennar Financial Services is continuing to expand its non-Lennar business reach and bottom line to replace those earnings. Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in just a few minutes.
LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, our multifamily apartment segment, has continued to grow and exceed expectations. LMC generated $6.5 million of earnings in the second quarter driven by the sale of one of our merchant build apartment communities. While we have continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we also have grown LMV, our build-to-core program, which is cash flow focused on building and apartment portfolio. In the second quarter, we started 1,140 apartment homes in 4 communities with a total development cost of approximately $520 million. As of May 31, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 76 communities, totaling approximately 23,600 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.2 billion. These included 37 merchant build communities, totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion and 39 LMV build-to-core communities totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $4.1 billion. Our Multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations.
Turning to Rialto. Rialto contributed $6.2 million to the bottom line this quarter versus a loss year ago. Rialto's investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base as well as harvest value for investors and for us. Our first 2 flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers. We're also pleased that our third opportunistic fund held its final closing with approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments and it has already invested or has under contract 33 transactions, involving the investment of over $600 million of equity. And to complement our opportunistic funds, we also have over $1.1 billion of investor equity dedicated to investment-grade CMBS, mezzanine and transitional lending, which we also will be looking to grow this year.
On the Rialto Mortgage Finance side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF, which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable nonbank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 39th and 40th securitization transactions during this quarter with net margins averaging 5.8%, selling over $392 million of RMF originated loans. Our direct investments should be winding down over the next quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into our higher returning businesses. Going forward from that point, our focus will be solely on our investment management and RMF business segments there. 
Finally, FivePoint successfully completed its IPO this quarter and now enters the public market as a pure-play California master planned community developer. We expected over time the value embedded in the FivePoint management team and its extraordinary asset base will be realized as the appreciation cycle of these extremely well-located communities will be revealed through transparency and public filings. Certainly, from a Lennar perspective, the new stock symbol, FPH, will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet. 
Finally, in conclusion, across the platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our second quarter, and we're feeling very optimistic about the remainder of the year. We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across the platform on the strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market in the near feature. Each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform in strengthening market conditions. People, assets and operations are all aligned to perform in 2017, and we look forward to keeping you updated. 
So with that, let me turn over for greater detail to Bruce."
30763,433559551,1232201,"Lennar Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 20, 2017",2017-06-20,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $213.6 million or $0.91 per diluted share and this compares to second quarter 2016 net earnings of $218.5 million or $0.95 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.02 p",1592,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $213.6 million or $0.91 per diluted share and this compares to second quarter 2016 net earnings of $218.5 million or $0.95 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.02 per diluted share impact due to a lower 32.2% tax rate as a result of energy credits available in the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 18% in the second quarter, driven by a 15% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% increase in average selling price to $374,000.
As Stuart highlighted, our homebuilding team used our new technologies and a strong sales season to focus on selling deliverable inventory. This resulted in a significant increase in our expected backlog conversion ratio to 86% for the quarter. Additionally, our completed unsold home inventory dropped by 224 homes or 17% sequentially from the first quarter. This focus on deliverable inventory resulted in an acceleration of home deliveries that were previously expected in our third quarter. WCI contributed 388 deliveries to the quarter and that was about 70 more than were expected.
Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 21.5%. We are on track with our previously stated goal of 22% to 22.5% gross margins for the full year. The prior year's gross margin was 23.1% and the decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased lands and construction costs. Our gross margin percentage was impacted 20 basis points due to the write-off of WCI backlog inventory that closed during the quarter. Sales incentives year-over-year were consistent at 5.7% but improved sequentially by 20 basis points from our first quarter. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our homebuilding east segment. Direct construction costs were up 5% year-over-year to approximately $55 per square foot, driven by an approximate 7% increase in labor and 4% in material costs, driven primarily by lumber. 
Our SG&A percent in the second quarter was consistent with the prior year at 9.3%, which was a record low. We are continuing to improve SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in existing homebuilding divisions and benefiting from our focus on our technology investments through the company. Included in our SG&A for the second quarter were transaction-related expenses [ due ] to the WCI acquisition, which had a 20 basis point impact.
Other income net was $3.8 million compared to $13.7 million in the prior year. In the prior year, we did have a profit participation from one of our homebuilding consolidated joint ventures that drove most of that profit. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $21.5 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incur general and administrative expenses while ramping up for future land sales. We opened 86 new communities during the quarter and closed 102 communities to end the quarter with 736 net active communities. We continued with our soft pivot strategy as we purchased only 7,500 homesites, totaling $371 million in the second quarter. And our homesite count, owned and controlled, now totals 167,000, of which 136,000 are owned and 31,000 are controlled.
Our Financial Services business had strong results with operating earnings of $43.7 million compared to $44.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income decreased slightly to $32 million from $36.8 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were $2.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year. Refinance volume was down 48% compared to the prior year, leading to a more competitive origination environment. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 80% compared to 83% in the prior year. Our title company's profit increased to $9.7 million during the quarter from $7.4 million in the prior year, driven by an 8% increase in revenue and operating leverage from these higher revenues. And then our new Florida Realty brokerage operation acquired from WCI generated $2.2 million of profit during the quarter. The spring selling season quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year for this business.
More detail on Rialto. This segment produced $6.2 million compared to last year's loss of $13.8 million, both years are net of noncontrolling interests. The investment management business contributed $42 million of net earnings, which included $5.8 million of equity in earnings from the real estate funds and $36.3 million of management fees and other, which includes $11 million of carried interest distributions. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund I and II now totals $119 million. 
Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $392 million of commercial loans into 2 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $15.6 million compared with $386 million and $12.7 million in the prior year, respectively. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the average net margins and [ with ] securitizations from 3.6% in the prior year to 4.2% in the current year.
Our direct investments had a loss of $13 million as we continue to focus on monetizing the remaining assets from the early portfolio purchases. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $32.1 million for the quarter and interest expense was $6.3 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $120 million of cash. The Multifamily segment delivered a $6.5 million operating profit during the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $11.4 million share of gains from the 1 operating property that was sold as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 33.8%, which included a favorable resolution with the IRS. The rate is higher than the prior year's rate of 32.2% due to the energy credits in the prior year, and we expect the tax rate to be approximately 34% for the remainder of this year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to total capital of 40.7%, a decline of 280 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with $748 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. This facility was amended during the quarter to extend out to 5 years and to increase the commitments to $2 billion, which includes a $400 million accordion feature.
During the quarter, we retired our 12.25% senior note maturity of $400 million, which was due June 1, with the proceeds from our new issuance of $650 million, a 4.5% 7-year senior notes. This results in an annual net cash interest savings of $31 million per year. We intend to use the balance of the proceeds to redeem the 6.875% senior notes that were acquired with the WCI transaction. This redemption will likely occur at the next call date in August. Stockholders' equity increased to $7.3 billion and our book value per share grew to $31.23 per share.
Now I would like to update our goals for 2017. We are right on track to deliver between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. Given that we accelerated closings from Q3 into Q2, there is a smaller population of homes available for delivery in Q3, and therefore, we expect the backlog conversion ratio to be similar to the 2016 second half conversion ratios, which was 75% for the third quarter and close to 90% for the fourth quarter. We are increasing our average sales price guidance to between $370,000 and $375,000 for the year. We are still on track to hit our expected operating margins of around 13% for the full year.
The full year gross margin is still expected to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. We expect our third quarter gross margin percentage to be between 21.75% and 22%. We still expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line to be between 9.1% and 9.3% for the full year. The third quarter will have some nonrecurring transition costs relating to the WCI transaction. And therefore, we expect SG&A to be approximately 9.3% again in the third quarter. The fourth quarter, however, should realize the largest leverage given our higher expected volume for the fourth quarter.
Financial Services, despite a large decline in refis, we are on track with our Financial Services goal of $160 million for the year with the third quarter expected to be $45 million to $50 million.
Turning to Rialto. Rialto is now expected to generate profits of approximately $30 million for the year with the third quarter expected to be in a range of $3 million to $5 million.
Multifamily is still on track to be between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. The third quarter is expected to be approximately $5 million of that number.
And joint ventures, land sales and other income, as we look at this combined category, we still expect a range of $70 million to $80 million of profit for the full year. The third quarter is expected to be profitable in the range of 0 to $5 million and the fourth quarter will generate the bulk of the profits in this category.
Corporate G&A is on track to still be 2.2% to 2.3% of total company revenues for the year and our community count is still expected to be approximately 770 to 780 communities.
The balance sheet is well positioned to end the year with strong liquidity and similar leverage as 2016. So as you can see, we are well positioned to achieve our goals for the remainder of 2017.
So with that, let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

Because you guys have made great strides in a short amount of time, it seems like all levers are working in the business. Can you get a better net margin in, say, the next 18 months or 2 years due to the fact that you got favorable operating leverage, the pricing environment seems benign if not outright positive and you're doing a great job of leveraging the cost structure?

We are articulating our successes relative to digital marketing and now dynamic pricing because we can point to some tangible effects that people can latch on to. But this is a big strategic initiative within the company. We feel that we're at the very early stages, very early innings of what I said in my comments, building a better mousetrap. We think that there's a lot more leverage. I think it derives from a lot of smaller initiatives adding up over time. And as they become more provable, we'll start to put them on the table. I don't want to start getting out over my skis or creating false optimism. It has been done before. But as we prove these up, we're talking about them a little bit more. I think that many know -- many people know that this is a very big strategic focus for the company, and we think that we can produce a lot of operating leverage and bring our operating margins up. I don't want to quantify it, but we don't think it's tens of basis points. We think it's much bigger than that and it will be over time."

You've heard us talk a lot about LMC, our multifamily apartment rental program. That program, as we move through our merchant build assets and migrate towards our build-to-core strategy, this sets up an opportunity for us to maintain the strategy within the company if it strategically makes sense as a core asset or to do some kind of alternative transaction, and that can very well happen over the next couple of years. On the Rialto's side, you've seen the buildup of our investment management business. You've seen the buildup and execution around Rialto Mortgage Finance. And you're seeing a very focused strategy on liquidating our core holdings, our assets that -- where we invested Rialto capital, so that we're going to reduce the business to just those 2 core business lines of RMF and investment management.

It's animal spirits. It's the notion that all of this is an inexact science. Interest rates and affordability and wages and pricing all play a part in what people can afford and how the math actually works out. But the confidence that people bring with them to the table about whether their job is stable and whether there's going to be a wage increase or there's opportunity for them to move and be mobile to the next job opportunity, whether they've been able to accumulate a down payment or in excess of a down payment or whether there are family members that are able to help support with a gift or something else, all of these are moving parts that define this inexact science that we're all trying to kind of divine going forward. So it's kind of hard to wrap all of our heads around where the market is going. But the general trajectory is positive. And even at the first-time buyer level, as the millennials start to unwind, they're doubling up and come to the market realizing that rental rates have gone up and there's a real reason to go ahead and purchase, that first-time buyer segment is showing some optimism and some ability to be flexible in and around the affordability levels and as prices move up.

I think that you had mentioned -- you called out 2 areas in particular, I think, digital marketing and dynamic pricing and you said there was some others. But within the digital marketing, I think you pointed that marketing spend was down year-over-year for 10 straight quarters; and in dynamic pricing, that you reduced your standing inventory 17% without a negative margin impact. And I guess, I was curious as to when you take those 2, digital marketing and dynamic pricing, are those the metrics that you're primarily monitoring that you think are the most important for assessing the effectiveness of your programs there? Or is there -- are there other very important metrics that we should be thinking about as it relates to those 2? And you mentioned other initiatives outside of those 2. Are there any general areas of -- that hold the most promise that you think that we could be focused on?"

You've clearly listened. Look, these initiatives are really core to what we're working on day-to-day inside the company. And your question is a good one. The answer is that those metrics are the starting metrics for those 2 initiatives, but they are not the only metrics for those 2 initiatives. There are other embedded metrics that we're working at. So relative to digital marketing, the very first thing was proving that we could improve our traffic, particularly the quality of traffic, put aside the quantity for a minute, but the quality of traffic while reducing the spend. So it was really, can we cut the spend by 50 basis points while we improve the quality of the traffic and continue to grow our business? And that was the beginning metric. But as we become more proficient at digital marketing and as we can expand the flow of qualified traffic, I highlighted 100,000 customers -- qualified customers coming through the doors driven by social media and Internet marketing. As we can expand the number coming through the doors, we're probably going to be able to see greater pricing power and other efficiencies as well. And I'm not going to go through and start articulating those metrics, but we think there's more firepower in the digital marketing strategy, and we are very focused on that on a regular basis. Likewise, with the dynamic pricing tool, what you're seeing in a reduction in standing inventory is a starter, but the ability to sell homes that are not standing inventory at the end of quarters helps alleviate the need to use discounting mechanisms or incentives to move that inventory. And so as we move forward with those digital tools or technology tools, we think that there's more firepower in them. But we have a whole host of initiatives that we're working on that we don't articulate because we're simply not getting out of our skis, but we are telling you that we're working on these things every day and we are committed and think we will build a better mousetrap.
And do want to say thank you to everybody for joining us. We look forward to keeping you updated as we move through the rest of 2017. Thank you."

As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview, Bruce will deliver further detail. [Operator Instructions] 
So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we are very pleased to announce a very healthy earnings for our third quarter in spite of the active hurricane season that's affected our business at the end of the third quarter and carried into the fourth. And in fact, let me begin today with an acknowledgment of the many, across our platform, who have been affected by adversity. 
First, in our Texas markets, Hurricane Harvey affected all of our markets and especially, of course, Houston. And I want to thank the Lennar associates who responded and continue to respond so selflessly to care and assess with their time, with their wallets and with company funds to make a difference in the aftermath. Right now, it seems like this storm took place almost years ago, but it was really only just last month and the continuing efforts are very much appreciated. 
Next, Hurricane Irma came barreling through Florida, through Georgia and up the Eastern Seaboard and affected millions of people in those areas. Again, Lennar associates responded and are still responding with their hearts, their wallets, as is the company and this is greatly appreciated. Additionally, with Hurricane Maria, our hearts go out to the people of Puerto Rico and our company through the Lennar Foundation is meaningfully contributing there as well. And then of course, just yesterday, we all woke up to the tragedy that has gripped Las Vegas, another significant Lennar market. The ripple effect of the Las Vegas shootings affects us all, but most impacts those closest to it. And again, Lennar associates are activated and have already organized the blood drive internally and are contributing money to support grief counseling for those in need. 
Difficult circumstances call on great companies to properly balance excellent business practices with the human element. And I am particularly proud to say that I believe that we have done exactly that at Lennar and I'm very proud to be able to represent our efforts. 
Against that backdrop, let me say that through the end of the third quarter and into the fourth, we've been able to execute on our business plan and strategy of growing and refining our business while focusing on our balance sheet after paying all cash for our WCI acquisition at the beginning of the year. Overall, we've continued to see strength in the housing market through the third quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins continue to be in line with or above our expectations. Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market as jobs are being created across the country and wages are generally moving higher. 
The often discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into wage growth. And while much of the data collected by the government doesn't seem to reflect significant wage growth, the customers visiting our Welcome Home Centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment and an ability to afford today's more expensive homes. Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the same sense that we have as business operators that the economic environment is generally strong and stable and improving. There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that the government's pro-business stance will result at least in job security and possibly some tax relief as well. 
The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery is at least continuing to turn slowly, while at some times even seems to be giving way to more definitive accelerated recovery and reversion to normal. We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years have been and continue to drive some pricing power as we move through the selling season, as we moved through the selling season, and that is somewhat offset by land and construction cost increases. 
Additionally, the economic realities of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic realities of higher rental rates are beginning to have and have had a rational impact on decision-making for first-time homebuyers as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market. Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market. And as we look ahead to the final quarter of 2017 and into '18, we are expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve. 
Now against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our business -- operating business segments. To begin, our for-sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017 in spite of the storm activity described before. Deliveries for the third quarter increased 12% and our gross margins and net margins improved 20 the basis points and 40 basis points year-over-year. In the third quarter, new orders -- new order increases of 8% in volume and 12% in revenues was driven by year-over-year community count growth of 9%, while our new order pace remained constant at 3.4 homes per community per month. Our strongest markets were Southeast Florida, the Bay Area, Inland Empire and Portland, all with sales pace of over 5 homes per community per month followed by Orlando, Tampa, California Coastal, Fresno and Seattle, all with over 4 homes per community per month. 
We continue to see success with our digital marketing focus, driving better quality traffic to our communities. In our third quarter, our social media outreach generated over 115,000 leads, a 15% year-over-year increase. This allows us to operate at a very efficient level where our total advertising spend is now down to only 40 basis points of our revenue. Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool. This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of the deliverable inventory, so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently. We continue to see the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during the third quarter as we reduced our completed unsold inventory by 9% year-over-year and 21% sequentially without sacrificing margin. Additionally and directly related, we have also seen our incentives per home delivered decreased to 5.5% across the platform, which is our lowest sales incentive since 2006. 
As you've heard from us in prior quarters, we are using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model. Fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives as well, we continue to focus on overall operational efficiency, driving our SG&A to historic lows of 9.2% for the third quarter, which is the lowest in history. As I've said before, we are simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time. 
As I'm sure you will recall, we closed of the WCI transaction the first quarter of this year. This integration -- the integration of this acquisition has been executed seamlessly by Lennar's operating teams in the field and by our corporate support groups as well. With any combination, the hard work begins at closing, after all the fanfare, the real congratulations are due as results are achieved. The WCI combination and integration is now complete and the results are coming in exactly as expected, as Lennar's margins, SG&A and bottom line are performing as promised. We simply have an excellent management team with tremendous bandwidth to execute and I'd like to take a brief pause to express my appreciation for that hard work and focus as well and for the opportunity to represent their work and accomplishment to our investor community. 
In addition, as I noted earlier, we came to the end of the third quarter, Hurricane Harvey came through in Texas and that was followed by Irma at the beginning of the fourth quarter. For Homebuilders and Homebuilding divisions on the business side, these storms present many cumbersome challenges, whether the storm is a direct hit or a near miss. Preparation for these storms requires a shutdown of the business operations with extensive preparation to batten down the hatches, so to speak. Associates need to care for their work environments and for their personal residents and families at the same time. After the storm, caring for our associates who might have been affected while surveying damage, attending to our customers in resorting business operation is equally difficult. 
As we noted in our recent press release, we have come through these 2 hurricanes quite well. We have attempted to our associates, we have assessed the damage to our communities, we have attended to our customers and have restarted business operations. As we've said, our community sustained only minor damage and due to the business disruption, we expect approximately 950 closings will be pushed from 2017 into 2018. Addition -- additionally, given the volume push into 2018, the positive trajectory of our margins will be temporarily impacted as well and Bruce will give some additional detail. 
With that said, the Lennar team has done an excellent job of managing through difficult times as these hurricanes affected geographies, representing some 50% of our volume by closing. Considering both the all-cash acquisition of WCI and the effect of the 2 hurricanes, we are pleased to report that we've continued to focus on cash flow and on our balance sheet, we have maintained our 7% to 10% growth target and have focused on driving our operating cost down in order to drive bottom line and cash flow. These strategies have brought our balance sheet back to the position of a year ago with our debt to total cap at 39.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year. While the impact of the hurricanes will delay some of this progress over the next quarter, our strategy continues today to drive strong cash flow and position our company for opportunity in the future. 
Now let me briefly turn to our Financial Services segment. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform row in the third quarter as it contributed operating earnings of over $49 million. While profits and projections are down slightly from last year, the decrease is primarily due to storm impacts and the slowdown in the refi business. Our core Financial Services business is growing in lockstep with our Homebuilding operations and is innovating with new products like our recently announced Creative Student Loan program. As the refi business has diminished over the past year, Lennar Financial Services continues to focus on product innovations as well as it's non-Lennar retail business to replace those earnings. Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in just a few minutes. 
LMC, Lennar's multifamily communities, our apartment segment, has also continued to grow and exceed expectations. LMC generated $9.1 million of earnings in the third quarter, driven by the sale of 2 of our merchant field apartment communities. While we continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we've also significantly grown LMV, our build-to-core program, which is cash flow focused on building an apartment portfolio. In the third quarter, we started 836 apartment homes in 3 communities with a total development cost of $371 million. As of August 31, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 75 communities, totaling approximately 23,700 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.3 billion. These include 36 merchant build communities totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.2 billion and 39 LMV build-to-core communities, totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with the total development cost of $4.1 billion. 
Our Multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations. 
Turning to Rialto. Rialto contributed $3.2 million to the bottom line this quarter versus $5.9 million a year ago as our direct investments continued to be a drag on overall performance. These direct investments should be winding down over the next 2 quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into our higher returning businesses. This will enable us to efficiently lever our existing infrastructure and overhead and focus on our investment management business and RMF business segment. The investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base. As we've said before, our first 2 flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers, which has helped Rialto attract both existing and new investors to newer vehicles. Our third opportunity fund, which is approximately $1.9 billion in total commitment, has already invested or has under contract 43 transactions, involving the investment over $815 million of that equity. 
On the Rialto Mortgage Finance, RMF side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF, which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable non-bank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 41st through 43rd securitization transactions during the quarter with net margins averaging 5.1%, selling over $236 million of RMF originated loans. 
Finally, just to mention FivePoint, because I always have, as you all know, it's now an independent public company. Accordingly, the FivePoint management team will speak regularly for its asset base, including the very positive news recently on progress at new home Ranch. As I've said before, from a Lennar perspective, the new stock symbol, FPH, will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet as the value embedded in these extraordinary California assets is unlocked. 
In conclusion, across our platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our third quarter and we're feeling very optimistic about our future. Given production deficits that persist, existing housing supply constraints, a pro-growth stance in government, a generally solid employment fundamentals, we believe that the macro environment reads very positively for the next years and there is still a long runway in this recovery. We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market for the future. In spite of the short-term speed bumps that will temporarily slow progress in the fourth quarter, each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform is strengthened. People, assets and operations or all aligned as we begin to prepare for 2018. And with that, let me turn it over to Bruce."
30763,537530007,1309046,"Lennar Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 03, 2017",2017-10-03,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the third quarter were $249.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share. This compares to third quarter of 2016 net earnings of $235.8 million or $1.01 per share, which included a favorable $0.03 per diluted",1434,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the third quarter were $249.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share. This compares to third quarter of 2016 net earnings of $235.8 million or $1.01 per share, which included a favorable $0.03 per diluted share impact due to a lower 31.1% tax rate as a result of energy credits available in the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the third quarter, driven by 12% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 4% increase in average selling price to $375,000. As Stuart highlighted, our Homebuilding team is focused on the dynamic pricing tool to price and deliver more efficiently and it is reflected in our results. Our delivery machine achieved a backlog conversion ratio of 74.5%, while our completed unsold inventory dropped by 233 homes or 21% sequentially to the lowest level per community since 2012. 
Our pricing efficiency is also noted as our sales incentives dropped 40 basis points year-over-year to 5.5%, which is an 11-year low and drove our gross margin outperformance. Our gross margin on home sales in the third quarter was 22.8% versus 22.6% in the prior year. Gross margin percents were once again its highest in our Homebuilding east segment. The gross margin percentage was benefited by 30 basis points this quarter due to insurance recoveries. Direct construction costs were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $56 per square foot, driven by an approximate 5% increase in labor and 3% in material costs. Our SG&A percentage continues to drive lower as Q3 was 9.2% compared to 9.3% in the prior year. Included in our SG&A in the third quarter were transaction-related expenses related to the WCI acquisition, which had a 20 basis point impact, but were offset by insurance recoveries. 
Our operating margin improved by 40 basis points for the quarter to 13.6%. Other income net was $2.8 million compared to $30 million in the prior period. In the prior period, other income net included the sale of clubhouse and management fee income from one of our strategic joint ventures. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $9.7 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incur G&A while ramping up for future land sales. We opened 108 new communities during the quarter and closed 86 to end the quarter with 758 net active communities. 
New homeowners increased 8% and new order dollar value increased 14% for the quarter. And as we disclosed a few weeks ago, there were approximately 120 new homeowners that were impacted due to Hurricane Harvey. Our sales pace was 3.4 sales per community per month, which was the same as the prior year. During the quarter, we purchased 12,700 homesites, totaling $498 million. We continue with our soft vivid strategy, however, this quarter also included the strategic purchase of 5,800 homesites in Maryland. Our homesites owned and controlled now totaled 176,000 homesites, of which 141,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled. 
Our Financial Services business segment had operating earnings of $49.1 million compared to $53.2 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income decreased to $32.5 million from $38.3 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were $2.4 billion compared to $2.6 billion last year. Refinance volume was down 62% compared to the prior year, leading to a more competitive origination environment. Refinances now make up only 7% of our total originations. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 80% for the quarter compared to 82% in the prior year. Our title company's profit increased slightly to $15.6 million during the quarter from $15 million in the prior year and that was driven by a 6% increase in revenue and operating leverage from the higher revenues. 
Our Florida realty brokerage operation acquired from WCI generated $1.3 million profit during the quarter. Stuart provided the multifamily detail, so now I'll turn to Rialto. The Rialto segment produced operating earnings of $3.2 million compared to $5.9 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interests. The investment management business contributed $37 million of earnings, which includes $4.7 million equity in earnings from real estate funds and $32.3 million of management fees and other, which includes $11.4 million of carried interest distributions. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate fund 1 into now totals $108 million. 
Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $236 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $12.5 million compared with $491 million and $27.2 million in the prior year, respectively, and that's before the SG&A expenses. The decrease in earnings were primarily due to lower volume. Our direct investments had a loss of $9.4 million as we continue to make good progress on monetizing the remaining assets from the FDIC and early portfolio purchases. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $30.6 million for the quarter and interest expense including the warehouse lines was $6.3 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $155 million of cash. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 33.4%. The rate is higher than the prior year's third quarter of 31.1% due to the additional energy credits recognized in the prior year. These credits expired on December 31, 2016, and were only available to us for part of this year, therefore, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 34% for the fourth quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to total capital of 39.6%, a decline of 30 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with $565 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we redeemed early the $250 million of 6 and 7/8 senior notes that were acquired with the WCI transaction. We continued to significantly reduce our cost of capital as we improve our leverage ratio. S&P upgraded our corporate credit rating during the quarter to BB+. Stockholders equity increased to $7.6 billion and now our book value per share grew to $32.11 per share. 
Now I'd like to update our goals for closing out 2017, starting with deliveries. We were right on track to achieve a 90% backlog conversion ratio for the fourth quarter before the storms hit. Using the same backlog conversion ratio and adjusting for the 950 homes that we talked about being pushed into 2018, now calculates to between 8,200 and 8,300 deliveries, which is what we are now projecting for the fourth quarter. Based on the projected closings on our backlog, we are increasing our average sales price guidance to between $380,000 to $385,000 for the year. 
We expect our fourth quarter gross margin percentage to be between 22% and 22.25%. This should bring our full-year gross margin percentage to 22%. The fourth quarter gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points as a result of 950 deliveries being pushed into 2018, and therefore, a higher field expense for the remaining delivery. Additionally, these deliveries were primarily in Florida, which has the highest gross margin percentages in the company. We continue to see improvement in the SG&A line and we should see another record low SG&A percentage in the fourth quarter as we are projecting between 8.5% and 8.6%. 
Turning to Financial Services. As a result of the significant decline in refinances, lack of resale inventory and the storm impacts, our fourth quarter is now projected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million. Rialto is now expected to generate profits for the fourth quarter of $2 million to $5 million, which will bring it to about $25 million for the year. Multifamily is expected to be approximately $35 million to $37 million, which will bring it to approximately $70 million for the full year. 
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income in this category we've been highlighting all year that the fourth quarter will generate the bulk of the profits. The fourth quarter is expected to generate approximately $90 million to $95 million, which will bring the full year at the lower end of the previously range that we gave of $70 million to $80 million of profit. Corporate G&A is expected to be 2.1% of total revenues for the fourth quarter and our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities. We expect our balance sheet to again end the year with strong liquidity, positioning us well as we enter 2018. 
Let me now turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

I'm sure that John, who's really been spearheading the dynamic pricing and Rick would also want to join in. But look, dynamic pricing, our dynamic pricing model helps us in a number of ways and really helps us focus in order to drive margin and even ASP growth. Starts with a proper alignment of our production machine and our sales machine, recognizing that as we near completion, it's time to sell. That has really enabled us to bring down our incentives generally. And as I noted, our incentive levels have come down to the lowest level since 2006 at 5.5% and I feel that that's very directly tied to the initiatives in and around our dynamic pricing. Now another part of that is the driving of our inventory levels. We've seen a number of our divisions benefit in both generating pricing power and driving down incentives by being able to reduce standing inventory. Standing inventory homes are generally the ones that come with the greatest discounts or the greatest incentives and getting people to tuned into properly aligning pricing and delivery and clearing inventory earlier has helped that. So John, do you want to add to that?"

The efficient delivery of homes that Stuart is describing has really enabled by providing our division the data so that they can pull the right levers at the right time to match sales pace with construction pace. And as Stuart mentioned, the low inventory levels. Last quarter, we were down to 1.25 quarter homes per community on average. I don't have the data, that's a record low. But I don't personally remember that we're being that low. And by orderly selling the homes through the construction process, having a buyer who's mortgage approved, ready to close as the homes is completed really enables us to reduce the incentives, both helping ASP and margin. I also want to note that when we talk for several years about the impact of our next-gen platform and there, our sales are up 41% year-over-year and now represents just about 6% of our company's total sales. That's also a high mark for next-gen sales. And ASP of next-gen is almost $490,000 compared to the company average of $375,000. So it's a number of initiatives that cumulatively are giving us the results that we speak to."

And on the cost side of the equation, we're doing our best to hold our trades accountable for the type of cost pricing that we're looking for. Clearly in this environment, where you have people chasing the storm aftermath, there's some trades and some areas of the business that are tight and where people are going after the easy insurance money. Those are typically in the roofing, the drywall, the siding, depending on the market. That said, we constantly are adjusting sales pace with sales price. And the real tricky thing for us at this point is whether we want to really push the trades and pay them more than what the job should really justify in order to accelerate the home or do we take a little bit longer to deliver that home. All of this will work itself out in the next 3 to 6 months."

But stock buyback comes in a number of different forms. Remember that we had initially targeted WCI to be a 50-50 stock in cash transaction that ended up being an all cash transaction, which was in effect, a large stock buyback. It's fully integrated, it's well executed. And we're becoming a real cash flow program and machine, which affords us the ability to target transactions to use cash in a variety of ways. And we're fully confident that as we move forward, our strategies are going to reflect on our returns on equity and on capital, perhaps more importantly, in very positive and constructive way.

And naturally, what I wanted to spend my first question and there are couple of things here. So bear with me. You mentioned 50-basis-point impact. It wasn't clear to me weather there was a fourth quarter comment or an annual comment. And then you also mentioned that you were seeing some of your customers in Houston needing to repair their homes. And that sort of brings to mind this question of, what's the fate of the margin impact do you think ultimately may be. And I know you're not going to get specific until later, but I'm interested in sort of what things you are likely to put into that bucket of hurricane affected margin. For instance, when you have people who may have lost more equity than they anticipated in their home because it was flooded in Houston and then they drop out, if there's any cancelation that's been out of that, would that be something that would show up. If you have to pay extra for labor, are you going to try to quantify the amount you're paying extra for labor? Or is it simply going to be, we think maybe we lost some sales total and what impact do we think that has on our overhead at the project level. Can you help us think about how you're thinking about quantifying the hurricane-related effects on your margin?"

Steve, it's got take some time to actually some of this out. But overall, long term, given the loss of residences in a generally constrained market to begin with, you're more likely to see a supply shortage that as homes get repaired, there's really very little fade in terms of value and pricing. As homes get repaired, the value comes back and I think that you're going to see a shorter term negative turn into a longer-term positive. And that's traditionally what we've seen in storm-affected areas through many decades of having dealt with it. Takes a little bit of time for things to get back on their feet. And as we talked about the loss of or the postponement push of some closings from fourth quarter into 2018 and some directly related to homes to sell that has to be repaired and ultimately brought online, those homes will get repaired. They will be sold probably at the price that was expected with very little re-trade. And I don't think that, that will be the impact of margin, if anything, it will probably come around and lift the ability to raise prices maybe with some offset from cost on the labor and material front. But Bruce, go ahead."

We've only started to break the surface of some of these areas. And we are really invigorated by it. Both myself, Jon, Rick and our whole management team are really focused on this. And I would encourage you, at some point, to when you're down here, Steve, to come visit and make sure that you see our innovation center, which we've done on our third floor here. We are fully focused on thinking about how technologies can create efficiencies through our system in every part of our business. And we think that there's a long way to go. Your question, of course, is how much room is there to enhance SG&A or to bring SG&A down. And I can quantify that right now. But I think we've just started to figure out how to really build that better mousetrap that I keep talking about. Now you're next question is, to what extent is there a first mover example -- advantage. I'm not going to say of first mover advantage because I believe that others can learn and jump on board. But it's not about first mover advantage, it's about incorporating of these technologies, it's hard, hard work. It's hard work to learn and understand how they work and then to transport that knowledge out to multiple divisions in multiple geographies is a very complex management engagement. And it's something that we work on every day. So as you've watched the improvement of migrating from conventional to digital marketing, that seems like a kind of binary, oh, let's just make a movement, but it has come with a learning curve, a testing curve, a proven curve and then an implementation curve that is really difficult to overcome. So it's not a first mover advantage in a traditional sense, it's the sooner you start, the more time you put behind you in doing the hard work and the heavy lifting that it takes to actually implement these programs. So our work is not to run to get ahead of others, it's to move hard, work hard every single day to implement and to garner that 1, 2 or 10 basis points per week, per month, per quarter of improvement that we've been articulating as we've gone through the past years."

First question, Stuart, I wanted to circle back to the comments you had in your press release actually, and I believe he had this even in your initial prior release around estimations of impact and what you said in the release again, today was that you expect an increased demand in homes and this storm-related areas, which will result in a broader range of opportunities as we look towards 2018. So I just wanted to see if you could give a little more detail around that statement. From our perspective, when you think about the impact of the storms and I think you've alluded to this in previous questions, it seems like it's more around fixing existing homes, getting insurance recoveries, power related, et cetera. Certainly, there might be some incremental demand for new homes in terms of maybe people wanting to move out of a damaged home. But I just wanted to get a sense for, you said you've been through this before, what specifically -- is there an expectation in terms of maybe incremental new-home demand going up 5%, 10%, 15% in the respective states or is it more of a broader statement and when you say a broader range of opportunities, if there are certain specific types of initiatives or certain types of communities are pivoting or maybe for multifamily, what exactly do you mean by that?"

This can be tremendous capital invested in infrastructure that's going to create new jobs, that's going to create wage growth, that's going to allow people to just have more spend as they're looking at buying homes just in general. The second aspect of it is as you look at where the storms hit, particularly in Houston, let's just focus on Houston right now. There's going to be parts of the market where will shut down and will not allow homes to be built in those areas. As a result of that, for folks like us that have a lot of land in other parts of the market more the upland areas, that's going to create over time, just long-term fundamental demand. The other aspect of it and I put this sort of in both markets, the Florida markets and Houston markets, as you look at what happened with regard to the storms, the newer homes, the newer production, the newer construction fared so much better than the used home market, the existing market. And as a result of that, you're seeing a continued shift of people saying, I'd rather live in something that's going to weather the storm than be impacted by the storm again and again. But those are just a few aspects of the opportunities that exist out there that creates that longer-term fundamental demand in the aftermath of the storms."

As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview, Bruce will deliver further detail, and then we'll go to the Q&A portion. [Operator Instructions] 
So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we are very pleased to announce a very healthy earnings for our third quarter in spite of the active hurricane season that's affected our business at the end of the third quarter and carried into the fourth. And in fact, let me begin today with an acknowledgment of the many across our platform who have been affected by adversity. 
First, in our Texas markets, Hurricane Harvey affected all of our markets and especially, of course, Houston. And I want to thank the Lennar associates who responded and continue to respond so selflessly to care and assess with their time, with their wallets and with company funds to make a difference in the aftermath. Right now, it seems like this storm took place almost years ago, but it was really only just last month and the continuing efforts are very much appreciated. 
Next, Hurricane Irma came barreling through Florida, through Georgia and up the Eastern Seaboard and affected millions of people in those areas. Again, Lennar associates responded and are still responding with their hearts, their wallets, as is the company, and this is greatly appreciated. 
Additionally, with Hurricane Maria, our hearts go out to the people of Puerto Rico, and our company, through the Lennar Foundation, is meaningfully contributing there as well. 
And then of course, just yesterday, we all woke up to the tragedy that has gripped Las Vegas, another significant Lennar market. The ripple effect of the Las Vegas shootings affects us all, but most impacts those closest to it. And again, Lennar associates are activated and have already organized a blood drive internally and are contributing money to support grief counseling for those in need. 
Difficult circumstances call on great companies to properly balance excellent business practices with the human element. And I am particularly proud to say that I believe that we have done exactly that at Lennar, and I'm very proud to be able to represent our efforts. 
Against that backdrop, let me say that through the end of the third quarter and into the fourth, we've been able to execute on our business plan and strategy of growing and refining our business while focusing on our balance sheet after paying all cash for our WCI acquisition at the beginning of the year. Overall, we've continued to see strength in the housing market through the third quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins continue to be in line with or above our expectations. Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market as jobs are being created across the country and wages are generally moving higher. 
The often discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into wage growth. And while much of the data collected by the government doesn't seem to reflect significant wage growth, the customers visiting our Welcome Home Centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment and an ability to afford today's more expensive homes. 
Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the same sense that we have as business operators that the economic environment is generally strong and stable and improving. There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that the government's pro-business stance will result at least in job security and possibly some tax relief as well. 
The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery is at least continuing to churn slowly, while at some times even seems to be giving way to a more definitive accelerated recovery and reversion to normal. We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years have been and continue to drive some pricing power as we move through the selling season -- as we moved through the selling season, and that is somewhat offset by land and construction cost increases. 
Additionally, the economic realities of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic realities of higher rental rates are beginning to have and have had a rational impact on decision-making for first-time homebuyers as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market. Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market. And as we look ahead to the final quarter of 2017 and into '18, we are expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve. 
Now against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our business -- operating business segments. To begin, our for-sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017 in spite of the storm activity described before. Deliveries for the third quarter increased 12%, and our gross margin and net margins improved 20 the basis points and 40 basis points year-over-year. In the third quarter, new orders -- new order increases of 8% in volume and 12% in revenues was driven by year-over-year community count growth of 9%, while our new order pace remained constant at 3.4 homes per community per month. Our strongest markets were Southeast Florida, the Bay Area, Inland Empire and Portland, all with sales pace of over 5 homes per community per month, followed by Orlando, Tampa, California Coastal, Fresno and Seattle, all with over 4 homes per community per month. 
We continue to see success with our digital marketing focus, driving better quality traffic to our communities. In our third quarter, our social media outreach generated over 115,000 leads, a 15% year-over-year increase. This allows us to operate at a very efficient level where our total advertising spend is now down to only 40 basis points of our revenue. Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool. This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of the deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently. We continued to see the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during the third quarter as we reduced our completed unsold inventory by 9% year-over-year and 21% sequentially without sacrificing margin. Additionally and directly related, we have also seen our incentives per home delivered decrease to 5.5% across the platform, which is our lowest sales incentive since 2006. 
As you've heard from us in prior quarters, we are using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model. Fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tools and other technology initiatives as well, we continue to focus on overall operational efficiency, driving our SG&A to historic lows of 9.2% for the third quarter, which is the lowest in history. As I've said before, we are simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time. 
As I'm sure you will recall, we closed on the WCI transaction in the first quarter of this year. This integration -- the integration of this acquisition has been executed seamlessly by Lennar's operating teams in the field and by our corporate support groups as well. With any combination, the hard work begins at closing. After all the fanfare, the real congratulations are due as results are achieved. The WCI combination and integration is now complete and the results are coming in exactly as expected as Lennar's margins, SG&A and bottom line are performing as promised. We simply have an excellent management team with tremendous bandwidth to execute, and I'd like to take a brief pause to express my appreciation for that hard work and focus as well and for the opportunity to represent their work and accomplishment to our investor community. 
In addition, as I noted earlier, we came to the end of the third quarter, Hurricane Harvey came through in Texas and that was followed by Irma at the beginning of the fourth quarter. For homebuilders and homebuilding divisions on the business side, these storms present many cumbersome challenges, whether the storm is a direct hit or a near miss. Preparation for these storms requires a shutdown of the business operations with extensive preparation to batten down the hatches, so to speak. Associates need to care for their work environments and for their personal residents and families at the same time. After the storm, caring for our associates who might have been affected while surveying damage, attending to our customers and restarting business operation is equally difficult. 
As we noted in our recent press release, we have come through these 2 hurricanes quite well. We have attended to our associates, we have assessed the damage to our communities, we have attended to our customers and have restarted business operations. As we've said, our community sustained only minor damage, and due to the business disruption, we expect approximately 950 closings will be pushed from 2017 into 2018. Additionally, given the volume push into 2018, the positive trajectory of our margins will be temporarily impacted as well and Bruce will give some additional detail. 
With that said, the Lennar team has done an excellent job of managing through difficult times as these hurricanes affected geographies, representing some 50% of our volume by closing. Considering both the all-cash acquisition of WCI and the effect of the 2 hurricanes, we are pleased to report that we've continued to focus on cash flow and on our balance sheet, we have maintained our 7% to 10% growth target and have focused on driving our operating cost down in order to drive bottom line and cash flow. These strategies have brought our balance sheet back to the position of a year ago with our debt to total cap at 39.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year. While the impact of the hurricanes will delay some of this progress over the next quarter, our strategy continues to be to drive strong cash flow and position our company for opportunity in the future. 
Now let me briefly turn to our Financial Services segment. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well in the third quarter as it contributed operating earnings of over $49 million. While profits and projections are down slightly from last year, the decrease is primarily due to storm impacts and the slowdown in the refi business. Our core Financial Services business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and is innovating with new products like our recently announced creative student loan program. As the refi business has diminished over the past year, Lennar Financial Services continues to focus on product innovations as well as it's non-Lennar retail business to replace those earnings. Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in just a few minutes. 
LMC, Lennar's Multifamily Communities, our apartment segment, has also continued to grow and exceed expectations. LMC generated $9.1 million of earnings in the third quarter, driven by the sale of 2 of our merchant build apartment communities. While we continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we've also significantly grown LMV, our build to core program, which is cash flow-focused on building an apartment portfolio. In the third quarter, we started 836 apartment homes in 3 communities with a total development cost of $371 million. As of August 31, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 75 communities, totaling approximately 23,700 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.3 billion. These include 36 merchant build communities totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.2 billion and 39 LMV build-to-core communities, totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion. 
Our Multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations. 
Turning to Rialto. Rialto contributed $3.2 million to the bottom line this quarter versus $5.9 million a year ago as our direct investments continued to be a drag on overall performance. These direct investments should be winding down over the next 2 quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into our higher returning businesses. This will enable us to efficiently lever our existing infrastructure and overhead and focus on our investment management business and RMF business segment. The investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base. As we've said before, our first 2 flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers, which has helped Rialto attract both existing and new investors to newer vehicles. Our third opportunity fund, which is approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments, has already invested or has under contract 43 transactions, involving the investment of over [ $850 ] million of that equity. 
On the Rialto Mortgage Finance, RMF side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF, which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable non-bank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 41st through 43rd securitization transactions during the quarter with net margins averaging 5.1%, selling over $236 million of RMF originated loans. 
Finally, just to mention FivePoint, because I always have, as you all know, it's now an independent public company. Accordingly, the FivePoint management team will speak regularly for its asset base, including the very positive news recently on progress at Newhall Ranch. As I've said before, from a Lennar perspective, the new stock symbol, FPH, will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet as the value embedded in these extraordinary California assets is unlocked. 
In conclusion, across our platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our third quarter and we're feeling very optimistic about our future. Given production deficits that persist, existing housing supply constraints, a pro-growth stance in government, a generally solid -- and generally solid employment fundamentals, we believe that the macro environment reads very positively for the next years and there is still a long runway in this recovery. We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market for the future. In spite of the short-term speed bumps that will temporarily slow progress in the fourth quarter, each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform and strengthened. People, assets and operations are all aligned as we begin to prepare for 2018. And with that, let me turn it over to Bruce."
30763,537530007,1309187,"Lennar Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 03, 2017",2017-10-03,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the third quarter were $249.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share. This compared to third quarter of 2016 net earnings of $235.8 million or $1.01 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.03 per",1439,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the third quarter were $249.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share. This compared to third quarter of 2016 net earnings of $235.8 million or $1.01 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.03 per diluted share impact due to a lower 31.1% tax rate as a result of energy credits available in the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the third quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 4% increase in average selling price to $375,000. As Stuart highlighted, our homebuilding team has focused on the dynamic pricing tool to price and deliver more efficiently and it is reflected in our results. Our delivery machine achieved a backlog conversion ratio of 74.5%, while our completed unsold inventory dropped by 233 homes or 21% sequentially to the lowest level per community since 2012. 
Our pricing efficiency is also noted as our sales incentives dropped 40 basis points year-over-year to 5.5%, which is an 11-year low and drove our gross margin outperformance. Our gross margin on home sales in the third quarter was 22.8% versus 22.6% in the prior year. Gross margin percents were once again its highest in our homebuilding east segment. The gross margin percentage was benefited by 30 basis points this quarter due to insurance recoveries. Direct construction costs were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $56 per square foot, driven by an approximate 5% increase in labor and 3% in material costs. Our SG&A percentage continues to drive lower as Q3 was 9.2% compared to 9.3% in the prior year. Included in our SG&A in the third quarter were transaction-related expenses related to the WCI acquisition, which had a 20 basis point impact, but were offset by insurance recoveries. 
Our operating margin improved by 40 basis points for the quarter to 13.6%. Other income net was $2.8 million compared to $30 million in the prior period. In the prior period, other income net included the sale of a  clubhouse and management fee income from one of our strategic joint ventures. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $9.7 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incur G&A while ramping up for future land sales. We opened 108 new communities during the quarter and closed 86, to end the quarter with 758 net active communities. 
New homeowners increased 8% and new order dollar value increased 14% for the quarter. And as we disclosed a few weeks ago, there were approximately 120 new homeowners that were impacted due to Hurricane Harvey. Our sales pace was 3.4 sales per community per month, which was the same as the prior year. During the quarter, we purchased 12,700 homesites, totaling $498 million. We continue with our soft pivot strategy, however, this quarter also included the strategic purchase of 5,800 homesites in Maryland. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 176,000 homesites, of which 141,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled. 
Our Financial Services business segment had operating earnings of $49.1 million compared to $53.2 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income decreased to $32.5 million from $38.3 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were $2.4 billion compared to $2.6 billion last year. Refinance volume was down 62% compared to the prior year, leading to a more competitive origination environment. Refinances now make up only 7% of our total originations. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 80% for the quarter compared to 82% in the prior year. 
Our title company's profit increased slightly to $15.6 million during the quarter from $15 million in the prior year, and that was driven by a 6% increase in revenue and operating leverage from the higher revenues. 
Our Florida realty brokerage operation acquired from WCI generated $1.3 million profit during the quarter. 
Stuart provided the multifamily detail, so now I'll turn to Rialto. The Rialto segment produced operating earnings of $3.2 million compared to $5.9 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interests. The investment management business contributed $37 million of earnings, which includes $4.7 million of equity and earnings from real estate funds and $32.3 million of management fees and other, which includes $11.4 million of carried interest distributions. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate fund 1 and 2 now totals $108 million. 
Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $236 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $12.5 million compared with $491 million and $27.2 million in the prior year, respectively, and that's before their D&A expenses. The decrease in earnings were primarily due to lower volume. Our direct investments had a loss of $9.4 million as we continue to make good progress on monetizing the remaining assets from the FDIC and early portfolio purchases. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $30.6 million for the quarter, and interest expense including the warehouse lines was $6.3 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $155 million of cash. 
Our tax rate for the third quarter was 33.4%. The rate is higher than the prior year's third quarter of 31.1% due to the additional energy credits recognized in the prior year. These credits expired on December 31, 2016 and were only available to us for part of this year, therefore, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 34% for the fourth quarter. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to total capital of 39.6%, a decline of 30 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with $565 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we redeemed early the $250 million of 6 7/8 senior notes that were acquired with the WCI transaction. We continued to significantly reduce our cost of capital as we improve our leverage ratio. 
S&P upgraded our corporate credit rating during the quarter to BB+. Stockholders equity increased to $7.6 billion and now our book value per share grew to $32.11 per share. 
Now I'd like to update our goals for closing out 2017, starting with deliveries. We were right on track to achieve a 90% backlog conversion ratio for the fourth quarter before the storms hit. Using the same backlog conversion ratio and adjusting for the 950 homes that we talked about being pushed into 2018, now calculates to between 8,200 and 8,300 deliveries, which is what we are now projecting for the fourth quarter. Based on the projected closings in our backlog, we are increasing our average sales price guidance to between $380,000 to $385,000 for the year. 
We expect our fourth quarter gross margin percentage to be between 22% and 22.25%. This should bring our full-year gross margin percentage to 22%. The fourth quarter gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points as a result of 950 deliveries being pushed into 2018, and therefore, a higher field expense for the remaining delivery. Additionally, these deliveries were primarily in Florida, which has the highest gross margin percentages in the company. We continue to see improvement in the SG&A line and we should see another record low SG&A percentage in the fourth quarter as we are projecting between 8.5% and 8.6%. 
Turning to Financial Services. As a result of the significant decline in refinances, lack of resale inventory and the storm impact, our fourth quarter is now projected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million. Rialto is now expected to generate profits for the fourth quarter of $2 million to $5 million, which will bring it to about $25 million for the year. Multifamily is expected to be approximately $35 million to $37 million, which will bring it to approximately $70 million for the full year. 
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, in this category, we've been highlighting all year that the fourth quarter will generate the bulk of the profits. The fourth quarter is expected to generate approximately $90 million to $95 million, which will bring the full year at the lower end of the previous range that we gave of $70 million to $80 million of profit. Corporate G&A is expected to be 2.1% of total company revenues for the fourth quarter and our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities. We expect our balance sheet to again end the year with strong liquidity, positioning us well as we enter 2018. 
Let me now turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

But look, dynamic pricing, our dynamic pricing model helps us in a number of ways and really helps us focus in order to drive margin and even ASP growth. It starts with a proper alignment of our production machine and our sales machine, recognizing that as we near completion, it's time to sell. That has really enabled us to bring down our incentives generally. And as I noted, our incentive levels have come down to the lowest level since 2006 at 5.5%, and I feel that, that's very directly tied to the initiatives in and around our dynamic pricing. Now another part of that is the driving of our inventory levels. We've seen a number of our divisions benefit in both generating pricing power, driving down -- and driving down incentives by being able to reduce standing inventory. Standing inventory homes are generally the ones that come with the greatest discounts or the greatest incentives and getting people to tuned into properly aligning pricing and delivery and clearing inventory earlier has helped that. So Jon, do you want to add to that?"

I don't have the data as to whether that's a record low. But I don't personally remember that were being that low. And by orderly selling the homes through the construction process, having a buyer who's mortgage approved, ready to close as the home is completed really enables us to reduce the incentives, both helping ASP and margin. I'd also want to note that we talked for several years about the impact of our Next Gen platform, and there, our sales are up 41% year-over-year and now represents just about 6% of our company's total sales. That's also a high mark for Next Gen sales. And ASP of Next Gen is almost $490,000 compared to the company average of $375,000. So it's a number of initiatives that cumulatively are giving us the results that we speak to."

Folks are -- those trades are really chasing that insurance business, and it's slowly getting better. From a power standpoint, we're really not having any power connection issues in the Texas markets, so that's a good thing. On the sales side of the market, we're having good traffic; good, solid traffic where people want to buy. The issue is a lot of those folks need to sell a home that's damaged, and they haven't received the insurance proceeds yet. And as a result, it's going to take a little bit of time for them to get those homes repaired in order for them to buy something, and people want to move into areas and communities that haven't been impacted by this type of weather damage."

But with WTI, that's trending -- that's been trending a little bit higher. We're very focused on cash flow and using cash flow to both pay down debt and ultimately look at stock buyback. But stock buyback comes in a number of different forms. Remember that we had initially targeted WCI to be a 50-50 stock and cash transaction that ended up being a full -- an all-cash transaction, which was, in effect, a large stock buyback. It's fully integrated. It's well executed. And we're becoming a real cash flow program and machine, which affords us the ability to target transactions to use cash in a variety of ways. And we're fully confident that as we move forward, our strategies are going to reflect on our returns on equity and on capital, and perhaps more importantly, in very positive and constructive way. We've mapped out our strategy for The Street to consider. The execution has been flowing in course. And I think that over time, remembering that we are less focused on quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month stock performance and more concerned and focused on adherence to a strategy that is designed to maximize return on equity, return on capital over a longer period of time, we're fully confident that our stock performance will continue to be excellent over the long term."

If you look at the composition of our apartment communities, the distribution between the merchant build and the build to core programs that we have in place, we just have an excellent program of execution ahead over the next couple of years that will define an extraordinary value for that compendium of assets. As it relates to Rialto, we've had some bumps on the road which we've articulated over time. We still need another couple of quarters to clear those bumps and to start striding forward., And we have every confidence that we'll be able to do that also. But if you look at Rialto as a private equity asset manager and investment manager, if you look at Rialto's RMF execution, those 2 isolated go-forward programs are best-in-class. They are blue-chip, and they will ultimately drive shareholder value. So I think we're right on course and I think that we have the management patience to execute well over a longer time horizon. The stock market might fluctuate a little bit more on a short-term basis and we're going to continue to execute our plan.

For instance, when you have people who may have lost more equity than they anticipated in their home because it was flooded in Houston, and then he dropped out, if there's any cancelation that's been out of that, would that be something that would show up? If you have to pay extra for labor. Are you going to try to quantify the amount you're paying extra for labor?

Steve, it's got take some time to actually ferret some of this out. But overall, long term, given the loss of residences in a generally constrained market to begin with, you're more likely to see a supply shortage that as homes get repaired, there's really very little fade in terms of value and pricing. As homes get repaired, the value comes back and I think that you're going to see a shorter-term negative turn into a longer-term positive. And that's traditionally what we've seen in storm-affected areas through many decades of having dealt with it. It takes a little bit of time for things to get back on their feet. And as we talked about the loss of or the postponement push of some closings from fourth quarter into 2018 and some directly related to homes to sell that has to be repaired and ultimately brought online, those homes will get repaired. They will be sold probably at the price that was expected with very little re-trade. And I don't think that, that will be the impact to margin.

We've only started to break the surface of some of these areas, and we are really invigorated by it. Both myself, Jon, Rick and our whole management team are really focused on this. And I would encourage you, at some point, to when you're down here, Steve, to come visit and make sure that you see our innovation center, which we've done on our third floor here. We are fully focused on thinking about how technologies can create efficiencies through our system in every part of our business. And we think that there's a long way to go. Your question, of course, is so, how much room is there to enhance SG&A or to bring SG&A down? And I can't quantify that right now. But I think we've just started to figure out how to really build that better mousetrap that I keep talking about. Now your next question is to what extent is there a first-mover example -- advantage, excuse me. I'm not going to say a first-mover advantage because I believe that others can learn and jump on board. But it's not about first-mover advantage; it's about incorporating these technologies, it's hard, hard work. It's hard work to learn and understand how they work and then to transport that knowledge out to multiple divisions in multiple geographies is a very complex management engagement. And it's something that we work on every day. So as you've watched the improvement of migrating from conventional to digital marketing, that seems like a kind of binary, oh, let's just make a movement, but it has come with a learning curve, a testing curve, a proven curve and then an implementation curve that is really difficult to overcome. So it's not a first mover advantage in a traditional sense, it's the sooner you start, the more time you put behind you in doing the hard work and the heavy lifting that it takes to actually implement these programs. So our work is not to run to get ahead of others, it's to move hard, work hard every single day to implement and to garner that 1, 2 or 10 basis points per week, per month, per quarter of improvement that we've been articulating as we've gone through the past years."

So I just wanted to see if you could give a little more detail around that statement. From our perspective, when you think about the impact of the storms, and I think you've alluded to this in previous questions, it seems like it's more around fixing existing homes, getting insurance recoveries, power related, et cetera. Certainly, there might be some incremental demand for new homes in terms of maybe people wanting to move out of a damaged home. But just wanted to get a sense for -- you said you've been through this before, what specifically -- is there an expectation in terms of maybe incremental new home demand going up 5%, 10%, 15% in the respective states?

There's going to be tremendous capital invested in infrastructure that's going to create new jobs, that's going to create wage growth, that's going to allow people to just have more spend as they're looking at buying homes just in general. The second aspect of it is as you look at where the storms hit, particularly in Houston, let's just focus on Houston right now, there's going to be parts of the market where FEMA will shut down and will not allow homes to be built in those areas. As a result of that, for folks like us that have a lot of land in other parts of the market, more the upland areas, that's going to create, over time, just long-term fundamental demand. The other aspect of it, and I've put this sort of in both markets, the Florida markets and the Houston markets, as you look at what happened with regard to the storms, the newer homes, the newer production, the newer construction fared so much better than the used home market, the existing market. As a result of that, you're seeing a continued shift of people saying, ""I'd rather live in something that's going to weather the storm than be impacted by the storm again and again.""

And then you also mentioned a negative gross margin mix from the delayed Florida delivery, a couple of questions here on this. I guess, just to understand. Was the negative gross margin mix in addition to that 50 bps impact from the delayed closings, which sounded like a little bit more of negative fixed cost absorption. And if so, or if it's not, it seems like the prior guidance was pointing to a 4Q gross margin in the high 23s. So just was curious what changed outside of the 50 bps hit, because also, obviously, your 3Q gross margin came in above expectations. So I was just curious if there was other shifts going around or what really fully impacted on top of the hurricane hit, the gross margin outlook."

As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview, Bruce will deliver further detail, and then we'll go to the Q&A portion. [Operator Instructions] 
So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we are very pleased to announce a very healthy earnings for our third quarter in spite of the active hurricane season that's affected our business at the end of the third quarter and carried into the fourth. And in fact, let me begin today with an acknowledgment of the many across our platform who have been affected by adversity.
First, in our Texas markets, Hurricane Harvey affected all of our markets and especially, of course, Houston. And I want to thank the Lennar associates who responded and continue to respond so selflessly to care and assist with their time, with their wallets and with company funds to make a difference in the aftermath. Right now, it seems like this storm took place almost years ago, but it was really only just last month, and the continuing efforts are very much appreciated.
Next, Hurricane Irma came barreling through Florida, through Georgia and up the Eastern Seaboard and affected millions of people in those areas. Again, Lennar associates responded and are still responding with their hearts, their care, their wallets, as is the company, and this is greatly appreciated.
Additionally, with Hurricane Maria, our hearts go out to the people of Puerto Rico, and our company, through the Lennar Foundation, is meaningfully contributing there as well.
And then of course, just yesterday, we all woke up to the tragedy that has gripped Las Vegas, another significant Lennar market. The ripple effect of the Las Vegas shootings affects us all, but most impacts those closest to it. And again, Lennar associates are activated and have already organized a blood drive internally and are contributing money to support grief counseling for those in need. 
Difficult circumstances call on great companies to properly balance excellent business practices with the human element. And I am particularly proud to say that I believe that we have done exactly that at Lennar, and I'm very proud to be able to represent our efforts.
Against that backdrop, let me say that through the end of the third quarter and into the fourth, we've been able to execute on our business plan and strategy of growing and refining our business while focusing on our balance sheet after paying all cash for our WCI acquisition at the beginning of the year. Overall, we've continued to see strength in the housing market through the third quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins continue to be in line with or above our expectations. Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market as jobs are being created across the country and wages are generally moving higher.
The often discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into wage growth. And while much of the data collected by the government doesn't seem to reflect significant wage growth, the customers visiting our Welcome Home Centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment and an ability to afford today's more expensive homes.
Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the same sense that we have as business operators that the economic environment is generally strong and stable and improving. There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that the government's pro-business stance will result at least in job security and possibly some tax relief as well.
The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery is at least continuing to churn slowly, while at some times even seems to be giving way to a more definitive accelerated recovery and reversion to normal. We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years have been and continue to drive some pricing power as we move through the selling season -- as we moved through the selling season, and that is somewhat offset by land and construction cost increases.
Additionally, the economic realities of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic realities of higher rental rates are beginning to have and have had a rational impact on decision-making for first-time homebuyers as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market. Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market. And as we look ahead to the final quarter of 2017 and into '18, we are expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve.
Now against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our business -- operating business segments. To begin, our for-sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017 in spite of the storm activity described before. Deliveries for the third quarter increased 12%, and our gross margin and net margins improved 20 basis points and 40 basis points year-over-year. In the third quarter, new orders -- new order increases of 8% in volume and 12% in revenues was driven by year-over-year community count growth of 9%, while our new order pace remained constant at 3.4 homes per community per month. Our strongest markets were Southeast Florida, the Bay Area, Inland Empire and Portland, all with sales pace of over 5 homes per community per month, followed by Orlando, Tampa, California Coastal, Fresno and Seattle, all with over 4 homes per community per month.
We continue to see success with our digital marketing focus, driving better quality traffic to our communities. In our third quarter, our social media outreach generated over 115,000 leads, a 15% year-over-year increase. This allows us to operate at a very efficient level where our total advertising spend is now down to only 40 basis points of our revenue. Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool. This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently. We continued to see the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during the third quarter as we reduced our completed unsold inventory by 9% year-over-year and 21% sequentially without sacrificing margin. Additionally and directly related, we have also seen our incentives per home delivered decrease to 5.5% across the platform, which is our lowest sales incentive since 2006.
As you've heard from us in prior quarters, we are using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model. Fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tools and other technology initiatives as well, we continue to focus on overall operational efficiency, driving our SG&A to historic lows of 9.2% for the third quarter, which is the lowest in history. As I've said before, we are simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time.
As I'm sure you will recall, we closed on the WCI transaction in the first quarter of this year. This integration -- the integration of this acquisition has been executed seamlessly by Lennar's operating teams in the field and by our corporate support groups as well. With any combination, the hard work begins at closing. After all the fanfare, the real congratulations are due as results are achieved. The WCI combination and integration is now complete, and the results are coming in exactly as expected as Lennar's margins, SG&A and bottom line are performing as promised. We simply have an excellent management team with tremendous bandwidth to execute, and I'd like to take a brief pause to express my appreciation for that hard work and focus as well and for the opportunity to represent their work and accomplishment to our investor community.
In addition, as I noted earlier, we came to the end of the third quarter, Hurricane Harvey came through in Texas, and that was followed by Irma at the beginning of the fourth quarter. For homebuilders and homebuilding divisions on the business side, these storms present many cumbersome challenges, whether the storm is a direct hit or a near miss. Preparation for these storms requires a shutdown of the business operations with extensive preparation to batten down the hatches, so to speak. Associates need to care for their work environments and for their personal residence and families at the same time. After the storm, caring for our associates who might have been affected while surveying damage, attending to our customers and restarting business operation is equally difficult.
As we noted in our recent press release, we have come through these two hurricanes quite well. We have attended to our associates, we have assessed the damage to our communities, we have attended to our customers and have restarted business operations. As we've said, our community sustained only minor damage, and due to the business disruption, we expect approximately 950 closings will be pushed from 2017 into 2018. Additionally, given the volume push into 2018, the positive trajectory of our margins will be temporarily impacted as well, and Bruce will give some additional detail.
With that said, the Lennar team has done an excellent job of managing through difficult times as these hurricanes affected geographies representing some 50% of our volume by closings. Considering both the all-cash acquisition of WCI and the effect of the two hurricanes, we are pleased to report that we've continued to focus on cash flow and on our balance sheet, we have maintained our 7% to 10% growth target and have focused on driving our operating cost down in order to drive bottom line and cash flow. These strategies have brought our balance sheet back to the position of a year ago with our debt to total cap at 39.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year. While the impact of the hurricanes will delay some of this progress over the next quarter, our strategy continues to be to drive strong cash flow and position our company for opportunity in the future.
Now let me briefly turn to our Financial Services segment. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well in the third quarter as it contributed operating earnings of over $49 million. While profits and projections are down slightly from last year, the decrease is primarily due to storm impacts and the slowdown in the refi business. Our core Financial Services business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and is innovating with new products like our recently announced creative student loan program. As the refi business has diminished over the past year, Lennar Financial Services continues to focus on product innovations as well as its non-Lennar retail business to replace those earnings. Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in just a few minutes.
LMC, Lennar's Multifamily Communities, our apartment segment, has also continued to grow and exceed expectations. LMC generated $9.1 million of earnings in the third quarter, driven by the sale of two of our merchant build apartment communities. While we continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we've also significantly grown LMV, our build to core program, which is cash flow-focused on building an apartment portfolio. In the third quarter, we started 836 apartment homes in three communities with a total development cost of $371 million. As of August 31, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 75 communities, totaling approximately 23,700 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.3 billion. These include 36 merchant build communities totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.2 billion and 39 LMV build-to-core communities totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion.
Our Multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations.
Turning to Rialto. Rialto contributed $3.2 million to the bottom line this quarter versus $5.9 million a year ago as our direct investments continued to be a drag on overall performance. These direct investments should be winding down over the next 2 quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into our higher returning businesses. This will enable us to efficiently lever our existing infrastructure and overhead and focus on our investment management business and RMF business segment. The investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base. As we've said before, our first two flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers, which has helped Rialto attract both existing and new investors to newer vehicles. Our third opportunity fund, which is approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments, has already invested or has under contract 43 transactions, involving the investment of over $850 million of that equity.
On the Rialto Mortgage Finance, RMF, side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF, which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable non-bank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 41st through 43rd securitization transactions during the quarter with net margins averaging 5.1%, selling over $236 million of RMF originated loans.
Finally, just to mention FivePoint, because I always have, as you all know, it's now an independent public company. Accordingly, the FivePoint management team will speak regularly for its asset base, including the very positive news recently on progress at Newhall Ranch. As I've said before, from a Lennar perspective, the new stock symbol, FPH, will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet as the value embedded in these extraordinary California assets is unlocked.
In conclusion, across our platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our third quarter and we're feeling very optimistic about our future. Given production deficits that persist, existing housing supply constraints, a pro-growth stance in government, a generally solid -- and generally solid employment fundamentals, we believe that the macro environment reads very positively for the next years and there is still a long runway in this recovery. We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market for the future. In spite of the short-term speed bumps that will temporarily slow progress in the fourth quarter, each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform and strengthen. People, assets and operations are all aligned as we begin to prepare for 2018. And with that, let me turn it over to Bruce."

Our net earnings for the third quarter were $249.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share. This compared to third quarter of 2016 net earnings of $235.8 million or $1.01 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.03 per diluted share impact due to a lower 31.1% tax rate as a result of energy credits available in the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the third quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 4% increase in average selling price to $375,000. As Stuart highlighted, our homebuilding team has focused on the dynamic pricing tool to price and deliver more efficiently, and it is reflected in our results. Our delivery machine achieved a backlog conversion ratio of 74.5%, while our completed unsold inventory dropped by 233 homes or 21% sequentially to the lowest level per community since 2012.
Our pricing efficiency is also noted as our sales incentives dropped 40 basis points year-over-year to 5.5%, which is an 11-year low and drove our gross margin outperformance. Our gross margin on home sales in the third quarter was 22.8% versus 22.6% in the prior year. Gross margin percents were once again its highest in our homebuilding east segment. The gross margin percentage was benefited by 30 basis points this quarter due to insurance recoveries. Direct construction costs were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $56 per square foot, driven by an approximate 5% increase in labor and 3% in material costs. Our SG&A percentage continues to drive lower as Q3 was 9.2% compared to 9.3% in the prior year. Included in our SG&A in the third quarter were transaction-related expenses related to the WCI acquisition, which had a 20 basis point impact, but were offset by insurance recoveries.
Our operating margin improved by 40 basis points for the quarter to 13.6%. Other income net was $2.8 million compared to $30 million in the prior period. In the prior period, other income net included the sale of a clubhouse and management fee income from one of our strategic joint ventures. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $9.7 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incur G&A while ramping up for future land sales. We opened 108 new communities during the quarter and closed 86 to end the quarter with 758 net active communities.
New home orders increased 8% and new order dollar value increased 14% for the quarter. And as we disclosed a few weeks ago, there were approximately 120 new home orders that were impacted due to Hurricane Harvey. Our sales pace was 3.4 sales per community per month, which was the same as the prior year. During the quarter, we purchased 12,700 homesites, totaling $498 million. We continue with our soft pivot strategy. However, this quarter also included the strategic purchase of 5,800 homesites in Maryland. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 176,000 homesites, of which 141,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled.
Our Financial Services business segment had operating earnings of $49.1 million compared to $53.2 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income decreased to $32.5 million from $38.3 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were $2.4 billion compared to $2.6 billion last year. Refinance volume was down 62% compared to the prior year, leading to a more competitive origination environment. Refinances now make up only 7% of our total originations. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 80% for the quarter compared to 82% in the prior year.
Our title company's profit increased slightly to $15.6 million during the quarter from $15 million in the prior year, and that was driven by a 6% increase in revenue and operating leverage from the higher revenues.
Our Florida realty brokerage operation acquired from WCI generated $1.3 million profit during the quarter.
Stuart provided the multifamily detail, so now I'll turn to Rialto. The Rialto segment produced operating earnings of $3.2 million compared to $5.9 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interests. The investment management business contributed $37 million of earnings, which includes $4.7 million of equity and earnings from real estate funds and $32.3 million of management fees and other, which includes $11.4 million of carried interest distributions. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate fund 1 and 2 now totals $108 million.
Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $236 million of commercial loans into three securitizations, resulting in earnings of $12.5 million compared with $491 million and $27.2 million in the prior year, respectively, and that's before their D&A expenses. The decrease in earnings were primarily due to lower volume. Our direct investments had a loss of $9.4 million as we continued to make good progress on monetizing the remaining assets from the FDIC and early portfolio purchases. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $30.6 million for the quarter, and interest expense including the warehouse lines was $6.3 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $155 million of cash.
Our tax rate for the third quarter was 33.4%. The rate is higher than the prior year's third quarter of 31.1% due to the additional energy credits recognized in the prior year. These credits expired on December 31, 2016, and were only available to us for part of this year. Therefore, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 34% for the fourth quarter.
Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to total capital of 39.6%, a decline of 30 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with $565 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we redeemed early the $250 million of 6 7/8% senior notes that were acquired with the WCI transaction. We continued to significantly reduce our cost of capital as we improve our leverage ratio.
S&P upgraded our corporate credit rating during the quarter to BB+. Stockholders equity increased to $7.6 billion, and now our book value per share grew to $32.11 per share.
Now I'd like to update our goals for closing out 2017, starting with deliveries. We were right on track to achieve a 90% backlog conversion ratio for the fourth quarter before the storms hit. Using the same backlog conversion ratio and adjusting for the 950 homes that we talked about being pushed into 2018 now calculates to between 8,200 and 8,300 deliveries, which is what we are now projecting for the fourth quarter. Based on the projected closings in our backlog, we are increasing our average sales price guidance to between $380,000 and $385,000 for the year.
We expect our fourth quarter gross margin percentage to be between 22% and 22.25%. This should bring our full-year gross margin percentage to 22%. The fourth quarter gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points as a result of 950 deliveries being pushed into 2018, and therefore, a higher field expense per remaining delivery. Additionally, these deliveries were primarily in Florida, which has the highest gross margin percentages in the company. We continue to see improvement in the SG&A line, and we should see another record low SG&A percentage in the fourth quarter as we are projecting between 8.5% and 8.6%.
Turning to Financial Services. As a result of the significant decline in refinances, lack of resale inventory and the storm impact, our fourth quarter is now projected to be in a range of $35 million to $40 million. Rialto is now expected to generate profits for the fourth quarter of $2 million to $5 million, which will bring it to about $25 million for the year. Multifamily is expected to be approximately $35 million to $37 million, which will bring it to approximately $70 million for the full year.
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, in this category, we've been highlighting all year that the fourth quarter will generate the bulk of the profits. The fourth quarter is expected to generate approximately $90 million to $95 million, which will bring the full year at the lower end of the previous range that we gave of $70 million to $80 million of profit. Corporate G&A is expected to be 2.1% of total company revenues for the fourth quarter, and our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities. We expect our balance sheet to again end the year with strong liquidity, positioning us well as we enter 2018.
Let me now turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

But look, dynamic pricing, our dynamic pricing model helps us in a number of ways and really helps us focus in order to drive margin and even ASP growth. It starts with a proper alignment of our production machine and our sales machine, recognizing that as we near completion, it's time to sell. That has really enabled us to bring down our incentives generally. And as I noted, our incentive levels have come down to the lowest level since 2006 at 5.5%, and I feel that, that's very directly tied to the initiatives in and around our dynamic pricing. Now another part of that is the driving of our inventory levels. We've seen a number of our divisions benefit in both generating pricing power, driving down -- and driving down incentives by being able to reduce standing inventory. Standing inventory homes are generally the ones that come with the greatest discounts or the greatest incentives, and getting people tuned into properly aligning pricing and delivery and clearing inventory earlier has helped that. So Jon, do you want to add to that?"

The efficient delivery of the homes that Stuart's describing is really enabled by providing our division the data so that they can pull the right levers at the right time to match sales pace with construction pace. And as Stuart mentioned, the low inventory levels. Last quarter, we were down to 1.25 quarter homes per community on average of completed homes that were unsold. I don't have the data as to whether that's a record low. But I don't personally remember it ever being that low. And by orderly selling the homes through the construction process, having a buyer who's mortgage approved, ready to close as the home is completed really enables us to reduce the incentives, both helping ASP and margin. I'd also want to note that we talked for several years about the impact of our Next Gen platform, and there, our sales are up 41% year-over-year and now represent just about 6% of our company's total sales. That's also a high mark for Next Gen sales. And ASP of Next Gen is almost $490,000 compared to the company average of $375,000. So it's a number of initiatives that I think cumulatively are giving us the results that we speak to."

Those are typically in the roofing, the drywall, the siding and depending on the market. That said, we constantly are adjusting sales pace with sales price. And the real tricky thing for us at this point is whether we want to really push the trades and pay them more than what the job should really justify in order to accelerate the home, or do we take a little bit longer to deliver that home.

But stock buyback comes in a number of different forms. Remember that we had initially targeted WCI to be a 50-50 stock and cash transaction that ended up being a full -- an all-cash transaction, which was, in effect, a large stock buyback. It's fully integrated. It's well executed. And we're becoming a real cash flow program and machine, which affords us the ability to target transactions to use cash in a variety of ways. And we're fully confident that as we move forward, our strategies are going to reflect on our returns on equity and on capital, and perhaps more importantly, in very positive and constructive way. We've mapped out our strategy for The Street to consider. The execution has been flowing in course.

But overall, long term, given the loss of residences in a generally constrained market to begin with, you're more likely to see a supply shortage that as homes get repaired, there's really very little fade in terms of value and pricing. As homes get repaired, the value comes back and I think that you're going to see a shorter-term negative turn into a longer-term positive. And that's traditionally what we've seen in storm-affected areas through many decades of having dealt with it. It takes a little bit of time for things to get back on their feet. And as we talked about the loss of or the postponement push of some closings from fourth quarter into 2018 and some directly related to homes to sell that have to be repaired and ultimately brought online, those homes will get repaired. They will be sold probably at the price that was expected with very little re-trade. And I don't think that, that will be the impact to margin. If anything, it will probably come around and lift the ability to raise prices maybe with some offset from cost on the labor and material front. But Bruce, go ahead."

Obviously, it's been really impressive, it's been -- and I know that you've been out and front and have been very active and continue to be active in ways your competitors are not. And I guess my question relates to what you think -- what inning do you think we are in, in terms of not necessarily digital marketing and dynamic pricing per se, but the ability of the technology initiatives that you see on the table right now being able to benefit the margin structure of your business over the next few years. Like what inning do you think we are in. And what do you think the first-mover advantages are in these technology-related investments, like how much can you keep, do you think, relative to your competition?"

And there's a big, big range of opportunity in the technology field to refine this -- the homebuilding business that has only started. We've only started to break the surface of some of these areas, and we are really invigorated by it. Both myself, Jon, Rick and our whole management team are really focused on this. And I would encourage you, at some point, to when you're down here, Steve, to come visit and make sure that you see our innovation center, which we've done on our third floor here. We are fully focused on thinking about how technologies can create efficiencies through our system in every part of our business. And we think that there's a long way to go. Your question, of course, is so, how much room is there to enhance SG&A or to bring SG&A down. And I can't quantify that right now. But I think we've just started to figure out how to really build that better mousetrap that I keep talking about. Now your next question is to what extent is there a first-mover example -- advantage, excuse me. I'm not going to say a first-mover advantage because I believe that others can learn and jump on board. But it's not about first-mover advantage; it's about incorporating these technologies is hard, hard work. It's hard work to learn and understand how they work and then to transport that knowledge out to multiple divisions in multiple geographies is a very complex management engagement. And it's something that we work on every day. So as you've watched the improvement of migrating from conventional to digital marketing, that seems like a kind of binary, oh, let's just make a movement, but it has come with a learning curve, a testing curve, a proven curve and then an implementation curve that is really difficult to overcome. So it's not a first mover advantage in a traditional sense, it's the sooner you start, the more time you put behind you in doing the hard work and the heavy lifting that it takes to actually implement these programs. So our work is not to run to get ahead of others, it's to move hard, work hard every single day to implement and to garner that 1, 2 or 10 basis points per week, per month, per quarter of improvement that we've been articulating as we've gone through the past years."

Stuart, I wanted to circle back to the comments you had in your press release actually, and I believe you had this even on your initial -- your prior release around estimations of impact. And what you said in the release, again, today, was that you expect an increased demand in homes in the storm-related areas, which will result in a broader range of opportunities as we look towards 2018. So I just wanted to see if you could give a little more detail around that statement. From our perspective, when you think about the impact of the storms, and I think you've alluded to this in previous questions, it seems like it's more around fixing existing homes, getting insurance recoveries, power related, et cetera. Certainly, there might be some incremental demand for new homes in terms of maybe people wanting to move out of a damaged home. But just wanted to get a sense for -- you said you've been through this before, what specifically -- is there an expectation in terms of maybe incremental new home demand going up 5%, 10%, 15% in the respective states? Or is it more of a broader statement? And when you say a broader range of opportunities, if there are certain specific types of initiatives or certain types of communities are pivoting, or maybe for Multifamily. What exactly do you mean by that?"

There are several aspects of this that are just different pieces. One is just the overall new capital investment as you're rebuilding various markets. There's going to be tremendous capital invested in infrastructure that's going to create new jobs, that's going to create wage growth, that's going to allow people to just have more spend as they're looking at buying homes just in general. The second aspect of it is as you look at where the storms hit, particularly in Houston, let's just focus on Houston right now, there's going to be parts of the market where FEMA will shut down and will not allow homes to be built in those areas. As a result of that, for folks like us that have a lot of land in other parts of the market, more the upland areas, that's going to create, over time, just long-term fundamental demand. The other aspect of it, and I'd put this sort of in both markets, the Florida markets and the Houston markets, as you look at what happened with regard to the storms, the newer homes, the newer production, the newer construction fared so much better than the used home market, the existing market. As a result of that, you're seeing a continued shift of people saying, ""I'd rather live in something that's going to weather the storm than be impacted by the storm again and again."" But those are just a few aspects of the opportunities that exist out there that creates that longer-term fundamental demand in the aftermath of these storms."

Was the negative gross margin mix in addition to that 50 bps impact from the delayed closings, which sounded like a little bit more of negative fixed cost absorption. And if so, or if it's not, it seems like the prior guidance was pointing to a 4Q gross margin in the high 23s.

As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview, Bruce will deliver further detail, and then we'll go to the Q&A portion. [Operator Instructions] 
So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we are very pleased to announce a very healthy earnings for our third quarter in spite of the active hurricane season that's affected our business at the end of the third quarter and carried into the fourth. And in fact, let me begin today with an acknowledgment of the many across our platform who have been affected by adversity.
First, in our Texas markets, Hurricane Harvey affected all of our markets and especially, of course, Houston. And I want to thank the Lennar associates who responded and continue to respond so selflessly to care and assist with their time, with their wallets and with company funds to make a difference in the aftermath. Right now, it seems like this storm took place almost years ago, but it was really only just last month, and the continuing efforts are very much appreciated.
Next, Hurricane Irma came barreling through Florida, through Georgia and up the Eastern Seaboard and affected millions of people in those areas. Again, Lennar associates responded and are still responding with their hearts, their care, their wallets, as is the company, and this is greatly appreciated.
Additionally, with Hurricane Maria, our hearts go out to the people of Puerto Rico, and our company, through the Lennar Foundation, is meaningfully contributing there as well.
And then of course, just yesterday, we all woke up to the tragedy that has gripped Las Vegas, another significant Lennar market. The ripple effect of the Las Vegas shootings affects us all, but most impacts those closest to it. And again, Lennar associates are activated and have already organized a blood drive internally and are contributing money to support grief counseling for those in need. 
Difficult circumstances call on great companies to properly balance excellent business practices with the human element. And I am particularly proud to say that I believe that we have done exactly that at Lennar, and I'm very proud to be able to represent our efforts.
Against that backdrop, let me say that through the end of the third quarter and into the fourth, we've been able to execute on our business plan and strategy of growing and refining our business while focusing on our balance sheet after paying all cash for our WCI acquisition at the beginning of the year. Overall, we've continued to see strength in the housing market through the third quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins continue to be in line with or above our expectations. Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market as jobs are being created across the country and wages are generally moving higher.
The often discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into wage growth. And while much of the data collected by the government doesn't seem to reflect significant wage growth, the customers visiting our Welcome Home Centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment and an ability to afford today's more expensive homes.
Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the same sense that we have as business operators that the economic environment is generally strong and stable and improving. There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that the government's pro-business stance will result at least in job security and possibly some tax relief as well.
The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery is at least continuing to churn slowly, while at some times even seems to be giving way to a more definitive accelerated recovery and reversion to normal. We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years have been and continue to drive some pricing power as we move through the selling season -- as we moved through the selling season, and that is somewhat offset by land and construction cost increases.
Additionally, the economic realities of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic realities of higher rental rates are beginning to have and have had a rational impact on decision-making for first-time homebuyers as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market. Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market. And as we look ahead to the final quarter of 2017 and into '18, we are expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve.
Now against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our business -- operating business segments. To begin, our for-sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017 in spite of the storm activity described before. Deliveries for the third quarter increased 12%, and our gross margin and net margins improved 20 basis points and 40 basis points year-over-year. In the third quarter, new orders -- new order increases of 8% in volume and 12% in revenues was driven by year-over-year community count growth of 9%, while our new order pace remained constant at 3.4 homes per community per month. Our strongest markets were Southeast Florida, the Bay Area, Inland Empire and Portland, all with sales pace of over 5 homes per community per month, followed by Orlando, Tampa, California Coastal, Fresno and Seattle, all with over 4 homes per community per month.
We continue to see success with our digital marketing focus, driving better quality traffic to our communities. In our third quarter, our social media outreach generated over 115,000 leads, a 15% year-over-year increase. This allows us to operate at a very efficient level where our total advertising spend is now down to only 40 basis points of our revenue. Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool. This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently. We continued to see the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during the third quarter as we reduced our completed unsold inventory by 9% year-over-year and 21% sequentially without sacrificing margin. Additionally and directly related, we have also seen our incentives per home delivered decrease to 5.5% across the platform, which is our lowest sales incentive since 2006.
As you've heard from us in prior quarters, we are using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model. Fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tools and other technology initiatives as well, we continue to focus on overall operational efficiency, driving our SG&A to historic lows of 9.2% for the third quarter, which is the lowest in history. As I've said before, we are simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time.
As I'm sure you will recall, we closed on the WCI transaction in the first quarter of this year. This integration -- the integration of this acquisition has been executed seamlessly by Lennar's operating teams in the field and by our corporate support groups as well. With any combination, the hard work begins at closing. After all the fanfare, the real congratulations are due as results are achieved. The WCI combination and integration is now complete, and the results are coming in exactly as expected as Lennar's margins, SG&A and bottom line are performing as promised. We simply have an excellent management team with tremendous bandwidth to execute, and I'd like to take a brief pause to express my appreciation for that hard work and focus as well and for the opportunity to represent their work and accomplishment to our investor community.
In addition, as I noted earlier, we came to the end of the third quarter, Hurricane Harvey came through in Texas, and that was followed by Irma at the beginning of the fourth quarter. For homebuilders and homebuilding divisions on the business side, these storms present many cumbersome challenges, whether the storm is a direct hit or a near miss. Preparation for these storms requires a shutdown of the business operations with extensive preparation to batten down the hatches, so to speak. Associates need to care for their work environments and for their personal residence and families at the same time. After the storm, caring for our associates who might have been affected while surveying damage, attending to our customers and restarting business operation is equally difficult.
As we noted in our recent press release, we have come through these2 hurricanes quite well. We have attended to our associates, we have assessed the damage to our communities, we have attended to our customers and have restarted business operations. As we've said, our community sustained only minor damage, and due to the business disruption, we expect approximately 950 closings will be pushed from 2017 into 2018. Additionally, given the volume push into 2018, the positive trajectory of our margins will be temporarily impacted as well, and Bruce will give some additional detail.
With that said, the Lennar team has done an excellent job of managing through difficult times as these hurricanes affected geographies representing some 50% of our volume by closings. Considering both the all-cash acquisition of WCI and the effect of the 2 hurricanes, we are pleased to report that we've continued to focus on cash flow and on our balance sheet, we have maintained our 7% to 10% growth target and have focused on driving our operating cost down in order to drive bottom line and cash flow. These strategies have brought our balance sheet back to the position of a year ago with our debt to total cap at 39.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year. While the impact of the hurricanes will delay some of this progress over the next quarter, our strategy continues to be to drive strong cash flow and position our company for opportunity in the future.
Now let me briefly turn to our Financial Services segment. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well in the third quarter as it contributed operating earnings of over $49 million. While profits and projections are down slightly from last year, the decrease is primarily due to storm impacts and the slowdown in the refi business. Our core Financial Services business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and is innovating with new products like our recently announced creative student loan program. As the refi business has diminished over the past year, Lennar Financial Services continues to focus on product innovations as well as its non-Lennar retail business to replace those earnings. Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in just a few minutes.
LMC, Lennar's Multifamily Communities, our apartment segment, has also continued to grow and exceed expectations. LMC generated $9.1 million of earnings in the third quarter, driven by the sale of 2 of our merchant build apartment communities. While we continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we've also significantly grown LMV, our build to core program, which is cash flow-focused on building an apartment portfolio. In the third quarter, we started 836 apartment homes in 3 communities with a total development cost of $371 million. As of August 31, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 75 communities, totaling approximately 23,700 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.3 billion. These include 36 merchant build communities totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.2 billion and 39 LMV build-to-core communities totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion.
Our Multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations.
Turning to Rialto. Rialto contributed $3.2 million to the bottom line this quarter versus $5.9 million a year ago as our direct investments continued to be a drag on overall performance. These direct investments should be winding down over the next 2 quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into our higher returning businesses. This will enable us to efficiently lever our existing infrastructure and overhead and focus on our investment management business and RMF business segment. The investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base. As we've said before, our first 2 flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers, which has helped Rialto attract both existing and new investors to newer vehicles. Our third opportunity fund, which is approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments, has already invested or has under contract 43 transactions, involving the investment of over $850 million of that equity.
On the Rialto Mortgage Finance, RMF, side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF, which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable non-bank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 41st through 43rd securitization transactions during the quarter with net margins averaging 5.1%, selling over $236 million of RMF originated loans.
Finally, just to mention FivePoint, because I always have, as you all know, it's now an independent public company. Accordingly, the FivePoint management team will speak regularly for its asset base, including the very positive news recently on progress at Newhall Ranch. As I've said before, from a Lennar perspective, the new stock symbol, FPH, will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet as the value embedded in these extraordinary California assets is unlocked.
In conclusion, across our platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our third quarter and we're feeling very optimistic about our future. Given production deficits that persist, existing housing supply constraints, a pro-growth stance in government, a generally solid -- and generally solid employment fundamentals, we believe that the macro environment reads very positively for the next years and there is still a long runway in this recovery. We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market for the future. In spite of the short-term speed bumps that will temporarily slow progress in the fourth quarter, each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform and strengthen. People, assets and operations are all aligned as we begin to prepare for 2018. And with that, let me turn it over to Bruce."
30763,537530007,1309359,"Lennar Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 03, 2017",2017-10-03,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the third quarter were $249.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share.

Our net earnings for the third quarter were $249.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share. This compared to third quarter of 2016 net earnings of $235.8 million or $1.01 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.03 per diluted share impact due to a lower 31.1% tax rate as a result of energy credits available in the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the third quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 4% increase in average selling price to $375,000. As Stuart highlighted, our homebuilding team has focused on the dynamic pricing tool to price and deliver more efficiently, and it is reflected in our results. Our delivery machine achieved a backlog conversion ratio of 74.5%, while our completed unsold inventory dropped by 233 homes or 21% sequentially to the lowest level per community since 2012.
Our pricing efficiency is also noted as our sales incentives dropped 40 basis points year-over-year to 5.5%, which is an 11-year low and drove our gross margin outperformance. Our gross margin on home sales in the third quarter was 22.8% versus 22.6% in the prior year. Gross margin percents were once again its highest in our homebuilding east segment. The gross margin percentage was benefited by 30 basis points this quarter due to insurance recoveries. Direct construction costs were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $56 per square foot, driven by an approximate 5% increase in labor and 3% in material costs. Our SG&A percentage continues to drive lower as Q3 was 9.2% compared to 9.3% in the prior year. Included in our SG&A in the third quarter were transaction-related expenses related to the WCI acquisition, which had a 20 basis point impact, but were offset by insurance recoveries.
Our operating margin improved by 40 basis points for the quarter to 13.6%. Other income net was $2.8 million compared to $30 million in the prior period. In the prior period, other income net included the sale of a clubhouse and management fee income from one of our strategic joint ventures. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $9.7 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incur G&A while ramping up for future land sales. We opened 108 new communities during the quarter and closed 86 to end the quarter with 758 net active communities.
New home orders increased 8% and new order dollar value increased 14% for the quarter. And as we disclosed a few weeks ago, there were approximately 120 new home orders that were impacted due to Hurricane Harvey. Our sales pace was 3.4 sales per community per month, which was the same as the prior year. During the quarter, we purchased 12,700 homesites, totaling $498 million. We continue with our soft pivot strategy. However, this quarter also included the strategic purchase of 5,800 homesites in Maryland. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 176,000 homesites, of which 141,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled.
Our Financial Services business segment had operating earnings of $49.1 million compared to $53.2 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income decreased to $32.5 million from $38.3 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were $2.4 billion compared to $2.6 billion last year. Refinance volume was down 62% compared to the prior year, leading to a more competitive origination environment. Refinances now make up only 7% of our total originations. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 80% for the quarter compared to 82% in the prior year.
Our title company's profit increased slightly to $15.6 million during the quarter from $15 million in the prior year, and that was driven by a 6% increase in revenue and operating leverage from the higher revenues.
Our Florida realty brokerage operation acquired from WCI generated $1.3 million profit during the quarter.
Stuart provided the multifamily detail, so now I'll turn to Rialto. The Rialto segment produced operating earnings of $3.2 million compared to $5.9 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interests. The investment management business contributed $37 million of earnings, which includes $4.7 million of equity and earnings from real estate funds and $32.3 million of management fees and other, which includes $11.4 million of carried interest distributions. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate fund 1 and 2 now totals $108 million.
Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $236 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $12.5 million compared with $491 million and $27.2 million in the prior year, respectively, and that's before their D&A expenses. The decrease in earnings were primarily due to lower volume. Our direct investments had a loss of $9.4 million as we continued to make good progress on monetizing the remaining assets from the FDIC and early portfolio purchases. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $30.6 million for the quarter, and interest expense including the warehouse lines was $6.3 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $155 million of cash.
Our tax rate for the third quarter was 33.4%. The rate is higher than the prior year's third quarter of 31.1% due to the additional energy credits recognized in the prior year. These credits expired on December 31, 2016, and were only available to us for part of this year. Therefore, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 34% for the fourth quarter.
Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to total capital of 39.6%, a decline of 30 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with $565 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we redeemed early the $250 million of 6 7/8% senior notes that were acquired with the WCI transaction. We continued to significantly reduce our cost of capital as we improve our leverage ratio.
S&P upgraded our corporate credit rating during the quarter to BB+. Stockholders equity increased to $7.6 billion, and now our book value per share grew to $32.11 per share.
Now I'd like to update our goals for closing out 2017, starting with deliveries. We were right on track to achieve a 90% backlog conversion ratio for the fourth quarter before the storms hit. Using the same backlog conversion ratio and adjusting for the 950 homes that we talked about being pushed into 2018 now calculates to between 8,200 and 8,300 deliveries, which is what we are now projecting for the fourth quarter. Based on the projected closings in our backlog, we are increasing our average sales price guidance to between $380,000 and $385,000 for the year.
We expect our fourth quarter gross margin percentage to be between 22% and 22.25%. This should bring our full-year gross margin percentage to 22%. The fourth quarter gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points as a result of 950 deliveries being pushed into 2018, and therefore, a higher field expense per remaining delivery. Additionally, these deliveries were primarily in Florida, which has the highest gross margin percentages in the company. We continue to see improvement in the SG&A line, and we should see another record low SG&A percentage in the fourth quarter as we are projecting between 8.5% and 8.6%.
Turning to Financial Services. As a result of the significant decline in refinances, lack of resale inventory and the storm impact, our fourth quarter is now projected to be in a range of $35 million to $40 million. Rialto is now expected to generate profits for the fourth quarter of $2 million to $5 million, which will bring it to about $25 million for the year. Multifamily is expected to be approximately $35 million to $37 million, which will bring it to approximately $70 million for the full year.
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, in this category, we've been highlighting all year that the fourth quarter will generate the bulk of the profits. The fourth quarter is expected to generate approximately $90 million to $95 million, which will bring the full year at the lower end of the previous range that we gave of $70 million to $80 million of profit. Corporate G&A is expected to be 2.1% of total company revenues for the fourth quarter, and our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities. We expect our balance sheet to again end the year with strong liquidity, positioning us well as we enter 2018.
Let me now turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

But look, dynamic pricing, our dynamic pricing model helps us in a number of ways and really helps us focus in order to drive margin and even ASP growth. It starts with a proper alignment of our production machine and our sales machine, recognizing that as we near completion, it's time to sell. That has really enabled us to bring down our incentives generally. And as I noted, our incentive levels have come down to the lowest level since 2006 at 5.5%, and I feel that, that's very directly tied to the initiatives in and around our dynamic pricing. Now another part of that is the driving of our inventory levels. We've seen a number of our divisions benefit in both generating pricing power, driving down -- and driving down incentives by being able to reduce standing inventory. Standing inventory homes are generally the ones that come with the greatest discounts or the greatest incentives, and getting people tuned into properly aligning pricing and delivery and clearing inventory earlier has helped that. So Jon, do you want to add to that?"

The efficient delivery of the homes that Stuart's describing is really enabled by providing our division the data so that they can pull the right levers at the right time to match sales pace with construction pace. And as Stuart mentioned, the low inventory levels. Last quarter, we were down to 1.25 quarter homes per community on average of completed homes that were unsold. I don't have the data as to whether that's a record low. But I don't personally remember it ever being that low. And by orderly selling the homes through the construction process, having a buyer who's mortgage approved, ready to close as the home is completed really enables us to reduce the incentives, both helping ASP and margin. I'd also want to note that we talked for several years about the impact of our Next Gen platform, and there, our sales are up 41% year-over-year and now represent just about 6% of our company's total sales. That's also a high mark for Next Gen sales. And ASP of Next Gen is almost $490,000 compared to the company average of $375,000. So it's a number of initiatives that I think cumulatively are giving us the results that we speak to."

Those are typically in the roofing, the drywall, the siding and depending on the market. That said, we constantly are adjusting sales pace with sales price. And the real tricky thing for us at this point is whether we want to really push the trades and pay them more than what the job should really justify in order to accelerate the home, or do we take a little bit longer to deliver that home.

From a power standpoint, we're really not having any power connection issues in the Texas markets, so that's a good thing.

And as a result, it's going to take a little bit of time for them to get those homes repaired in order for them to buy something, and people want to move into areas and communities that haven't been impacted by this type of weather damage."

But we obviously saw a decline in your ROE, which was related to WCI, and obviously, we expect that to resume acceleration.

But aside from that, if you look at our strategy and you look at the way that our company is performing, we've been very focused on a growth strategy that targets a 7% to 10% rate. But with WTI, that's trending -- that's been trending a little bit higher. We're very focused on cash flow and using cash flow to both pay down debt and ultimately look at stock buyback. But stock buyback comes in a number of different forms. Remember that we had initially targeted WCI to be a 50-50 stock and cash transaction that ended up being a full -- an all-cash transaction, which was, in effect, a large stock buyback. It's fully integrated. It's well executed. And we're becoming a real cash flow program and machine, which affords us the ability to target transactions to use cash in a variety of ways. And we're fully confident that as we move forward, our strategies are going to reflect on our returns on equity and on capital, and perhaps more importantly, in very positive and constructive way. We've mapped out our strategy for The Street to consider. The execution has been flowing in course. And I think that over time, remembering that we are less focused on quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month stock performance and more concerned and focused on adherence to a strategy that is designed to maximize return on equity, return on capital over a longer period of time, we're fully confident that our stock performance will continue to be excellent over the long term."

LMC is progressing exactly -- not exactly, even better than we ever anticipated. If you look at the composition of our apartment communities, the distribution between the merchant build and the build to core programs that we have in place, we just have an excellent program of execution ahead over the next couple of years that will define an extraordinary value for that compendium of assets. As it relates to Rialto, we've had some bumps on the road which we've articulated over time. We still need another couple of quarters to clear those bumps and to start striding forward, and we have every confidence that we'll be able to do that also. But if you look at Rialto as a private equity asset manager and investment manager, if you look at Rialto's RMF execution, those 2 isolated go-forward programs are best-in-class. They are blue-chip, and they will ultimately drive shareholder value. So I think we're right on course and I think that we have the management patience to execute well over a longer time horizon. The stock market might fluctuate a little bit more on a short-term basis, and we're going to continue to execute our plan.

And that sort of brings to mind this question of what the fade of the margin impact you think ultimately may be. And I know you're not going to get specific until later. But I'm interested in sort of what things you are likely to put into that bucket of hurricane-affected margin. For instance, when you have people who may have lost more equity than they anticipated in their home because it was flooded in Houston, and then he dropped out, if there's any cancelations that spin out of that, would that be something that would show up? If you have to pay extra for labor, are you going to try to quantify the amount you're paying extra for labor?

Steve, it's got take some time to actually ferret some of this out. But overall, long term, given the loss of residences in a generally constrained market to begin with, you're more likely to see a supply shortage that as homes get repaired, there's really very little fade in terms of value and pricing. As homes get repaired, the value comes back and I think that you're going to see a shorter-term negative turn into a longer-term positive. And that's traditionally what we've seen in storm-affected areas through many decades of having dealt with it. It takes a little bit of time for things to get back on their feet. And as we talked about the loss of or the postponement push of some closings from fourth quarter into 2018 and some directly related to homes to sell that have to be repaired and ultimately brought online, those homes will get repaired. They will be sold probably at the price that was expected with very little re-trade. And I don't think that, that will be the impact to margin. If anything, it will probably come around and lift the ability to raise prices maybe with some offset from cost on the labor and material front. But Bruce, go ahead."

We've only started to break the surface of some of these areas, and we are really invigorated by it. Both myself, Jon, Rick and our whole management team are really focused on this. And I would encourage you, at some point, to when you're down here, Steve, to come visit and make sure that you see our innovation center, which we've done on our third floor here. We are fully focused on thinking about how technologies can create efficiencies through our system in every part of our business. And we think that there's a long way to go. Your question, of course, is so, how much room is there to enhance SG&A or to bring SG&A down. And I can't quantify that right now. But I think we've just started to figure out how to really build that better mousetrap that I keep talking about. Now your next question is to what extent is there a first-mover example -- advantage, excuse me. I'm not going to say a first-mover advantage because I believe that others can learn and jump on board. But it's not about first-mover advantage; it's about incorporating these technologies is hard, hard work. It's hard work to learn and understand how they work and then to transport that knowledge out to multiple divisions in multiple geographies is a very complex management engagement. And it's something that we work on every day. So as you've watched the improvement of migrating from conventional to digital marketing, that seems like a kind of binary, oh, let's just make a movement, but it has come with a learning curve, a testing curve, a proven curve and then an implementation curve that is really difficult to overcome. So it's not a first mover advantage in a traditional sense, it's the sooner you start, the more time you put behind you in doing the hard work and the heavy lifting that it takes to actually implement these programs. So our work is not to run to get ahead of others, it's to move hard, work hard every single day to implement and to garner that 1, 2 or 10 basis points per week, per month, per quarter of improvement that we've been articulating as we've gone through the past years."

From our perspective, when you think about the impact of the storms, and I think you've alluded to this in previous questions, it seems like it's more around fixing existing homes, getting insurance recoveries, power related, et cetera. Certainly, there might be some incremental demand for new homes in terms of maybe people wanting to move out of a damaged home. But just wanted to get a sense for -- you said you've been through this before, what specifically -- is there an expectation in terms of maybe incremental new home demand going up 5%, 10%, 15% in the respective states?

There's going to be tremendous capital invested in infrastructure that's going to create new jobs, that's going to create wage growth, that's going to allow people to just have more spend as they're looking at buying homes just in general. The second aspect of it is as you look at where the storms hit, particularly in Houston, let's just focus on Houston right now, there's going to be parts of the market where FEMA will shut down and will not allow homes to be built in those areas. As a result of that, for folks like us that have a lot of land in other parts of the market, more the upland areas, that's going to create, over time, just long-term fundamental demand. The other aspect of it, and I'd put this sort of in both markets, the Florida markets and the Houston markets, as you look at what happened with regard to the storms, the newer homes, the newer production, the newer construction fared so much better than the used home market, the existing market. As a result of that, you're seeing a continued shift of people saying, ""I'd rather live in something that's going to weather the storm than be impacted by the storm again and again.""

As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview, Bruce will deliver further detail, and then we'll go to the Q&A portion. [Operator Instructions] 
So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we are very pleased to announce a very healthy earnings for our third quarter in spite of the active hurricane season that's affected our business at the end of the third quarter and carried into the fourth. And in fact, let me begin today with an acknowledgment of the many across our platform who have been affected by adversity.
First, in our Texas markets, Hurricane Harvey affected all of our markets and especially, of course, Houston. And I want to thank the Lennar associates who responded and continue to respond so selflessly to care and assist with their time, with their wallets and with company funds to make a difference in the aftermath. Right now, it seems like this storm took place almost years ago, but it was really only just last month, and the continuing efforts are very much appreciated.
Next, Hurricane Irma came barreling through Florida, through Georgia and up the Eastern Seaboard and affected millions of people in those areas. Again, Lennar associates responded and are still responding with their hearts, their care, their wallets, as is the company, and this is greatly appreciated.
Additionally, with Hurricane Maria, our hearts go out to the people of Puerto Rico, and our company, through the Lennar Foundation, is meaningfully contributing there as well.
And then of course, just yesterday, we all woke up to the tragedy that has gripped Las Vegas, another significant Lennar market. The ripple effect of the Las Vegas shootings affects us all, but most impacts those closest to it. And again, Lennar associates are activated and have already organized a blood drive internally and are contributing money to support grief counseling for those in need. 
Difficult circumstances call on great companies to properly balance excellent business practices with the human element. And I am particularly proud to say that I believe that we have done exactly that at Lennar, and I'm very proud to be able to represent our efforts.
Against that backdrop, let me say that through the end of the third quarter and into the fourth, we've been able to execute on our business plan and strategy of growing and refining our business while focusing on our balance sheet after paying all cash for our WCI acquisition at the beginning of the year. Overall, we've continued to see strength in the housing market through the third quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins continue to be in line with or above our expectations. Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market as jobs are being created across the country and wages are generally moving higher.
The often discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into wage growth. And while much of the data collected by the government doesn't seem to reflect significant wage growth, the customers visiting our Welcome Home Centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment and an ability to afford today's more expensive homes.
Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the same sense that we have as business operators that the economic environment is generally strong and stable and improving. There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that the government's pro-business stance will result at least in job security and possibly some tax relief as well.
The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery is at least continuing to churn slowly, while at some times even seems to be giving way to a more definitive accelerated recovery and reversion to normal. We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years have been and continue to drive some pricing power as we move through the selling season -- as we moved through the selling season, and that is somewhat offset by land and construction cost increases.
Additionally, the economic realities of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic realities of higher rental rates are beginning to have and have had a rational impact on decision-making for first-time homebuyers as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market. Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market. And as we look ahead to the final quarter of 2017 and into '18, we are expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve.
Now against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our business -- operating business segments. To begin, our for-sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017 in spite of the storm activity described before. Deliveries for the third quarter increased 12%, and our gross margin and net margins improved 20 basis points and 40 basis points year-over-year. In the third quarter, new orders -- new order increases of 8% in volume and 12% in revenues was driven by year-over-year community count growth of 9%, while our new order pace remained constant at 3.4 homes per community per month. Our strongest markets were Southeast Florida, the Bay Area, Inland Empire and Portland, all with sales pace of over 5 homes per community per month, followed by Orlando, Tampa, California Coastal, Fresno and Seattle, all with over 4 homes per community per month.
We continue to see success with our digital marketing focus, driving better quality traffic to our communities. In our third quarter, our social media outreach generated over 115,000 leads, a 15% year-over-year increase. This allows us to operate at a very efficient level where our total advertising spend is now down to only 40 basis points of our revenue. Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool. This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently. We continued to see the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during the third quarter as we reduced our completed unsold inventory by 9% year-over-year and 21% sequentially without sacrificing margin. Additionally and directly related, we have also seen our incentives per home delivered decrease to 5.5% across the platform, which is our lowest sales incentive since 2006.
As you've heard from us in prior quarters, we are using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model. Fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tools and other technology initiatives as well, we continue to focus on overall operational efficiency, driving our SG&A to historic lows of 9.2% for the third quarter, which is the lowest in history. As I've said before, we are simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time.
As I'm sure you will recall, we closed on the WCI transaction in the first quarter of this year. This integration -- the integration of this acquisition has been executed seamlessly by Lennar's operating teams in the field and by our corporate support groups as well. With any combination, the hard work begins at closing. After all the fanfare, the real congratulations are due as results are achieved. The WCI combination and integration is now complete, and the results are coming in exactly as expected as Lennar's margins, SG&A and bottom line are performing as promised. We simply have an excellent management team with tremendous bandwidth to execute, and I'd like to take a brief pause to express my appreciation for that hard work and focus as well and for the opportunity to represent their work and accomplishment to our investor community.
In addition, as I noted earlier, we came to the end of the third quarter, Hurricane Harvey came through in Texas, and that was followed by Irma at the beginning of the fourth quarter. For homebuilders and homebuilding divisions on the business side, these storms present many cumbersome challenges, whether the storm is a direct hit or a near miss. Preparation for these storms requires a shutdown of the business operations with extensive preparation to batten down the hatches, so to speak. Associates need to care for their work environments and for their personal residence and families at the same time. After the storm, caring for our associates who might have been affected while surveying damage, attending to our customers and restarting business operation is equally difficult.
As we noted in our recent press release, we have come through these2 hurricanes quite well. We have attended to our associates, we have assessed the damage to our communities, we have attended to our customers and have restarted business operations. As we've said, our community sustained only minor damage, and due to the business disruption, we expect approximately 950 closings will be pushed from 2017 into 2018. Additionally, given the volume push into 2018, the positive trajectory of our margins will be temporarily impacted as well, and Bruce will give some additional detail.
With that said, the Lennar team has done an excellent job of managing through difficult times as these hurricanes affected geographies representing some 50% of our volume by closings. Considering both the all-cash acquisition of WCI and the effect of the 2 hurricanes, we are pleased to report that we've continued to focus on cash flow and on our balance sheet, we have maintained our 7% to 10% growth target and have focused on driving our operating cost down in order to drive bottom line and cash flow. These strategies have brought our balance sheet back to the position of a year ago with our debt to total cap at 39.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year. While the impact of the hurricanes will delay some of this progress over the next quarter, our strategy continues to be to drive strong cash flow and position our company for opportunity in the future.
Now let me briefly turn to our Financial Services segment. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well in the third quarter as it contributed operating earnings of over $49 million. While profits and projections are down slightly from last year, the decrease is primarily due to storm impacts and the slowdown in the refi business. Our core Financial Services business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and is innovating with new products like our recently announced creative student loan program. As the refi business has diminished over the past year, Lennar Financial Services continues to focus on product innovations as well as its non-Lennar retail business to replace those earnings. Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in just a few minutes.
LMC, Lennar's Multifamily Communities, our apartment segment, has also continued to grow and exceed expectations. LMC generated $9.1 million of earnings in the third quarter, driven by the sale of 2 of our merchant build apartment communities. While we continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we've also significantly grown LMV, our build to core program, which is cash flow-focused on building an apartment portfolio. In the third quarter, we started 836 apartment homes in 3 communities with a total development cost of $371 million. As of August 31, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 75 communities, totaling approximately 23,700 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.3 billion. These include 36 merchant build communities totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.2 billion and 39 LMV build-to-core communities totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion.
Our Multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations.
Turning to Rialto. Rialto contributed $3.2 million to the bottom line this quarter versus $5.9 million a year ago as our direct investments continued to be a drag on overall performance. These direct investments should be winding down over the next 2 quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into our higher returning businesses. This will enable us to efficiently lever our existing infrastructure and overhead and focus on our investment management business and RMF business segment. The investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base. As we've said before, our first 2 flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers, which has helped Rialto attract both existing and new investors to newer vehicles. Our third opportunity fund, which is approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments, has already invested or has under contract 43 transactions, involving the investment of over $850 million of that equity.
On the Rialto Mortgage Finance, RMF, side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF, which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable non-bank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 41st through 43rd securitization transactions during the quarter with net margins averaging 5.1%, selling over $236 million of RMF originated loans.
Finally, just to mention FivePoint, because I always have, as you all know, it's now an independent public company. Accordingly, the FivePoint management team will speak regularly for its asset base, including the very positive news recently on progress at Newhall Ranch. As I've said before, from a Lennar perspective, the new stock symbol, FPH, will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet as the value embedded in these extraordinary California assets is unlocked.
In conclusion, across our platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our third quarter and we're feeling very optimistic about our future. Given production deficits that persist, existing housing supply constraints, a pro-growth stance in government, a generally solid -- and generally solid employment fundamentals, we believe that the macro environment reads very positively for the next years and there is still a long runway in this recovery. We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market for the future. In spite of the short-term speed bumps that will temporarily slow progress in the fourth quarter, each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform and strengthen. People, assets and operations are all aligned as we begin to prepare for 2018. And with that, let me turn it over to Bruce."

Our net earnings for the third quarter were $249.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share. This compared to third quarter of 2016 net earnings of $235.8 million or $1.01 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.03 per",1441,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the third quarter were $249.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share. This compared to third quarter of 2016 net earnings of $235.8 million or $1.01 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.03 per diluted share impact due to a lower 31.1% tax rate as a result of energy credits available in the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the third quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 4% increase in average selling price to $375,000. As Stuart highlighted, our homebuilding team has focused on the dynamic pricing tool to price and deliver more efficiently, and it is reflected in our results. Our delivery machine achieved a backlog conversion ratio of 74.5%, while our completed unsold inventory dropped by 233 homes or 21% sequentially to the lowest level per community since 2012.
Our pricing efficiency is also noted as our sales incentives dropped 40 basis points year-over-year to 5.5%, which is an 11-year low and drove our gross margin outperformance. Our gross margin on home sales in the third quarter was 22.8% versus 22.6% in the prior year. Gross margin percents were once again its highest in our homebuilding east segment. The gross margin percentage was benefited by 30 basis points this quarter due to insurance recoveries. Direct construction costs were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $56 per square foot, driven by an approximate 5% increase in labor and 3% in material costs. Our SG&A percentage continues to drive lower as Q3 was 9.2% compared to 9.3% in the prior year. Included in our SG&A in the third quarter were transaction-related expenses related to the WCI acquisition, which had a 20 basis point impact, but were offset by insurance recoveries.
Our operating margin improved by 40 basis points for the quarter to 13.6%. Other income net was $2.8 million compared to $30 million in the prior period. In the prior period, other income net included the sale of a clubhouse and management fee income from one of our strategic joint ventures. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $9.7 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incur G&A while ramping up for future land sales. We opened 108 new communities during the quarter and closed 86 to end the quarter with 758 net active communities.
New home orders increased 8% and new order dollar value increased 14% for the quarter. And as we disclosed a few weeks ago, there were approximately 120 new home orders that were impacted due to Hurricane Harvey. Our sales pace was 3.4 sales per community per month, which was the same as the prior year. During the quarter, we purchased 12,700 homesites, totaling $498 million. We continue with our soft pivot strategy. However, this quarter also included the strategic purchase of 5,800 homesites in Maryland. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 176,000 homesites, of which 141,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled.
Our Financial Services business segment had operating earnings of $49.1 million compared to $53.2 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income decreased to $32.5 million from $38.3 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were $2.4 billion compared to $2.6 billion last year. Refinance volume was down 62% compared to the prior year, leading to a more competitive origination environment. Refinances now make up only 7% of our total originations. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 80% for the quarter compared to 82% in the prior year.
Our title company's profit increased slightly to $15.6 million during the quarter from $15 million in the prior year, and that was driven by a 6% increase in revenue and operating leverage from the higher revenues.
Our Florida realty brokerage operation acquired from WCI generated $1.3 million profit during the quarter.
Stuart provided the multifamily detail, so now I'll turn to Rialto. The Rialto segment produced operating earnings of $3.2 million compared to $5.9 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interests. The investment management business contributed $37 million of earnings, which includes $4.7 million of equity and earnings from real estate funds and $32.3 million of management fees and other, which includes $11.4 million of carried interest distributions. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate fund 1 and 2 now totals $108 million.
Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $236 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $12.5 million compared with $491 million and $27.2 million in the prior year, respectively, and that's before their D&A expenses. The decrease in earnings were primarily due to lower volume. Our direct investments had a loss of $9.4 million as we continued to make good progress on monetizing the remaining assets from the FDIC and early portfolio purchases. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $30.6 million for the quarter, and interest expense including the warehouse lines was $6.3 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $155 million of cash.
Our tax rate for the third quarter was 33.4%. The rate is higher than the prior year's third quarter of 31.1% due to the additional energy credits recognized in the prior year. These credits expired on December 31, 2016, and were only available to us for part of this year. Therefore, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 34% for the fourth quarter.
Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to total capital of 39.6%, a decline of 30 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with $565 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we redeemed early the $250 million of 6 7/8% senior notes that were acquired with the WCI transaction. We continued to significantly reduce our cost of capital as we improve our leverage ratio.
S&P upgraded our corporate credit rating during the quarter to BB+. Stockholders equity increased to $7.6 billion, and now our book value per share grew to $32.11 per share.
Now I'd like to update our goals for closing out 2017, starting with deliveries. We were right on track to achieve a 90% backlog conversion ratio for the fourth quarter before the storms hit. Using the same backlog conversion ratio and adjusting for the 950 homes that we talked about being pushed into 2018 now calculates to between 8,200 and 8,300 deliveries, which is what we are now projecting for the fourth quarter. Based on the projected closings in our backlog, we are increasing our average sales price guidance to between $380,000 and $385,000 for the year.
We expect our fourth quarter gross margin percentage to be between 22% and 22.25%. This should bring our full-year gross margin percentage to 22%. The fourth quarter gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points as a result of 950 deliveries being pushed into 2018, and therefore, a higher field expense per remaining delivery. Additionally, these deliveries were primarily in Florida, which has the highest gross margin percentages in the company. We continue to see improvement in the SG&A line, and we should see another record low SG&A percentage in the fourth quarter as we are projecting between 8.5% and 8.6%.
Turning to Financial Services. As a result of the significant decline in refinances, lack of resale inventory and the storm impact, our fourth quarter is now projected to be in a range of $35 million to $40 million. Rialto is now expected to generate profits for the fourth quarter of $2 million to $5 million, which will bring it to about $25 million for the year. Multifamily is expected to be approximately $35 million to $37 million, which will bring it to approximately $70 million for the full year.
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, in this category, we've been highlighting all year that the fourth quarter will generate the bulk of the profits. The fourth quarter is expected to generate approximately $90 million to $95 million, which will bring the full year at the lower end of the previous range that we gave of $70 million to $80 million of profit. Corporate G&A is expected to be 2.1% of total company revenues for the fourth quarter, and our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities. We expect our balance sheet to again end the year with strong liquidity, positioning us well as we enter 2018.
Let me now turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

But look, dynamic pricing, our dynamic pricing model helps us in a number of ways and really helps us focus in order to drive margin and even ASP growth. It starts with a proper alignment of our production machine and our sales machine, recognizing that as we near completion, it's time to sell. That has really enabled us to bring down our incentives generally. And as I noted, our incentive levels have come down to the lowest level since 2006 at 5.5%, and I feel that, that's very directly tied to the initiatives in and around our dynamic pricing. Now another part of that is the driving of our inventory levels. We've seen a number of our divisions benefit in both generating pricing power, driving down -- and driving down incentives by being able to reduce standing inventory. Standing inventory homes are generally the ones that come with the greatest discounts or the greatest incentives, and getting people tuned into properly aligning pricing and delivery and clearing inventory earlier has helped that. So Jon, do you want to add to that?"

The efficient delivery of the homes that Stuart's describing is really enabled by providing our division the data so that they can pull the right levers at the right time to match sales pace with construction pace. And as Stuart mentioned, the low inventory levels. Last quarter, we were down to 1.25 quarter homes per community on average of completed homes that were unsold. I don't have the data as to whether that's a record low. But I don't personally remember it ever being that low. And by orderly selling the homes through the construction process, having a buyer who's mortgage approved, ready to close as the home is completed really enables us to reduce the incentives, both helping ASP and margin. I'd also want to note that we talked for several years about the impact of our Next Gen platform, and there, our sales are up 41% year-over-year and now represent just about 6% of our company's total sales. That's also a high mark for Next Gen sales. And ASP of Next Gen is almost $490,000 compared to the company average of $375,000. So it's a number of initiatives that I think cumulatively are giving us the results that we speak to."

We're very focused on cash flow and using cash flow to both pay down debt and ultimately look at stock buyback. But stock buyback comes in a number of different forms. Remember that we had initially targeted WCI to be a 50-50 stock and cash transaction that ended up being a full -- an all-cash transaction, which was, in effect, a large stock buyback. It's fully integrated. It's well executed. And we're becoming a real cash flow program and machine, which affords us the ability to target transactions to use cash in a variety of ways. And we're fully confident that as we move forward, our strategies are going to reflect on our returns on equity and on capital, and perhaps more importantly, in very positive and constructive way. We've mapped out our strategy for The Street to consider. The execution has been flowing in course.

As it relates to Rialto, we've had some bumps on the road which we've articulated over time. We still need another couple of quarters to clear those bumps and to start striding forward, and we have every confidence that we'll be able to do that also. But if you look at Rialto as a private equity asset manager and investment manager, if you look at Rialto's RMF execution, those 2 isolated go-forward programs are best-in-class.

Steve, it's got take some time to actually ferret some of this out. But overall, long term, given the loss of residences in a generally constrained market to begin with, you're more likely to see a supply shortage that as homes get repaired, there's really very little fade in terms of value and pricing. As homes get repaired, the value comes back and I think that you're going to see a shorter-term negative turn into a longer-term positive. And that's traditionally what we've seen in storm-affected areas through many decades of having dealt with it. It takes a little bit of time for things to get back on their feet. And as we talked about the loss of or the postponement push of some closings from fourth quarter into 2018 and some directly related to homes to sell that have to be repaired and ultimately brought online, those homes will get repaired. They will be sold probably at the price that was expected with very little re-trade. And I don't think that, that will be the impact to margin.

And I guess my question relates to what you think -- what inning do you think we are in, in terms of not necessarily digital marketing and dynamic pricing per se, but the ability of the technology initiatives that you see on the table right now being able to benefit the margin structure of your business over the next few years. Like what inning do you think we are in. And what do you think the first-mover advantages are in these technology-related investments, like how much can you keep, do you think, relative to your competition?"

And there's a big, big range of opportunity in the technology field to refine this -- the homebuilding business that has only started. We've only started to break the surface of some of these areas, and we are really invigorated by it. Both myself, Jon, Rick and our whole management team are really focused on this. And I would encourage you, at some point, to when you're down here, Steve, to come visit and make sure that you see our innovation center, which we've done on our third floor here. We are fully focused on thinking about how technologies can create efficiencies through our system in every part of our business. And we think that there's a long way to go. Your question, of course, is so, how much room is there to enhance SG&A or to bring SG&A down. And I can't quantify that right now. But I think we've just started to figure out how to really build that better mousetrap that I keep talking about. Now your next question is to what extent is there a first-mover example -- advantage, excuse me. I'm not going to say a first-mover advantage because I believe that others can learn and jump on board. But it's not about first-mover advantage; it's about incorporating these technologies is hard, hard work. It's hard work to learn and understand how they work and then to transport that knowledge out to multiple divisions in multiple geographies is a very complex management engagement. And it's something that we work on every day. So as you've watched the improvement of migrating from conventional to digital marketing, that seems like a kind of binary, oh, let's just make a movement, but it has come with a learning curve, a testing curve, a proven curve and then an implementation curve that is really difficult to overcome. So it's not a first mover advantage in a traditional sense, it's the sooner you start, the more time you put behind you in doing the hard work and the heavy lifting that it takes to actually implement these programs. So our work is not to run to get ahead of others, it's to move hard, work hard every single day to implement and to garner that 1, 2 or 10 basis points per week, per month, per quarter of improvement that we've been articulating as we've gone through the past years."

As people understand the benefits of these technologies, the change management aspect of that is easier to address and to incorporate the 2.0 version and 3.0 version. So I think that's -- whether it's first mover or not, the sooner you get started, the sooner you're going to get to better and better execution of new technologies."

And congrats on getting through all the challenges; weather-related, obviously. It was a huge undertaking, I'm sure. First question. Stuart, I wanted to circle back to the comments you had in your press release actually, and I believe you had this even on your initial -- your prior release around estimations of impact. And what you said in the release, again, today, was that you expect an increased demand in homes in the storm-related areas, which will result in a broader range of opportunities as we look towards 2018. So I just wanted to see if you could give a little more detail around that statement. From our perspective, when you think about the impact of the storms, and I think you've alluded to this in previous questions, it seems like it's more around fixing existing homes, getting insurance recoveries, power related, et cetera. Certainly, there might be some incremental demand for new homes in terms of maybe people wanting to move out of a damaged home. But just wanted to get a sense for -- you said you've been through this before, what specifically -- is there an expectation in terms of maybe incremental new home demand going up 5%, 10%, 15% in the respective states? Or is it more of a broader statement? And when you say a broader range of opportunities, if there are certain specific types of initiatives or certain types of communities are pivoting, or maybe for Multifamily. What exactly do you mean by that?"

There are several aspects of this that are just different pieces. One is just the overall new capital investment as you're rebuilding various markets. There's going to be tremendous capital invested in infrastructure that's going to create new jobs, that's going to create wage growth, that's going to allow people to just have more spend as they're looking at buying homes just in general. The second aspect of it is as you look at where the storms hit, particularly in Houston, let's just focus on Houston right now, there's going to be parts of the market where FEMA will shut down and will not allow homes to be built in those areas. As a result of that, for folks like us that have a lot of land in other parts of the market, more the upland areas, that's going to create, over time, just long-term fundamental demand. The other aspect of it, and I'd put this sort of in both markets, the Florida markets and the Houston markets, as you look at what happened with regard to the storms, the newer homes, the newer production, the newer construction fared so much better than the used home market, the existing market. As a result of that, you're seeing a continued shift of people saying, ""I'd rather live in something that's going to weather the storm than be impacted by the storm again and again."" But those are just a few aspects of the opportunities that exist out there that creates that longer-term fundamental demand in the aftermath of these storms."

It's sort of fundamentally a reallocation of capital from insurance companies to local economies that drive those local economies creating, as Rick said, wage growth, job growth and demand for housing.

I guess you've identified that of the 22% to 22.25%, 50 bps of an impact from deliveries. And then you also mentioned a negative gross margin mix from the delayed Florida delivery, a couple of questions here on this. I guess, just to understand. Was the negative gross margin mix in addition to that 50 bps impact from the delayed closings, which sounded like a little bit more of negative fixed cost absorption. And if so, or if it's not, it seems like the prior guidance was pointing to a 4Q gross margin in the high 23s. So just was curious what changed outside of the 50 bp hit, because also, obviously, your 3Q gross margin came in above expectations. So I was just curious if there was other shifts going around or what really fully impacted on top of the hurricane hit, the gross margin outlook."
