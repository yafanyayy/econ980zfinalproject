323857,418738040,1139891,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2017",2017-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brad, and good morning. 2016 was a year of significant progress and substantial achievement for Chesapeake Energy. We are stronger today than any other time in our history. Looking back across this challenging period of low commodity prices, we",855,"Thank you, Brad, and good morning. 2016 was a year of significant progress and substantial achievement for Chesapeake Energy. We are stronger today than any other time in our history. Looking back across this challenging period of low commodity prices, we successfully delivered on our strategy to delever, derisk and simplify our balance sheet while driving improved capital and operating efficiencies and also driving industry-leading low production costs. The company is positioned to differentially perform through further debt reduction and development of our high-quality asset portfolio in the coming years.
The most significant accomplishment for 2016 included successful liability management initiatives that resulted in reduced debt, refinanced near-term maturities and restoring a reasonable cost of capital. Other major accomplishments included, one, divesting the Barnett asset, eliminating an annual negative impact of $200 million to $300 million in EBITDA, principally due to MBC payments in burdens and gathering and firm transportation agreements associated with the asset; two, renegotiating midstream contracts, including new gathering agreements in the Powder River Basin and Mid-Continent assets; three, divesting of more than $2 billion in noncore, nonoperated and/or low EBITDA-generating assets; four, significantly improving capital efficiency with new technology, better engineering and greater recoveries, resulting in higher-quality, more efficient well economics; and five, reassessing our entire portfolio and confirming the long-term economic strength of our asset. We have previously shared the strength of our portfolio consisting of 11.3 billion barrels of net recoverable resources, 5,600 locations with an internal rate of return of greater than 40% and a projected growth rate of 5% to 15% annually through 2020 and normalized flat pricing of $3 per Mcf at $60 per barrel of oil.
We crushed [ph] our cash cost in 2016. We reduced our total production expenses by approximately $336 million or 28% per barrel of oil equivalent of production compared to 2015. We also reduced our total GP&T expenses by approximately $264 million or 7% per BOE of production compared to 2015. These improvements totaled $600 million of annual savings, and we are not done.
Our total production in 2016 averaged over 635,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down just 0.3% after adjusting for asset sales, while we reduced our total capital expenditures by approximately 53%. This excludes proved property acquisitions and the repurchase of volumetric production payment transaction. These accomplishments reflect the power, strength and resiliency of our portfolio and the focus of our talented employees.
Last week, we released capital and production guidance for 2017. We are committed to improving upon our 2016 performance, continuing the transformation of our balance sheet and increasing our productivity and capital efficiency. We included service cost escalation in our capital guidance, but we will utilize our operating strengths and purchasing power to minimize any potential cost increases. We will be working to accelerate [ph] our stated debt reduction target of $2 billion to $3 billion over the next few years through additional asset sale. Our capital program is designed to achieve cash flow neutrality in 2018 as we progress forward our targeted net debt to EBITDA multiple of 2x.
After planning for a lower turn in line count in 2017 in the first quarter, our production volumes are projected to return to growth in the second quarter of this year. We believe this strong growth trajectory will be driven by our oil assets, most notably the Eagle Ford, the Mid-Continent and some exciting progress coming from the Powder River Basin. Meanwhile, we expect our gas volumes will be primarily driven by the Haynesville and Marcellus. We are moving to more pad drilling in all of our operating areas, and we anticipate we'll generate a strong production ramp in the second half of the year.
Our production guidance for 2017 is projected to deliver an exit-to-exit increase in total production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately 7%, of which oil is projected to have an exit-to-exit increase of 10%. We expect this oil [ph] to accelerate even more in 2018, with oil production projected to increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 by more than 20%. 
Our [ph] portfolio across 6 major basins is getting stronger due to growing use of longer laterals, more aggressive fracture stimulations and the shortening of our reinvestment cycle, all leading to greater productivity and higher cash flows for Chesapeake.
To reiterate, total production growth through 2020 is expected to range between 5% and 15% per year. Our corporate strategies of financial discipline, profitable and efficient growth of captured resources, business development and exploration remain unchanged. 2017 is an important year for Chesapeake, a year where we pivot from defense to offense. As noted, we are committed to removing an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet and are plans poised [ph] to execute upon this reduction sooner rather than later. We're focused on expanding our margins and, thereby, our EBITDA through greater oil production and our unrelenting drive to lower all of our cash costs.
I'll now pass the call to Nick to share some additional financial information."

We're very pleased with our 2016 results and the significant improvements in our capital efficiency, asset performance, cost structure and liquidity that Doug highlighted in his comments.Starting with our liq",845,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our 2016 results and the significant improvements in our capital efficiency, asset performance, cost structure and liquidity that Doug highlighted in his comments.
Starting with our liquidity position, as a reminder, we have effectively taken over $4 billion of leverage and preferred stock out of our capital structure over the last 16 months. That's $2.6 billion of debt inclusive of our December 2015 debt exchange and $1.4 billion liquidation value of our preferred shares for common shares.
Importantly, through these transactions and several incremental refinancings completed in 2016, we removed or refinanced approximately $2.7 billion of near-term debt that was maturing or could be put to us in 2017 and 2018, primarily through refinancing, with only $77 million remaining due or puttable in that period.
Today, we have liquidity of approximately $3.4 billion, including a projected $300 million of cash on hand at the end of February, with no borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility. We're pleased with this liquidity position, but our goal is to reduce our debt even further. And as Doug mentioned, we remain prudent [ph] and patient in working toward removing another $2 billion to $3 billion of debt off our books.
We continue to achieve significant progress in lowering our production expenses and expect it to decline even further in 2017 on a BOE of production basis. However, our G&A ticked up slightly year-over-year and will continue to increase in 2017, primarily as a result of costs moving from LOE to G&A following our significant asset sales.
We continue to see opportunities to improve efficiency around our reduced operating footprint, having sold nearly 10,000 operated wells in the last year, and with that, having removed the maintenance of over 30 field offices, significant IT and communications equipment, invoices to process and decreasing the burden on several other administrative functions. Given the movement between G&A and LOE, we believe the best way to measure the improvement is to [ph] our combined LOE and G&A per BOE of production decrease by 8% year-over-year.
We also continue to see our GP&T expenses improve, decreasing by approximately 7% on a BOE of production basis in 2016 and forecasted to decrease by approximately 10% in 2017. With our acreage [ph] on the Barnett Shale, the restructuring of our Mid-Continent and Powder River Basin gathering agreements and amendments to certain firm transportation agreements in the Haynesville and Eagle Ford operating areas, we have seen a reduction, a $5.5 billion reduction, in our future GP&T commitments since the end of 2014 and a $2.9 billion reduction since the end of 2015. We have additional commitments that will step down going into 2018 as well as expected synergies associated with volume growth in our key basins, and so we anticipate continuing the trend of decreasing GP&T costs on a per unit basis beyond this year.
This work continues in 2017 with our buydown of certain crude oil and natural gas transportation commitments this quarter for roughly $390 million in cash. The buydown of these contracts will remove approximately $560 million from our future transportation commitments, further optimizes our long-haul transportation plans and significantly improves the margin in our marketing group over time. We have provided a slide on this earlier today projecting how these buydowns have improved our GP&T commitments in the coming periods.
We also continue to improve our netbacks for our liquids production in various basins by accessing new markets for hydrocarbons and optimizing our point-of-sale further downstream in several cases versus Our marketing team continues to have success in improving our realized pricing production, and we look forward to further success. 
On the A&D front, with the closing of our 2 Haynesville this quarter, we have received approximately $2.2 billion in net proceeds from asset sales that were signed during 2016. Like we have said before, we expect to continue to optimize our portfolio in 2017 and use asset sales proceeds for further debt reduction.
Finally for 2017, we currently have approximately 71% of our projected gas production hedged at $3.07 per Mcf and approximately 68% [ph] of our projected oil production hedged at approximately $50.19 per barrel using midpoints of our production guidance. With these hedges in place, our cash flow is not materially impacted by the recent decline we have seen in natural gas prices. We've also hedged a meaningful portion of our 2018 gas production a little over $3 per Mcf. We have stated before that our 2016 achievements have allowed us to focus on our operations instead of our obligations. Our return to production growth during 2017 sets Chesapeake for an even stronger year for 2018. This production growth and the associated growth in cash flow accrues much more directly to our equity holders than in the past, given our significantly decreased total leverage and improved capital structure. We look forward to executing on these plans that deliver these enhanced returns to shareholders.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

So we're moving rigs back and forth between those depending on what we'll also need to drill and what also need to complete and then really creates a lot of efficiency for us and kind of the regional area. In the Mid-Con, what we're looking at is we have 2 rigs running in the Oswego right now. The cycle times. are really impressive there. The wells are forming great. The Wedge play, it is evolving.

And so when we went back into the field, the completions team took a look at the completion design on that Nio well that was the Barton, which is basically the best Nio well in the country from a cumulative basis. The new wells have received a larger frac. They are not expanded lateral so they didn't perform as quite as well as the Barnett. The initial well that we brought on is still making about 1230 barrels of oil a day, 60% are BOE a day, 60% of that is oil after almost 30 days of online. So we are seeing a response that is very positive so now we're going to move as we go into a Nio program down the road we will be putting longer laterals and larger fracs on those Nio wells and expect to have good stuff."

We are stronger today than any other time in our history. Looking back across this challenging period of low commodity prices, we successfully delivered on our strategy to delever, derisk and simplify our balance sheet while driving improved capital and operating efficiencies and also driving industry-leading, low production costs. The company is positioned to differentially perform through further debt reduction and development of our high-quality asset portfolio in the coming years.
The most significant accomplishment for 2016 included successful liability management initiatives that resulted in reduced debt, refinanced near-term maturities and restoring a reasonable cost of capital. Other major accomplishments included, one, divesting the Barnett asset, eliminating an annual negative impact of $200 million to $300 million in EBITDA, principally due to MBC payments in burdens and gathering and firm transportation agreements associated with the asset; two, renegotiating midstream contracts, including new gathering agreements in the Powder River Basin and Mid-Continent assets; three, divesting of more than $2 billion in noncore, nonoperated and/or low EBITDA-generating assets; four, significantly improving capital efficiency with new technology, better engineering and greater recoveries, resulting in higher-quality, more efficient well economics; and five, reassessing our entire portfolio and confirming the long-term economic strength of our asset. We have previously shared the strength of our portfolio consisting of 11.3 billion barrels of net recoverable resources, 5,600 locations with an internal rate of return of greater than 40% and a projected growth rate of 5% to 15% annually through 2020 and normalized flat pricing of $3 per Mcf at $60 per barrel of oil.
We crushed our cash costs in 2016. We reduced our total production expenses by approximately $336 million or 28% per barrel of oil equivalent of production compared to 2015. We also reduced our total GP&T expenses by approximately $264 million or 7% per BOE of production compared to 2015. These improvements totaled $600 million of annual savings, and we are not done.
Our total production in 2016 averaged over 635,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down just 0.3% after adjusting for asset sales, while we reduced our total capital expenditures by approximately 53%. This excludes proved property acquisitions and the repurchase of volumetric production payment transaction. These accomplishments reflect the power, strength and resiliency of our portfolio and the focus of our talented employees.
Last week, we released capital and production guidance for 2017. We are committed to improving upon our 2016 performance, continuing the transformation of our balance sheet and increasing our productivity and capital efficiency. We included service cost escalation in our capital guidance, but we will utilize our operating strengths and purchasing power to minimize any potential cost increases. We will be working to accelerate our stated debt reduction target of $2 billion to $3 billion over the next few years through additional asset sale. Our capital program is designed to achieve cash flow neutrality in 2018 as we progress toward our targeted net debt to EBITDA multiple of 2x.
After planning for a lower turn in line count in 2017 in the first quarter, our production volumes are projected to return to growth in the second quarter of this year. We believe this strong growth trajectory will be driven by our oil assets, most notably the Eagle Ford, the Mid-Continent and some exciting progress coming from the Powder River Basin. Meanwhile, we expect our gas volumes will be primarily driven by the Haynesville and Marcellus. We are moving to more pad drilling in all of our operating areas, and we anticipate we'll generate a strong production ramp in the second half of the year.
Our production guidance for 2017 is projected to deliver an exit-to-exit increase in total production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately 7%, of which oil is projected to have an exit-to-exit increase of 10%. We expect this oil growth to accelerate even more in 2018, with oil production projected to increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 by more than 20%. 
Our portfolio across 6 major basins is getting stronger due to growing use of longer laterals, more aggressive fracture stimulations and the shortening of our reinvestment cycle, all leading to greater productivity and higher cash flows for Chesapeake.
To reiterate, total production growth through 2020 is expected to range between 5% and 15% per year. Our corporate strategies of financial discipline, profitable and efficient growth of captured resources, business development and exploration remain unchanged. 2017 is an important year for Chesapeake, a year where we pivot from defense to offense. As noted, we are committed to removing an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet and our plans to execute upon this reduction sooner rather than later. We're focused on expanding our margins and, thereby, our EBITDA through greater oil production and our unrelenting drive to lower all of our cash costs.
I'll now pass the call to Nick to share some additional financial information."
323857,418738040,1140036,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2017",2017-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our 2016 results and the significant improvements in our capital efficiency, asset performance, cost structure and liquidity that Doug highlighted in his comments.Starting with our liq",858,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our 2016 results and the significant improvements in our capital efficiency, asset performance, cost structure and liquidity that Doug highlighted in his comments.
Starting with our liquidity position, as a reminder, we have effectively taken over $4 billion of leverage in preferred stock out of our capital structure over the last 16 months. That's $2.6 billion of debt inclusive of our December 2015 debt exchange and $1.4 billion liquidation value of our preferred shares for common shares.
Importantly, through these transactions and several incremental refinancings completed in 2016, we removed or refinanced approximately $2.7 billion of near-term debt that was maturing or could be put to us in 2017 and 2018 primarily through refinancing, with only $77 million remaining due or puttable in that period.
Today, we have liquidity of approximately $3.4 billion, including a projected $300 million of cash on hand at the end of February, with no borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility. We're pleased with this liquidity position, but our goal is to reduce our debt even further. And as Doug mentioned, we remain prudent and patient in working toward removing another $2 billion to $3 billion of debt off our books.
We continue to achieve significant progress in lowering our production expenses and expect it to decline even further in 2017 on a BOE of production basis. However, our G&A ticked up slightly year-over-year and will continue to increase in 2017, primarily as a result of costs moving from LOE to G&A following our significant asset sales.
We continue to see opportunities to improve efficiency around our reduced operating footprint, having sold nearly 10,000 operated wells in the last year, and with that, having removed the maintenance of over 30 field offices, significant IT and communications equipment, invoices to process and decreasing the burden on several other administrative functions. Given the movement between G&A and LOE, we believe the best way to measure the improvement is to net our combined LOE and G&A per BOE of production decrease by 8% year-over-year.
We also continue to see our GP&T expenses improve, decreasing by approximately 7% on a BOE of production basis in 2016 and forecasted to decrease by approximately 10% in 2017. With our exit from the Barnett Shale, the restructuring of our Mid-Continent and Powder River Basin gathering agreements and amendments to certain firm transportation agreements in the Haynesville and Eagle Ford operating areas, we have seen a reduction -- a $5.5 billion reduction in our future GP&T commitments since the end of 2014 and a $2.9 billion reduction since the end of 2015. We have additional commitments that will step down going into 2018 as well as expected synergies associated with volume growth in our key basins, and so we anticipate continuing the trend of decreasing GP&T costs on a per unit basis beyond this year.
This work continues in 2017 with our buydown of certain crude oil and natural gas transportation commitments this quarter for roughly $390 million in cash. The buydown of these contracts will remove approximately $560 million from our future transportation commitments, further optimizes our long-haul transportation plans and significantly improves the margin in our marketing group over time. We have provided a slide on this earlier today projecting how these buydowns have improved our GP&T commitments in the coming periods.
We also continue to improve our netbacks for our liquids production in various basins by accessing new markets for our hydrocarbons and optimizing our point-of-sale further downstream in several cases versus at the wellhead. Our marketing team continues to have success in improving our realized pricing for oil production, and we look forward to further success. 
On the A&D front, with the closing of our 2 Haynesville assets back at just this quarter, we have received approximately $2 billion -- $2.2 billion in net proceeds from asset sales that were signed during 2016. Like we have said before, we expect to continue to optimize our portfolio in 2017 and use asset sales proceeds for further debt reduction.
Finally, for 2017, we currently have approximately 71% of our projected gas production hedged at $3.07 per Mcf and approximately 68% of our projected oil production hedged at approximately $50.19 per barrel using midpoints of our production guidance. With these hedges in place, our cash flow is not materially impacted by the recent decline we have seen in natural gas prices. We've also hedged a meaningful portion of our 2018 gas production a little over $3 per Mcf.
We have stated before that our 2016 achievements have allowed us to focus on our operations instead of our obligations. Our return to production growth during 2017 sets Chesapeake up for an even stronger year in 2018. This production growth and the associated growth in cash flow accrues much more directly to our equity holders than in the past, given our significantly decreased total leverage and improved capital structure. We look forward to executing on these plans to deliver these enhanced returns to our shareholders.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

So we're moving rigs back and forth between those, depending on what wells we need to drill and what wells we need to complete. And it really creates a lot of efficiency for us and kind of the regional area. In the Mid-Con, what we're looking at is we have 2 rigs running in the Oswego right now. The cycle times are really impressive there. The wells are forming great. The Wedge play, it is evolving. And as we get more and more data, we'll start to look at do we ramp up, how do we manage that program for us.

We are stronger today than any other time in our history. Looking back across this challenging period of low commodity prices, we successfully delivered on our strategy to delever, derisk and simplify our balance sheet while driving improved capital and operating efficiencies and also driving industry-leading, low production costs. The company is positioned to differentially perform through further debt reduction and development of our high-quality asset portfolio in the coming years.
The most significant accomplishment for 2016 included successful liability management initiatives that resulted in reduced debt, refinanced near-term maturities and restoring a reasonable cost of capital. Other major accomplishments included, one, divesting the Barnett asset, eliminating an annual negative impact of $200 million to $300 million in EBITDA, principally due to MBC payments in burdens and gathering and firm transportation agreements associated with the asset; two, renegotiating midstream contracts, including new gathering agreements in the Powder River Basin and Mid-Continent assets; three, divesting of more than $2 billion in noncore, nonoperated and/or low EBITDA-generating assets; four, significantly improving capital efficiency with new technology, better engineering and greater recoveries, resulting in higher-quality, more efficient well economics; and five, reassessing our entire portfolio and confirming the long-term economic strength of our assets. We have previously shared the strength of our portfolio, consisting of 11.3 billion barrels of net recoverable resources, 5,600 locations with an internal rate of return of greater than 40% and a projected growth rate of 5% to 15% annually through 2020 and normalized flat pricing of $3 per Mcf at $60 per barrel of oil.
We crushed our cash costs in 2016. We reduced our total production expenses by approximately $336 million or 28% per barrel of oil equivalent of production compared to 2015. We also reduced our total GP&T expenses by approximately $264 million or 7% per BOE of production compared to 2015. These improvements totaled $600 million of annual savings, and we are not done.
Our total production in 2016 averaged over 635,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down just 0.3% after adjusting for asset sales, while we reduced our total capital expenditures by approximately 53%. This excludes proved property acquisitions and the repurchase of volumetric production payment transaction. These accomplishments reflect the power, strength and resiliency of our portfolio and the focus of our talented employees.
Last week, we released capital and production guidance for 2017. We are committed to improving upon our 2016 performance, continuing the transformation of our balance sheet and increasing our productivity and capital efficiency. We included service cost escalation in our capital guidance, but we will utilize our operating strengths and purchasing power to minimize any potential cost increases. We will be working to accelerate our stated debt reduction target of $2 billion to $3 billion over the next few years through additional asset sale. Our capital program is designed to achieve cash flow neutrality in 2018 as we progress toward our targeted net debt to EBITDA multiple of 2x.
After planning for a lower turn in line count in 2017 in the first quarter, our production volumes are projected to return to growth in the second quarter of this year. We believe this strong growth trajectory will be driven by our oil assets, most notably the Eagle Ford, the Mid-Continent and some exciting progress coming from the Powder River Basin. Meanwhile, we expect our gas volumes will be primarily driven by the Haynesville and Marcellus. We are moving to more pad drilling in all of our operating areas, which we anticipate we'll generate a strong production ramp in the second half of the year.
Our production guidance for 2017 is projected to deliver an exit-to-exit increase in total production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately 7%, of which oil is projected to have an exit-to-exit increase of 10%. We expect this oil growth to accelerate even more in 2018, with oil production projected to increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 by more than 20%. 
Our portfolio across 6 major basins is getting stronger due to growing use of longer laterals, more aggressive fracture stimulations and the shortening of our reinvestment cycle, all leading to greater productivity and higher cash flows for Chesapeake.
To reiterate, total production growth through 2020 is expected to range between 5% and 15% per year. Our corporate strategies of financial discipline, profitable and efficient growth of captured resources, business development and exploration remain unchanged. 2017 is an important year for Chesapeake, a year where we pivot from defense to offense. As noted, we are committed to removing an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet and our plan is to execute upon this reduction sooner rather than later. We're focused on expanding our margins and, thereby, our EBITDA through greater oil production and our unrelenting drive to lower all of our cash costs.
I'll now pass the call to Nick to share some additional financial information."
323857,418738040,1140348,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2017",2017-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our 2016 results and the significant improvements in our capital efficiency, asset performance, cost structure and liquidity that Doug highlighted in his comments.Starting with our liq",858,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our 2016 results and the significant improvements in our capital efficiency, asset performance, cost structure and liquidity that Doug highlighted in his comments.
Starting with our liquidity position. As a reminder, we have effectively taken over $4 billion of leverage in preferred stock out of our capital structure over the last 16 months. That's $2.6 billion of debt inclusive of our December 2015 debt exchange and $1.4 billion liquidation value of our preferred shares for common shares.
Importantly, through these transactions and several incremental refinancings completed in 2016, we've removed or refinanced approximately $2.7 billion of near-term debt that was maturing or could be put to us in 2017 and 2018, primarily through refinancing, with only $77 million remaining due or puttable [ph] in that period.
Today, we have liquidity of approximately $3.4 billion, including a projected $300 million of cash on hand at the end of February, with no borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility. We're pleased with this liquidity position, but our goal is to reduce our debt even further. And as Doug mentioned, we remain prudently impatient in working toward removing another $2 billion to $3 billion of debt off our books.
We continue to achieve significant progress in lowering our production expenses and expect it to decline even further in 2017 on a BOE of production basis. However, our G&A ticked up slightly year-over-year and will continue to increase in 2017, primarily as a result of costs moving from LOE to G&A following our significant asset sales.
We continue to see opportunities to improve efficiency around our reduced operating footprint, having sold nearly 10,000 operated wells in the last year, and with that, having removed the maintenance of over 30 field offices, significant IT and communications equipment, invoices to process and decreasing the burden on several other administrative functions. Given the movement between G&A and LOE, we believe the best way to measure the improvement is to note that our combined LOE and G&A per BOE of production decreased by 8% year-over-year.
We also continue to see our GP&T expenses improve, decreasing by approximately 7% on a BOE of production basis in 2016 and forecasted to decrease by approximately 10% in 2017. With our exit from the Barnett Shale, the restructuring of our Mid-Continent and Powder River Basin gathering agreements and amendments to certain firm transportation agreements in the Haynesville and Eagle Ford operating areas, we have seen a reduction -- a $5.5 billion reduction in our future GP&T commitments since the end of 2014 and a $2.9 billion reduction since the end of 2015. We have additional commitments that will step down going into 2018 as well as expected synergies associated with volume growth in our key basins, and so we anticipate continuing the trend of decreasing GP&T costs on a per unit basis beyond this year.
This work continues in 2017 with our buydown of certain crude oil and natural gas transportation commitments this quarter for roughly $390 million in cash. The buydown of these contracts will remove approximately $560 million from our future transportation commitments, further optimizes our long-haul transportation plans and significantly improves the margin in our marketing group over time. We have provided a slide on this earlier today projecting how these buydowns have improved our GP&T commitments in the coming periods.
We also continue to improve our netbacks for our liquids production in various basins by accessing new markets for our hydrocarbons and optimizing our point-of-sale further downstream in several cases versus at the wellhead. Our marketing team continues to have success in improving our realized pricing for oil production, and we look forward to further success. 
On the A&D front, with the closing of our 2 Haynesville asset packages this quarter, we have received approximately $2 billion -- $2.2 billion in net proceeds from asset sales that were signed during 2016. Like we have said before, we expect to continue to optimize our portfolio in 2017 and use asset sales proceeds for further debt reduction.
Finally, for 2017, we currently have approximately 71% of our projected gas production hedged at $3.07 per Mcf and approximately 68% of our projected oil production hedged at approximately $50.19 per barrel using midpoints of our production guidance. With these hedges in place, our cash flow is not materially impacted by the recent decline we have seen in natural gas prices. We've also hedged a meaningful portion of our 2018 gas production at a little over $3 per Mcf.
We have stated before that our 2016 achievements have allowed us to focus on our operations instead of our obligations. Our return to production growth during 2017 sets Chesapeake up for an even stronger year in 2018. This production growth and the associated growth in cash flow accrues much more directly to our equity holders than in the past, given our significantly decreased total leverage and improved capital structure. We look forward to executing on these plans to deliver these enhanced returns to our shareholders.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

So we're moving rigs back and forth between those, depending on what wells we need to drill and what wells we need to complete. And it really creates a lot of efficiency for us and kind of the regional area. In the Mid-Con, what we're looking at is we have 2 rigs running in the Oswego right now. The cycle times are really impressive there. The wells are forming great. The Wedge play, it is evolving.

We are stronger today than any other time in our history. Looking back across this challenging period of low commodity prices, we successfully delivered on our strategy to delever, derisk and simplify our balance sheet while driving improved capital and operating efficiencies and also driving industry-leading, low production costs. The company is positioned to differentially perform through further debt reduction and development of our high-quality asset portfolio in the coming years.
The most significant accomplishment for 2016 included successful liability management initiatives that resulted in reduced debt, refinanced near-term maturities and restoring a reasonable cost of capital. Other major accomplishments included, one, divesting the Barnett asset, eliminating an annual negative impact of $200 million to $300 million in EBITDA, principally due to MBC payments in burdens and gathering and firm transportation agreements associated with the asset; two, renegotiating midstream contracts, including new gathering agreements in the Powder River Basin and Mid-Continent assets; three, divesting of more than $2 billion in noncore, nonoperated and/or low EBITDA-generating assets; four, significantly improving capital efficiency with new technology, better engineering and greater recoveries, resulting in higher-quality, more efficient well economics; and five, reassessing our entire portfolio and confirming the long-term economic strength of our assets. We have previously shared the strength of our portfolio, consisting of 11.3 billion barrels of net recoverable resources, 5,600 locations with an internal rate of return of greater than 40% and a projected growth rate of 5% to 15% annually through 2020 and normalized flat pricing of $3 per Mcf at $60 per barrel of oil.
We crushed our cash costs in 2016. We reduced our total production expenses by approximately $336 million or 28% per barrel of oil equivalent of production compared to 2015. We also reduced our total GP&T expenses by approximately $264 million or 7% per BOE of production compared to 2015. These improvements totaled $600 million of annual savings, and we are not done.
Our total production in 2016 averaged over 635,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down just 0.3% after adjusting for asset sales, while we reduced our total capital expenditures by approximately 53%. This excludes proved property acquisitions and the repurchase of volumetric production payment transaction. These accomplishments reflect the power, strength and resiliency of our portfolio and the focus of our talented employees.
Last week, we released capital and production guidance for 2017. We are committed to improving upon our 2016 performance, continuing the transformation of our balance sheet and increasing our productivity and capital efficiency. We included service cost escalation in our capital guidance, but we will utilize our operating strengths and purchasing power to minimize any potential cost increases. We will be working to accelerate our stated debt reduction target of $2 billion to $3 billion over the next few years through additional asset sale. Our capital program is designed to achieve cash flow neutrality in 2018 as we progress toward our targeted net debt to EBITDA multiple of 2x.
After planning for a lower turn in line count in 2017 in the first quarter, our production volumes are projected to return to growth in the second quarter of this year. We believe this strong growth trajectory will be driven by our oil assets, most notably the Eagle Ford, the Mid-Continent and some exciting progress coming from the Powder River Basin. Meanwhile, we expect our gas volumes will be primarily driven by the Haynesville and Marcellus. We are moving to more pad drilling in all of our operating areas, which we anticipate we'll generate a strong production ramp in the second half of the year.
Our production guidance for 2017 is projected to deliver an exit-to-exit increase in total production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately 7%, of which oil is projected to have an exit-to-exit increase of 10%. We expect this oil growth to accelerate even more in 2018, with oil production projected to increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 by more than 20%. 
Our portfolio across 6 major basins is getting stronger due to growing use of longer laterals, more aggressive fracture stimulations and the shortening of our reinvestment cycle, all leading to greater productivity and higher cash flows for Chesapeake.
To reiterate, total production growth through 2020 is expected to range between 5% and 15% per year. Our corporate strategies of financial discipline, profitable and efficient growth of captured resources, business development and exploration remain unchanged. 2017 is an important year for Chesapeake, a year where we pivot from defense to offense. As noted, we are committed to removing an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet and our plan is to execute upon this reduction sooner rather than later. We're focused on expanding our margins and, thereby, our EBITDA through greater oil production and our unrelenting drive to lower all of our cash costs.
I'll now pass the call to Nick to share some additional financial information."
323857,418738040,1140803,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2017",2017-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our 2016 results and the significant improvements in our capital efficiency, asset performance, cost structure and liquidity that Doug highlighted in his comments.Starting with our liq",858,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our 2016 results and the significant improvements in our capital efficiency, asset performance, cost structure and liquidity that Doug highlighted in his comments.
Starting with our liquidity position. As a reminder, we have effectively taken over $4 billion of leverage in preferred stock out of our capital structure over the last 16 months. That's $2.6 billion of debt inclusive of our December 2015 debt exchange and $1.4 billion liquidation value of our preferred shares for common shares.
Importantly, through these transactions and several incremental refinancings completed in 2016, we've removed or refinanced approximately $2.7 billion of near-term debt that was maturing or could be put to us in 2017 and 2018, primarily through refinancing, with only $77 million remaining due or puttable [ph] in that period.
Today, we have liquidity of approximately $3.4 billion, including a projected $300 million of cash on hand at the end of February, with no borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility. We're pleased with this liquidity position, but our goal is to reduce our debt even further. And as Doug mentioned, we remain prudently impatient in working toward removing another $2 billion to $3 billion of debt off our books.
We continue to achieve significant progress in lowering our production expenses and expect it to decline even further in 2017 on a BOE of production basis. However, our G&A ticked up slightly year-over-year and will continue to increase in 2017, primarily as a result of costs moving from LOE to G&A following our significant asset sales.
We continue to see opportunities to improve efficiency around our reduced operating footprint, having sold nearly 10,000 operated wells in the last year, and with that, having removed the maintenance of over 30 field offices, significant IT and communications equipment, invoices to process and decreasing the burden on several other administrative functions. Given the movement between G&A and LOE, we believe the best way to measure the improvement is to note that our combined LOE and G&A per BOE of production decreased by 8% year-over-year.
We also continue to see our GP&T expenses improve, decreasing by approximately 7% on a BOE of production basis in 2016 and forecasted to decrease by approximately 10% in 2017. With our exit from the Barnett Shale, the restructuring of our Mid-Continent and Powder River Basin gathering agreements and amendments to certain firm transportation agreements in the Haynesville and Eagle Ford operating areas, we have seen a reduction -- a $5.5 billion reduction in our future GP&T commitments since the end of 2014 and a $2.9 billion reduction since the end of 2015. We have additional commitments that will step down going into 2018 as well as expected synergies associated with volume growth in our key basins, and so we anticipate continuing the trend of decreasing GP&T costs on a per unit basis beyond this year.
This work continues in 2017 with our buydown of certain crude oil and natural gas transportation commitments this quarter for roughly $390 million in cash. The buydown of these contracts will remove approximately $560 million from our future transportation commitments, further optimizes our long-haul transportation plans and significantly improves the margin in our marketing group over time. We have provided a slide on this earlier today projecting how these buydowns have improved our GP&T commitments in the coming periods.
We also continue to improve our netbacks for our liquids production in various basins by accessing new markets for our hydrocarbons and optimizing our point-of-sale further downstream in several cases versus at the wellhead. Our marketing team continues to have success in improving our realized pricing for oil production, and we look forward to further success. 
On the A&D front, with the closing of our 2 Haynesville asset packages this quarter, we have received approximately $2 billion -- $2.2 billion in net proceeds from asset sales that were signed during 2016. Like we have said before, we expect to continue to optimize our portfolio in 2017 and use asset sales proceeds for further debt reduction.
Finally, for 2017, we currently have approximately 71% of our projected gas production hedged at $3.07 per Mcf and approximately 68% of our projected oil production hedged at approximately $50.19 per barrel using midpoints of our production guidance. With these hedges in place, our cash flow is not materially impacted by the recent decline we have seen in natural gas prices. We've also hedged a meaningful portion of our 2018 gas production at a little over $3 per Mcf.
We have stated before that our 2016 achievements have allowed us to focus on our operations instead of our obligations. Our return to production growth during 2017 sets Chesapeake up for an even stronger year in 2018. This production growth and the associated growth in cash flow accrues much more directly to our equity holders than in the past, given our significantly decreased total leverage and improved capital structure. We look forward to executing on these plans to deliver these enhanced returns to our shareholders.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

So we're moving rigs back and forth between those, depending on what wells we need to drill and what wells we need to complete. And it really creates a lot of efficiency for us and kind of the regional area. In the Mid-Con, what we're looking at is we have 2 rigs running in the Oswego right now. The cycle times are really impressive there. The wells are forming great. The Wedge play, it is evolving. And as we get more and more data, we'll start to look at, do we ramp up, how do we manage that program for us.

We are pleased with our first quarter results, and we are confident in our ability to deliver our strategy in 2017 priorities of: first, increasing EBITDA through oil production growth, superior capital efficiency, cash cost leadership; and second, further improving our balance sheet through debt reduction. The first quarter reflects continued progress on these priorities. And of note, our performance is consistent with our Analyst Day guidance provided back in October of last year. Chesapeake has reached an important and pivotal point in our transformation. The company is now returning to production growth from a portfolio of high-quality assets. Importantly, our oil production will be increasing in the second half of the year at a meaningful pace from a first quarter 2017 level of roughly 84,000 barrels of oil per day, we're on track to achieve our target of 100,000 barrels of oil per day by year-end 2017. As a result, we raised the lower end of our oil guidance range for 2017 along with our gas and NGL guidance. The significant increase in our oil volumes will also provide an accelerated rate of change for our EBITDA and margins. The oil growth rate will be driven from 3 assets: the Eagle Ford, the Powder River Basin and the Mid-Continent, which are all poised to deliver stronger volumes as the year progresses. In Eagle Ford Shale, we set a daily oil production record from a new well with a peak rate of 2,800 barrels of oil per day or roughly 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is one of our longer lateral wells that was also completed with more sand per foot and tighter cluster spacing compared to our standard design. We plan to place more wells on production with these enhanced completion methods, and we believe the enhanced completions can generate both the production and economic uplift our program. We also drilled our first  Upper Eagle Ford Shale well with an 11,300-foot lateral. This well is placed online yesterday so we should have a peak production rate to report in a few weeks.
Our South Texas assets will be a major driver of our oil volume growth through 2018, and we expect continued strong results through our long lateral joint program, improved base optimization and shorter cycle times. In the Powder River Basin, we announced our first operated Turner well in March that reached a peak rate of 2,560 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the 78% oil pad or 2000 barrels of oil per day. This well continues to display strong performance with gross cumulative oil production of approximately 36,000 barrels during its first 30 days of production. Our second Turner well, the is expected to be placed on production next week, and we anticipate this will deliver equivalent or better production on the per foot basis in the first well. Though the Rankin has a shorter lateral, approximately 4500-foot compared to 7100-foot in the first well, the Rankin has higher pressure at a shallower depth. The higher pressure and impressive 45-foot drilling lateral is expected to translate into greater deliverability on a per foot basis. Finally, we Turner and the Rankin well and were saturated with oil. It looks really great.
We have a good of the production from this well in a couple of weeks after and depending upon these results, we may elect to move another rig to the Powder River Basin to focus exclusively on the tar.
We also drilled our first 2 wells in the Powder River Basin this year, our first of 2 partner wells in the Powder River Basin. While production constrained, the first well has already reached the peak rate of 714 barrels of oil per day or 763 barrels equivalent per day. We have also placed 3 notable Niobrara DUCs on production this year, which had peak rates of approximately 750, 1200 and 1215 barrels of oil per day. In the third quarter we plan to put the sales of approximately 9 to 12 Sussex wells and will begin to our first deep Mowry test. The Powder River Basin is revving up the Chesapeake, and we expect to substantial rate of change in our oil production from this asset over the next several years.
In the Mid-Continent, we drove our first extended lateral well targeting the St. Genevieve formation in Major County, Oklahoma. This well is put online recently and is still cleaning up, so we plan to release these results soon. We plan to drill up to 20 additional extended lateral wells in the St. Genevieve formation in 2017. We have also been testing additional formations in the Mid-Continent later this year, including the Chester limestone and sandstone formations. We control approximately 230,000 net acres that we believe are prospective for the Chester and have taken 2 full cores to help us optimize our completion designs. We are looking forward to our first test results in the Chester in the third and fourth quarters. Our Turner count of 76 wells in the 2017 first quarter is expected to increase to around 120 wells in the second quarter then range between 120 and 140 wells in the third and fourth quarters. The turn-in line rate should be a strong indicator of the momentum we are building in the latter part of 2017 and as we enter 2018. The combined results in these oil-directed investments are delivering. The average rate for April is more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day above our first quarter average oil rate, and current daily field estimates are approaching 90,000 barrels of oil a day. We are on the ramp. Our strategic focus and near-term priorities will result in continued incremental positive improvements in our operations and financial position. I believe the strength of our portfolio, determination of our employees and relentless pursuit of improvement will drive competitive, differential value for Chesapeake shareholders, leading capital efficiency, cash cost management and strong oil growth and financial flexibility.
I'll now pass the call to Nick for further details regarding our first quarter performance."

We're pleased with our earnings and cash flow results for the first quarter. Our production exceeded the midpoint of our projections based on strong gas performance in the Appalachian region and strong oil production from new wells drilled in the VRB, Mid-Con and Eagle Ford. Looking ahead, we believe we've seen the production in February, and our production ramp in the second half of the year looks very strong, driven by a significant increase in wells based online over the next 3 quarters. On the cost side, we continue to reduce our production expenses sequentially from the fourth quarter and expect those to decline even further in 2017 on a BOE and production basis. We're forecasting that our G&A will increase slightly throughout 2017, primarily as a result of cost moving from LOE to G&A due to last year's asset sales. Given the movement between LOW and G&A, it's important to measure the combined trend and together, LOE and G&A per BOE decreased by 2% sequentially, indicating a drop in the absolute spend.
Our gathering, processing and transportation expenses also improved sequentially on a BOE basis, and we look for these 2 to move lower throughout the year. We reduced our GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance on all 3 -- for oil GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance on all 3 products. Basis has improved considerably, and the reduction in our forecasted basis differentials is meaningful. We continue to work on improving our realized prices by moving our crude and NGL production to better price points by accessing new markets for these barrels and optimizing our point-of-sale for all 3 products for the downstream. As a reminder, we noted on our fourth quarter earnings call that we bought done a couple of midstream commitments and favorable economics during the first quarter for roughly $390 million cash. The results of these buy-downs will show up beginning in our April financials.
All of these cost improvements, LOE, G&A, gathering and transport and marketing have led to a 10% improvement in our margin for BOE, excluding the increase in commodity prices. Many of these operating cost improvements are a result of the assets in our portfolio around our most profitable basins and properties. This gives us confidence in the sustainability of the margin increases as prices recover. And in fact, as we see volume growth of new wells and these production increases, we look for economies of scale to provide further opportunities for improvements. As we noted before, our cost structure is becoming a competitive advantage for the company and one  that we're very focused on maintaining and growing as prices recover. On the A&D front, we closed our 2 asset packages in the first quarter and continue to work smaller asset packages, particularly in the Mid-Continent area. We will continue to optimizer portfolios and work toward goal of removing another $2 billion, $3 billion of debt off our books. Following the end of the quarter, we satisfied the judgment of $441 million related to our 2019 notes on April 28, which also relieved the associated letter of credit. Our liquidity following this payment and the pending release of the is approximately $3.3 billion. As a reminder, this had no impact on our liquidity as the posted LC had already removed the amount from our reporting.
It's certainly worth noting that inclusive of this payment and the opportunistic buy-down of certain midstream contracts we completed during the quarter and open market purchases of debt, we are seeing higher-than-expected available liquidity for the company due to strong performance of our underlying business. Finally, for 2017, we currently have approximately 75% of our remaining projected gas production hedged at $3.05 per Mcf and approximately 64% of our remaining projected oil production hedged at $50.25 per barrel. Using the midpoints of our production guidance, we have also started to hedge a portion of our 2018 gas production at a little over $3 per Mcf and a small portion of our 2018 oil production over $51 per barrel so far. We believe that the next 18 months are going to be very exciting for Chesapeake as we start to see significant earnings and cash flow growth and margin expansion due to greater oil volumes, larger producing wells across our portfolio and new plays like the PRB that combined with our leading operating cost structure and capital efficiency will start to make a meaningful difference in the financial performance of the company.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

We have a large number of wells that we're going to be pushing through the system because, at the time, that was the best economics in the portfolio for the Powder and some of the best economics in the company. We've now tested the Turner on one side, and we're working the second Turner well in line. Honestly, we had that well drilled and raised for several weeks. It was a tight location, and we could not do what we've been doing, which is building our facilities ahead of time, so we had to build our facilities after the rig left. That well will be turned in line here in the next week or so. And when we get that well online, I think that's going to open up the Turner as a really good position to run with and that's several hundred wells that we can drill there are they are going to have outstanding probably as you seen today better than the Sussex so that's going to jump to the top of the list and that's why Doug and you've talked about in that instance are going to move another rig to focus on the Turner. The big question, the next big question is going to be the Mowry. We've now the first Mowry well. We'll be putting it online here in the second, into the third quarter and that will open up additional running rigs. So we see really strong running room in the Sussex, which we defined by that big sandbar that we've been chasing. The Turner across the majority of our acreage.

It's a great question, Doug. And as we evaluate that portfolio constantly, the churn and evaluation consists of what is the EBITDA generation, what is the future potential, what is the competitive investment pieces in our portfolio of great assets going forward. But the key in my mind and across the company is that we're going to continue to improve our operations and continue to improve our balance sheet and look for opportunities to reduce our debt further as quickly as possible. I just draw your attention back to what the investment community's view of the Haynesville was a few years ago and to the significant value that our operating expertise and experience is what that's done and the uplift there that we recognize and the value of that asset the past few years as we continue to drill and produce just big Boomer Wells there in the Haynesville Shale. That same transfer of technology and operating capability, we pushed to the Powder River, and we have that excitement there. And as you look at the Marcellus and the Utica, the northeast, these are very, very strong cash-generating assets, some of the best block shale gas rock in the world. When you can spend $100 million and keep an asset flat at 2 Bcf a day for the next 5-plus years, it's a tremendous asset to have in our portfolio. What I'm getting at there is that if we can accelerate and the value, we will absolutely do that and consider bigger asset sales, broader asset sales to accelerate the value to our shareholders. But make no mistake along the ways, we evaluate the portfolio and continue with our investment thesis. We're driving the greatest value in a very disciplined capital program, pursuing that free cash flow neutrality. Essentially, if it weren't for extraneous items the past several quarters, our spending has been in line, capital spending for drilling completion CapEx within our EBITDA, and we're going to continue those asset sales and look for opportunities to add to value. But make no mistake, across the portfolio, we're making meaningful improvements that will generate value for our shareholders in the future."

The primary financial focus of the company is going to continue to be to drive our debt balance lower and meet our long-term debt targets. If you think about the excess liquidity that we generated through strong operational performance, I commented in my prepared remarks this morning that we have diverted some funds to reducing some burdens and contracts. Those were done at favorable economics, and I can assure you is we think about doing something like that, we compare it to the relative benefit of retiring debt and think about the yield on doing so and found that retiring those contracts was more attractive. So when you think about the excess liquidity that we generated above plan, we applied back to a cost improvement effective leverage reduction, and we will always be focused on reducing our leverage until we hit our goal. What that talks about reality capital to the Powder River, think about the fact that, that may very well be just that a reallocation, not a net increase in rigs. And as we get into the second half of the year and we see what kind of commodity price environment we're heading into in '18 and we determine what our proper total capital spend going into next year should be, given the market environment, given the cash flow we expect to generate, that's when you would make a decision about whether or not it's not a net add or to shift. So I the focus remains that the production liquidity we protect, but I think we're comfortable with their liquidity we have, we don't want to see it at the road into growth production grow cash flow unless it's doing so in a really high rate of return way that is additive to our overall efforts of reducing leverage and rating putting the company in a position to generate free cash flow. So none of these things can happen overnight unless you're willing to destroy value and we're not. So we're getting there. And the previous question about asset sales is still very, very much and that will continue to drive the majority of our leverage production."

Remember these, the Sussex and the Turner, are actually silky sandstones so they react a little bit differently than, say, your unconventional plays shales are something much, much lighter. There is actually some permeability in this rock, so it's going to behave a little bit differently. We will start seeing pressure and production decline but right now, the well is really just kind of cleaning up and getting its horsepower behind it. So that's why we're pretty excited about this. If you remember the way the map was when we laid it out in October this well is over on the very western edge of what we call the play was. It was kind of a well that we needed to drill on a federal unit to maintain the federal unit, and we also had good over there, so we decided to drill it and take the core. The core was better than we expected, and the productivity of the well is much better than we expected. Then we moved basically 17 miles to the east, the other well that we're to turn on, it's of much probably a better part of the rock. That well is a shorter lateral, but we carried a pretty big flare with a high while we were drilling that, and that well is just ready to turn online business to get the facilities picked up. So this Turner is -- looks like it's on the upper end of what we expected so we're pretty excited about it, and that's why we're talking about if both of these work -- the way they look like they're going to work, we're going to have to start focusing some serious effort on the Turner here. And the beauty of it is we can develop Turner off of Sussex batch, we can develop Niobrara and turn off the same pads. And this is a STACK play where we're going to be able to develop a lot of production off of smaller footprints. We have to manage that though because we don't want to tie up a bunch of drilling and completion capital and not get the volume.

What we focused on initially is we had a few wells testing different concepts, but kind of honed in right now on the Meramec for the time being because it has high productivity. We have a really good footprint. We've been able to put together really nice acreage position on top of what we already had. One of the reasons we haven't talked about a lot of results is because we're continuing to add to our acreage position out there and coring up. And then we knew the Chester was something that we were really interested in, and no one had really it much. But when you look at the map, the reason it hasn't changed much is because we own about 230,000 acres of it, and we own the core of it. So we needed more data on that. We now drilled 2 wells and taking core, and we're laying one of those wells out horizontally will be doing some completion testing. The thing about the Chester it's reservoirs. They do produce vertically, they're oil prone, but there's 4 to 5 STACK reservoirs on our acreage position, so we're really interested in that play but we want to do the science and get it right both on the geo side and on the completion side."

We're pleased with our first quarter results, and we are confident in our ability to deliver our strategy in 2017 priorities of: first, increasing EBITDA through oil production growth, superior capital efficiency and cash cost leadership; and second, further improving our balance sheet through debt reduction. The first quarter reflects continued progress on these priorities. And of note, our performance is consistent with our Analyst Day guidance provided back in October of last year. 
Chesapeake has reached an important and pivotal point in our transformation. The company is now returning to production growth from our portfolio of high-quality assets. Importantly, our oil production will be increasing in the second half of the year at a meaningful pace. From a first quarter 2017 level of roughly 84,000 barrels of oil per day, we are on track to achieve our target of 100,000 barrels of oil per day by year-end 2017. As a result, we raised the lower end of our oil guidance range for 2017 along with our gas and NGL guidance. The significant increase in our oil volumes will also provide an accelerated rate of change for our EBITDA and margins. 
The oil growth rate will be driven from 3 assets: the Eagle Ford, the Powder River Basin and the Mid-Continent, which are all poised to deliver stronger volumes as the year progresses. In the Eagle Ford Shale, we set a daily oil production record from a new well with a peak rate of 2,800 barrels of oil per day or roughly 3,200 barrel of oil equivalent per day. This is one of our longer lateral wells that was also completed with more sand per foot and tighter cluster spacing compared to our standard design. We plan to place more wells on production with these enhanced completion methods, and we believe the enhanced completions can generate both a production and economic uplift to our program. 
We also drilled our first Upper Eagle Ford Shale well with an 11,300-foot lateral. This well was placed online yesterday, so we should have a peak production rate to report in a few weeks.
Our South Texas assets will be the major driver of our oil volume growth through 2018. And we expect continued strong results through our long lateral drilling program, improved base optimization and shorter cycle times. 
In the Powder River Basin, we announced our first operated Turner well in March that reached a peak rate of 2,560 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the 78% oil pad or 2,000 barrels of oil per day. This well continues to display strong performance, with gross cumulative oil production of approximately 36,000 barrels during its first 30 days of production. 
Our second Turner well, the Rankin, is expected to be placed on production next week. And we anticipate this well will deliver equivalent or better production on a per foot basis than the first well. Although Rankin has a shorter lateral, approximately 4,500 foot compared to 7,100 foot in the first well, the Rankin has higher pressure at a shallower depth. The higher pressure and an impressive 45-foot flare well drilling the lateral is expected to translate into greater deliverability on a per foot basis. 
Finally, we cored the Turner and the Rankin well, and they were saturated with oil. It looks really great. We'll have a good sense of the production from this well in a couple of weeks after it's turned in line. And dependent upon these results, we may elect to move another rig to the Powder River Basin to focus exclusively on the tar.
We also drilled our first 2 Parkman wells in the Powder River Basin this year -- our first of 2 Parkman wells in the Powder River Basin. While production is constrained, the first well has already reached a peak rate of 714 barrels of oil per day or 763 barrels equivalent per day. We have also placed 3 notable Niobrara DUCs on production this year, which had peak rates of approximately 750, 1,200 and 1,215 barrels of oil per day. In the third quarter, we plan to put to sales approximately 9 to 12 Sussex wells, and we'll begin to flow back our first deep Mowry test. 
The Powder River Basin is revving up at Chesapeake, and we expect a substantial rate of change in our oil production from this asset over the next several years.
In the Mid-Continent, we drilled our first extended lateral well targeting the St. Genevieve formation in Major County, Oklahoma. This well was put online recently and is still cleaning up, so we plan to release these results soon. We plan to drill up to 20 additional extended lateral wells in the St. Genevieve formation in 2017. We will also be testing additional formations in the Mid-Continent later this year, including the Chester limestone and sandstone formations. We control approximately 230,000 net acres that we believe are prospective for the Chester, and we have taken 2 full cores to help us optimize our completion designs. We are looking forward to our first test results from the Chester in the third and fourth quarters. 
Our turn-in-line count of 76 wells in the 2017 first quarter is expected to increase to around 120 wells in the second quarter then range between 120 and 140 wells in the third and fourth quarters. The turn-in-line rate should be a strong indicator of the path for momentum we are building in the latter part of 2017 and as we enter 2018. 
The combined results from these oil-directed investments are delivering. The average oil rate for April is more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day above our first quarter average oil rate. And current daily field estimates are approaching 90,000 barrels of oil a day. We are on the ramp. 
Our strategic focus and near-term priorities will result in continued incremental positive improvements in our operations and financial position. I believe the strength of our portfolio, determination of our employees and relentless pursuit of improvement will drive competitive, differential value for Chesapeake shareholders, leading to superior capital efficiency, cash cost management, strong oil growth and financial flexibility.
I'll now pass the call to Nick for further details regarding our first quarter performance."
323857,428097074,1189624,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our earnings and cash flow results for the first quarter.

We're pleased with our earnings and cash flow results for the first quarter. Our production exceeded the midpoint of our projections based on strong gas performance in the Appalachian region and strong oil production from new wells drilled in the PRB, Mid-Con and Eagle Ford. 
Looking ahead, we believe we've seen the low end of our oil production in February, and our production ramp in the second half of the year looks very strong, drove by a significant increase in wells placed online over the next 3 quarters. 
On the cost side, we've continued to reduce our production expenses sequentially from the fourth quarter and expect those to decline even further in 2017 on a boe and production basis. We're forecasting that our G&A will increase slightly throughout 2017, primarily as a result of costs moving from LOE to G&A due to last year's asset sales. Given the movement between LOE and G&A, it's important to measure the combined trend. And together, LOE and G&A per boe decreased by 2% sequentially, indicating a drop in the absolute spend.
Our gathering, processing and transportation expenses also improved sequentially on a boe basis, and we look for these 2 to move lower throughout the year. We reduced our GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance on all 3 -- our oil GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance on all 3 products. Basis has improved considerably, and the reduction in our forecasted basis differentials is meaningful. We continue to work on improving our realized prices by moving our crude and NGL production to better price points by accessing new markets for these barrels and optimizing our point of sale for all 3 products further downstream. 
As a reminder, we noted on our fourth quarter earnings call that we bought down a couple of midstream commitments at favorable economics during the first quarter for roughly $390 million in cash. The results of these buy-downs will show up beginning in our April financials.
All of these cost improvements, LOE, G&A, gathering and transport and marketing have led to a 10% improvement in our margin per boe, excluding the increase in commodity prices. Many of these operating cost improvements are a result of refining the assets in our portfolio around our most profitable basins and properties. This gives us confidence in the sustainability of the margin increases as prices recover. And in fact, as we see volume growth of new wells and base production increases, we look for economies of scale to provide further opportunities for improvements. As we noted before, our cost structure is becoming a competitive advantage for the company and one that we are very focused on maintaining and growing as prices recover. 
On the A&D front, we closed our 2 Haynesville asset packages in the first quarter and continue to work smaller asset packages, particularly in the Mid-Continent area. We will continue to optimize our portfolios and work toward our goal of removing another $2 billion to $3 billion of debt off our books. 
Following the end of the quarter, we satisfied the judgment of $441 million related to our 2019 notes litigation on April 28, which also relieved the associated letter of credit. Our liquidity following this payment and the pending release of the LC is approximately $3.3 billion. As a reminder, this had no impact on our liquidity as the posted LC had already removed the amount from our liquidity. 
It's certainly worth noting that inclusive of this payment and the opportunistic buy-down of certain midstream contracts we completed during the quarter and open-market purchases of debt, we are seeing higher-than-expected available liquidity for the company due to strong performance of our underlying business. 
Finally, for 2017, we currently have approximately 75% of our remaining projected gas production hedged at $3.05 per Mcf and approximately 64% of our remaining projected oil production hedged at $50.25 per barrel. Using the midpoints of our production guidance, we have also started to hedge a portion of our 2018 gas production at a little over $3 per Mcf and a small portion of our 2018 oil production over $51 per barrel so far. 
To close, we believe that the next 18 months are going to be very exciting for Chesapeake as we start to see significant earnings and cash flow growth and margin expansion due to greater oil volumes, larger producing wells across our portfolio and new plays like the PRB that, combined with our leading operating cost structure and capital efficiency, will start to make a meaningful difference in the financial performance of the company.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I would like you to just kind of go -- look back at the October data that we gave you. We are on track there. We have a large number of Sussex wells that we're going to be pushing through the system because at the time, that was the best economics in the portfolio for the Powder and some of the best economics in the company. We've now tested the Turner on one side, and we're waiting on turning the second Turner well in line. Honestly, we've had that well drilled and ready to turn in for several weeks. It was a tight location, and we could not do what we've been doing, which is building our facilities ahead of time, so we had to build our facilities after the rig left. That well will be turned in line here in the next week or so. And when we get that well online, I think that's going to open up the Turner as a really good position to run with. And that's several hundred wells that we can drill there. They're going to have outstanding economics, probably, as we see it today, better than the Sussex. So that's going to jump to the top of the list, and that's why Doug and we've talked about, in that instance, we're going to move -- probably move another rig in to focus on the Turner. The big question, the next big question is going to be the Mowry. We've now [ PD-ed ] the first Mowry well. We'll be putting it online here in the second -- into the third quarter, and that will open up additional running room. So we see really strong running room in the Sussex, which we define by that big sandbar that we've been chasing. The Turner across a majority of our acreage, Niobrara now with the new enhanced completions look much better than we had anticipated. So that's going to open up. We see this as several thousand locations available to us, and that, remember, is on relatively broad spacing. We see an opportunity to downspace here that's just going to increase our opportunity set. That's what you needed, Doug?"

Northwest STACK seems to be moving up the relative priority list as it relates to, again, your opportunity set. And I guess I really just wanted to ask the monetization question slightly differently because the only thing that really seems to be holding you back from getting recognition for some of this stuff is there's still high leverage of -- or a high level of debt and leverage obviously. So I guess what I'm really asking is that, as you evolve the portfolio towards these more oily areas, highway areas, more economic areas, how do you think about the relative reset in your portfolio?

And as we evaluate the portfolio constantly, the churn in evaluation consists of, what is the EBITDA generation? What is the future potential? What is the competitive investment thesis in our portfolio of great assets going forward? The key in my mind and across the company is that we're going to continue to improve our operations and continue to improve our balance sheet and look for opportunities to reduce our debt further as quickly as possible. I'd just draw your attention back to what the investment community's view of the Haynesville was a few years ago and to the significant value that our operating expertise and experiences, what that's done and the uplift there that we've recognized and the value of that asset in the past few years as we continue to drill and produce just big boomer wells there in the Haynesville Shale. That same transfer of technology and operating capability, we've pushed to the Powder River, and we have that excitement there. And as you look at the Marcellus and the Utica in the Northeast, these are very, very strong cash-generating assets, some of the best rock -- shale gas rock in the world. When you can spend $100 million and keep an asset flat at 2 Bcf a day for the next 5-plus years, it's a tremendous asset to have in our portfolio. What I'm getting at there is that if we can accelerate the value, we will absolutely do that and consider bigger asset sales, broader asset sales to accelerate the value to our shareholders. But make no mistake, along the way, as we evaluate the portfolio and continue with our investment thesis, we're driving the greatest value in a very disciplined capital program, pursuing that free cash flow neutrality. Essentially, if it weren't for some of the extraneous items the past several quarters, we have -- our spending has been in line, capital spending for drilling and completion CapEx within our EBITDA. And we're going to continue those asset sales and look for opportunities to add to value. But make no mistake, across the portfolio, we're making meaningful improvements that will generate value for our shareholders in the future."

The primary financial focus of the company is going to continue to be to drive our debt balance lower and meet our long-term debt targets. If you think about the excess liquidity that we generated through strong operational performance, I commented in my prepared notes this morning that we have diverted some funds to reducing some burdensome contracts. Those were done at favorable economics, and I can assure you that as we think about doing something like that, we compare it to the relative benefit of retiring debt and think about the yield on doing so and found that retiring those contracts was more attractive. So when you think about the excess liquidity that we generated above plan, we apply it back to a cost improvement effective leverage reduction, and we will always be focused on reducing our leverage until we hit our goal. When Doug talks about reallocating some capital to the Powder River, think about the fact that, that may very well be just that: a reallocation, not a net increase in rigs. And as we get into the second half of the year and we see what kind of commodity price environment we're heading into in '18 and we determine what our proper total capital spend going into next year should be, given the market environment, given the cash flow we expect to generate, that's when you would make a decision about whether or not that's a net add or it's a shift. So the focus remains debt reduction. Liquidity, we protect, but I think we are comfortable with the liquidity we have. We don't want to see it eroded to grow production, grow cash flow unless it's doing so in a really high rate of return way that is additive to our overall efforts of reducing leverage and rating -- putting the company in a position to generate free cash flow. So none of these things can happen overnight unless you're willing to destroy value, and we're not. So we're getting there. And the previous question about asset sales is still very, very much front of mind for us, and that will continue to drive the majority of our leverage reduction."

We're really not seeing decline right now. Remember, these -- the Sussex and the Turner are actually silty sandstones, so they react a little bit differently than, say, your unconventional plays that are the shales or something much, much tighter. There is actually some permeability in this rock, so it's going to behave a little bit differently. We will start seeing pressure and production decline, but right now, the well is really just kind of cleaning up and getting its horsepower behind it. So that's why we're pretty excited about this. If you remember the way the map was when we laid it out in October, this well is over on the very western edge of what we thought the play was. It was kind of a well that we needed to drill on a federal unit to maintain the federal unit. And we also had good partner over there, so we decided to drill it and take a core. The core was better than we expected, and the productivity of the well is much better than we expected. Then we moved basically 17 miles to the east, the other well that we're waiting to turn on. It's a much -- probably a better part of the rock. That well is a shorter lateral, but we carried a pretty big flare with high mud weight while we were drilling that. And that well is just ready to turn online as soon as we get the facilities picked up. So this Turner is -- looks like it's on the upper end of what we expected. So we're pretty excited about it, and that's why we're talking about if both of these work the way they look like they're going to work, we're going to have to start focusing some serious effort on the Turner here. And the beauty of it is we can develop Turner off of Sussex pads. We can develop Niobrara and Turner off the same pads. I mean, this is a STACK play where we're going to be able to develop a lot of production off of smaller footprints. We have to manage that, though, because we don't want to tie up a bunch of drilling and completion capital and not get the volume. So we're working through a field development plan right now to put all this in play."

We have a really good footprint. We've been able to put together a really nice acreage position on top of what we already had. One of the reasons we haven't talked about a lot of results is because we're continuing to add to our acreage position out there and coring up. And then we knew the Chester was something that we were really interested in, and no one had really chased it much. But when you look at the map, the reason it hasn't been chased much is because we own about 230,000 acres of it, and we own the core of it. So we needed more data on that. We've now drilled 2 wells and taking core, and we're laying one of those wells out horizontally and will be doing some completion testing. The thing about the Chester is its -- there are thinner reservoirs. They do produce vertically, they're oil prone, but there's 4 to 5 STACK reservoirs on our acreage position.

We're pleased with our first quarter results, and we are confident in our ability to deliver our strategy and 2017 priorities of: first, increasing EBITDA through oil production growth, superior capital efficiency and cash cost leadership; and second, further improving our balance sheet through debt reduction. The first quarter reflects continued progress on these priorities. And of note, our performance is consistent with our Analyst Day guidance provided back in October of last year. 
Chesapeake has reached an important and pivotal point in our transformation. The company is now returning to production growth from our portfolio of high-quality assets. Importantly, our oil production will be increasing in the second half of the year at a meaningful pace. From a first quarter 2017 level of roughly 84,000 barrels of oil per day, we are on track to achieve our target of 100,000 barrels of oil per day by year-end 2017. As a result, we raised the lower end of our oil guidance range for 2017 along with our gas and NGL guidance. The significant increase in our oil volumes will also provide an accelerated rate of change to our EBITDA and margins. 
The oil growth rate will be driven from 3 assets: the Eagle Ford, the Powder River Basin and the Mid-Continent, which are all poised to deliver stronger volumes as the year progresses. In the Eagle Ford Shale, we set a daily oil production record from a new well with a peak rate of 2,800 barrels of oil per day or roughly 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is one of our longer lateral wells that was also completed with more sand per foot and tighter cluster spacing compared to our standard design. We plan to place more wells on production with these enhanced completion methods, and we believe the enhanced completions can generate both a production and economic uplift to our program. 
We also drilled our first Upper Eagle Ford Shale well with an 11,300-foot lateral. This well was placed online yesterday, so we should have a peak production rate to report in a few weeks.
Our South Texas assets will be the major driver of our oil volume growth through 2018. And we expect continued strong results through our long lateral drilling program, improved base optimization and shorter cycle times. 
In the Powder River Basin, we announced our first operated Turner well in March that reached a peak rate of 2,560 barrels of oil equivalent per day with a 78% oil cut or 2,000 barrels of oil per day. This well continues to display strong performance, with gross cumulative oil production of approximately 36,000 barrels during its first 30 days of production. 
Our second Turner well, the Rankin, is expected to be placed on production next week. And we anticipate this well will deliver equivalent or better production on a per-foot basis than the first well. Although Rankin has a shorter lateral, approximately 4,500 foot compared to 7,100 foot in the first well, the Rankin has higher pressure at a shallower depth. The higher pressure and an impressive 45-foot flare while drilling the lateral is expected to translate into greater deliverability on a per-foot basis. 
Finally, we cored the Turner and the Rankin well, and they were saturated with oil. It looks really great. We'll have a good sense of the production from this well in a couple of weeks after it's turned in lined. And dependent upon these results, we may elect to move another rig to the Powder River Basin to focus exclusively on the Turner.
We also drilled our first 2 Parkman wells in the Powder River Basin this year -- our first of 2 Parkman wells in the Powder River Basin. While production is constrained, the first well has already reached a peak rate of 714 barrels of oil per day or 763 barrels equivalent per day. We have also placed 3 notable Niobrara DUCs on production this year, which had peak rates of approximately 750, 1,200 and 1,215 barrels of oil per day. In the third quarter, we plan to put to sales approximately 9 to 12 Sussex wells, and we'll begin to flow back our first deep Mowry test. 
The Powder River Basin is revving up at Chesapeake, and we expect a substantial rate of change in our oil production from this asset over the next several years.
In the Mid-Continent, we drilled our first extended lateral well targeting the St. Genevieve formation in Major County, Oklahoma. This well was put online recently and is still cleaning up, so we plan to release these results soon. We plan to drill up to 20 additional extended-lateral wells in the St. Genevieve formation in 2017. We will also be testing additional formations in the Mid-Continent later this year, including the Chester limestone and sandstone formations. We control approximately 230,000 net acres that we believe are prospective for the Chester, and we have taken 2 full cores to help us optimize our completion designs. We are looking forward to our first test results from the Chester in the third and fourth quarters. 
Our turn-in-line count of 76 wells in the 2017 first quarter is expected to increase to around 120 wells in the second quarter, then range between 120 and 140 wells in the third and fourth quarters. The turn-in-line rate should be a strong indicator of the [ path for ] momentum we are building in the latter part of 2017 and as we enter 2018. 
The combined results from these oil-directed investments are delivering. The average oil rate for April is more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day above our first quarter average oil rate. And current daily field estimates are approaching 90,000 barrels of oil a day. We are on the ramp. 
Our strategic focus and near-term priorities will result in continued incremental positive improvements in our operations and financial position. I believe the strength of our portfolio, determination of our employees and relentless pursuit of improvement will drive competitive, differential value for Chesapeake shareholders, leading with superior capital efficiency, cash cost management, strong oil growth and financial flexibility.
I'll now pass the call to Nick for further details regarding our first quarter performance."

We're pleased with our earnings and cash flow results for the first quarter. Our production exceeded the midpoint of our projections based on strong gas performance in the Appalachian region and strong oil production from new wells drilled in the PRB, Mid-Con and Eagle Ford. 
Looking ahead, we believe we've seen the low in our oil production in February, and our production ramp in the second half of the year looks very strong, fueled by a significant increase in wells placed online over the next 3 quarters. 
On the cost side, we've continued to reduce our production expenses sequentially from the fourth quarter and expect those to decline even further in 2017 on a boe and production basis. We're forecasting that our G&A will increase slightly throughout 2017, primarily as a result of costs moving from LOE to G&A due to last year's asset sales. Given the movement between LOE and G&A, it's important to measure the combined trend. And together, LOE and G&A per boe decreased by 2% sequentially, indicating a drop in the absolute spend.
Our gathering, processing and transportation expenses also improved sequentially on a boe basis, and we look for these to move lower throughout the year. We reduced our GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance on all 3 -- our oil GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance on all 3 products. Basis has improved considerably, and the reduction in our forecasted basis differentials is meaningful. We continue to work on improving our realized prices by moving our crude and NGL production to better price points by accessing new markets for these barrels and optimizing our point of sale for all 3 products further downstream. 
As a reminder, we noted on our fourth quarter earnings call that we bought down a couple of midstream commitments at favorable economics during the first quarter for roughly $390 million in cash. The results of these buy-downs will show up beginning in our April financials.
All of these cost improvements, LOE, G&A, gathering and transport and marketing, have led to a 10% improvement in our margin per boe, excluding the increase in commodity prices. Many of these operating cost improvements are a result of refining the assets in our portfolio around our most profitable basins and properties. This gives us confidence in the sustainability of the margin increases as prices recover. And in fact, as we see volume growth of new wells and base production increases, we look for economies of scale to provide further opportunities for improvements. As we noted before, our cost structure is becoming a competitive advantage for the company and one that we are very focused on maintaining and growing as prices recover. 
On the A&D front, we closed our 2 Haynesville asset packages in the first quarter and continue to work smaller asset packages, particularly in the Mid-Continent area. We will continue to optimize our portfolios and work toward our goal of removing another $2 billion to $3 billion of debt off our books. 
Following the end of the quarter, we satisfied the judgment of $441 million related to our 2019 notes litigation on April 28, which also relieved the associated letter of credit. Our liquidity following this payment and the pending release of the LC is approximately $3.3 billion. As a reminder, this had no impact on our liquidity as the posted LC had already removed the amount from our liquidity. 
It's certainly worth noting that inclusive of this payment and the opportunistic buy-down of certain midstream contracts we completed during the quarter and open-market purchases of debt, we are seeing higher-than-expected available liquidity for the company due to strong performance of our underlying business. 
Finally, for 2017, we currently have approximately 75% of our remaining projected gas production hedged at $3.05 per Mcf and approximately 64% of our remaining projected oil production hedged at $50.25 per barrel. Using the midpoints of our production guidance, we have also started to hedge a portion of our 2018 gas production at a little over $3 per Mcf and a small portion of our 2018 oil production over $51 per barrel so far. 
To close, we believe that the next 18 months are going to be very exciting for Chesapeake as we start to see significant earnings and cash flow growth and margin expansion due to greater oil volumes, larger producing wells across our portfolio and new plays like the PRB that, combined with our leading operating cost structure and capital efficiency, will start to make a meaningful difference in the financial performance of the company.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

We have a large number of Sussex wells that we're going to be pushing through the system because at the time, that was the best economics in the portfolio for the Powder and some of the best economics in the company. We've now tested the Turner on one side, and we're waiting on turning the second Turner well in line. Honestly, we've had that well drilled and ready to turn in for several weeks. It was a tight location, and we could not do what we've been doing, which is building our facilities ahead of time, so we had to build our facilities after the rig left. That well will be turned in line here in the next week or so. And when we get that well online, I think that's going to open up the Turner as a really good position to run with. And that's several hundred wells that we can drill there. They're going to have outstanding economics, probably, as we see it today, better than the Sussex. So that's going to jump to the top of the list, and that's why Doug and we've talked about, in that instance, we're going to move -- probably move another rig in to focus on the Turner. The big question, the next big question is going to be the Mowry. We've now [ PD-ed ] the first Mowry well. We'll be putting it online here in the second -- into the third quarter, and that will open up additional running room. So we see really strong running room in the Sussex, which we define by that big sandbar that we've been chasing, the Turner across a majority of our acreage. Niobrara now with the new enhanced completions look much better than we had anticipated. So that's going to open up.

And I guess I really just wanted to ask the monetization question slightly differently because the only thing that really seems to be holding you back from getting recognition for some of this stuff is there's still high leverage of -- or a high level of debt and leverage obviously. So I guess what I'm really asking is that, as you evolve the portfolio towards these more oily areas, higher-rate areas, more economic areas, how do you think about the relative reset in your portfolio? I'm thinking specifically Marcellus and whether you would ever consider accelerating asset sales across some of your more pure-play gas names -- gas positions."

And as we evaluate the portfolio constantly, the churn in evaluation consists of, what is the EBITDA generation? What is the future potential? What is the competitive investment thesis in our portfolio of great assets going forward? The key in my mind and across the company is that we're going to continue to improve our operations and continue to improve our balance sheet and look for opportunities to reduce our debt further as quickly as possible. I'd just draw your attention back to what the investment community's view of the Haynesville was a few years ago and to the significant value that our operating expertise and experiences, what that's done and the uplift there that we've recognized and the value of that asset in the past few years as we continue to drill and produce just big boomer wells there in the Haynesville Shale. That same transfer of technology and operating capability, we've pushed to the Powder River, and we have that excitement there. And as you look at the Marcellus and the Utica in the Northeast, these are very, very strong cash-generating assets, some of the best rock -- shale gas rock in the world. When you can spend $100 million and keep an asset flat at 2 Bcf a day for the next 5-plus years, it's a tremendous asset to have in our portfolio. What I'm getting at there is that if we can accelerate the value, we will absolutely do that and consider bigger asset sales, broader asset sales to accelerate the value to our shareholders. But make no mistake, along the way, as we evaluate the portfolio and continue with our investment thesis, we're driving the greatest value in a very disciplined capital program, pursuing that free cash flow neutrality. Essentially, if it weren't for some of the extraneous items the past several quarters, we have -- our spending has been in line, capital spending for drilling and completion CapEx within our EBITDA. And we're going to continue those asset sales and look for opportunities to add the value. But make no mistake, across the portfolio, we're making meaningful improvements that will generate value for our shareholders in the future."

The primary financial focus of the company is going to continue to be to drive our debt balance lower and meet our long-term debt targets. If you think about the excess liquidity that we generated through strong operational performance, I commented in my prepared notes this morning that we have diverted some funds to reducing some burdensome contracts. Those were done at favorable economics, and I can assure you that as we think about doing something like that, we compare it to the relative benefit of retiring debt and think about the yield on doing so and found that retiring those contracts was more attractive. So when you think about the excess liquidity that we generated above plan, we apply it back to a cost improvement, effective leverage reduction, and we will always be focused on reducing our leverage until we hit our goal. When Doug talks about reallocating some capital to the Powder River, think about the fact that, that may very well be just that: a reallocation, not a net increase in rigs. And as we get into the second half of the year and we see what kind of commodity price environment we're heading into in '18 and we determine what our proper total capital spend going into next year should be, given the market environment, given the cash flow we expect to generate, that's when you would make a decision about whether or not that's a net add or it's a shift. So the focus remains debt reduction. Liquidity, we protect, but I think we are comfortable with the liquidity we have. We don't want to see it eroded to grow production, grow cash flow unless it's doing so in a really high rate-of-return way that is additive to our overall efforts of reducing leverage and rating -- putting the company in a position to generate free cash flow. So none of these things can happen overnight unless you're willing to destroy value, and we're not. So we're getting there. And the previous question about asset sales is still very, very much front of mind for us, and that will continue to drive the majority of our leverage reduction."

Again, we think we've got a good recipe out there for our frac designs.

We're planning to test the high end of it, but I was -- I went out to the field the other day, and I stood on a location making 41 million cubic feet a day. So we're still making some really large wells out there, and the team has actually got some wells, looking out on the schedule, that could be 15,000 feet compared to the 10,000-feet wells we have been drilling. So those will be a step change in productivity as well. So we're really happy with the performance in the Haynesville.

We're really not seeing decline right now. Remember, these -- the Sussex and the Turner are actually silty sandstones, so they react a little bit differently than, say, your unconventional plays that are the shales or something much, much tighter. There is actually some permeability in this rock, so it's going to behave a little bit differently. We will start seeing pressure and production decline, but right now, the well is really just kind of cleaning up and getting its horsepower behind it. So that's why we're pretty excited about this. If you remember the way the map was when we laid it out in October, this well is over on the very western edge of what we thought the play was. It was kind of a well that we needed to drill on a federal unit to maintain the federal unit. And we also had a good Parkman over there, so we decided to drill it and take a core. The core was better than we expected, and the productivity of the well is much better than we expected. Then we moved basically 17 miles to the east, the other well that we're waiting to turn on. It's in a much -- probably a better part of the rock. That well is a shorter lateral, but we carried a pretty big flare with high mud weight while we were drilling that. And that well is just ready to turn online as soon as we get the facilities hooked up. So this Turner is -- looks like it's on the upper end of what we expected. So we're pretty excited about it, and that's why we're talking about if both of these work the way they look like they're going to work, we're going to have to start focusing some serious effort on the Turner here. And the beauty of it is we can develop Turner off of Sussex pads. We can develop Niobrara and Turner off the same pads. I mean, this is a STACK play where we're going to be able to develop a lot of production off of smaller footprints. We have to manage that, though, because we don't want to tie up a bunch of drilling and completion capital and not get the volume. So we're working through a field development plan right now to put all this in play."

We have a really good footprint. We've been able to put together a really nice acreage position on top of what we already had. One of the reasons we haven't talked about a lot of results is because we're continuing to add to our acreage position out there and coring up. And then we knew the Chester was something that we were really interested in, and no one had really chased it much. But when you look at the map, the reason it hasn't been chased much is because we own about 230,000 acres of it, and we own the core of it. So we needed more data on that. We've now drilled 2 wells and taking core, and we're laying one of those wells out horizontally and will be doing some completion testing. The thing about the Chester, it's -- they're thinner reservoirs. They do produce vertically, they're oil prone, but there's 4 to 5 STACK reservoirs on our acreage position.

We're pleased with our first quarter results, and we are confident in our ability to deliver our strategy and 2017 priorities of: first, increasing EBITDA through oil production growth, superior capital efficiency and cash cost leadership; and second, further improving our balance sheet through debt reduction. The first quarter reflects continued progress on these priorities. And of note, our performance is consistent with our Analyst Day guidance provided back in October of last year. 
Chesapeake has reached an important and pivotal point in our transformation. The company is now returning to production growth from our portfolio of high-quality assets. Importantly, our oil production will be increasing in the second half of the year at a meaningful pace. From a first quarter 2017 level of roughly 84,000 barrels of oil per day, we are on track to achieve our target of 100,000 barrels of oil per day by year-end 2017. As a result, we raised the lower end of our oil guidance range for 2017 along with our gas and NGL guidance. The significant increase in our oil volumes will also provide an accelerated rate of change to our EBITDA and margins. 
The oil growth rate will be driven from 3 assets: the Eagle Ford, the Powder River Basin and the Mid-Continent, which are all poised to deliver stronger volumes as the year progresses. In the Eagle Ford Shale, we set a daily oil production record from a new well with a peak rate of 2,800 barrels of oil per day or roughly 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is one of our longer lateral wells that was also completed with more sand per foot and tighter cluster spacing compared to our standard design. We plan to place more wells on production with these enhanced completion methods, and we believe the enhanced completions can generate both a production and economic uplift to our program. 
We also drilled our first Upper Eagle Ford Shale well with an 11,300-foot lateral. This well was placed online yesterday, so we should have a peak production rate to report in a few weeks.
Our South Texas assets will be the major driver of our oil volume growth through 2018. And we expect continued strong results through our long lateral drilling program, improved base optimization and shorter cycle times. 
In the Powder River Basin, we announced our first operated Turner well in March that reached a peak rate of 2,560 barrels of oil equivalent per day with a 78% oil cut or 2,000 barrels of oil per day. This well continues to display strong performance, with gross cumulative oil production of approximately 36,000 barrels during its first 30 days of production. 
Our second Turner well, the Rankin, is expected to be placed on production next week. And we anticipate this well will deliver equivalent or better production on a per-foot basis than the first well. Although Rankin has a shorter lateral, approximately 4,500 foot compared to 7,100 foot in the first well, the Rankin has higher pressure at a shallower depth. The higher pressure and an impressive 45-foot flare while drilling the lateral is expected to translate into greater deliverability on a per-foot basis. 
Finally, we cored the Turner and the Rankin well, and they were saturated with oil. It looks really great. We'll have a good sense of the production from this well in a couple of weeks after it's turned in line. And dependent upon these results, we may elect to move another rig to the Powder River Basin to focus exclusively on the Turner.
We also drilled our first 2 Parkman wells in the Powder River Basin this year -- our first of 2 Parkman wells in the Powder River Basin. While production is constrained, the first well has already reached a peak rate of 714 barrels of oil per day or 763 barrels equivalent per day. We have also placed 3 notable Niobrara DUCs on production this year, which had peak rates of approximately 750, 1,200 and 1,215 barrels of oil per day. In the third quarter, we plan to put to sales approximately 9 to 12 Sussex wells, and we'll begin to flow back our first deep Mowry test. 
The Powder River Basin is revving up at Chesapeake, and we expect a substantial rate of change in our oil production from this asset over the next several years.
In the Mid-Continent, we drilled our first extended lateral well targeting the St. Genevieve formation in Major County, Oklahoma. This well was put online recently and is still cleaning up, so we plan to release these results soon. We plan to drill up to 20 additional extended-lateral wells in the St. Genevieve formation in 2017. We will also be testing additional formations in the Mid-Continent later this year, including the Chester limestone and sandstone formations. We control approximately 230,000 net acres that we believe are prospective for the Chester, and we have taken 2 full cores to help us optimize our completion designs. We are looking forward to our first test results from the Chester in the third and fourth quarters. 
Our turn-in-line count of 76 wells in the 2017 first quarter is expected to increase to around 120 wells in the second quarter, then range between 120 and 140 wells in the third and fourth quarters. The turn-in-line rate should be a strong indicator of the [ path for ] momentum we are building in the latter part of 2017 and as we enter 2018. 
The combined results from these oil-directed investments are delivering. The average oil rate for April is more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day above our first quarter average oil rate. And current daily field estimates are approaching 90,000 barrels of oil a day. We are on the ramp. 
Our strategic focus and near-term priorities will result in continued incremental positive improvements in our operations and financial position. I believe the strength of our portfolio, determination of our employees and relentless pursuit of improvement will drive competitive, differential value for Chesapeake shareholders, leading with superior capital efficiency, cash cost management, strong oil growth and financial flexibility.
I'll now pass the call to Nick for further details regarding our first quarter performance."
323857,428097074,1194673,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our earnings and cash flow results for the first quarter.

We're pleased with our earnings and cash flow results for the first quarter. Our production exceeded the midpoint of our projections based on strong gas performance in the Appalachian region and strong oil production from new wells drilled in the PRB, Mid-Con and Eagle Ford. 
Looking ahead, we believe we've seen the low in our oil production in February, and our production ramp in the second half of the year looks very strong, fueled by a significant increase in wells placed online over the next 3 quarters. 
On the cost side, we've continued to reduce our production expenses sequentially from the fourth quarter and expect those to decline even further in 2017 on a boe and production basis. We're forecasting that our G&A will increase slightly throughout 2017, primarily as a result of costs moving from LOE to G&A due to last year's asset sales. Given the movement between LOE and G&A, it's important to measure the combined trend. And together, LOE and G&A per boe decreased by 2% sequentially, indicating a drop in the absolute spend.
Our gathering, processing and transportation expenses also improved sequentially on a boe basis, and we look for these to move lower throughout the year. We reduced our GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance on all 3 -- our oil GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance on all 3 products. Basis has improved considerably, and the reduction in our forecasted basis differentials is meaningful. We continue to work on improving our realized prices by moving our crude and NGL production to better price points by accessing new markets for these barrels and optimizing our point of sale for all 3 products further downstream. 
As a reminder, we noted on our fourth quarter earnings call that we bought down a couple of midstream commitments at favorable economics during the first quarter for roughly $390 million in cash. The results of these buy-downs will show up beginning in our April financials.
All of these cost improvements, LOE, G&A, gathering and transport and marketing, have led to a 10% improvement in our margin per boe, excluding the increase in commodity prices. Many of these operating cost improvements are a result of refining the assets in our portfolio around our most profitable basins and properties. This gives us confidence in the sustainability of the margin increases as prices recover. And in fact, as we see volume growth of new wells and base production increases, we look for economies of scale to provide further opportunities for improvements. As we noted before, our cost structure is becoming a competitive advantage for the company and one that we are very focused on maintaining and growing as prices recover. 
On the A&D front, we closed our 2 Haynesville asset packages in the first quarter and continue to work smaller asset packages, particularly in the Mid-Continent area. We will continue to optimize our portfolios and work toward our goal of removing another $2 billion to $3 billion of debt off our books. 
Following the end of the quarter, we satisfied the judgment of $441 million related to our 2019 notes litigation on April 28, which also relieved the associated letter of credit. Our liquidity following this payment and the pending release of the LC is approximately $3.3 billion. As a reminder, this had no impact on our liquidity as the posted LC had already removed the amount from our liquidity. 
It's certainly worth noting that inclusive of this payment and the opportunistic buy-down of certain midstream contracts we completed during the quarter and open-market purchases of debt, we are seeing higher-than-expected available liquidity for the company due to strong performance of our underlying business. 
Finally, for 2017, we currently have approximately 75% of our remaining projected gas production hedged at $3.05 per Mcf and approximately 64% of our remaining projected oil production hedged at $50.25 per barrel. Using the midpoints of our production guidance, we have also started to hedge a portion of our 2018 gas production at a little over $3 per Mcf and a small portion of our 2018 oil production over $51 per barrel so far. 
To close, we believe that the next 18 months are going to be very exciting for Chesapeake as we start to see significant earnings and cash flow growth and margin expansion due to greater oil volumes, larger producing wells across our portfolio and new plays like the PRB that, combined with our leading operating cost structure and capital efficiency, will start to make a meaningful difference in the financial performance of the company.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I would like you to just kind of go -- look back at the October data that we gave you. We are on track there. We have a large number of Sussex wells that we're going to be pushing through the system because at the time, that was the best economics in the portfolio for the Powder and some of the best economics in the company. We've now tested the Turner on one side, and we're waiting on turning the second Turner well in line. Honestly, we've had that well drilled and ready to turn in for several weeks. It was a tight location, and we could not do what we've been doing, which is building our facilities ahead of time, so we had to build our facilities after the rig left. That well will be turned in line here in the next week or so. And when we get that well online, I think that's going to open up the Turner as a really good position to run with. And that's several hundred wells that we can drill there. They're going to have outstanding economics, probably, as we see it today, better than the Sussex. So that's going to jump to the top of the list, and that's why Doug and we've talked about, in that instance, we're going to move -- probably move another rig into focus on the Turner. The big question, the next big question is going to be the Mowry. We've now [ PD-ed ] the first Mowry well. We'll be putting it online here in the second -- into the third quarter, and that will open up additional running room. So we see really strong running room in the Sussex, which we define by that big sandbar that we've been chasing, the Turner across a majority of our acreage. Niobrara now with the new enhanced completions look much better than we had anticipated. So that's going to open up. We see this as several thousand locations available to us, and that, remember, is on relatively broad spacing. If we see an opportunity to down space here, that's just going to increase our opportunity set. That's what you needed, Doug?"

Northwest STACK seems to be moving up the relative priority list as it relates to, again, your opportunity set. And I guess I really just wanted to ask the monetization question slightly differently because the only thing that really seems to be holding you back from getting recognition for some of this stuff is there's still high leverage of -- or a high level of debt and leverage obviously. So I guess what I'm really asking is that, as you evolve the portfolio towards these more oily areas, higher-rate areas, more economic areas, how do you think about the relative reset in your portfolio? I'm thinking specifically Marcellus and whether you would ever consider accelerating asset sales across some of your more pure-play gas names -- gas positions."

And as we evaluate the portfolio constantly, the churn in evaluation consists of, what is the EBITDA generation? What is the future potential? What is the competitive investment thesis in our portfolio of great assets going forward? The key in my mind and across the company is that we're going to continue to improve our operations and continue to improve our balance sheet and look for opportunities to reduce our debt further as quickly as possible. I'd just draw your attention back to what the investment community's view of the Haynesville was a few years ago and to the significant value that our operating expertise and experiences, what that's done and the uplift there that we've recognized and the value of that asset in the past few years as we continue to drill and produce just big boomer wells there in the Haynesville Shale. That same transfer of technology and operating capability, we've pushed to the Powder River, and we have that excitement there. And as you look at the Marcellus and the Utica in the Northeast, these are very, very strong cash-generating assets, some of the best rock -- shale gas rock in the world. When you can spend $100 million and keep an asset flat at 2 Bcf a day for the next 5-plus years, it's a tremendous asset to have in our portfolio. What I'm getting at there is that if we can accelerate the value, we will absolutely do that and consider bigger asset sales, broader asset sales to accelerate the value to our shareholders. But make no mistake, along the way, as we evaluate the portfolio and continue with our investment thesis, we're driving the greatest value in a very disciplined capital program, pursuing that free cash flow neutrality. Essentially, if it weren't for some of the extraneous items the past several quarters, we have -- our spending has been in line, capital spending for drilling and completion CapEx within our EBITDA. And we're going to continue those asset sales and look for opportunities to add the value. But make no mistake, across the portfolio, we're making meaningful improvements that will generate value for our shareholders in the future."

The primary financial focus of the company is going to continue to be to drive our debt balance lower and meet our long-term debt targets. If you think about the excess liquidity that we generated through strong operational performance, I commented in my prepared notes this morning that we have diverted some funds to reducing some burdensome contracts. Those were done at favorable economics, and I can assure you that as we think about doing something like that, we compare it to the relative benefit of retiring debt and think about the yield on doing so and found that retiring those contracts was more attractive. So when you think about the excess liquidity that we generated above plan, we apply it back to a cost improvement, effective leverage reduction, and we will always be focused on reducing our leverage until we hit our goal. When Doug talks about reallocating some capital to the Powder River, think about the fact that, that may very well be just that: a reallocation, not a net increase in rigs. And as we get into the second half of the year and we see what kind of commodity price environment we're heading into in '18 and we determine what our proper total capital spend going into next year should be, given the market environment, given the cash flow we expect to generate, that's when you would make a decision about whether or not that's a net add or it's a shift. So the focus remains debt reduction. Liquidity, we protect, but I think we are comfortable with the liquidity we have. We don't want to see it eroded to grow production, grow cash flow unless it's doing so in a really high rate-of-return way that is additive to our overall efforts of reducing leverage and rating -- putting the company in a position to generate free cash flow. So none of these things can happen overnight unless you're willing to destroy value, and we're not. So we're getting there. And the previous question about asset sales is still very, very much front of mind for us, and that will continue to drive the majority of our leverage reduction."

We're really not seeing decline right now. Remember, these -- the Sussex and the Turner are actually silty sandstones, so they react a little bit differently than, say, your unconventional plays that are the shales or something much, much tighter. There is actually some permeability in this rock, so it's going to behave a little bit differently. We will start seeing pressure and production decline, but right now, the well is really just kind of cleaning up and getting its horsepower behind it. So that's why we're pretty excited about this. If you remember the way the map was when we laid it out in October, this well is over on the very western edge of what we thought the play was. It was kind of a well that we needed to drill on a federal unit to maintain the federal unit. And we also had a good Parkman over there, so we decided to drill it and take a core. The core was better than we expected, and the productivity of the well is much better than we expected. Then we moved basically 17 miles to the east, the other well that we're waiting to turn on. It's in a much -- probably a better part of the rock. That well is a shorter lateral, but we carried a pretty big flare with high mud weight while we were drilling that. And that well is just ready to turn online as soon as we get the facilities hooked up. So this Turner is -- looks like it's on the upper end of what we expected. So we're pretty excited about it, and that's why we're talking about if both of these work the way they look like they're going to work, we're going to have to start focusing some serious effort on the Turner here. And the beauty of it is we can develop Turner off of Sussex pads. We can develop Niobrara and Turner off the same pads. I mean, this is a STACK play where we're going to be able to develop a lot of production off of smaller footprints. We have to manage that, though, because we don't want to tie up a bunch of drilling and completion capital and not get the volume. So we're working through a field development plan right now to put all this in play."

We have a really good footprint. We've been able to put together a really nice acreage position on top of what we already had. One of the reasons we haven't talked about a lot of results is because we're continuing to add to our acreage position out there and coring up. And then we knew the Chester was something that we were really interested in, and no one had really chased it much. But when you look at the map, the reason it hasn't been chased much is because we own about 230,000 acres of it, and we own the core of it. So we needed more data on that. We've now drilled 2 wells and taking core, and we're laying one of those wells out horizontally and will be doing some completion testing. The thing about the Chester, it's -- they're thinner reservoirs. They do produce vertically, they're oil prone, but there's 4 to 5 STACK reservoirs on our acreage position. So we're really interested in that play, but we want to do the science and get it right both on the geo side and on the completion side."

Chesapeake continued to deliver our business as planned in the second quarter. We have several exciting well results improved the quality and strength of our portfolio and provide confidence in our capital efficiency and operational performance. As a reminder, our 2017 capital program was designed to improve our margins and increase cash flow following the production decline resulting from asset sales and low capital investment in 2015 and 2016. We are reiterating today our full year guidance for capital and production as previously disclosed. I'm pleased to share that the value at capital efficiency of our investments continue to improve through our extended lateral expertise and completion technologies. We are on track to deliver our 2017 oil growth target of 10%. And we expect to exceed our goal of 100,000 barrels of oil per day prior to year-end. This production target is a leading indicator of our strategic goal of restoring the company's cash flow. We are pleased to see that oil production coming online. And I'd like to highlight the improvement in our EBITDA per BOE, which has more than doubled from a year ago. These are important metrics to monitor as we position the company for growth within cash flow and increase returns on capital.
Production in the second quarter averaged over 528,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, flat compared to our first quarter production. In July, we have already seen a significant uptick in production from the second quarter average of approximately 540,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We expect our production will accelerate further beginning in August as we plan to plays our production approximately 60 wells in this month alone. In the second half of 2017, we expect to turn in line approximately 250 wells, representing more than half of our turn-in-line wells for the year. Turning to the assets quickly. In Western Dimmitt County in South Texas, we are in the process of bringing online 20 wells that have some form of completion design. Our oil growth trajectory for the company for the remainder of 2017 is primarily driven by the Eagle Ford. For the second half of 2017, we expect to place roughly 100 wells online in South Texas compared to 61 wells turn-in-line during the first half 2017. In the Powder River Basin, we are presently operating 2 rigs and we plan to add a third rig in October. We are very encouraged by the results have seen for our first Turner and Parkman wells along with the early results from our first Mowry well. Our first to Turner wells continue to outperform our pre-drill expectations. These 2 wells have each recorded cumulative equivalent production of 224,000 barrels, approximately 78% oil and 134,000 barrels, approximately 40% -- 46% oil, respectively after 142 and 76 days online, respectively. We plan to dedicate the third rig exclusively to additional Turner development and place another 4 wells on production in the Turner this year. Our first Mowry wells provide confirmation to be a significant resource. While it's only unloaded 21% of the fracture stimulation and has reached a peak rate of over 6 million cubic feet of gas per day with a relatively short lateral. We have seen spot rates as high as 7.6 million cubic feet of gas during flowback. But as noted, the wells still flow in a large volume of frac fluid. We drilled this well in a gas window essentially as a proof-of-concept well to test productivity, permeability and pressure and strategically located near existing infrastructure to minimize cycle times and maximize value. We've taken 2 quarters in the oilier are year and each showed good saturation. Our plan will be to move into this oilier area and drill a longer lateral on our next well. The Powder River Basin will also contribute to our oil growth target in 2017 as we plan to put 19 wells to sale in the latter half of the year compared to 9 wells in the first half of the year. In the Mid-Continent, our produced water cut is on the high end of expectations pressure on the economics of our North Meramec wells. We continue to redesign our completion techniques and will redeploy capital from this program as necessary since we evaluate the results. In the Marcellus, we begun testing different completion designs of flow capacity. Our earlier results from the McGavin well are nothing short of outstanding. We started flowback on the McGavin well last Friday. And after 6 days, it has already reached a peak rate of 61 million cubic feet of gas per day, making it the highest rate well we have operated in the Marcellus and possibly the highest rate will ever recorded in Northeast Pennsylvania. We will continue to test enhanced completion in many of the [ 40 or so ] remaining wells we plan to place on production in the Marcellus by year-end. Finally, in the Haynesville Shale, we recently drilled and completed a 7,500-foot lateral well in DeSoto Parish with a peak rate of over 38 million cubic feet of gas per day or nearly 5.15 million cubic feet of gas per thousand lateral feet. This result is particularly important because this well is located outside of the Spring Ridge area where majority of our recent success has taken place. This well's performance gives us additional encouragement as we prove the concept of laterals and enhance completions across our entire acreage position. We also performed our first rig Haynesville completion utilizing a new production liner. Peak production from this refrac reached almost 9 million cubic feet of gas per day from a lateral of only 2990 feet. This is encouraging result and we look forward to doing more refracs in 2018. 
In the first 6 months of 2017, we made good progress in increasing our EBITDA to growing oil production keeping our cash costs low and reducing our market commitments and obligations by approximately $585 million. Looking to 2018, our operating and capital efficiencies provide significant flexibility in capital spending and have significant note free cash flow neutrality is achievable at $50 oil and $3 gas in 2018.
We are prepared to adjust our 2018 capital program and production growth targets based on market conditions. Our key priorities are unchanged for the company. Further reducing our debt is our top priority while continuing to improve our operating performance, capital efficiency and EBITDA margins. We are resolute, determined and confident in our ability to achieve our strategy and to deliver differential value to our shareholders. I'll now pass the call to Nick to share further details in our second quarter financials."

As Doug mentioned, our production started move higher in July. And we expect that our multi-well turn-in-line projects in the Eagle Ford, Utica and PRB will provide strong oil production acceleration in the third quarter. On the cost side, we expect our combined production and G&A expenses to move lower in the second half of 2017 on a per unit basis. This is despite a modest increase in G&A costs as -- primarily as a result of asset sales. We reduced our producing well counts in which we had a working interest by over 24,000 gross wells over the last 18 months, primarily driven by our divestitures in the Mid-Continent asset and areas, reducing our overhead recovery in producing locations. We always expect these combined metrics on a per BOE basis, particularly LOE to continue to decline in the last 6 months of the year. Our gathering process and transportation expenses improved sequentially on BOE basis, and we reduced our oil and NGLs GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance. We are currently projecting an improvement in our oil basis by $0.30 per barrel, due in part to strengthening market conditions in the U.S. Gulf Coast and a flatter Contango oil curve along with several successful marketing development initiatives across all 4 oil basins in our portfolio. On the gas side, although our basis for the first 6 months of the year came in better than we had anticipated, we are maintaining our guidance due to the recent pressure seen in the northeast with delays of Rover and the pipeline.
We increased our income statement interest expense guidance primarily as a result of accounting adjustments related to the $750 million debt refinancing we completed in June. This is primarily a function of refinancing the second lien notes that we're accounted for under the troubled debt restructuring accounting rules where the second lien notes have a GAAP carrying value premium that depreciates over time. With the tender, we saw an acceleration of a portion of that depreciation that was previously an offset to reported interest expense. Notably, our cash interest expense was virtually unchanged as a result of the June refinancing.
Regarding our cash position, as expected, we have used the cash balance we started the year with to retire debt and other obligations and now sit with a $575 million revolving credit facility balance and $3.1 billion of available liquidity. Related to our core business, total CapEx has outpaced EBITDA by approximately $200 million year-to-date as we restore the company's cash flow-generating capability. Separately, we have retired debt of approximately $1 billion inclusive of tender loans, open-market repurchases, calls of near-term debt and debt maturities. We've paid legal settlements and judgments of approximately $500 million, including the Bank of New York litigation, paid approximately $400 million and marketing contracts and paid interest preferred dividends of approximately $450 million. All this activity was offset by sales proceeds of approximately $950 million today. This was in line with expectations for the first half of the year and as a result, we have reduced debt, improved working capital deficit and improved our profitability on a go-forward basis. On the A&D front following the close of our Haynesville Shale assets in the first quarter, we have sold or agreed to sell multiple additional producing properties and acreage for approximately $360 million to date. We expect approximately $265 million of these signed asset sale agreements to close in the third quarter. The production impact of the assets sold to date in 2017 is minimal, about 16 Bcf of gas. Since we have not adjusted our total gas production guidance for the year, it's also a reflection of the production power of our remaining gas assets. We continue to work noncore asset packages, particularly the Mid-Continent area as well as larger assets as we work toward our goal of removing $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet. 
Finally for 2017, we currently have approximately 74% of our remaining projected cash production hedged at $3.09 per Mcf and approximately 60% of our remaining projected oil production hedged at approximately $50.32 per barrel. Using the midpoint of our production guidance, we have also hedged the portion of our 2018 gas production hedged at $3.09 per Mcf and have added to our 2018 oil hedges, which have an average hedge price of around $49.87 a barrel.

And as we noted, we intended to average 17 rigs for the year. We've been high to that a little bit, and we planned on reducing our rig activity in the latter part of the year.

Keep in mind as well that the flexibility around our program today is we have tremendous to direct our capital towards where we see the best returns based on market conditions and based on results of our investments. The capital efficiently and flexibility the company has is something that I consider to be one of our competitive strengths. As a result of that competitive strengths, we are in excellent position to reduce our capital or increase our capital based on market conditions. And we're prepared to do so with the hedging protection that we have in place for 2017 and our goal of restoring that cash flow after these asset sales and the reduced activity in the past few years, we feel very comfortable and very confident that the extended lateral program and the completion efficiency and the results seen in some of these areas such as Powder River Basin, this monster well we've seen in Marcellus and the continued improvements in the Eagle Ford that were pumping bigger fracs and seeing good results from it. And so we are in good position to exactly as planned so it's noted as a reduction in drilling activity, but it's really just a reallocation and capital towards where the best investments for our strategy are to be located. And as we look forward to 2018, we are in excellent position at $50 oil and $3 gas to be free cash flow-neutral. And we're prepared to adjust the program as necessary."

Kudos also to the field team for safely and efficiently bringing a well that magnitude on. That's an incredible achievement. We had to basically redesign the surface facilities. As you can imagine, we're not used to bringing on 60 million a day wells on the Marcellus. So that's great. As far as the Marcellus as we see it today, we've been producing pretty steady in the 2 to 2.2 Bcf a day and that's our capacity as far as being able to get gas out of the field. We're still looking for more opportunities this is a great and we can step on the accelerator. But I think the more important thing about the big well is it tells you how -- first how good the rock is because this is an undeveloped portion of the field. It's not an outlier. It's kind of the heart of the field. Secondly, as we push these better completions and longer laterals is going to speak to the capital efficiency we're going to have less capital in the branded or the same gas, which is pretty substantial and the third probably the most important thing in the future is this is in the core of the field. But just like in Haynesville this completion design, this well design, if we move it out into what we consider the less prospective area, the less core area we can actually change what the core is in this field. And our footprint really high quality gas is now probably expanded substantially."

We put a very large frac on it. Honestly, didn't really want to talk about it as early because we're early in the flowback. We're only about 20-plus percent of frac flow back, but the well came on gas almost instantaneously. And it's been pretty stout gas well. Until we get it unloaded, we just don't know what that's going to do. We've taken 2 cores in Turner wells. The Mowry marry is just below the Turner. We've taken 2 cores this year. Those cores are in our lateral. We've analyzed them. They have good saturations of gas and oil. So the next test we do will probably be up into oil or gas ram to see what we can do as far as getting a hot one of over well, a higher rate well not knowing what this what is going to do.

Chesapeake continued to deliver our business as planned in the second quarter. We have several exciting well results that prove the quality and strength of our portfolio and provide confidence in our capital efficiency and operational performance. 
As a reminder, our 2017 capital program was designed to improve our margins and increase cash flow following a production decline resulting from asset sales and low capital investment in 2015 and 2016. We are reiterating today our full year guidance for capital and production as previously disclosed. 
I'm pleased to share that the value and capital efficiency of our investments continue to improve through our extended lateral expertise and completion technologies. We are on track to deliver our 2017 oil growth target of 10%, and we expect to exceed our goal of 100,000 barrels of oil per day prior to year-end. This production target is a leading indicator of our strategic goal of restoring the company's cash flow. We are pleased to see the oil production coming online. And I'd like to highlight the improvements in our EBITDA per boe, which has more than doubled from a year ago. These are important metrics to monitor as we position the company for growth within cash flow and increase returns on capital.
Production in the second quarter averaged over 528,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, flat compared to our first quarter production. In July, we have already seen a significant uptick in production from the second quarter average of approximately 548,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We expect our production will accelerate further beginning in August as we plan to place on production approximately 60 wells in this month alone. In the second half of 2017, we expect to turn in line approximately 250 wells, representing more than half of our total turn-in-line wells for the year. 
Just turning to the assets quickly. In western Dimmitt County in South Texas, we are in the process of bringing online 20 wells that have some form of enhanced completion design. Our oil growth trajectory for the company for the remainder of 2017 is primarily driven by the Eagle Ford. For the second half of 2017, we expect to place roughly 100 wells online in South Texas compared to 61 wells turned in line during the first half 2017. 
In the Powder River Basin, we are presently operating 2 rigs, and we plan to add a third rig in October. We are very encouraged by the results we have seen from our first Turner and Parkman wells along with the early results from our first Mowry well. Our first 2 Turner wells continue to outperform our predrill expectations. These 2 wells have each recorded cumulative equivalent production of 224,000 barrels, approximately 78% oil; and 134,000 barrels, approximately 46% oil, respectively, after 142 and 76 days online, respectively. We plan to dedicate the third rig exclusively to additional Turner development and place another 4 wells on production in the turn of this year. 
Our first Mowry wells provide confirmation of what we estimated to be a significant resource. While it has only unloaded 21% of the fracture stimulation fluid pump, it has reached a peak rate of over 6 million cubic feet of gas per day with a relatively short lateral. We have seen spot rates as high as 7.6 million cubic feet of gas during flowback. But as noted, the well is still flowing a large volume of frac fluid. We drilled this well in a gas window essentially as a proof-of-concept well to test productivity, permeability and pressure. And it's strategically located near existing infrastructure to minimize cycle times and maximize value. We have taken 2 cores in the oilier area this year, and each showed good saturation. Our plan will be to move into this oilier area and drill a longer lateral on our next well. 
The Powder River Basin will also contribute to our oil growth target in 2017 as we plan to put 19 wells to [ sale ] in the latter half of the year compared to 9 wells in the first half of the year. 
In the Mid-Continent, our produced water cut is on the high end of expectations and putting pressure on the economics of our north Meramec wells. We continue to redesign our completion techniques and will redeploy capital from this program as necessary as we evaluate new results. 
In the Marcellus, we have begun testing different completion designs and flow capacity. Our earlier results from the McGavin well are nothing short of outstanding. We started flowback on the McGavin well last Friday. And after 6 days, it has already reached a peak rate of 61 million cubic feet of gas per day, making it the highest-rate well we have operated in the Marcellus and possibly the highest rate well ever recorded in Northeast Pennsylvania. We will continue to be -- to test enhanced completion in many of the 40-or-so remaining wells we plan to place on production in the Marcellus by year-end. 
Finally, in the Haynesville Shale, we recently drilled and completed a 7,500-foot lateral well in DeSoto Parish with a peak rate of over 38 million cubic feet of gas per day or nearly 5.15 million cubic feet of gas per thousand lateral feet. This result is particularly important because this well is located outside of the Springridge area where the majority of our recent success has taken place. This well's performance gives us additional encouragement as we prove the concept of long laterals and enhanced completions across our entire acreage position. We also performed our first Haynesville rig completion utilizing a new production liner. Peak production from this refrac reached almost 9 million cubic feet of gas per day from a lateral of only 2,990 feet. This is an encouraging result, and we look forward to doing more refracs in 2018. 
In the first 6 months of 2017, we made good progress in increasing our EBITDA through growing oil production, keeping our cash costs low and reducing our market commitments and obligations by approximately $585 million. Looking to 2018, our operating and capital efficiencies provide significant flexibility in capital spending. And of significant note, free cash flow neutrality is achievable at $50 oil and $3 gas in 2018. We are prepared to adjust our 2018 capital program and production growth targets based on market conditions. 
Our key priorities are unchanged for the company. Further reducing our debt is our top priority while continuing to improve our operating performance, capital efficiency and EBITDA margins. We are resolute, determined and confident in our ability to achieve our strategy and to deliver differential value to our shareholders. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick to share further details on our second quarter financials."

As Doug mentioned, our production started to move higher in July, and we expect that our multi-well turn-in-line projects in the Eagle Ford, Utica and PRB will provide strong oil production acceleration in the third quarter. 
On the cost side, we expect our combined production and G&A expenses to move lower in the second half of 2017 on a per unit basis. This is despite a modest increase in G&A costs as -- primarily as a result of asset sales. We've reduced our producing well counts in which we had a working interest by over 24,000 gross wells over the last 18 months, primarily driven by our divestitures in the Mid-Continent, Barnett and Devonian areas, reducing our overhead recovery on producing locations. [ Progress ], we expect these combined metrics on a per boe basis, particularly LOE, to continue to decline in the last 6 months of the year. 
Our gathering, processing and transportation expenses improved sequentially on a boe basis. And we reduced our oil and NGL GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance on oil. We are currently projecting an improvement in our oil basis by $0.30 per barrel, due in part to strengthening market conditions in the U.S. Gulf Coast and a flatter contango oil curve, along with several successful marketing development initiatives across all 4 oil basins in our portfolio. 
On the gas side, although our basis for the first 6 months of the year came in better than we had anticipated, we are maintaining our basis guidance due to the recent pressure seen in the Northeast with the delays of Rover and the Nexus pipeline.
We increased our income statement interest expense guidance primarily as a result of accounting adjustments related to the $750 million debt refinancing we completed in June. This was primarily a function of refinancing the second lien notes that were accounted for under the troubled debt restructuring accounting rules where the second lien notes have a GAAP carrying value premium that depreciates over time. With the tender, we saw an acceleration of a portion of that depreciation that was previously an offset to reported interest expense. Notably, our cash interest expense was virtually unchanged as a result of the June refinancing.
Regarding our cash position. As expected, we have used the cash balance we started the year with to retire debt and other obligations and now sit with a $575 million revolving credit facility balance and $3.1 billion of available liquidity. Related to our core business, total CapEx has outpaced EBITDA by approximately $200 million year-to-date as we restore the company's cash flow-generating capability. Separately, we have retired debt of approximately $1 billion inclusive of tender settlements, open-market repurchases, calls of near-term debt and debt maturities. We've paid legal settlements and judgments of approximately $500 million, including the Bank of New York litigation; paid approximately $400 million in buydowns of marketing contracts; and paid interest and preferred dividends of approximately $450 million. All this activity was offset by sales proceeds of approximately $950 million to date. This outspend was in line with our expectations for the first half of the year, and as a result, we have reduced debt, improved our working capital deficit and improved our profitability on a go-forward basis. 
On the A&D front, following the close of our Haynesville Shale assets in the first quarter, we have sold or agreed to sell multiple additional producing properties and acreage for approximately $360 million to date. We expect approximately $265 million of these signed asset sale agreements to close in the third quarter. The production impact of the assets sold to date in 2017 is minimal, about 16 bcf of gas. Since we have not adjusted our total gas production guidance for the year, it's also a reflection of the productive power of our remaining gas assets. We continue to work other noncore asset packages, particularly the Mid-Continent area, as well as larger assets as we work toward our goal of removing $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet. 
Finally for 2017, we currently have approximately 74% of our remaining projected gas production hedged at $3.09 per mcf and approximately 60% of our remaining projected oil production hedged at approximately $50.32 per barrel. Using the midpoints of our production guidance, we have also hedged a meaningful portion of our 2018 gas production hedged at $3.09 per mcf and have added to our 2018 oil hedges, which have an average hedge price of around $49.87 per barrel.

And as we noted, we intended to average 17 rigs for the year. We've been high to that a little bit, and we planned on reducing our rig activity in the latter part of the year. So this is really consistent with our plan. Keep in mind as well that the flexibility around our program today is we have tremendous optionality to direct our capital towards where we see the best returns based on market conditions and based on the results of our investments. That capital efficiently and flexibility the company has is something that I consider to be one of our competitive strengths. As a result of that competitive strength, we are in excellent position to reduce our capital or increase our capital based on market conditions. And we're prepared to do so. With the hedging protection that we have in place for 2017 and our goal of restoring that cash flow after these asset sales and the reduced activity in the past few years, we feel very comfortable and very confident that the extended lateral program, our completion efficiency and the results we're seeing in some of these areas such as Powder River Basin, this monster well we've seen in the Marcellus and the continued improvements in the Eagle Ford that -- where there are bigger -- we're pumping bigger fracs and seeing good results from it. So we're in great position to perform exactly as planned. It's noted as a reduction in drilling activity, but it's really -- just it's the allocation of capital towards where the best investments for our strategy are to be located. And as we look forward to 2018, we are in excellent position at $50 oil and $3 gas to be free cash flow neutral. And we're prepared to adjust that program as necessary."

So they did a great job of challenging themselves and coming up with, ""Okay, how could we optimize and make the best Marcellus completion possible?"" Kudos also to the field team for safely and efficiently bringing a well that magnitude on. That's an incredible achievement. We had to basically redesign the surface facilities. As you can imagine, we're not used to bringing on 60 million a day wells in the Marcellus. So that's great. As far as the Marcellus as we see it today, we have been producing pretty steady in the 2 to 2.2 bcf a day, and that's our capacity as far as being able to get pipe out -- gas out of the field. We are still looking for more opportunities, which are -- this is great rock, and we can step on the accelerator. But I think the more important thing about the big well is it tells you how -- first how good the rock is because this is in a developed portion of the field. It's not an outlier. It's kind of in the heart of the field. Secondly, as we push these better completions and longer laterals, it's going to speak to the capital efficiency. We're going to have less capital in the ground for the same gas, which is pretty substantial. And then the third and probably the most important thing for the future is this is in the core of the field. But just like in the Haynesville, this completion design, this well design, if we move it out into the -- what we consider the less prospective area, the less core area, we can actually change what the core is in this field. And our footprint of really high-quality gas is now probably expanded substantially."

And we will be bringing a bunch of those wells online here in the next 2 to 3 weeks. The Turner has been fantastic. We've basically drilled the edges. We have not drilled the core of the field yet. We are now moving rigs into a more core area. We've learned quite a bit about the GOR across the field, which is -- it changes slightly, but the pressure has been good. The deliverability has been outstanding. So we're going to continue to tweak our completions to optimize these. We're drilling longer and longer laterals now, both in the Sussex and in the Turner. So you're going to see us focus in -- the rest of '17 and into '18 and into '19 on those 2 plays. The Niobrara, what we determined to date is that completion matters. And so the bigger completions really changes the dynamics of that play. We will continue to work that into our plan. Parkman is good. It's just not a large player on our acreage position. So we're going to focus on our best economics. We're pretty excited about what we've seen in the Turner. And I'm really, really excited about what we -- what I anticipate the Sussex is going to do here in the next few weeks."

We knew that formation would be higher pressure and potentially naturally fractured. So what we did was we decided to drill a well where we had access to pipes so we could maximize the value of what we were testing. So we went to kind of to the center of the field where our gas pipe -- gathering system is robust and drilled a 4,100-foot lateral. We did not want to take a big bite on this because the Mowry in the area has always been notoriously difficult to drill horizontally, but we got a really good 4,100-foot lateral. We've put a very large frac on it. Honestly, didn't really want to talk about it this early because we're early in the flowback. We're only about 20-plus percent of the frac fluid back, but the well came on gas almost instantaneously. And it's been a pretty stout gas well. Until we get it unloaded, we just don't know what it's going to do. We've taken 2 cores in Turner wells. The Mowry is just below the Turner. We've taken 2 cores this year. Those cores are in our lateral. We've analyzed them. They have good saturations of gas and oil. So the next test we do will probably be up in the oil or wet gas realm to see what we can do as far as getting a hot one, a longer well, a higher-rate well. Not knowing what this one's going to do, we don't know what it's going to do. But a higher-rate well and a better economic well. So that is in the testing stage. Powder, the way I look at Powder in the near term is Sussex, Turner and probably Niobrara, Mowry is something that will come on the back side of that."

Chesapeake continued to deliver our business as planned in the second quarter. We have several exciting well results that prove the quality and strength of our portfolio and provide confidence in our capital efficiency and operational performance. 
As a reminder, our 2017 capital program was designed to improve our margins and increase cash flow following a production decline resulting from asset sales and low capital investment in 2015 and 2016. We are reiterating today our full year guidance for capital and production as previously disclosed. 
I'm pleased to share that the value and capital efficiency of our investments continue to improve through our extended lateral expertise and completion technologies. We are on track to deliver our 2017 oil growth target of 10%, and we expect to exceed our goal of 100,000 barrels of oil per day prior to year-end. This production target is a leading indicator of our strategic goal of restoring the company's cash flow. We are pleased to see the oil production coming online. And I'd like to highlight the improvements in our EBITDA per boe, which has more than doubled from a year ago. These are important metrics to monitor as we position the company for growth within cash flow and increase returns on capital.
Production in the second quarter averaged over 528,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, flat compared to our first quarter production. In July, we have already seen a significant uptick in production from the second quarter average to approximately 548,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We expect our production will accelerate further beginning in August as we plan to place on production approximately 60 wells in this month alone. In the second half of 2017, we expect to turn in line approximately 250 wells, representing more than half of our total turn-in-line wells for the year. 
Just turning to the assets quickly. In western Dimmitt County in South Texas, we are in the process of bringing online 20 wells that have some form of enhanced completion design. Our oil growth trajectory for the company for the remainder of 2017 is primarily driven by the Eagle Ford. For the second half of 2017, we expect to place roughly 100 wells online in South Texas compared to 61 wells turned in line during the first half 2017. 
In the Powder River Basin, we are presently operating 2 rigs, and we plan to add a third rig in October. We are very encouraged by the results we have seen from our first Turner and Parkman wells along with the early results from our first Mowry well. Our first 2 Turner wells continue to outperform our predrill expectations. These 2 wells have each recorded cumulative equivalent production of 224,000 barrels, approximately 78% oil; and 134,000 barrels, approximately 46% oil, respectively, after 142 and 76 days online, respectively. We plan to dedicate the third rig exclusively to additional Turner development and place another 4 wells on production in the turn of this year. 
Our first Mowry wells provide confirmation of what we estimated to be a significant resource. While it has only unloaded 21% of the fracture stimulation fluid pump, it has reached a peak rate of over 6 million cubic feet of gas per day with a relatively short lateral. We have seen spot rates as high as 7.6 million cubic feet of gas during flowback. But as noted, the well is still flowing a large volume of frac fluid. We drilled this well in a gas window essentially as a proof-of-concept well to test productivity, permeability and pressure. And it's strategically located near existing infrastructure to minimize cycle times and maximize value. We have taken 2 cores in the oilier area this year, and each showed good saturation. Our plan will be to move into this oilier area and drill a longer lateral on our next well. 
The Powder River Basin will also contribute to our oil growth target in 2017 as we plan to put 19 wells to place in the latter half of the year compared to 9 wells in the first half of the year. 
In the Mid-Continent, our produced water cut is on the high end of expectations and putting pressure on the economics of our north Meramec wells. We continue to redesign our completion techniques and will redeploy capital from this program as necessary as we evaluate new results. 
In the Marcellus, we have begun testing different completion designs and flow capacity. Our earlier results from the McGavin well are nothing short of outstanding. We started flowback on the McGavin well last Friday. And after 6 days, it has already reached a peak rate of 61 million cubic feet of gas per day, making it the highest-rate well we have operated in the Marcellus and possibly the highest rate well ever recorded in Northeast Pennsylvania. We will continue to be -- to test enhanced completion in many of the 40-or-so remaining wells we plan to place on production in the Marcellus by year-end. 
Finally, in the Haynesville Shale, we recently drilled and completed a 7,500-foot lateral well in DeSoto Parish with a peak rate of over 38 million cubic feet of gas per day or nearly 5.15 million cubic feet of gas per thousand lateral feet. This result is particularly important because this well is located outside of the Springridge area where the majority of our recent success has taken place. This well's performance gives us additional encouragement as we prove the concept of long laterals and enhanced completions across our entire acreage position. We also performed our first Haynesville rig completion utilizing a new production liner. Peak production from this refrac reached almost 9 million cubic feet of gas per day from a lateral of only 2,990 feet. This is an encouraging result, and we look forward to doing more refracs in 2018. 
In the first 6 months of 2017, we made good progress in increasing our EBITDA through growing oil production, keeping our cash costs low then reducing our market commitments and obligations by approximately $585 million. Looking to 2018, our operating and capital efficiencies provide significant flexibility in capital spending. And of significant note, free cash flow neutrality is achievable at $50 oil and $3 gas in 2018. We are prepared to adjust our 2018 capital program and production growth targets based on market conditions. 
Our key priorities are unchanged for the company. Further reducing our debt is our top priority while continuing to improve our operating performance, capital efficiency and EBITDA margins. We are resolute, determined and confident in our ability to achieve our strategy and to deliver differential value to our shareholders. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick to share further details on our second quarter financials."
323857,530303768,1265184,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2017",2017-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone.

Our production grew 2% sequentially after adjusting for asset sales. As Doug mentioned, our production started to move higher in July, and we expect that our multi-well turn-in-line projects in the Eagle Ford, Utica and PRB will provide strong oil production acceleration in the third quarter. 
On the cost side, we expect our combined production and G&A expenses to move lower in the second half of 2017 on a per unit basis. This is despite a modest increase in G&A costs as -- primarily as a result of asset sales. We've reduced our producing well counts in which we had a working interest by over 24,000 gross wells over the last 18 months, primarily driven by our divestitures in the Mid-Continent, Barnett and Devonian areas, reducing our overhead recovery on producing locations. Regardless, we expect these combined metrics on a per boe basis, particularly LOE, to continue to decline in the last 6 months of the year. 
Our gathering, processing and transportation expenses improved sequentially on a boe basis. And we reduced our oil and NGL GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance on oil. We are currently projecting an improvement in our oil basis by $0.30 per barrel, due in part to strengthening market conditions in the U.S. Gulf Coast and a flatter contango oil curve, along with several successful marketing development initiatives across all 4 oil basins in our portfolio. 
On the gas side, although our basis for the first 6 months of the year came in better than we had anticipated, we are maintaining our basis guidance due to the recent pressure seen in the Northeast with the delays of Rover and the Nexus pipeline.
We increased our income statement interest expense guidance primarily as a result of accounting adjustments related to the $750 million debt refinancing we completed in June. This is primarily a function of refinancing the second lien notes that were accounted for under the troubled debt restructuring accounting rules where the second lien notes have a GAAP carrying value premium that depreciates over time. With the tender, we saw an acceleration of a portion of that depreciation that was previously an offset to reported interest expense. Notably, our cash interest expense was virtually unchanged as a result of the June refinancing.
Regarding our cash position. As expected, we have used the cash balance we started the year with to retire debt and other obligations and now sit with a $575 million revolving credit facility balance and $3.1 billion of available liquidity. Related to our core business, total CapEx has outpaced EBITDA by approximately $200 million year-to-date as we restore the company's cash flow-generating capability. Separately, we have retired debt of approximately $1 billion inclusive of tender settlements, open-market repurchases, calls of near-term debt and debt maturities. We've paid legal settlements and judgments of approximately $500 million, including the Bank of New York litigation; paid approximately $400 million in buydowns of marketing contracts; and paid interest in preferred dividends of approximately $450 million. All this activity was offset by sales proceeds of approximately $950 million to date. This outspend was in line with our expectations for the first half of the year, and as a result, we have reduced debt, improved our working capital deficit and improved our profitability on a go-forward basis. 
On the A&D front, following the close of our Haynesville Shale assets in the first quarter, we have sold or agreed to sell multiple additional producing properties and acreage for approximately $360 million to date. We expect approximately $265 million of these signed asset sale agreements to close in the third quarter. The production impact of the assets sold to date in 2017 is minimal, about 16 bcf of gas. Since we have not adjusted our total gas production guidance for the year, it's also a reflection of the productive power of our remaining gas assets. We continue to work other noncore asset packages, particularly the Mid-Continent area, as well as larger assets as we work toward our goal of removing $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet. 
Finally for 2017, we currently have approximately 74% of our remaining projected gas production hedged at $3.09 per mcf and approximately 60% of our remaining projected oil production hedged at approximately $50.32 per barrel. Using the midpoints of our production guidance, we have also hedged a meaningful portion of our 2018 gas production hedged at $3.09 per mcf and have added to our 2018 oil hedges, which have an average hedge price of around $49.87 per barrel.

And as we noted, we intended to average 17 rigs for the year. We've been high to that a little bit, and we planned on reducing our rig activity in the latter part of the year. So this is really consistent with our plan. Keep in mind as well that the flexibility around our program today is we have tremendous optionality to direct our capital towards where we see the best returns based on market conditions and based on the results of our investments. That capital efficiency and flexibility the company has is something that I consider to be one of our competitive strengths. As a result of that competitive strength, we are in excellent position to reduce our capital or increase our capital based on market conditions. And we're prepared to do so. With the hedging protection that we have in place for 2017 and our goal of restoring that cash flow after these asset sales and the reduced activity in the past few years, we feel very comfortable and very confident that the extended lateral program, our completion efficiency and the results we're seeing in some of these areas such as Powder River Basin, this monster well we've seen in the Marcellus and the continued improvements in the Eagle Ford that -- where there are bigger -- we're pumping bigger fracs and seeing good results from it. So we're in great position to perform exactly as planned. It's noted as a reduction in drilling activity, but it's really -- just it's the allocation of capital towards where the best investments for our strategy are to be located. And as we look forward to 2018, we are in excellent position at $50 oil and $3 gas to be free cash flow neutral. And we're prepared to adjust that program as necessary."

So they did a great job of challenging themselves and coming up with, ""Okay, how could we optimize and make the best Marcellus completion possible?"" Kudos also to the field team for safely and efficiently bringing a well that magnitude on. That's an incredible achievement. We had to basically redesign the surface facilities. As you can imagine, we're not used to bringing on 60 million a day wells in the Marcellus. So that's great. As far as the Marcellus as we see it today, we have been producing pretty steady in the 2 to 2.2 bcf a day, and that's our capacity as far as being able to get pipe out -- gas out of the field. We are still looking for more opportunities, which are -- this is great rock, and we can step on the accelerator. But I think the more important thing about the big well is it tells you how -- first how good the rock is because this is in a developed portion of the field. It's not an outlier. It's kind of in the heart of the field. Secondly, as we push these better completions and longer laterals, it's going to speak to the capital efficiency. We're going to have less capital in the ground for the same gas, which is pretty substantial. And then the third and probably the most important thing for the future is this is in the core of the field. But just like in the Haynesville, this completion design, this well design, if we move it out into the -- what we consider the less prospective area, the less core area, we can actually change what the core is in this field. And our footprint of really high-quality gas is now probably expanded substantially."

We are now moving rigs into a more core area. We've learned quite a bit about the GOR across the field, which is -- it changes slightly, but the pressure has been good. The deliverability has been outstanding. So we're going to continue to tweak our completions to optimize these. We're drilling longer and longer laterals now, both in the Sussex and in the Turner.

We knew that formation would be higher pressure and potentially naturally fractured. So what we did was we decided to drill a well where we had access to pipes so we could maximize the value of what we were testing. So we went to kind of to the center of the field where our gas pipe -- gathering system is robust and drilled a 4,100-foot lateral. We did not want to take a big bite on this because the Mowry in the area has always been notoriously difficult to drill horizontally, but we got a really good 4,100-foot lateral. We've put a very large frac on it. Honestly, didn't really want to talk about it this early because we're early in the flowback. We're only about 20-plus percent of frac fluid back, but the well came on gas almost instantaneously. And it's been a pretty stout gas well. Until we get it unloaded, we just don't know what it's going to do. We've taken 2 cores in Turner wells. The Mowry is just below the Turner. We've taken 2 cores this year. Those cores are in our lateral. We've analyzed them. They have good saturations of gas and oil. So the next test we do will probably be up in the oil or wet gas realm to see what we can do as far as getting a hot one, a longer well, a higher-rate well. Not knowing what this one's going to do, we don't know what it's going to do. But a higher-rate well and a better economic well. So that is in the testing stage. Powder, the way I look at Powder in the near term is Sussex, Turner and probably Niobrara, Mowry is something that will come on the back side of that."

Good morning, and thank you for joining our call this morning. Chesapeake continued to deliver our business as planned in the second quarter.

Chesapeake continued to deliver our business as planned in the second quarter. We have several exciting well results that prove the quality and strength of our portfolio and provide confidence in our capital efficiency and operational performance. 
As a reminder, our 2017 capital program was designed to improve our margins and increase cash flow following a production decline resulting from asset sales and low capital investment in 2015 and 2016. We are reiterating today our full year guidance for capital and production as previously disclosed. 
I'm pleased to share that the value and capital efficiency of our investments continue to improve through our extended lateral expertise and completion technologies. We are on track to deliver our 2017 oil growth target of 10%, and we expect to exceed our goal of 100,000 barrels of oil per day prior to year-end. This production target is a leading indicator of our strategic goal of restoring the company's cash flow. We are pleased to see the oil production coming online. And I'd like to highlight the improvements in our EBITDA per boe, which has more than doubled from a year ago. These are important metrics to monitor as we position the company for growth within cash flow and increase returns on capital.
Production in the second quarter averaged over 528,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, flat compared to our first quarter production. In July, we have already seen a significant uptick in production from the second quarter average to approximately 548,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We expect our production will accelerate further beginning in August as we plan to place on production approximately 60 wells in this month alone. In the second half of 2017, we expect to turn in line approximately 250 wells, representing more than half of our total turn-in-line wells for the year. 
Just turning to the assets quickly. In western Dimmitt County in South Texas, we are in the process of bringing online 20 wells that have some form of enhanced completion design. Our oil growth trajectory for the company for the remainder of 2017 is primarily driven by the Eagle Ford. For the second half of 2017, we expect to place roughly 100 wells online in South Texas compared to 61 wells turned in line during the first half 2017. 
In the Powder River Basin, we are presently operating 2 rigs, and we plan to add a third rig in October. We are very encouraged by the results we have seen from our first Turner and Parkman wells along with the early results from our first Mowry well. Our first 2 Turner wells continue to outperform our predrill expectations. These 2 wells have each recorded cumulative equivalent production of 224,000 barrels, approximately 78% oil; and 134,000 barrels, approximately 46% oil, respectively, after 142 and 76 days online, respectively. We plan to dedicate the third rig exclusively to additional Turner development and place another 4 wells on production in the turn of this year. 
Our first Mowry wells provide confirmation of what we estimated to be a significant resource. While it has only unloaded 21% of the fracture stimulation fluid pump, it has reached a peak rate of over 6 million cubic feet of gas per day with a relatively short lateral. We have seen spot rates as high as 7.6 million cubic feet of gas during flowback. But as noted, the well is still flowing a large volume of frac fluid. We drilled this well in a gas window essentially as a proof-of-concept well to test productivity, permeability and pressure. And it's strategically located near existing infrastructure to minimize cycle times and maximize value. We have taken 2 cores in the oilier area this year, and each showed good saturation. Our plan will be to move into this oilier area and drill a longer lateral on our next well. 
The Powder River Basin will also contribute to our oil growth target in 2017 as we plan to put 19 wells to place in the latter half of the year compared to 9 wells in the first half of the year. 
In the Mid-Continent, our produced water cut is on the high end of expectations and putting pressure on the economics of our north Meramec wells. We continue to redesign our completion techniques and will redeploy capital from this program as necessary as we evaluate new results. 
In the Marcellus, we have begun testing different completion designs and flow capacity. Our earlier results from the McGavin well are nothing short of outstanding. We started flowback on the McGavin well last Friday. And after 6 days, it has already reached a peak rate of 61 million cubic feet of gas per day, making it the highest-rate well we have operated in the Marcellus and possibly the highest rate well ever recorded in Northeast Pennsylvania. We will continue to be -- to test enhanced completion in many of the 40-or-so remaining wells we plan to place on production in the Marcellus by year-end. 
Finally, in the Haynesville Shale, we recently drilled and completed a 7,500-foot lateral well in DeSoto Parish with a peak rate of over 38 million cubic feet of gas per day or nearly 5.15 million cubic feet of gas per thousand lateral feet. This result is particularly important because this well is located outside of the Springridge area where the majority of our recent success has taken place. This well's performance gives us additional encouragement as we prove the concept of long laterals and enhanced completions across our entire acreage position. We also performed our first Haynesville rig completion utilizing a new production liner. Peak production from this refrac reached almost 9 million cubic feet of gas per day from a lateral of only 2,990 feet. This is an encouraging result, and we look forward to doing more refracs in 2018. 
In the first 6 months of 2017, we made good progress in increasing our EBITDA through growing oil production, keeping our cash costs low then reducing our market commitments and obligations by approximately $585 million. Looking to 2018, our operating and capital efficiencies provide significant flexibility in capital spending. And of significant note, free cash flow neutrality is achievable at $50 oil and $3 gas in 2018. We are prepared to adjust our 2018 capital program and production growth targets based on market conditions. 
Our key priorities are unchanged for the company. Further reducing our debt is our top priority while continuing to improve our operating performance, capital efficiency and EBITDA margins. We are resolute, determined and confident in our ability to achieve our strategy and to deliver differential value to our shareholders. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick to share further details on our second quarter financials."

As Doug mentioned, our production started to move higher in July, and we expect that our multi-well turn-in-line projects in the Eagle Ford, Utica and PRB will provide strong oil production acceleration in the third quarter. 
On the cost side, we expect our combined production and G&A expenses to move lower in the second half of 2017 on a per unit basis. This is despite a modest increase in G&A costs as -- primarily as a result of asset sales. We've reduced our producing well counts in which we had a working interest by over 24,000 gross wells over the last 18 months, primarily driven by our divestitures in the Mid-Continent, Barnett and Devonian areas, reducing our overhead recovery on producing locations. Regardless, we expect these combined metrics on a per boe basis, particularly LOE, to continue to decline in the last 6 months of the year. 
Our gathering, processing and transportation expenses improved sequentially on a boe basis. And we reduced our oil and NGL GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance on oil. We are currently projecting an improvement in our oil basis by $0.30 per barrel, due in part to strengthening market conditions in the U.S. Gulf Coast and a flatter contango oil curve, along with several successful marketing development initiatives across all 4 oil basins in our portfolio. 
On the gas side, although our basis for the first 6 months of the year came in better than we had anticipated, we are maintaining our basis guidance due to the recent pressure seen in the Northeast with the delays of Rover and the Nexus pipeline.
We increased our income statement interest expense guidance primarily as a result of accounting adjustments related to the $750 million debt refinancing we completed in June. This is primarily a function of refinancing the second lien notes that were accounted for under the troubled debt restructuring accounting rules where the second lien notes have a GAAP carrying value premium that depreciates over time. With the tender, we saw an acceleration of a portion of that depreciation that was previously an offset to reported interest expense. Notably, our cash interest expense was virtually unchanged as a result of the June refinancing.
Regarding our cash position. As expected, we have used the cash balance we started the year with to retire debt and other obligations and now sit with a $575 million revolving credit facility balance and $3.1 billion of available liquidity. Related to our core business, total CapEx has outpaced EBITDA by approximately $200 million year-to-date as we restore the company's cash flow-generating capability. Separately, we have retired debt of approximately $1 billion inclusive of tender settlements, open-market repurchases, calls of near-term debt and debt maturities. We've paid legal settlements and judgments of approximately $500 million, including the Bank of New York litigation; paid approximately $400 million in buydowns of marketing contracts; and paid interest in preferred dividends of approximately $450 million. All this activity was offset by sales proceeds of approximately $950 million to date. This outspend was in line with our expectations for the first half of the year, and as a result, we have reduced debt, improved our working capital deficit and improved our profitability on a go-forward basis. 
On the A&D front, following the close of our Haynesville Shale assets in the first quarter, we have sold or agreed to sell multiple additional producing properties and acreage for approximately $360 million to date. We expect approximately $265 million of these signed asset sale agreements to close in the third quarter. The production impact of the assets sold to date in 2017 is minimal, about 16 bcf of gas. Since we have not adjusted our total gas production guidance for the year, it's also a reflection of the productive power of our remaining gas assets. We continue to work other noncore asset packages, particularly the Mid-Continent area as well as larger assets as we work toward our goal of removing $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet. 
Finally for 2017, we currently have approximately 74% of our remaining projected gas production hedged at $3.09 per mcf and approximately 60% of our remaining projected oil production hedged at approximately $50.32 per barrel. Using the midpoints of our production guidance, we have also hedged a meaningful portion of our 2018 gas production hedged at $3.09 per mcf and have added to our 2018 oil hedges, which have an average hedge price of around $49.87 per barrel.

And as we noted, we intended to average 17 rigs for the year. We've been high to that a little bit, and we planned on reducing our rig activity in the latter part of the year. So this is really consistent with our plan. Keep in mind as well that the flexibility around our program today is we have tremendous optionality to direct our capital towards where we see the best returns based on market conditions and based on the results of our investments. That capital efficiency and flexibility the company has is something that I consider to be one of our competitive strengths. As a result of that competitive strength, we are in excellent position to reduce our capital or increase our capital based on market conditions. And we're prepared to do so. With the hedging protection that we have in place for 2017 and our goal of restoring that cash flow after these asset sales and the reduced activity in the past few years, we feel very comfortable and very confident that the extended lateral program, our completion efficiency and the results we're seeing in some of these areas such as Powder River Basin, this monster well we've seen in the Marcellus and the continued improvements in the Eagle Ford that -- where there are bigger -- we're pumping bigger fracs and seeing good results from it. So we're in great position to perform exactly as planned. It's noted as a reduction in drilling activity, but it's really -- just it's the allocation of capital towards where the best investments for our strategy are to be located. And as we look forward to 2018, we are in excellent position at $50 oil and $3 gas to be free cash flow neutral. And we're prepared to adjust that program as necessary."

So they did a great job of challenging themselves and coming up with, ""Okay, how could we optimize and make the best Marcellus completion possible?"" Kudos also to the field team for safely and efficiently bringing a well that magnitude on. That's an incredible achievement. We had to basically redesign the surface facilities. As you can imagine, we're not used to bringing on 60 million a day wells in the Marcellus. So that's great. As far as the Marcellus as we see it today, we have been producing pretty steady in the 2 to 2.2 bcf a day, and that's our capacity as far as being able to get pipe out -- gas out of the field. We are still looking for more opportunities, which are -- this is great rock, and we can step on the accelerator. But I think the more important thing about the big well is it tells you how -- first how good the rock is because this is in a developed portion of the field. It's not an outlier. It's kind of in the heart of the field. Secondly, as we push these better completions and longer laterals, it's going to speak to the capital efficiency. We're going to have less capital in the ground for the same gas, which is pretty substantial. And then the third and probably the most important thing for the future is this is in the core of the field. But just like in the Haynesville, this completion design, this well design, if we move it out into the -- what we consider the less prospective area, the less core area, we can actually change what the core is in this field. And our footprint of really high-quality gas is now probably expanded substantially."

Now we're going to step on the gas on those. We will focus on those. The Sussex, we are drilling -- we are basically in development mode. It goes at the heart of the field. And we will be bringing a bunch of those wells online here in the next 2 to 3 weeks. The Turner has been fantastic. We've basically drilled the edges. We have not drilled the core of the field yet. We are now moving rigs into a more core area. We've learned quite a bit about the GOR across the field, which is -- it changes slightly, but the pressure has been good. The deliverability has been outstanding. So we're going to continue to tweak our completions to optimize these. We're drilling longer and longer laterals now, both in the Sussex and in the Turner. So you're going to see us focus in -- the rest of '17 and into '18 and into '19 on those 2 plays. The Niobrara, what we determined to date is that completion matters. And so the bigger completions really changes the dynamics of that play. We will continue to work that into our plan. Parkman is good. It's just not a large player on our acreage position. So we're going to focus on our best economics. We're pretty excited about what we've seen in the Turner. And I'm really, really excited about what we -- what I anticipate the Sussex is going to do here in the next few weeks."

We knew that formation would be higher pressure and potentially naturally fractured. So what we did was we decided to drill a well where we had access to pipes so we could maximize the value of what we were testing. So we went to kind of to the center of the field where our gas pipe -- gathering system is robust and drilled a 4,100-foot lateral. We did not want to take a big bite on this because the Mowry in the area has always been notoriously difficult to drill horizontally, but we got a really good 4,100-foot lateral. We've put a very large frac on it. Honestly, didn't really want to talk about it this early because we're early in the flowback. We're only about 20-plus percent of frac fluid back, but the well came on gas almost instantaneously. And it's been a pretty stout gas well. Until we get it unloaded, we just don't know what it's going to do. We've taken 2 cores in Turner wells. The Mowry is just below the Turner. We've taken 2 cores this year. Those cores are in our lateral. We've analyzed them. They have good saturations of gas and oil. So the next test we do will probably be up in the oil or wet gas realm to see what we can do as far as getting a hot one, a longer well, a higher-rate well. Not knowing what this one's going to do, we don't know what it's going to do. But a higher-rate well and a better economic well. So that is in the testing stage. Powder, the way I look at Powder in the near term is Sussex, Turner and probably Niobrara, Mowry is something that will come on the back side of that."

They remain unchanged and drive all our business activities and every investment. Improving our balance sheet is a top line-oriented and indeed journey. We made great progress during the last few years reducing our total leverage for debt and obligation retirement, debt for equity exchanges and refinancing. We intend to further reduce our leverage and improve our debt-to-EBITDA multiple through additional asset sales and accretive acquisitions in the near term. Our stated target of free cash flow neutrality is critical to the financial strength of the company and is achievable within the next 1 to 2 years due to the quality of our assets and our industry-leading capital efficiency. Enhancing our returns and margins is also key to our financial stability and will be accomplished through increasing our oil volumes as a percentage of total production and aggressive cash cost leadership.
Now moving to our performance for the third quarter. I'm pleased to report our production started to climb as forecasted following the previously announced weather and related operational delays experienced during the quarter. As of October 30, our field production reached the daily rate of 584,000 barrels of oil equivalent, including 99,000 barrels of oil. Our fourth quarter volumes will be dominated by heavy turn-in-line schedule in our South Texas Eagle Ford asset, and we remain on target deliver our goal of averaging 100,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter. 
On the operations front, our people, technology and portfolio continue to combined to drive improvement in our productivity and value across all of our assets. This most recently been demonstrated in the Marcellus where we began deploying enhanced completion techniques on the Upper Marcellus. Results have been impressive. Our 2 Upper Marcellus pad wells placed on production September had achieved peak rates of 39 million cubic feet of gas per day. Both wells averaged roughly 6,700-foot laterals fracture stimulated with over 3,000 pounds of sand per foot and reconstrained by service production put in limits. Not only are the rates over 50% higher than previous peak rates from our Upper Marcellus wells, they were placed on production back in September of 2015, but these results confirm further delineation of our Upper Marcellus resource potential, significantly increasing our core position across the play. We plan to place the well, another Upper Marcellus well with enhanced completion online in December. on our Lower Marcellus McGavin well, which we placed on production in late July with an enhanced completion and a booming 61 million cubic foot per day rate has produced 4.3 Bcf of gas in its first 90 days with an average daily gross production rate of 48 million cubic feet of gas per day. This is an incredible well, which will pay out in roughly 9 months, and it provides a glimpse of things still to come from this world-class resource. Our progress in the Marcellus is a continuation of our technology across the entire portfolio. It all started in the Haynesville about a year ago when we began these larger completion jobs with powerful results. Accordingly, we believe the data we have in house and the technology we are utilizing today are revolutionizing the productivity in every one of our operating areas. 
Our Haynesville asset has evolved from an underappreciated asset to one of the most powerful gas basins in North America, rivaling even the Marcellus. Thanks to our unique ability to successfully couple long laterals with enhanced completions, an IP of 30 million cubic feet per day is now the new normal for Chesapeake. Just 3 years ago, our Haynesville well had initial production rates of only 12 million cubic feet per day. While the production growth alone is impressive, I'm especially proud of our teams accomplished this while improving capital efficiency by 30%. We turned 12 wells to sales in the third quarter highlighted by 4 wells on our BSNR patent DeSoto Parish, which combined making 134 million cubic feet of gas per day. Last week, our net production in the Haynesville hit 1 Bcf of gas per day. And to reiterate, on a net basis, we saw our highly highest daily gas rate since November of 2012. In addition, we have a new 10,000-foot Bossier well that will be turn-in-line in a few days and our first 15,000-foot Haynesville well will be online early in the first quarter. We're excited about our progress in this redefined prolific play. In South Texas, the Eagle Ford continues to drive our oil production growth. We placed 31 wells on production in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we plan to place approximately 73 wells on production. We're seeing encouraging results from completions targeting and longer laterals highlighted by best per unit well, which featured a 3-mile lateral with an enhanced completion resulting in key production of more than 2,000 barrels of oil per day. Additionally, we also targeted 2 tests in the third quarter and are pleased by current performance as both wells steadily climbing while each well reaching over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We'll continue to monitor productivity and update you on the progress in the Austin Chalk. Moving on to the Powder River Basin, and perhaps no asset better demonstrates our ability to create future differential value for our shareholders than this asset. Technology capital efficiency, geoscience expertise and smart creative employees truly intersect in Converse County. As you know, only a few years ago that have we moved all rigs and essentially all capital from the Powder. Our team made the most of the downtime understanding a tremendous tactic potential of our acreage, which ultimately will make the play the most promising over the opportunity in the portfolio. In September, our third Turner well is completed with a 4,500-foot lateral and placed on production, achieving a peak rate of more than 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 82% was oil. We recently place 2 new Turner wells in production 2 days -- just 2 days ago, and we'll have peak rates to report in a few days.
We added a third rig in October and expect to place in production a total of 11 wells in the fourth quarter. Looking to 2018, we expect to provide operational performance and CapEx guidance in early February. We anticipate reducing our capital expenditures during 2018 and still delivering a relatively flat to slightly increasing production profile for the year. Capital efficiency is a proven strike at Chesapeake. And the powerful combination of technology, high-quality assets and talented driven employees will continue to deliver improving results of our shareholders.
A little over 4 years ago, we started a major financial and operational transfer -- transformation here at Chesapeake. There's a significant prior to the collapse of commodity price. Chesapeake continues to grow stronger every day, and the improvements over the past few years serves as a strong foundation for greater returns and competitiveness. I am more confident in the future of the company than I've ever been. And as you can expect, further differential improvements and value growth will come from Chesapeake Energy. I'll now pass the call to Nick for some additional details regarding third quarter financial results."

As Doug mentioned, our total production during the third quarter grew 3% sequentially and 4% sequentially after adjusting for asset sales. We look forward to be this rate in the fourth quarter as we see the benefit of our significant Q2 to Q3 capital investments come online, and we are well on our way to averaging 100,000 barrels of oil per day, up 16% from our third quarter oil production. On the cost side, our combined production, gathering, processing and transportation and G&A expenses decreased slightly in the third quarter compared to Q2. We have seen some pressure in LOEs. We increased our oil volumes but have made room for that through our continued focus in G&A. We have seen and expect to see further synergies from volume growth on GP&T expenses this year and next. In October, we refinanced various secured and unsecured debt with $850 million of longer-dated unsecured notes resulting in a reduction of the principal amount of secure debt of [ $557  ] million. In total, we have reduced principal amount of our secured debt by approximately $1.2 billion this year to date and will look to further reduce our secure debt balances as the opportunities arise. 
On the capital front, we have seen the high for the year of our third quarter CapEx and expect our fourth quarter CapEx to be approximately $500 million. As a result, we raised the bottom end of our total capital guidance to a midpoint of $2.4 billion, which is approximately where we expect to end for the year. As Doug mentioned, we are currently working our 2018 capital plan and will provide more color on this in February. As we consider our capital allocation for 2018, we remain focused on value versus volumes and believe that value for our shareholders will be enhanced by a more balanced cash flow profile. We will remain flexible with our capital rise or fall dramatically, but we do not plan to change capital higher as a result of the recent modest increase in 2018 strip. As a reminder, we had some large onetime events in 2017, including outlays of approximately $550 million to resolve legal issues, primarily the Bank of New York matter, and approximately $400 million in buyouts in marketing in midstream contracts, but we do not project anything equivalent in 2018. As we look forward to 2018, we anticipate spending less capital than 2017 keeping our overall production flat to slightly higher compared to 2017 again subject to change of market conditions. On the A&D front, we closed multiple producing property at acreage sales for approximately $1.2 billion to date in 2017, which include our Haynesville Shale assets closed earlier in the year and several smaller Mid-Continent packages. We continue to work encore asset packages, particularly in the Mid-Continent as well as assets as we work toward goal of removing $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet.
Finally and most importantly, we have 579 Bcf of gas -- of 2018 production gas hedged at $3.10 per Mcf and nearly 21 million barrels of our 2018 oil production hedged at $51.33 per barrel. Further, we have significantly reduced 2 of our more volatile basis pricing exposures for 2018 in basin Marcellus gas sales and oil sales out of the Eagle Ford.
Marcellus and basin prices have strengthened significantly over the summer and in the late fall due to anticipation of new takeaway pipeline projects combined with the slowdown in production growth. We have had roughly 50% of our Marcellus and basin exposure for 1 year, which is the November '17 to October '18 period or about 190 million cubic feet a day. Average basis differential captured on these trades is $0.77 compared to our 2017 realized basis differential of $1.34 for this area. While also actively pursuing discussions with other parties and longer-term contracts alternative markets creating incremental demand in the region at competitive pricing. On the oil side, we sell approximately 60% of our total company net oil production on LLS base contracts. The index began the year trading and smoking to WTI of around $1.50 per barrel and declined significantly in the past few months. Given the recent strength we've hedged over 30% of our volumes for 2018. Current trades for 2018 average $3.20 basis differential to NYMEX versus average 2017 realized basis differential of $2.86 for volumes. These index and basin trades have given us a very strong level of protection on the 2018 cash flow.

Great question and happy to address. It's always difficult to be precise in talking about what we expect in the way of transactions, whether they be divestitures or any form of transaction because they are hard to predict, the timing hard to predict exactly what we'll play out. I can assure you that we work tirelessly to continue to reform our balance sheet, and the way that's going to happen is through asset sales. We have always considered asset sales in 3 buckets. They are truly noncore assets, which this company and every other E&P company should sell every year. There are assets of that we own a significant position in where we can trends a bit of our position still own a good solid position going forward that accelerate value from a part of the play that we wouldn't get to in a reasonable period of time. And a great example of that for this company Haynesville position, which closed at the beginning of 2017, the last of the full basin exit. We worked all 3 of those buckets of asset sales every day. We have active discussions going on on those types of transactions every day. Transactions through the middle of 2017 have been challenging. The availability of capital to this industry has been limited while the broad capital markets across all industries have been very strong, and there have been brief windows where we and others have been able to access the capital markets and other points of capital successfully. Broad-based access to capital for growth has been limited. But that results in a difficulty to bring transactions to fruition, but there are many motivated buyers out there seeking capital, and we're talking to many of them, and we will remain laser focused on delivering on our asset sales to reduce our debt. We'll stay away from that lines that are ultimately somewhat artificial, whether they be the end of this year or beginning of next year. We'll get this done. We'll get it done at the right time for the right value. We won't be driving for the last dollar, so to speak. We're thinking of the big strategic picture here, but we have to get it done right."

And for the last month, we've seen really good response. We think we can change the frac program and get the same result. You're going to see us look at potentially an Austin Chalk program that will augment our program next year and the following years.

All we're wanting to note this morning is given the current market environment and given our goals, we seem privy to have less capital in 2018 versus 2017. 2017, we really needed to restore our level of cash flow-generating capability off of a very low investment in 2016. So we needed to catch up a bit in some areas. We've done that. You can see those wells coming online here in the fourth quarter. And so exactly where we level out to a run rate, we're going to hold off. We're still running a lot of scenarios around that at this point, and prices remain somewhat volatile we continue to hedge, which we are pleased about that the risks how we think about the capital program next year. We'll continue to look at what we achieve in the A&D market. And all that will influence we also look at our well results. All that will influence the ultimate capital allocation for the portfolio next year. The takeaway that we wanted to leave everybody with this morning is that the inherent capital efficiency of the underlying portfolio what we delivered so far this year is we can spend less money than we did this year and still grow next year. We may not choose to spend that much. We may choose to not prices would fall apart. We may choose prices were to really run and we can hedge them accordingly to make you spend a little bit more, but don't look for us to change the strip higher with every bit. We are really showing internally that we can do better with some discipline here, and the scenarios we're running highlight that we be focused on delivery of these goals over time, which is going to result in, at this point, pretty modest capital program next year. We'll give more information on that as we get into '18. As we firm it up, things could change but that's what we're looking at right now."

Since we got the program going, Jason's team has knocked these wells down to under 30 days. We just bought 2 wells on this week, our most recent wells, and those 2 wells we've adjusted the completions. And we knocked $1.5 million off of each of those completions. So where we are today in the Turner is not where we're going to be tomorrow in the Turner. It's only going to get better. Kudos for the field team as well. They've been stretched pretty thin, and the culture of the company I think is so strong now. We've had people from Mid-Con and Gulf Coast go up and help that team out.

They remain unchanged and drive all of our business activities and every investment. Improving our balance sheet is our top priority and indeed, a journey. We've made great progress during the last few years reducing our total leverage through debt and obligation retirement, debt for equity exchanges and refinancing. We intend to further reduce our leverage and improve our debt-to-EBITDA multiple through additional asset sales and accretive acquisitions in the near term. Our stated target of free cash flow neutrality is critical to the financial strength of the company and is achievable within the next 1 to 2 years due to the quality of our assets and our industry-leading capital efficiency. Enhancing our returns and margins is also key to our financial stability and will be accomplished through increasing our oil volumes as a percentage of total production and aggressive cash cost leadership.
Now moving to our performance for the third quarter. I'm pleased to report our production has started to climb as forecasted following the previously announced weather and related operational delays experienced during the quarter. As of October 30, our fuel production reached a daily rate of 584,000 barrels of oil equivalent, including 99,000 barrels of oil. Our fourth quarter volumes will be dominated by heavy turn-in-line schedule in our South Texas Eagle Ford asset, and we remain on target deliver our goal of averaging 100,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter. 
On the operations front, our people, technology and portfolio continue to combine to drive improvement in our productivity and value across all of our assets. This effort has most recently been demonstrated in the Marcellus, where we've begun deploying enhanced completion techniques on the Upper Marcellus. Results have been impressive. Our 2 Upper Marcellus Maris pad wells placed on production in September have achieved peak rates of 30 million cubic feet of gas per day. Both wells averaged roughly 6,700-foot laterals or fracture-stimulated with over 3,000 pounds of sand per foot and were constrained by service production and equipment limits. Not only are their rates over 50% higher than previous peak rates from our Upper Marcellus wells that were placed on production back in September of 2015, but these results confirm further delineation of our Upper Marcellus resource potential, significantly increasing our core position across the play. We plan to place the [indiscernible] well, another Upper Marcellus well with enhanced completion, online in December. 
I'll take you on our Lower Marcellus McGavin well, which we placed on production in late July with an enhanced completion and a booming 61 million cubic foot per day rate, has produced 4.3 Bcf of gas in its first 90 days with an average daily gross production rate of 48 million cubic feet of gas per day. This is an incredible well, which will pay out in roughly 9 months, and it provides a glimpse of things still to come from this world-class resource. Our progress in the Marcellus is a continuation of our technology learnings across the entire portfolio. It all started in the Haynesville about a year ago when we began these larger completion jobs with powerful results. Accordingly, we believe the data we have in-house and the technology we're utilizing today are revolutionizing the productivity in every one of our operating areas. 
Our Haynesville asset has evolved from an underappreciated asset to one of the most powerful gas basins in North America, rivaling even the Marcellus. Thanks to our unique ability to successfully couple long laterals with enhanced completions, an IP of 30 million cubic feet per day is now the new normal for Chesapeake. Just 3 years ago, our Haynesville wells had initial production rates of only 12 million cubic feet per day. While the production growth alone is impressive, I'm especially proud that our teams have accomplished this feat while improving our capital efficiency by 30%. We turned 12 wells to sales in the third quarter highlighted by 4 wells on our BSNR pad in DeSoto Parish, which combined are making 134 million cubic feet of gas per day. Last week, our net production in the Haynesville hit 1 Bcf of gas per day on a net basis, which is our highly -- the highest daily gas rate since November 2012. 
In addition, we have a new 10,000-foot Bossier well that will be turned in line in a few days, and our first 15,000-foot Haynesville well will be online early in the first quarter. We're excited about our progress in this redefined prolific play. 
In South Texas, the Eagle Ford continues to drive our oil production growth. We placed 31 wells on production in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we plan to place approximately 73 wells on production. We're seeing encouraging results from completions, targeting and longer laterals highlighted by Vesper unit well, which featured a 3-mile lateral with an enhanced completion resulting in key production of more than 2,000 barrels of oil per day. Additionally, we also turned in line 2 Austin Chalk appraisal tests in the third quarter and are pleased by current performance as both wells have been steadily climbing [indiscernible], each well reaching over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We'll continue to monitor productivity and update you on the progress in the Austin Chalk. 
Moving on to the Powder River Basin. Perhaps no asset better demonstrates our ability to create future differential value for our shareholders than this asset. Technology, capital efficiency, geoscience expertise and smart creative employees have truly intersected in Converse County. As you know, it's only a few years ago that we removed all rigs and essentially all capital from the Powder. Our team made the most from the downtime, beating our understanding of the tremendous stacked pay potential of our acreage, which ultimately will make the play the most promising all-growth opportunity in our portfolio. In September, our third Turner well was completed with a 4,500-foot lateral and placed on production, achieving a peak rate of more than 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 82% was oil. We recently placed 2 new Turner wells on production 2 days -- just 2 days ago, and we'll have peak rates to report in a few days. We added a third rig in October and expect to place on production a total of 11 wells in the fourth quarter. 
Looking to 2018, we expect to provide operational performance and CapEx guidance in early February. We anticipate reducing our capital expenditures during 2018 and still delivering a relatively flat to slightly increasing production profile for the year. Capital efficiency is a proven strength at Chesapeake. And the powerful combination of technology, high-quality assets and talented driven employees will continue to deliver improving results for our shareholders.
A little over 4 years ago, we started a major financial and operational transformation here at Chesapeake. There's a significant challenge prior to the collapse of commodity price. Chesapeake continues to grow stronger every day, and the improvements over the past few years serve as a strong foundation for greater returns and competitiveness. I am more confident in the future of the company than I've ever been. And as you can expect, further differential improvements and value growth will come from Chesapeake Energy. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick for some additional details regarding the third quarter financial results."
323857,541105836,1329637,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, our total production during the third quarter grew 3% sequentially and 4% sequentially after adjusting for asset sales. We look forward to the acceleration of this rate in the fourth quarter",786,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, our total production during the third quarter grew 3% sequentially and 4% sequentially after adjusting for asset sales. We look forward to the acceleration of this rate in the fourth quarter as we see the benefit of our significant Q2 to Q3 capital investments come online, and we are well on our way to averaging 100,000 barrels of oil per day, up 16% from our third quarter oil production. 
On the cost side, our combined production, gathering, processing and transportation and G&A expenses decreased slightly in the third quarter compared to Q2. We have seen some pressure on LOE as we increased our oil volumes, but have made room for that through our continued focus on G&A. We have seen and expect to see further synergies from volume growth on GP&T expenses this year and in next. 
In October, we refinanced various secured and unsecured debt with $850 million of longer-dated unsecured notes, resulting in a reduction of the principal amount of secured debt of $557 million. In total, we have reduced the principal amount of unsecured debt by approximately $1.2 billion this year to date and will look to further reduce our secured debt balances as the opportunities arise. 
On the capital front, we have seen a high for the year with our third quarter CapEx and expect our fourth quarter CapEx to be approximately $500 million. As a result, we raised the bottom end of our total capital guidance to a midpoint of $2.4 billion, which is approximately where we expect to land for the year. As Doug mentioned, we are currently working our 2018 capital plan and will provide more color on this in February. As we consider our capital allocation for 2018, we remain focused on value versus volumes and believe that value for our shareholders will be enhanced by a more balanced cash flow profile. We will remain flexible with our capital should prices rise or fall dramatically, but we do not plan to chase capital higher as a result of the recent modest increase in the 2018 strip. 
As a reminder, we had some large onetime events in 2017, including outlays of approximately $550 million to resolve legal issues, primarily the Bank of New York matter, and approximately $400 million in buy-downs of marketing in midstream contracts, but we do not project anything equivalent in 2018. As we look forward to 2018, we anticipate spending less capital than 2017 while keeping our overall production flat to slightly higher compared to 2017, again, subject to change with market conditions. 
On the A&D front, we've closed multiple producing property and acreage shales for approximately $1.2 billion to date in 2017, which include our Haynesville Shale assets the closed earlier in the year and several smaller Mid-Continent packages. We continue to work other noncore asset packages, particularly in the Mid-Continent, as well as larger assets as we work toward our goal of removing $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet.
Finally and most importantly, we have 579 Bcf of gas -- of 2018 production gas hedged at $3.10 per Mcf and nearly 21 million barrels of our 2018 oil production hedged at $51.33 per barrel. Further, we have significantly reduced 2 of our more volatile basis pricing exposures for 2018: in-basin Marcellus gas sales and LLS oil sales out of the Eagle Ford.
Marcellus in-basin prices have strengthened significantly over the summer and in the late fall due to anticipation of new takeaway pipeline projects combined with the slowdown in production growth. We have hedged roughly 50% of our Marcellus in-basin exposure for 1 year, which is the November '17 to October '18 period or about 190 million cubic feet a day. Average basis differential captured on these trades is $0.77 compared to our 2017 realized basis differential of $1.34 for this area. We're also actively pursuing discussions with other parties on longer-term contracts to alternative markets, creating incremental demand in the region at competitive pricing. 
On the oil side, we sell approximately 60% of our total company net oil production on LLS-based contracts. The LLS index began the year trading in small premium to WTI of around $1.50 per barrel, and it has climbed significantly in the past few months. Given the recent strength, we've hedged over 30% of our LLS-exposed volumes for 2018. Current LLS trades for 2018 average $3.20 basis differential to NYMEX versus average 2017 realized basis differential of $2.86 for LLS volumes. These index and basis trades have given us a very strong level of protection on our 2018 cash flow.

Great question and happy to address. It's always difficult to be precise in talking about what we expect in the way of transactions, whether they be divestitures or any other form of transaction because they are hard to predict timing, hard to predict exactly what will play out. I can assure you that we work tirelessly to continue to reform our balance sheet, and the way that that's going to happen is through asset sales. We have always considered asset sales in 3 buckets: There are truly noncore assets, which this company and every well-run E&P company should sell every year. There are assets that we own a significant position in, where we can trim a bit of our position and still own a good, solid position going forward to accelerate value from a part of the play that we wouldn't get to in a reasonable period of time. A great example of that for this company would be the sales that we have out of our Haynesville position, which closed at the beginning of 2017, the last of the full-basin exit. We work all 3 of those buckets of asset sales every day. We have active discussions going on, on those types of transactions every day. Transactions through the middle of 2017 have been challenging. The availability of capital to this industry has been limited, while the broad capital markets across all industries have been very strong, and there have been brief windows where we and others have been able to access the high-yield capital markets and other points of capital successfully. Broad-based access to capital for growth has been limited. What that results in is a difficulty to bring transactions to fruition, but there are many motivated buyers out there seeking that capital, and we're talking to many of them, and we will remain laser focused on delivering on our asset sales to reduce our debt. We'll stay away from deadlines that are ultimately somewhat artificial, whether they be the end of this year or the beginning of next year. We'll get that done. We'll get it done at the right time for the right value. We won't be driving for the last dollar, so to speak. We're thinking of the big strategic picture here, but we have to get it done right."

And as we laid out that $2 billion to $3 billion reduction, we were very careful to note that it was over a few year time frame that we were going to execute on that. And the purpose in that time frame is that we have an extremely strong asset base, and that asset base continues to get better. And while we balance capital, commodity price and the potential to drive the greatest value for our shareholders, we're not in the process of giving away these high-quality assets. We're not going to do it. And the financial strength and improvements to the company position us that we'll continue to work it, we'll find the right opportunity and we'll execute upon it. As Nick has highlighted many times, we are prudently impatient at the pace at which we're attacking the balance sheet, but that doesn't mean that we're going to sacrifice value given the quality of these assets."

We went out and took all the industry data that we had seen in the play. It kind of covers the Southwest portion footprint of our acreage and designed a program just to test the concept. And we drilled the wells and put relatively large fracs on them. It took a while for the wells to come back. They were a little bit slow coming back, but now they're -- they've just been climbing. And for the last month, we've seen really good response. We think we can change the frac program and get the same result. You're going to see us look at potentially an Austin Chalk program that will augment our lower Eagle Ford program next year and the following years. But what it does is it basically gives us a stacked play within our Eagle Ford program, which we really can push on and have a lot of efficiency. It won't interfere with our lower Eagle Ford program.

All we're wanting to note this morning is that given the current market environment and given our goals, we see it prudent to have less capital in 2018 versus 2017. 2017, we really needed to restore our level of cash flow-generating capability off of a very low investment in 2016. So we needed to catch up a bit in some areas. We've done that. You could see those wells coming online here in the fourth quarter. And so exactly where we level out to a run rate, we're going to hold off. We're still running a lot of scenarios around that at this point, Arun, and prices remain somewhat volatile. We continue to hedge, which we are pleased about, the risks, how we think about that capital program next year. We'll continue to look at what we achieve in the A&D market. And all that will influence -- we also look at our well results. All of that will influence the ultimate capital allocation for the portfolio next year. The takeaway that we wanted to leave everybody with this morning is that the inherent capital efficiency of the underlying portfolio and what we've delivered so far this year is that we can spend less money than we did this year and still grow next year. We may not choose to spend that much. We may choose to not grow if prices were to fall apart. We may choose -- if prices were to really run and we can hedge them accordingly, we may choose to spend a little bit more. But don't look for us to change the strip higher with every move. We are really showing internally that we can do better with some discipline here. And the scenarios we're running highlight that we need to be focused on delivery of these financial goals over time, which is going to result in a -- at this point, we think, a pretty modest capital program next year. Again, we'll give more information on that as we get into '18. And as we firm it up, things could change, but that's what we're looking at right now."

I got to give real kudos to the culture and especially the operations team in the Turner. As we went out there, we didn't know much about it. Wells were in excess of 35, 40 days, the initial wells doing some science, and the costs were a little bit higher than what we wanted. Since we've gotten the program going, Jason's team has knocked these wells down to under 30 days. We just brought 2 wells on this week, our most recent wells, and those 2 wells we've adjusted the completions. And we knocked $1.5 million off of each of those completions. So where we are today in the Turner is not where we're going to be tomorrow in the Turner. It's only going to get better. Kudos for the field team as well. They've been stretched pretty thin, and the culture of the company I think is so strong now. We've had people from Mid-Con and Gulf Coast volunteer to go up and help that team out.

Enhancing our returns and margins is also key to our financial stability and will be accomplished through increasing our oil volumes as a percentage of total production and aggressive cash cost leadership.
Now moving to our performance for the third quarter. I'm pleased to report our production has started to climb as forecasted following the previously announced weather and related operational delays experienced during the quarter. As of October 30, our fuel production reached a daily rate of 584,000 barrels of oil equivalent, including 99,000 barrels of oil. Our fourth quarter volumes will be dominated by heavy turn-in-line schedule in our South Texas Eagle Ford asset, and we remain on target deliver our goal of averaging 100,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter. 
On the operations front, our people, technology and portfolio continue to combine to drive improvement in our productivity and value across all of our assets. This effort has most recently been demonstrated in the Marcellus, where we've begun deploying enhanced completion techniques on the Upper Marcellus. Results have been impressive. Our 2 Upper Marcellus Maris pad wells placed on production in September have achieved peak rates of 30 million cubic feet of gas per day. Both wells averaged roughly 6,700-foot laterals or fracture-stimulated with over 3,000 pounds of sand per foot and were rate constrained by service production and equipment limits. Not only are their rates over 50% higher than previous peak rates from our Upper Marcellus wells that were placed on production back in September of 2015, but these results confirm further delineation of our Upper Marcellus resource potential, significantly increasing our core position across the play. We plan to place the [indiscernible] well, another Upper Marcellus well with enhanced completion, online in December. 
I'll take you on our Lower Marcellus McGavin well, which we placed on production in late July with an enhanced completion and a booming 61 million cubic foot per day rate, has produced 4.3 Bcf of gas in its first 90 days with an average daily gross production rate of 48 million cubic feet of gas per day. This is an incredible well, which will pay out in roughly 9 months, and it provides a glimpse of things still to come from this world-class resource. Our progress in the Marcellus is a continuation of our technology and learnings across the entire portfolio. It all started in the Haynesville about a year ago when we began these larger completion jobs with powerful results. Accordingly, we believe the data we have in-house and the technology we're utilizing today are revolutionizing the productivity in every one of our operating areas. 
Our Haynesville asset has evolved from an underappreciated asset to one of the most powerful gas basins in North America, rivaling even the Marcellus. Thanks to our unique ability to successfully couple long laterals with enhanced completions, an IP of 30 million cubic feet per day is now the new normal for Chesapeake. Just 3 years ago, our Haynesville wells had initial production rates of only 12 million cubic feet per day. While the production growth alone is impressive, I'm especially proud that our teams have accomplished this feat while improving our capital efficiency by 30%. We turned 12 wells to sales in the third quarter highlighted by 4 wells on our BSNR pad in DeSoto Parish, which combined are making 134 million cubic feet of gas per day. Last week, our net production in the Haynesville hit 1 Bcf of gas per day to reiterate on a net basis, which is our highly -- the highest daily gas rate since November 2012. 
In addition, we have a new 10,000-foot Bossier well that will be turned in line in a few days, and our first 15,000-foot Haynesville well will be online early in the first quarter. We're excited about our progress in this redefined prolific play. 
In South Texas, the Eagle Ford continues to drive our oil production growth. We placed 31 wells on production in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we plan to place approximately 73 wells on production. We're seeing encouraging results from completions, targeting and longer laterals highlighted by Vesper unit well, which featured a 3-mile lateral with an enhanced completion resulting in key production of more than 2,000 barrels of oil per day. Additionally, we also turned in line 2 Austin Chalk appraisal tests in the third quarter and are pleased by current performance as both wells have been steadily climbing [indiscernible], each well reaching over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We'll continue to monitor productivity and update you on the progress in the Austin Chalk. 
Moving on to the Powder River Basin. Perhaps no asset better demonstrates our ability to create future differential value for our shareholders than this asset. Technology, capital efficiency, geoscience expertise and smart creative employees have truly intersected in Converse County. As you know, it's only a few years ago that we removed all rigs and essentially all capital from the Powder. Our team made the most of the downtime, deepening our understanding of the tremendous stacked pay potential of our acreage, which ultimately will make the play the most promising all-growth opportunity in our portfolio. In September, our third Turner well was completed with a 4,500-foot lateral and placed on production, achieving a peak rate of more than 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 82% was oil. We recently placed 2 new Turner wells on production 2 days -- just 2 days ago, and we'll have peak rates to report in a few days. We added a third rig in October and expect to place on production a total of 11 wells in the fourth quarter. 
Looking to 2018, we expect to provide operational performance and CapEx guidance in early February. We anticipate reducing our capital expenditures during 2018 and still delivering a relatively flat to a slightly increasing production profile for the year. Capital efficiency is a proven strength at Chesapeake. And the powerful combination of technology, high-quality assets and talented driven employees will continue to deliver improving results for our shareholders.
A little over 4 years ago, we started a major financial and operational transformation here at Chesapeake. There was a significant challenge prior to the collapse of commodity price. Chesapeake continues to grow stronger every day, and the improvements over the past few years serve as a strong foundation for greater returns and competitiveness. I am more confident in the future of the company than I've ever been. And as you can expect, further differential improvements and value growth will come from Chesapeake Energy. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick for some additional details regarding the third quarter financial results."
323857,541105836,1329761,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, our total production during the third quarter grew 3% sequentially and 4% sequentially after adjusting for asset sales. We look forward to the acceleration of this rate in the fourth quarter",785,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, our total production during the third quarter grew 3% sequentially and 4% sequentially after adjusting for asset sales. We look forward to the acceleration of this rate in the fourth quarter as we see the benefit of our significant Q2 to Q3 capital investments come online, and we are well on our way to averaging 100,000 barrels of oil per day, up 16% from our third quarter oil production. 
On the cost side, our combined production, gathering, processing and transportation and G&A expenses decreased slightly in the third quarter compared to Q2. We have seen some pressure on LOE as we increased our oil volumes, but have made room for that through our continued focus on G&A. We have seen and expect to see further synergies from volume growth on GP&T expenses this year and next. 
In October, we refinanced various secured and unsecured debt with $850 million of longer-dated unsecured notes, resulting in a reduction of the principal amount of secured debt of $557 million. In total, we have reduced the principal amount of our secured debt by approximately $1.2 billion this year to date and will look to further reduce our secured debt balances as the opportunities arise. 
On the capital front, we have seen a high for the year with our third quarter CapEx and expect our fourth quarter CapEx to be approximately $500 million. As a result, we raised the bottom end of our total capital guidance to a midpoint of $2.4 billion, which is approximately where we expect to land for the year. As Doug mentioned, we are currently working our 2018 capital plan and will provide more color on this in February. As we consider our capital allocation for 2018, we remain focused on value versus volumes and believe that value for our shareholders will be enhanced by a more balanced cash flow profile. We will remain flexible with our capital should prices rise or fall dramatically, but we do not plan to chase capital higher as a result of the recent modest increase in the 2018 strip. 
As a reminder, we had some large onetime events in 2017, including outlays of approximately $550 million to resolve legal issues, primarily the Bank of New York matter, and approximately $400 million in buy-downs of marketing and midstream contracts, but we do not project anything equivalent in 2018. As we look forward to 2018, we anticipate spending less capital than 2017 while keeping our overall production flat to slightly higher compared to 2017, again, subject to change with market conditions. 
On the A&D front, we've closed multiple producing property and acreage shales for approximately $1.2 billion to date in 2017, which include our Haynesville Shale assets that closed earlier in the year and several smaller Mid-Continent packages. We continue to work other noncore asset packages, particularly in the Mid-Continent, as well as larger assets as we work toward our goal of removing $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet.
Finally and most importantly, we have 579 Bcf of gas -- of 2018 production gas hedged at $3.10 per Mcf and nearly 21 million barrels of our 2018 oil production hedged at $51.33 per barrel. Further, we have significantly reduced 2 of our more volatile basis pricing exposures for 2018: in-basin Marcellus gas sales and LLS oil sales out of the Eagle Ford.
Marcellus in-basin prices have strengthened significantly over the summer and into late fall due to anticipation of new takeaway pipeline projects combined with the slowdown in production growth. We have hedged roughly 50% of our Marcellus in-basin exposure for 1 year, which is the November '17 to October '18 period or about 190 million cubic feet a day. Average basis differential captured on these trades is $0.77 compared to our 2017 realized basis differential of $1.34 for this area. We're also actively pursuing discussions with other parties on longer-term contracts to alternative markets, creating incremental demand in the region at competitive pricing. 
On the oil side, we sell approximately 60% of our total company net oil production on LLS-based contracts. The LLS index began the year trading at small premium to WTI of around $1.50 per barrel, and it has climbed significantly in the past few months. Given the recent strength, we've hedged over 30% of our LLS-exposed volumes for 2018. Current LLS trades for 2018 average $3.20 basis differential to NYMEX versus average 2017 realized basis differential of $2.86 for LLS volumes. These index and basis trades have given us a very strong level of protection on our 2018 cash flow.

Great question and happy to address. It's always difficult to be precise in talking about what we expect in the way of transactions, whether they be divestitures or any other form of transaction because they are hard to predict timing, hard to predict exactly what will play out. I can assure you that we work tirelessly to continue to reform our balance sheet, and the way that that's going to happen is through asset sales. We have always considered asset sales in 3 buckets: There are truly noncore assets, which this company and every well-run E&P company should sell every year. There are assets that we own a significant position in, where we can trim a bit of our position and still own a good, solid position going forward to accelerate value from a part of the play that we wouldn't get to in a reasonable period of time. A great example of that for this company would be the sales that we have out of our Haynesville position, which closed at the beginning of 2017, the last of the full-basin exit. We work all 3 of those buckets of asset sales every day. We have active discussions going on, on those types of transactions every day. Transactions through the middle of 2017 have been challenging. The availability of capital to this industry has been limited, while the broad capital markets across all industries have been very strong, and there have been brief windows where we and others have been able to access the high-yield capital markets and other points of capital successfully. Broad-based access to capital for growth has been limited. What that results in is a difficulty to bring transactions to fruition, but there are many motivated buyers out there seeking that capital, and we're talking to many of them, and we will remain laser focused on delivering on our asset sales to reduce our debt. We'll stay away from deadlines that are ultimately somewhat artificial, whether they be the end of this year or the beginning of next year. We'll get that done. We'll get it done at the right time for the right value. We won't be driving for the last dollar, so to speak. We're thinking of the big strategic picture here, but we have to get it done right."

The takeaway that we wanted to leave everybody with this morning is that the inherent capital efficiency of the underlying portfolio and what we've delivered so far this year is that we can spend less money than we did this year and still grow next year. We may not choose to spend that much. We may choose to not grow if prices were to fall apart. We may choose -- if prices were to really run and we can hedge them accordingly, we may choose to spend a little bit more. But don't look for us to change the strip higher with every move.

We're -- just to give you a feel for where we are in the portfolio, we're actually -- we've moved a third rig in, and that rig -- so we'll have 2 rigs focused primarily on the Turner for 2018 and actually, the remainder of 2017. I got to give real kudos to the culture and especially the operations team in the Turner. As we went out there, we didn't know much about it. Wells were in excess of 35, 40 days, the initial wells doing some science, and the costs were a little bit higher than what we wanted. Since we've gotten the program going, Jason's team has knocked these wells down to under 30 days. We just brought 2 wells on this week, our most recent wells, and those 2 wells we've adjusted the completions. And we knocked $1.5 million off of each of those completions. So where we are today in the Turner is not where we're going to be tomorrow in the Turner. It's only going to get better. Kudos for the field team as well. They've been stretched pretty thin, and the culture of the company I think is so strong now. We've had people from Mid-Con and Gulf Coast volunteer to go up and help that team out. So we've got people from all over the country helping us get that Turner program stood up. I'd love Jason to talk about his thoughts on that as well."

Good morning, everyone. I'd first like to reiterate this morning Chesapeake Energy's strategic priorities. They remain unchanged and drive all of our business activities in every investment. Improving our balance sheet is our top priority an",1246,"Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone. I'd first like to reiterate this morning Chesapeake Energy's strategic priorities. They remain unchanged and drive all of our business activities in every investment. Improving our balance sheet is our top priority and indeed, a journey. We've made great progress during the last few years reducing our total leverage through debt and obligation retirement, debt for equity exchanges and refinancing. We intend to further reduce our leverage and improve our debt-to-EBITDA multiple through additional asset sales and accretive acquisitions in the near term. Our stated target of free cash flow neutrality is critical to the financial strength of the company and is achievable within the next 1 to 2 years due to the quality of our assets and our industry-leading capital efficiency. Enhancing our returns and margins is also key to our financial stability and will be accomplished through increasing our oil volumes as a percentage of total production and aggressive cash cost leadership.
Now moving to our performance for the third quarter. I'm pleased to report our production has started to climb as forecasted following the previously announced weather and related operational delays experienced during the quarter. As of October 30, our fuel production reached a daily rate of 584,000 barrels of oil equivalent, including 99,000 barrels of oil. Our fourth quarter volumes will be dominated by heavy turn-in-line schedule in our South Texas Eagle Ford asset, and we remain on target deliver our goal of averaging 100,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter. 
On the operations front, our people, technology and portfolio continue to combine to drive improvement in our productivity and value across all of our assets. This effort has most recently been demonstrated in the Marcellus, where we've begun deploying enhanced completion techniques on the Upper Marcellus. Results have been impressive. Our 2 Upper Marcellus Maris pad wells placed on production in September have achieved peak rates of 30 million cubic feet of gas per day. Both wells averaged roughly 6,700-foot laterals or fracture-stimulated with over 3,000 pounds of sand per foot and were rate constrained by service production and equipment limits. Not only are their rates over 50% higher than previous peak rates from our Upper Marcellus wells that were placed on production back in September of 2015, but these results confirm further delineation of our Upper Marcellus resource potential, significantly increasing our core position across the play. We plan to place the [indiscernible] well, another Upper Marcellus well with enhanced completion, online in December. 
I'll take you on our Lower Marcellus McGavin well, which we placed on production in late July with an enhanced completion and a booming 61 million cubic foot per day rate, has produced 4.3 Bcf of gas in its first 90 days with an average daily gross production rate of 48 million cubic feet of gas per day. This is an incredible well, which will pay out in roughly 9 months, and it provides a glimpse of things still to come from this world-class resource. Our progress in the Marcellus is a continuation of our technology and learnings across the entire portfolio. It all started in the Haynesville about a year ago when we began these larger completion jobs with powerful results. Accordingly, we believe the data we have in-house and the technology we're utilizing today are revolutionizing the productivity in every one of our operating areas. 
Our Haynesville asset has evolved from an underappreciated asset to one of the most powerful gas basins in North America, rivaling even the Marcellus. Thanks to our unique ability to successfully couple long laterals with enhanced completions, an IP of 30 million cubic feet per day is now the new normal for Chesapeake. Just 3 years ago, our Haynesville wells had initial production rates of only 12 million cubic feet per day. While the production growth alone is impressive, I'm especially proud that our teams have accomplished this feat while improving our capital efficiency by 30%. We turned 12 wells to sales in the third quarter highlighted by 4 wells on our BSNR pad in DeSoto Parish, which combined are making 134 million cubic feet of gas per day. Last week, our net production in the Haynesville hit 1 Bcf of gas per day to reiterate on a net basis, which is our highly -- the highest daily gas rate since November 2012. 
In addition, we have a new 10,000-foot Bossier well that will be turned in line in a few days, and our first 15,000-foot Haynesville well will be online early in the first quarter. We're excited about our progress in this redefined prolific play. 
In South Texas, the Eagle Ford continues to drive our oil production growth. We placed 31 wells on production in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we plan to place approximately 73 wells on production. We're seeing encouraging results from completions, targeting and longer laterals highlighted by Vesper unit well, which featured a 3-mile lateral with an enhanced completion resulting in key production of more than 2,000 barrels of oil per day. Additionally, we also turned in line 2 Austin Chalk appraisal tests in the third quarter and are pleased by current performance as both wells have been steadily climbing [indiscernible], each well reaching over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We'll continue to monitor productivity and update you on the progress in the Austin Chalk. 
Moving on to the Powder River Basin. Perhaps no asset better demonstrates our ability to create future differential value for our shareholders than this asset. Technology, capital efficiency, geoscience expertise and smart creative employees have truly intersected in Converse County. As you know, it's only a few years ago that we removed all rigs and essentially all capital from the Powder. Our team made the most of the downtime, deepening our understanding of the tremendous stacked pay potential of our acreage, which ultimately will make the play the most promising all-growth opportunity in our portfolio. In September, our third Turner well was completed with a 4,500-foot lateral and placed on production, achieving a peak rate of more than 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 82% was oil. We recently placed 2 new Turner wells on production 2 days -- just 2 days ago, and we'll have peak rates to report in a few days. We added a third rig in October and expect to place on production a total of 11 wells in the fourth quarter. 
Looking to 2018, we expect to provide operational performance and CapEx guidance in early February. We anticipate reducing our capital expenditures during 2018 and still delivering a relatively flat to a slightly increasing production profile for the year. Capital efficiency is a proven strength at Chesapeake. And the powerful combination of technology, high-quality assets and talented driven employees will continue to deliver improving results for our shareholders.
A little over 4 years ago, we started a major financial and operational transformation here at Chesapeake. There was a significant challenge prior to the collapse of commodity price. Chesapeake continues to grow stronger every day, and the improvements over the past few years serve as a strong foundation for greater returns and competitiveness. I am more confident in the future of the company than I've ever been. And as you can expect, further differential improvements and value growth will come from Chesapeake Energy. 
I'll now pass the call to Nick for some additional details regarding the third quarter financial results."
323857,541105836,1332849,"Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Expand Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, our total production during the third quarter grew 3% sequentially and 4% sequentially after adjusting for asset sales. We look forward to the acceleration of this rate in the fourth quarter",785,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, our total production during the third quarter grew 3% sequentially and 4% sequentially after adjusting for asset sales. We look forward to the acceleration of this rate in the fourth quarter as we see the benefit of our significant Q2 to Q3 capital investments come online, and we are well on our way to averaging 100,000 barrels of oil per day, up 16% from our third quarter oil production. 
On the cost side, our combined production, gathering, processing and transportation and G&A expenses decreased slightly in the third quarter compared to Q2. We have seen some pressure on LOE as we increased our oil volumes, but have made room for that through our continued focus on G&A. We have seen and expect to see further synergies from volume growth on GP&T expenses this year and next. 
In October, we refinanced various secured and unsecured debt with $850 million of longer-dated unsecured notes, resulting in a reduction of the principal amount of secured debt of $557 million. In total, we have reduced the principal amount of our secured debt by approximately $1.2 billion this year to date and will look to further reduce our secured debt balances as the opportunities arise. 
On the capital front, we have seen a high for the year with our third quarter CapEx and expect our fourth quarter CapEx to be approximately $500 million. As a result, we raised the bottom end of our total capital guidance to a midpoint of $2.4 billion, which is approximately where we expect to land for the year. As Doug mentioned, we are currently working our 2018 capital plan and will provide more color on this in February. As we consider our capital allocation for 2018, we remain focused on value versus volumes and believe that value for our shareholders will be enhanced by a more balanced cash flow profile. We will remain flexible with our capital should prices rise or fall dramatically, but we do not plan to chase capital higher as a result of the recent modest increase in the 2018 strip. 
As a reminder, we had some large onetime events in 2017, including outlays of approximately $550 million to resolve legal issues, primarily the Bank of New York matter, and approximately $400 million in buy-downs of marketing and midstream contracts, but we do not project anything equivalent in 2018. As we look forward to 2018, we anticipate spending less capital than 2017 while keeping our overall production flat to slightly higher compared to 2017, again, subject to change with market conditions. 
On the A&D front, we've closed multiple producing property and acreage shales for approximately $1.2 billion to date in 2017, which include our Haynesville Shale assets that closed earlier in the year and several smaller Mid-Continent packages. We continue to work other noncore asset packages, particularly in the Mid-Continent, as well as larger assets as we work toward our goal of removing $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet.
Finally and most importantly, we have 579 Bcf of gas -- of 2018 production gas hedged at $3.10 per Mcf and nearly 21 million barrels of our 2018 oil production hedged at $51.33 per barrel. Further, we have significantly reduced 2 of our more volatile basis pricing exposures for 2018: in-basin Marcellus gas sales and LLS oil sales out of the Eagle Ford.
Marcellus in-basin prices have strengthened significantly over the summer and into late fall due to anticipation of new takeaway pipeline projects combined with the slowdown in production growth. We have hedged roughly 50% of our Marcellus in-basin exposure for 1 year, which is the November '17 to October '18 period or about 190 million cubic feet a day. Average basis differential captured on these trades is $0.77 compared to our 2017 realized basis differential of $1.34 for this area. We're also actively pursuing discussions with other parties on longer-term contracts to alternative markets, creating incremental demand in the region at competitive pricing. 
On the oil side, we sell approximately 60% of our total company net oil production on LLS-based contracts. The LLS index began the year trading at small premium to WTI of around $1.50 per barrel, and it has climbed significantly in the past few months. Given the recent strength, we've hedged over 30% of our LLS-exposed volumes for 2018. Current LLS trades for 2018 average $3.20 basis differential to NYMEX versus average 2017 realized basis differential of $2.86 for LLS volumes. These index and basis trades have given us a very strong level of protection on our 2018 cash flow.
Operator, that concludes my comments. I'll now turn the call over for questions."

Great question and happy to address. It's always difficult to be precise in talking about what we expect in the way of transactions, whether they be divestitures or any other form of transaction because they are hard to predict timing, hard to predict exactly what will play out. I can assure you that we work tirelessly to continue to reform our balance sheet, and the way that that's going to happen is through asset sales. We have always considered asset sales in 3 buckets: There are truly noncore assets, which this company and every well-run E&P company should sell every year. There are assets that we own a significant position in, where we can trim a bit of our position and still own a good, solid position going forward to accelerate value from a part of the play that we wouldn't get to in a reasonable period of time. A great example of that for this company would be the sales that we have out of our Haynesville position, which closed at the beginning of 2017, the last of the full-basin exit. We work all 3 of those buckets of asset sales every day. We have active discussions going on, on those types of transactions every day. Transactions through the middle of 2017 have been challenging. The availability of capital to this industry has been limited, while the broad capital markets across all industries have been very strong, and there have been brief windows where we and others have been able to access the high-yield capital markets and other points of capital successfully. Broad-based access to capital for growth has been limited. What that results in is a difficulty to bring transactions to fruition, but there are many motivated buyers out there seeking that capital, and we're talking to many of them, and we will remain laser focused on delivering on our asset sales to reduce our debt. We'll stay away from deadlines that are ultimately somewhat artificial, whether they be the end of this year or the beginning of next year. We'll get that done. We'll get it done at the right time for the right value. We won't be driving for the last dollar, so to speak. We're thinking of the big strategic picture here, but we have to get it done right."

And as we laid out that $2 billion to $3 billion reduction, we were very careful to note that it was over a few year time frame that we were going to execute on that. And the purpose in that time frame is that we have an extremely strong asset base, and that asset base continues to get better. And while we balance capital, commodity price and the potential to drive the greatest value for our shareholders, we're not in the process of giving away these high-quality assets. We're not going to do it. And the financial strength and improvements to the company position us that we'll continue to work it, we'll find the right opportunity and we'll execute upon it. As Nick has highlighted many times, we are prudently impatient at the pace at which we're attacking the balance sheet, but that doesn't mean that we're going to sacrifice value given the quality of these assets."

We went out and took all the industry data that we had seen in the play. It kind of covers the Southwest portion footprint of our acreage and designed a program just to test the concept. And we drilled the wells and put relatively large fracs on them. It took a while for the wells to come back. They were a little bit slow coming back, but now they're -- they've just been climbing. And for the last month, we've seen really good response. We think we can change the frac program and get the same result. You're going to see us look at potentially an Austin Chalk program that will augment our lower Eagle Ford program next year and the following years. But what it does is it basically gives us a stacked play within our Eagle Ford program, which we really can push on and have a lot of efficiency. It won't interfere with our lower Eagle Ford program. It'll actually be supplemental to that."

All we're wanting to note this morning is that given the current market environment and given our goals, we see it prudent to have less capital in 2018 versus 2017. 2017, we really needed to restore our level of cash flow-generating capability off of a very low investment in 2016. So we needed to catch up a bit in some areas. We've done that. You could see those wells coming online here in the fourth quarter. And so exactly where we level out to a run rate, we're going to hold off. We're still running a lot of scenarios around that at this point, Arun, and prices remain somewhat volatile. We continue to hedge, which we are pleased about, the risks, how we think about that capital program next year. We'll continue to look at what we achieve in the A&D market. And all that will influence -- we also look at our well results. All of that will influence the ultimate capital allocation for the portfolio next year. The takeaway that we wanted to leave everybody with this morning is that the inherent capital efficiency of the underlying portfolio and what we've delivered so far this year is that we can spend less money than we did this year and still grow next year. We may not choose to spend that much. We may choose to not grow if prices were to fall apart. We may choose -- if prices were to really run and we can hedge them accordingly, we may choose to spend a little bit more. But don't look for us to change the strip higher with every move. We are really showing internally that we can do better with some discipline here. And the scenarios we're running highlight that we need to be focused on delivery of these financial goals over time, which is going to result in a -- at this point, we think, a pretty modest capital program next year. Again, we'll give more information on that as we get into '18. And as we firm it up, things could change, but that's what we're looking at right now."

I got to give real kudos to the culture and especially the operations team in the Turner. As we went out there, we didn't know much about it. Wells were in excess of 35, 40 days, the initial wells doing some science, and the costs were a little bit higher than what we wanted. Since we've gotten the program going, Jason's team has knocked these wells down to under 30 days. We just brought 2 wells on this week, our most recent wells, and those 2 wells we've adjusted the completions. And we knocked $1.5 million off of each of those completions. So where we are today in the Turner is not where we're going to be tomorrow in the Turner. It's only going to get better. Kudos for the field team as well. They've been stretched pretty thin, and the culture of the company I think is so strong now. We've had people from Mid-Con and Gulf Coast volunteer to go up and help that team out. So we've got people from all over the country helping us get that Turner program stood up. I'd love Jason to talk about his thoughts on that as well."
