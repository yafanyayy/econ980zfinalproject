We're pleased to report that Altria had another outstanding year. In 2016, we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 8.2%, in line with our long-term objectives, while returning a large amount of cash to shareholders, improving our balance sheet and strengthening our organizational capability, thus well positioning Altria to continue to deliver on our long-term goals. During 2016, we also rewarded our shareholders by paying out over $4.5 billion in dividends, raising our dividend by 8% and repurchasing over $1 billion of our shares under an expanded $3 billion share repurchase program.
Since the beginning of 2011, we have returned over $28 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And our dividend payout ratio of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS is among the highest in our peer group. In 2016, we strengthened our balance sheet by tendering for high coupon debt and refinancing it with lower coupon, longer maturity debt. And in October, with Altria's support of Anheuser-Busch InBev's landmark business combination with SABMiller, we enhanced the value of our beer investment and our position in the global growing profit pool. We continue, also, to improve our operating efficiency through a $300 million productivity initiative announced in January 2016 and a separate $50 million manufacturing consolidation plan announced in October.
These efforts and others have strengthened our organization, streamlined our business processes and provided greater autonomy to our business leaders in this dynamic environment. For 2016, Altria delivered a total shareholder return of 20.5%, marking the fourth consecutive year that total shareholder return has exceeded 20%. And over the last 5 years, Altria's total shareholder return was 187%, significantly outpacing both the S&P 500 and the S&P Food, Beverage and Tobacco Index. All these results are made possible by our dedicated and talented employees, so I want to thank them all.
Here's some operating highlights. The smokeable product segment produced another year of strong results on the strength and consistency of its leading premium brands. Adjusted operating company's income grew by 5.3% for the year, primarily through higher pricing and effective cost management. The smokable segment delivered this growth despite very difficult comparisons to last year when it grew adjusted OCI nearly 11%. For the year, PM USA gained 1/10th of a retail share point to 51.4%, and Marlboro maintained retail share near record levels at 44%.
PM USA continues to bring innovative products, packaging and adult consumer engagement activities to the market to reinforce Marlboro's vibrancy and relevance. For example, the national expansion of Marlboro Menthol Slate, a bold menthol product featuring PM USA's innovative soft touch ink packaging is receiving positive feedback from our trade partners.
Last month, we further enhanced our smokeable product segment by acquiring Nat Sherman. Nat Sherman has an excellent and differentiated brand portfolio, which complements the brands in Altria's smokeable product segment. Nat Sherman brands will benefit from the retail distribution, brand management and adult tobacco consumer engagement expertise of Altria's companies. Integration and business plans are already well underway, and we welcome the Nat Sherman team of employees to the Altria family of companies.
In cigars, Middleton maintained its leadership position in the profitable tipped segment, posting strong full-year volume growth on the strength of the Black & Mild brand. Turning to the smokeless product segment. USSTC delivered a terrific year. The segment grew adjusted OCI 11% for the year, driven by higher pricing and volume, partially offset by higher costs and mix.
Consistent with this strategy, USSTC grew retail share of Copenhagen and Skoal combined by 9/10 of a share point to 52.2%, the highest full year share since we acquired USSTC.
Our portfolio strategy has enhanced Copenhagen and Skoal's competitive positioning and improved USSTC's efficiency and profitability. In 2016, Copenhagen continued to build on its position as the smokeless category's largest brand, with a successful national expansion of Copenhagen Mint. Copenhagen is also the fastest-growing smokeless tobacco brand, posting a 2.2 retail share point gain for the year, more than offsetting Skoal's 1.3 share point decline.
Product innovation was also a focus area in 2016. In e-vapor, Nu Mark made excellent progress this year toward achieving its long-term aspiration of becoming a leader in the e-vapor category. Nu Mark's disciplined test-and-learn approach to MarkTen's national expansion continues to gain traction. At year-end, MarkTen was available in stores, representing about 55% of the e-vapor category volume in retail channels, including C stores.
In heated tobacco, Altria continues to partner with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications for iQOS. In December, PMI submitted a modified risk tobacco product application to the FDA for the heated tobacco product that PM USA will commercialize in the U.S. under our agreement with PMI. PMI plans to file the premarket tobacco product application during the first quarter of 2017. And concurrently, PM USA continues to develop its U.S. plans. For example, a commercialization team is now dedicated to preparing for the launch of iQOS in the U.S., including working closely with PMI as against trade and consumer insights from other markets.
In the Lights segment, Ste. Michelle delivered another strong year on the performance of its premium brands, with adjusted operating income growth of nearly 10%. For the second consecutive year, Ste. Michelle's premium wines received more than 260 ratings of 90 or better. In October, AB InBev completed its business combination with SABMiller, with Altria ultimately securing a 10.2% ownership in AB InBev. This transaction enhanced the value of Altria's beer investment, and we expected to deliver strong long-term financial returns to our shareholders.
So to sum up, 2016 was another excellent year for our strong premium brands, our companies and our shareholders. We achieved significant milestones against an ambitious plan, and we believe that we have positioned Altria well for continued future success.
Let's turn for a moment to the regulatory environment. As you know, we continue to work closely with the FDA as it builds out its regulatory framework. One area is our company's substantial equivalence applications, both for provisional and new products. So one of our priorities is to resolve those applications, and the pace of work there has picked up. Second, for cigars and e-vapor, we're preparing the product applications now required by the deeming regulations and continuing to advocate for sensible interpretations consistent with the Act. Third, our companies continue to develop new and innovative products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer expectations, including products that advance tobacco harm reduction. This, too, requires advocating FDA and others to support and foster innovation that will benefit adult consumers. We expect to step up in investments because of these activities.
As you've seen from our press release, we expect to grow our full-year adjusted EPS for 2017 to a range of $3.26 to $3.32, representing growth of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS base of $3.03. So we expect another strong year for Altria.
It may be helpful to share some further color on how we're taking about that. So to begin, we're expecting continued strong performance from our operating companies, and we believe that the macroeconomic environment remains largely constructive for adult tobacco consumers. We also will have the benefit of reporting 4 full quarters of equity earnings from AB InBev. On the other hand, we've seen some cigarette volume declines, reverting back to more long-term norms. We also know that in April, California, a high-volume state, will implement significantly higher excise taxes, and there are already proposals in several states to raise excise taxes further. And finally, we've taken into account an expected increase in our effective tax rate for 2017, which Billy will explain in a moment. The most important point is that we are entering 2017 with very good momentum from last year and are expecting another year of growth in line with our long-term financial goals.
And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Billy."

Our operating company delivered solid results in the fourth quarter. In the smokeable product segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI grew by 3.7%, and adjusted OCI margins increased by 2 percentage points, both driven by higher net pricing and lower benefits cost. For the year, adjusted OCI margins in this segment expanded 1.8 percentage points to 48.2%, driven by higher net pricing and lower benefits cost, partially offset by higher resolution expenses.
PM USA maintained its leading retail position in the fourth quarter. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 4.8% in the quarter, primarily driven by the industry rate of decline in one peer shipping day. After adjusting for calendar differences, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined approximately 3.5% in the quarter and that total industry cigarette volumes also declined by approximately 3.5%.
For the year, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined approximately 2.5% and that total industry volume also declined by approximately 2.5%. Over the last 3 quarters, we're seeing the cigarette industry volume decline rate gradually revert to more long-term historical norms. In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's focus on the profitable tipped segment continues to yield strong results. Middleton's volumes were up 5.3% in the fourth quarter and 5.9% for the full year.
In the smokeless product segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI grew by 4.3%, driven by higher net pricing and volume, partially offset by higher cost. Fourth quarter adjusted OCI margins decreased by 2 percentage points due primarily to higher manufacturing costs and promotional investments. For the year, adjusted OCI margins expanded 7/10 of a percentage point to 64.4%, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix, higher manufacturing cost and higher promotional investments.
In the fourth quarter, USSTC grew volume ahead of the category growth rate and increased Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share by 1.1 share points to 52.5 share points. USSTC's reported shipment volume increased 2.2% in the quarter and 4.9% for the year after adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors. USSTC estimates that the shipment volume grew by approximately 4.5% in the quarter and 5% for the year.
This growth is well ahead of the estimated industry volume growth of approximately 2.5% over the past 6 months. In wine, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by 16.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.9% for the year. Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volume grew 4.2% in the quarter and 5.3% for the year.
Let me pick up on the tax issue Marty mentioned when discussing our guidance for 2017. For a variety of reasons, we expect that our 2017 full-year effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 36% compared to 34.7% for 2016.
One of these reasons is because we anticipate fewer foreign tax credits related to AB InBev dividends. Though technical, this is driven by differences in the profit pools between AB InBev and the former SABMiller. That wraps up our results. Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations, we posted for your reference our usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.

And we have FDA payments that go up every year. And our principal income contributor is the cigarette category where the volume goes down. So the strategy there for us is to take appropriate pricing in order that we can grow in line with our aspirations.  And we've been able to do that. You've seen that pricing for the year in the smokable segment up about 4%. If you look at it slightly longer periods, Adam, I think it's on an average somewhere between 4% and 5% of bounces there. And that algorithm works for us in terms of the profitability we expect from the smokeable segment. So that's how we think about pricing."

We want to make sure that we're doing everything we can, so that no one is injured as a result of this particular incident. And also, it's important, of course, to protect the brand trust. So the way I think I would think about it is, of course, it's a short-term disruption, but in the long term, what you want to do is to protect the consumer from harm from this and protect the trusted brand. We actually have 2 smokeless factories. The Franklin Park facility is the only one that is affected, Bonnie, and it is the smaller of our factories. So the national factory has not been implicated, and that's actually where most of the volume goes through. We want to make sure that we've got this buttoned up before we ship anymore product out of Franklin Park, and we'll do that as soon as we feel like we have our arms around it. And I just can't give you that date while we're on the call this morning, because I don't have it."

I don't want to really tell folks what our competitive plans are about how we're going to do that, but I would go back to what we were discussing earlier, I guess, which is that the object is to make sure that we get the product to adult smokers and explain how it works and what its attributes are, so that they can make a choice about whether it's for them. And there's a whole range of activities that you can use to do that. I just don't want to lay them out, as you can appreciate for competitive reasons. But we're well underway. We have a crackerjack team on it. We're very excited about the technology. We're working closely with PMI. So from my read, I think all the signals from a commercial point of view are in the right direction. And we're just going to have to work through the FDA process."

And as you know, Altria -- it would be a good thing for Altria. And so we've had a program underway to try to urge that as a matter of public policy to reduce the corporate income tax rate. We have not built that into our 2017 plans, because I think the best thinking is corporate tax reforms are pretty complicated. It's likely to take 2017 to do it. But obviously, it would be a material step-up for Altria if we've got significant corporate tax reforms. So that would be important for us to think about if and when it occurs. I think it's the same thing on a regulatory basis. Both at the FDA and for regulatory agencies generally, there appears to be a movement to try to lessen the regulatory burden on business. In our view, that would be good, but those things take time to work their way through the agency. Take HHS, for example, we don't even have a cabinet appointee yet, [ph] much less changes that would occur down the line. So our government affairs team and our regulatory affairs team are working very hard on that, but I would think of those more in the long term than in the short."

We're pleased to report that Altria had another outstanding year. In 2016, we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 8.2%, in line with our long-term objectives, while returning a large amount of cash to shareholders, improving our balance sheet and strengthening our organizational capability, thus well positioning Altria to continue to deliver on our long-term goals. During 2016, we also rewarded our shareholders by paying out over $4.5 billion in dividends, raising our dividend by 8% and repurchasing over $1 billion of our shares under an expanded $3 billion share repurchase program.
Since the beginning of 2011, we have returned over $28 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And our dividend payout ratio of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS is among the highest in our peer group. In 2016, we strengthened our balance sheet by tendering for high coupon debt and refinancing it with lower coupon, longer maturity debt. And in October, with Altria's support of Anheuser-Busch InBev's landmark business combination with SABMiller, we enhanced the value of our beer investment and our position in the global growing profit pool. We continue, also, to improve our operating efficiency through a $300 million productivity initiative announced in January 2016 and a separate $50 million manufacturing consolidation plan announced in October.
These efforts and others have strengthened our organization, streamlined our business processes and provided greater autonomy to our business leaders in this dynamic environment. For 2016, Altria delivered a total shareholder return of 20.5%, marking the fourth consecutive year that total shareholder return has exceeded 20%. And over the last 5 years, Altria's total shareholder return was 187%, significantly outpacing both the S&P 500 and the S&P Food, Beverage and Tobacco Index. All these results are made possible by our dedicated and talented employees, so I want to thank them all.
Here's some operating highlights. The smokeable product segment produced another year of strong results on the strength and consistency of its leading premium brands. Adjusted operating company's income grew by 5.3% for the year, primarily through higher pricing and effective cost management. The smokable segment delivered this growth despite very difficult comparisons to last year when it grew adjusted OCI nearly 11%. For the year, PM USA gained 1/10th of a retail share point to 51.4%, and Marlboro maintained retail share near record levels at 44%.
PM USA continues to bring innovative products, packaging and adult consumer engagement activities to the market to reinforce Marlboro's vibrancy and relevance. For example, the national expansion of Marlboro Menthol Slate, a bold menthol product featuring PM USA's innovative soft touch ink packaging is receiving positive feedback from our trade partners.
Last month, we further enhanced our smokeable product segment by acquiring Nat Sherman. Nat Sherman has an excellent and differentiated brand portfolio, which complements the brands in Altria's smokeable product segment. Nat Sherman brands will benefit from the retail distribution, brand management and adult tobacco consumer engagement expertise of Altria's companies. Integration and business plans are already well underway, and we welcome the Nat Sherman team of employees to the Altria family of companies.
In cigars, Middleton maintained its leadership position in the profitable tipped segment, posting strong full-year volume growth on the strength of the Black & Mild brand. Turning to the smokeless product segment. USSTC delivered a terrific year. The segment grew adjusted OCI 11% for the year, driven by higher pricing and volume, partially offset by higher costs and mix.
Consistent with this strategy, USSTC grew retail share of Copenhagen and Skoal combined by 9/10 of a share point to 52.2%, the highest full year share since we acquired USSTC.
Our portfolio strategy has enhanced Copenhagen and Skoal's competitive positioning and improved USSTC's efficiency and profitability. In 2016, Copenhagen continued to build on its position as the smokeless category's largest brand, with a successful national expansion of Copenhagen Mint. Copenhagen is also the fastest-growing smokeless tobacco brand, posting a 2.2 retail share point gain for the year, more than offsetting Skoal's 1.3 share point decline.
Product innovation was also a focus area in 2016. In e-vapor, Nu Mark made excellent progress this year toward achieving its long-term aspiration of becoming a leader in the e-vapor category. Nu Mark's disciplined test-and-learn approach to MarkTen's national expansion continues to gain traction. At year-end, MarkTen was available in stores, representing about 55% of the e-vapor category volume in retail channels, including C stores.
In heated tobacco, Altria continues to partner with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications for iQOS. In December, PMI submitted a modified risk tobacco product application to the FDA for the heated tobacco product that PM USA will commercialize in the U.S. under our agreement with PMI. PMI plans to file the premarket tobacco product application during the first quarter of 2017. And concurrently, PM USA continues to develop its U.S. plans. For example, a commercialization team is now dedicated to preparing for the launch of iQOS in the U.S., including working closely with PMI as against trade and consumer insights from other markets.
In the Lights segment, Ste. Michelle delivered another strong year on the performance of its premium brands, with adjusted operating income growth of nearly 10%. For the second consecutive year, Ste. Michelle's premium wines received more than 260 ratings of 90 or better. In October, AB InBev completed its business combination with SABMiller, with Altria ultimately securing a 10.2% ownership in AB InBev. This transaction enhanced the value of Altria's beer investment, and we expected to deliver strong long-term financial returns to our shareholders.
So to sum up, 2016 was another excellent year for our strong premium brands, our companies and our shareholders. We achieved significant milestones against an ambitious plan, and we believe that we have positioned Altria well for continued future success.
Let's turn for a moment to the regulatory environment. As you know, we continue to work closely with the FDA as it builds out its regulatory framework. One area is our company's substantial equivalence applications, both for provisional and new products. So one of our priorities is to resolve those applications, and the pace of work there has picked up. Second, for cigars and e-vapor, we're preparing the product applications now required by the deeming regulations and continuing to advocate for sensible interpretations consistent with the Act. Third, our companies continue to develop new and innovative products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer expectations, including products that advance tobacco harm reduction. This, too, requires advocating FDA and others to support and foster innovation that will benefit adult consumers. We expect to step up in investments because of these activities.
As you've seen from our press release, we expect to grow our full-year adjusted EPS for 2017 to a range of $3.26 to $3.32, representing growth of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS base of $3.03. So we expect another strong year for Altria.
It may be helpful to share some further color on how we're taking about that. So to begin, we're expecting continued strong performance from our operating companies, and we believe that the macroeconomic environment remains largely constructive for adult tobacco consumers. We also will have the benefit of reporting 4 full quarters of equity earnings from AB InBev. On the other hand, we've seen some cigarette volume declines, reverting back to more long-term norms. We also know that in April, California, a high-volume state, will implement significantly higher excise taxes, and there are already proposals in several states to raise excise taxes further. And finally, we've taken into account an expected increase in our effective tax rate for 2017, which Billy will explain in a moment. The most important point is that we are entering 2017 with very good momentum from last year and are expecting another year of growth in line with our long-term financial goals.
And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Billy."

Our operating company delivered solid results in the fourth quarter. In the smokeable product segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI grew by 3.7%, and adjusted OCI margins increased by 2 percentage points, both driven by higher net pricing and lower benefits cost. For the year, adjusted OCI margins in this segment expanded 1.8 percentage points to 48.2%, driven by higher net pricing and lower benefits cost, partially offset by higher resolution expenses.
PM USA maintained its leading retail position in the fourth quarter. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 4.8% in the quarter, primarily driven by the industry rate of decline in one peer shipping day. After adjusting for calendar differences, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined approximately 3.5% in the quarter and that total industry cigarette volumes also declined by approximately 3.5%.
For the year, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined approximately 2.5% and that total industry volume also declined by approximately 2.5%. Over the last 3 quarters, we're seeing the cigarette industry volume decline rate gradually revert to more long-term historical norms. In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's focus on the profitable tipped segment continues to yield strong results. Middleton's volumes were up 5.3% in the fourth quarter and 5.9% for the full year.
In the smokeless product segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI grew by 4.3%, driven by higher net pricing and volume, partially offset by higher cost. Fourth quarter adjusted OCI margins decreased by 2 percentage points due primarily to higher manufacturing costs and promotional investments. For the year, adjusted OCI margins expanded 7/10 of a percentage point to 64.4%, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix, higher manufacturing cost and higher promotional investments.
In the fourth quarter, USSTC grew volume ahead of the category growth rate and increased Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share by 1.1 share points to 52.5 share points. USSTC's reported shipment volume increased 2.2% in the quarter and 4.9% for the year after adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors. USSTC estimates that the shipment volume grew by approximately 4.5% in the quarter and 5% for the year.
This growth is well ahead of the estimated industry volume growth of approximately 2.5% over the past 6 months. In wine, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by 16.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.9% for the year. Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volume grew 4.2% in the quarter and 5.3% for the year.
Let me pick up on the tax issue Marty mentioned when discussing our guidance for 2017. For a variety of reasons, we expect that our 2017 full-year effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 36% compared to 34.7% for 2016.
One of these reasons is because we anticipate fewer foreign tax credits related to AB InBev dividends. Though technical, this is driven by differences in the profit pools between AB InBev and the former SABMiller. That wraps up our results. Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations, we posted for your reference our usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.

Moving on to the domestic cigarettes industry, I was wondering if you could talk about a little bit, give some color about how you're seeing the pricing environments, particularly in the lights of the facts that Imperial has said, if anything, it wants to invest a little bit more in pricing to grow market share perhaps a little bit faster. And also, in the lights of the fact that at least according to the scanner data, Reynolds' market share is -- has stopped growing and has perhaps declined. So is really a question about the pricing environment in the lights of that?"

The numbers that we put out, I think, demonstrate -- at least for us, we're a publicly traded company. We have growth aspirations. And our master settlement agreement payment goes up every year. And we have FDA payments that go up every year. And our principal income contributor is the cigarette category where the volume goes down. So the strategy there for us is to take appropriate pricing in order that we can grow in line with our aspirations.  And we've been able to do that. You've seen that pricing for the year in the smokable segment up about 4%. If you look at it slightly longer periods, Adam, I think it's on an average somewhere between 4% and 5% of bounces there. And that algorithm works for us in terms of the profitability we expect from the smokeable segment. So that's how we think about pricing."

There are other markets that are more open in terms of the ability to communicate with the consumer. You see the results in Japan, and you know the regulatory situation there. Our job at PM USA is to read all of that data and with our expertise about what is permitted in the United States, including under the master settlement agreement, for example, is to weave that interval plan that will meet our goals.

Listen, I can't tell you much more than what's in the press release, because we put in the press release basically what is known. So just to reprise, I mean, we've  got -- as you know, we produce hundreds of millions of cans of smokeless. We have 8 consumer complaints with metal objects in the cans. And so we've been working closely with the FDA. No one has reported any injuries. What we're trying to do is to make sure that we're doing the responsible thing with respect to the consumers. We want to make sure that we're doing everything we can, so that no one is injured as a result of this particular incident. And also, it's important, of course, to protect the brand trust. So the way I think I would think about it is, of course, it's a short-term disruption, but in the long term, what you want to do is to protect the consumer from harm from this and protect the trusted brand. We actually have 2 smokeless factories. The Franklin Park facility is the only one that is affected, Bonnie, and it is the smaller of our factories. So the national factory has not been implicated, and that's actually where most of the volume goes through. We want to make sure that we've got this buttoned up before we ship anymore product out of Franklin Park, and we'll do that as soon as we feel like we have our arms around it.

I don't want to really tell folks what our competitive plans are about how we're going to do that, but I would go back to what we were discussing earlier, I guess, which is that the object is to make sure that we get the product to adult smokers and explain how it works and what its attributes are, so that they can make a choice about whether it's for them. And there's a whole range of activities that you can use to do that. I just don't want to lay them out, as you can appreciate for competitive reasons. But we're well underway.

We have not built that into our 2017 plans, because I think the best thinking is corporate tax reforms are pretty complicated. It's likely to take 2017 to do it. But obviously, it would be a material step-up for Altria if we've got significant corporate tax reforms. So that would be important for us to think about if and when it occurs. I think it's the same thing on a regulatory basis. Both at the FDA and for regulatory agencies generally, there appears to be a movement to try to lessen the regulatory burden on business. In our view, that would be good, but those things take time to work their way through the agency. Take HHS, for example, we don't even have a cabinet appointee yet, much less changes that would occur down the line.

We have, I think, a significant competitive advantage in our sales force. It's large. They're very talented. They're very well led and so naturally, we would be thinking, as we go to market, about how we can use that to help iQOS be successful. I think we have excellent relationships with our trade partners. That's another area that's going to require a lot of thinking about how we take iQOS to market and working with our trade partners.

We're pleased to report that Altria had another outstanding year. In 2016, we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 8.2%, in line with our long-term objectives, while returning a large amount of cash to shareholders, improving our balance sheet and strengthening our organizational capability, thus well positioning Altria to continue to deliver on our long-term goals. During 2016, we also rewarded our shareholders by paying out over $4.5 billion in dividends, raising our dividend by 8% and repurchasing over $1 billion of our shares under an expanded $3 billion share repurchase program.
Since the beginning of 2011, we have returned over $28 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And our dividend payout ratio of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS is among the highest in our peer group. In 2016, we strengthened our balance sheet by tendering for high coupon debt and refinancing it with lower coupon, longer maturity debt. And in October, with Altria's support of Anheuser-Busch InBev's landmark business combination with SABMiller, we enhanced the value of our beer investment and our position in the global brewing profit pool. We continue, also, to improve our operating efficiency through a $300 million productivity initiative announced in January 2016 and a separate $50 million manufacturing consolidation plan announced in October.
These efforts and others have strengthened our organization, streamlined our business processes and provided greater autonomy to our business leaders in this dynamic environment. For 2016, Altria delivered a total shareholder return of 20.5%, marking the fourth consecutive year that total shareholder return has exceeded 20%. And over the last 5 years, Altria's total shareholder return was 187%, significantly outpacing both the S&P 500 and the S&P Food, Beverage and Tobacco Index. All these results are made possible by our dedicated and talented employees, so I want to thank them all.
Here are some operating highlights. The smokable product segment produced another year of strong results on the strength and consistency of its leading premium brands. Adjusted operating company's income grew by 5.3% for the year, primarily through higher pricing and effective cost management. The smokable segment delivered this growth despite very difficult comparisons to last year when it grew adjusted OCI nearly 11%. For the year, PM USA gained 1/10th of a retail share point to 51.4%, and Marlboro maintained retail share near record levels at 44%.
PM USA continues to bring innovative products, packaging and adult consumer engagement activities to the market to reinforce Marlboro's vibrancy and relevance. For example, the national expansion of Marlboro Menthol Slate, a bold menthol product featuring PM USA's innovative soft touch ink packaging is receiving positive feedback from our trade partners.
Last month, we further enhanced our smokable product segment by acquiring Nat Sherman. Nat Sherman has an excellent and differentiated brand portfolio, which complements the brands in Altria's smokable product segment. Nat Sherman brands will benefit from the retail distribution, brand management and adult tobacco consumer engagement expertise of Altria's companies. Integration and business plans are already well underway, and we welcome the Nat Sherman team of employees to the Altria family of companies.
In cigars, Middleton maintained its leadership position in the profitable tipped segment, posting strong full-year volume growth on the strength of the Black & Mild brand. Turning to the smokeless product segment. USSTC delivered a terrific year. The segment grew adjusted OCI 11% for the year, driven by higher pricing and volume, partially offset by higher cost and mix.
Consistent with this strategy, USSTC grew retail share of Copenhagen and Skoal combined by 9/10 of a share point to 52.2%, the highest full year share since we acquired USSTC.
Our portfolio strategy has enhanced Copenhagen and Skoal's competitive positioning and improved USSTC's efficiency and profitability. In 2016, Copenhagen continued to build on its position as the smokeless category's largest brand, with the successful national expansion of Copenhagen Mint. Copenhagen is also the fastest-growing smokeless tobacco brand, posting a 2.2 retail share point gain for the year, more than offsetting Skoal's 1.3 share point decline.
Product innovation was also a focus area in 2016. In e-vapor, Nu Mark made excellent progress this year toward achieving its long-term aspiration of becoming a leader in the e-vapor category. Nu Mark's disciplined test-and-learn approach to MarkTen's national expansion continues to gain traction. At year-end, MarkTen was available in stores representing about 55% of the e-vapor category volume in retail channels, including C stores.
In heated tobacco, Altria continues to partner with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications for iQOS. In December, PMI submitted a modified risk tobacco product application to the FDA for the heated tobacco product that PM USA will commercialize in the U.S. under our agreement with PMI. PMI plans to file the premarket tobacco product application during the first quarter of 2017. And concurrently, PM USA continues to develop its U.S. plans. For example, a commercialization team is now dedicated to preparing for the launch of iQOS in the U.S., including working closely with PMI as against trade and consumer insights from other markets.
In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered another strong year on the performance of its premium brands, with adjusted operating income growth of nearly 10%. For the second consecutive year, Ste. Michelle's premium wines received more than 260 ratings of 90 or better. In October, AB InBev completed its business combination with SABMiller, with Altria ultimately securing a 10.2% ownership in AB InBev. This transaction enhanced the value of Altria's beer investment, and we expect it to deliver strong long-term financial returns to our shareholders.
So to sum up, 2016 was another excellent year for our strong premium brands, our companies and our shareholders. We achieved significant milestones against an ambitious plan, and we believe that we have positioned Altria well for continued future success.
Let's turn for a moment to the regulatory environment. As you know, we continue to work closely with the FDA as it builds out its regulatory framework. One area is our company's substantial equivalence applications, both for provisional and new products. So one of our priorities is to resolve those applications, and the pace of work there has picked up. Second, for cigars and e-vapor, we're preparing the product applications now required by the deeming regulations and continuing to advocate for sensible interpretations consistent with the Act. Third, our companies continue to develop new and innovative products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer expectations, including products that advance tobacco harm reduction. This, too, requires advocating FDA and others to support and foster innovation that will benefit adult consumers. We expect a step up in investments because of these activities.
As you've seen from our press release, we expect to grow our full-year adjusted EPS for 2017 to a range of $3.26 to $3.32, representing growth of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS base of $3.03. So we expect another strong year for Altria.
It may be helpful to share some further color on how we're thinking about that. So to begin, we're expecting continued strong performance from our operating companies, and we believe that the macroeconomic environment remains largely constructive for adult tobacco consumers. We also will have the benefit of reporting 4 full quarters of equity earnings from AB InBev. On the other hand, we've seen some cigarette volume declines, reverting back to more long-term norms. We also know that in April, California, a high-volume state, will implement significantly higher excise taxes, and there are already proposals in several states to raise excise taxes further. And finally, we've taken into account an expected increase in our effective tax rate for 2017, which Billy will explain in a moment. The most important point is that we are entering 2017 with very good momentum from last year and are expecting another year of growth in line with our long-term financial goals.
And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Billy."

Our operating company delivered solid results in the fourth quarter. In the smokable product segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI grew by 3.7%, and adjusted OCI margins increased by 2 percentage points, both driven by higher net pricing and lower benefits cost. For the year, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expanded 1.8 percentage points to 48.2%, driven by higher net pricing and lower benefits cost, partially offset by higher resolution expenses.
PM USA maintained its leading retail position in the fourth quarter. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 4.8% in the quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline and one fewer shipping day. After adjusting for calendar differences, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined approximately 3.5% in the quarter and that total industry cigarette volumes also declined by approximately 3.5%.
For the year, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined approximately 2.5% and that total industry volume also declined by approximately 2.5%. Over the last 3 quarters, we're seeing the cigarette industry volume decline rate gradually revert to more long-term historical norms. In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's focus on the profitable tipped segment continues to yield strong results. Middleton's volumes were up 5.3% in the fourth quarter and 5.9% for the full year.
In the smokeless product segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI grew by 4.3%, driven by higher net pricing and volume, partially offset by higher cost. Fourth quarter adjusted OCI margins decreased by 2 percentage points due primarily to higher manufacturing cost and promotional investments. For the year, adjusted OCI margins expanded 7/10 of a percentage point to 64.4%, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix, higher manufacturing cost and higher promotional investments.
In the fourth quarter, USSTC grew volume ahead of the category growth rate and increased Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share by 1.1 share points to 52.5 share points. USSTC's reported shipment volume increased 2.2% in the quarter and 4.9% for the year. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its shipment volume grew by approximately 4.5% in the quarter and 5% for the year.
This growth is well ahead of the estimated industry volume growth of approximately 2.5% over the past 6 months. In wine, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by 16.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.9% for the year. Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volume grew 4.2% in the quarter and 5.3% for the year.
Let me pick up on the tax issue Marty mentioned when discussing our guidance for 2017. For a variety of reasons, we expect that the 2017 full-year effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 36% compared to 34.7% for 2016.
One of these reasons is because we anticipate fewer foreign tax credits related to AB InBev dividends. Though technical, this is driven by differences in the profit pools between AB InBev and the former SABMiller. That wraps up our results. Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations, we posted for your reference our usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.

Moving on to the domestic cigarette industry, I was wondering if you could talk about a little bit, and give some color about how you're seeing the pricing environment, particularly in the lights of the fact that Imperial has said, if anything, it wants to invest a little bit more in pricing to grow market share perhaps a little bit faster. And also, in the lights of the fact that at least according to the scanner data, Reynolds' market share is -- has stopped growing and has perhaps declined. So it is really a question about the pricing environment in the lights of that."

And we have FDA payments that go up every year. And our principal income contributor is the cigarette category where the volume goes down. So the strategy there for us is to take appropriate pricing in order that we can grow in line with our aspirations. And we've been able to do that. You've seen that pricing for the year in the smokable segment of about 4%. If you look at it slightly longer periods, Adam, I think it's on an average somewhere between 4% and 5%, it bounces there. And that algorithm works for us in terms of the profitability we expect from the smokable segment. So that's how we think about pricing."

And you're familiar with all of the reasons for that I know, so I won't repeat them. So we've taken that into account as we thought about our plan for the year. And in addition, of course, we mentioned we've got the California excise tax coming online in April, and we've been mindful of that. Listen, we're really happy about the Nat Sherman acquisition. They have a terrific team of people over there. They have a very complementary brand portfolio to us. It's a small share position, as you know. It's much more of a niche position, but we believe that when we combine their talented people and brands with the system that we have in terms of retail distribution and brand expertise that we can really make this grow quite nicely.

There are other markets that are more open in terms of the ability to communicate with the consumer. You see the results in Japan, and you know the regulatory situation there. Our job at PM USA is to read all of that data and with our expertise about what is permitted in the United States, including under the master settlement agreement, for example, is to weave that into a plan that will meet our goals. What we're going to try to do, of course, is to introduce adult smokers to the product, try to explain what it is and its attributes and to give them an opportunity to see if it's for them.

Listen, I can't tell you much more than what's in the press release, because we put in the press release basically what is known. So just to reprise, I mean, we've  got -- as you know, we produce hundreds of millions of cans of smokeless. We have 8 consumer complaints with metal objects in the cans. And so we've been working closely with the FDA. No one has reported any injuries. What we're trying to do is to make sure that we're doing the responsible thing with respect to the consumers. We want to make sure that we're doing everything we can, so that no one is injured as a result of this particular incident. And also, it's important, of course, to protect the brand trust. So the way I think I would think about it is, of course, it's a short-term disruption, but in the long term, what you want to do is to protect the consumer from harm from this and protect the trust of brand. We actually have 2 smokeless factories. The Franklin Park facility is the only one that is affected, Bonnie, and it is the smaller of our factories. So the national factory has not been implicated, and that's actually where most of the volume goes through.

That includes the work that we're doing to get ready to commercialize iQOS. As you know, we can commercialize iQOS when the FDA rolls out its applications, and you know what the schedule for that is. I don't want to really tell folks what our competitive plans are about how we're going to do that. But I would go back to what we were discussing earlier, I guess, which is that the object is to make sure that we get the product to adult smokers and explain how it works and what its attributes are so that they can make a choice about whether it's for them. And there's a whole range of activities that you can use to do that. I just don't want to lay them out, as you can appreciate for competitive reasons. But we're well underway. We have a crackerjack team on it. We're very excited about the technology. We're working closely with PMI. So from my read, I think all the signals from a commercial point of view are in the right direction. And we're just going to have to work through the FDA process."

And as you know, Altria -- it would be a good thing for Altria. And so we've had a program underway to try to urge that as a matter of public policy to reduce the corporate income tax rate. We have not built that into our 2017 plans, because I think the best thinking is corporate tax reform's pretty complicated. It's likely to take 2017 to do it. But obviously, it would be a material step-up for Altria if we got significant corporate tax reforms. So that would be important for us to think about if and when it occurs. I think it's the same thing on a regulatory basis. Both at the FDA and for regulatory agencies generally, there appears to be a movement to try to lessen the regulatory burden on business. In our view, that would be good, but those things take time to work their way through the agency. Take HHS, for example, we don't even have a cabinet appointee yet, much less changes that would occur down the line. So our government affairs team and our regulatory affairs team are working very hard on that, but I would think of those more in the long term than in the short."

We're pleased to report that Altria had another outstanding year. In 2016, we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 8.2%, in line with our long-term objectives, while returning a large amount of cash to shareholders, improving our balance sheet and strengthening our organizational capability, thus well positioning Altria to continue to deliver on our long-term goals. During 2016, we also rewarded our shareholders by paying out over $4.5 billion in dividends, raising our dividend by 8% and repurchasing over $1 billion of our shares under an expanded $3 billion share repurchase program.
Since the beginning of 2011, we have returned over $28 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And our dividend payout ratio of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS is among the highest in our peer group. In 2016, we strengthened our balance sheet by tendering for high coupon debt and refinancing it with lower coupon, longer maturity debt. And in October, with Altria's support of Anheuser-Busch InBev's landmark business combination with SABMiller, we enhanced the value of our beer investment and our position in the global brewing profit pool. We continue, also, to improve our operating efficiency through a $300 million productivity initiative announced in January 2016 and a separate $50 million manufacturing consolidation plan announced in October.
These efforts and others have strengthened our organization, streamlined our business processes and provided greater autonomy to our business leaders in this dynamic environment. For 2016, Altria delivered a total shareholder return of 20.5%, marking the fourth consecutive year that total shareholder return has exceeded 20%. And over the last 5 years, Altria's total shareholder return was 187%, significantly outpacing both the S&P 500 and the S&P Food, Beverage and Tobacco Index. All these results are made possible by our dedicated and talented employees, so I want to thank them all.
Here are some operating highlights. The smokable product segment produced another year of strong results on the strength and consistency of its leading premium brands. Adjusted operating company's income grew by 5.3% for the year, primarily through higher pricing and effective cost management. The smokable segment delivered this growth despite very difficult comparisons to last year when it grew adjusted OCI nearly 11%. For the year, PM USA gained 1/10th of a retail share point to 51.4%, and Marlboro maintained retail share near record levels at 44%.
PM USA continues to bring innovative products, packaging and adult consumer engagement activities to the market to reinforce Marlboro's vibrancy and relevance. For example, the national expansion of Marlboro Menthol Slate, a bold menthol product featuring PM USA's innovative soft touch ink packaging is receiving positive feedback from our trade partners.
Last month, we further enhanced our smokable product segment by acquiring Nat Sherman. Nat Sherman has an excellent and differentiated brand portfolio, which complements the brands in Altria's smokable product segment. Nat Sherman brands will benefit from the retail distribution, brand management and adult tobacco consumer engagement expertise of Altria's companies. Integration and business plans are already well underway, and we welcome the Nat Sherman team of employees to the Altria family of companies.
In cigars, Middleton maintained its leadership position in the profitable tipped segment, posting strong full-year volume growth on the strength of the Black & Mild brand. Turning to the smokeless product segment. USSTC delivered a terrific year. The segment grew adjusted OCI 11% for the year, driven by higher pricing and volume, partially offset by higher cost and mix.
Consistent with this strategy, USSTC grew retail share of Copenhagen and Skoal combined by 9/10 of a share point to 52.2%, the highest full year share since we acquired USSTC.
Our portfolio strategy has enhanced Copenhagen and Skoal's competitive positioning and improved USSTC's efficiency and profitability. In 2016, Copenhagen continued to build on its position as the smokeless category's largest brand, with the successful national expansion of Copenhagen Mint. Copenhagen is also the fastest-growing smokeless tobacco brand, posting a 2.2 retail share point gain for the year, more than offsetting Skoal's 1.3 share point decline.
Product innovation was also a focus area in 2016. In e-vapor, Nu Mark made excellent progress this year toward achieving its long-term aspiration of becoming a leader in the e-vapor category. Nu Mark's disciplined test-and-learn approach to MarkTen's national expansion continues to gain traction. At year-end, MarkTen was available in stores representing about 55% of the e-vapor category volume in retail channels, including C stores.
In heated tobacco, Altria continues to partner with Philip Morris International on its FDA applications for iQOS. In December, PMI submitted a modified risk tobacco product application to the FDA for the heated tobacco product that PM USA will commercialize in the U.S. under our agreement with PMI. PMI plans to file the premarket tobacco product application during the first quarter of 2017. And concurrently, PM USA continues to develop its U.S. plans. For example, a commercialization team is now dedicated to preparing for the launch of iQOS in the U.S., including working closely with PMI as against trade and consumer insights from other markets.
In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered another strong year on the performance of its premium brands, with adjusted operating income growth of nearly 10%. For the second consecutive year, Ste. Michelle's premium wines received more than 260 ratings of 90 or better. In October, AB InBev completed its business combination with SABMiller, with Altria ultimately securing a 10.2% ownership in AB InBev. This transaction enhanced the value of Altria's beer investment, and we expect it to deliver strong long-term financial returns to our shareholders.
So to sum up, 2016 was another excellent year for our strong premium brands, our companies and our shareholders. We achieved significant milestones against an ambitious plan, and we believe that we have positioned Altria well for continued future success.
Let's turn for a moment to the regulatory environment. As you know, we continue to work closely with the FDA as it builds out its regulatory framework. One area is our company's substantial equivalence applications, both for provisional and new products. So one of our priorities is to resolve those applications, and the pace of work there has picked up. Second, for cigars and e-vapor, we're preparing the product applications now required by the deeming regulations and continuing to advocate for sensible interpretations consistent with the Act. Third, our companies continue to develop new and innovative products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer expectations, including products that advance tobacco harm reduction. This, too, requires advocating FDA and others to support and foster innovation that will benefit adult consumers. We expect a step up in investments because of these activities.
As you've seen from our press release, we expect to grow our full-year adjusted EPS for 2017 to a range of $3.26 to $3.32, representing growth of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS base of $3.03. So we expect another strong year for Altria.
It may be helpful to share some further color on how we're thinking about that. So to begin, we're expecting continued strong performance from our operating companies, and we believe that the macroeconomic environment remains largely constructive for adult tobacco consumers. We also will have the benefit of reporting 4 full quarters of equity earnings from AB InBev. On the other hand, we've seen some cigarette volume declines, reverting back to more long-term norms. We also know that in April, California, a high-volume state, will implement significantly higher excise taxes, and there are already proposals in several states to raise excise taxes further. And finally, we've taken into account an expected increase in our effective tax rate for 2017, which Billy will explain in a moment. The most important point is that we are entering 2017 with very good momentum from last year and are expecting another year of growth in line with our long-term financial goals.
And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Billy."

Our operating company delivered solid results in the fourth quarter. In the smokable product segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI grew by 3.7%, and adjusted OCI margins increased by 2 percentage points, both driven by higher net pricing and lower benefits cost. For the year, adjusted OCI margins in the segment expanded 1.8 percentage points to 48.2%, driven by higher net pricing and lower benefits cost, partially offset by higher resolution expenses.
PM USA maintained its leading retail position in the fourth quarter. PM USA's reported domestic cigarette shipment volume declined 4.8% in the quarter, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline and one fewer shipping day. After adjusting for calendar differences, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined approximately 3.5% in the quarter and that total industry cigarette volumes also declined by approximately 3.5%.
For the year, PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume declined approximately 2.5% and that total industry volume also declined by approximately 2.5%. Over the last 3 quarters, we're seeing the cigarette industry volume decline rate gradually revert to more long-term historical norms. In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's focus on the profitable tipped segment continues to yield strong results. Middleton's volumes were up 5.3% in the fourth quarter and 5.9% for the full year.
In the smokeless product segment, fourth quarter adjusted OCI grew by 4.3%, driven by higher net pricing and volume, partially offset by higher cost. Fourth quarter adjusted OCI margins decreased by 2 percentage points due primarily to higher manufacturing cost and promotional investments. For the year, adjusted OCI margins expanded 7/10 of a percentage point to 64.4%, primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by mix, higher manufacturing cost and higher promotional investments.
In the fourth quarter, USSTC grew volume ahead of the category growth rate and increased Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share by 1.1 share points to 52.5 share points. USSTC's reported shipment volume increased 2.2% in the quarter and 4.9% for the year. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its shipment volume grew by approximately 4.5% in the quarter and 5% for the year.
This growth is well ahead of the estimated industry volume growth of approximately 2.5% over the past 6 months. In wine, Ste. Michelle grew adjusted OCI by 16.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.9% for the year. Ste. Michelle's reported wine shipment volume grew 4.2% in the quarter and 5.3% for the year.
Let me pick up on the tax issue Marty mentioned when discussing our guidance for 2017. For a variety of reasons, we expect that the 2017 full-year effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 36% compared to 34.7% for 2016.
One of these reasons is because we anticipate fewer foreign tax credits related to AB InBev dividends. Though technical, this is driven by differences in the profit pools between AB InBev and the former SABMiller. That wraps up our results. Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations, we posted for your reference our usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.

So the strategy there for us is to take appropriate pricing in order that we can grow in line with our aspirations. And we've been able to do that. You've seen that pricing for the year in the smokable segment of about 4%. If you look at it slightly longer periods, Adam, I think it's on an average somewhere between 4% and 5%, it bounces there. And that algorithm works for us in terms of the profitability we expect from the smokable segment. So that's how we think about pricing."

For the year, on an adjusted basis, we've got volume down for us at about 2.5%, but obviously, the declines were higher in the back half of the year than they were in the first half of the year. And you're familiar with all of the reasons for that I know, so I won't repeat them. So we've taken that into account as we thought about our plan for the year. And in addition, of course, we mentioned we've got the California excise tax coming online in April, and we've been mindful of that. Listen, we're really happy about the Nat Sherman acquisition. They have a terrific team of people over there. They have a very complementary brand portfolio to us. It's a small share position, as you know. It's much more of a niche position, but we believe that when we combine their talented people and brands with the system that we have in terms of retail distribution and brand expertise that we can really make this grow quite nicely. So we haven't put out any targets on that, as you can appreciate from a competitive point of view, but it's a very nice addition to the smokable segment for us. And we're really excited about it."

There are other markets that are more open in terms of the ability to communicate with the consumer. You see the results in Japan, and you know the regulatory situation there. Our job at PM USA is to read all of that data and with our expertise about what is permitted in the United States, including under the master settlement agreement, for example, is to weave that into a plan that will meet our goals. What we're going to try to do, of course, is to introduce adult smokers to the product, try to explain what it is and its attributes and to give them an opportunity to see if it's for them.

Listen, I can't tell you much more than what's in the press release, because we put in the press release basically what is known. So just to reprise, I mean, we've  got -- as you know, we produce hundreds of millions of cans of smokeless. We have 8 consumer complaints with metal objects in the cans. And so we've been working closely with the FDA. No one has reported any injuries. What we're trying to do is to make sure that we're doing the responsible thing with respect to the consumers. We want to make sure that we're doing everything we can, so that no one is injured as a result of this particular incident. And also, it's important, of course, to protect the brand trust. So the way I think I would think about it is, of course, it's a short-term disruption, but in the long term, what you want to do is to protect the consumer from harm from this and protect the trust of brand. We actually have 2 smokeless factories. The Franklin Park facility is the only one that is affected, Bonnie, and it is the smaller of our factories. So the national factory has not been implicated, and that's actually where most of the volume goes through. We want to make sure that we've got this buttoned up before we ship any more product out of Franklin Park, and we'll do that as soon as we feel like we have our arms around it.

We have not built that into our 2017 plans, because I think the best thinking is corporate tax reform's pretty complicated. It's likely to take 2017 to do it. But obviously, it would be a material step-up for Altria if we got significant corporate tax reforms. So that would be important for us to think about if and when it occurs. I think it's the same thing on a regulatory basis. Both at the FDA and for regulatory agencies generally, there appears to be a movement to try to lessen the regulatory burden on business. In our view, that would be good, but those things take time to work their way through the agency. Take HHS, for example, we don't even have a cabinet appointee yet, much less changes that would occur down the line. So our government affairs team and our regulatory affairs team are working very hard on that, but I would think of those more in the long term than in the short."

I think we have excellent relationships with our trade partners. That's another area that's going to require a lot of thinking about how we take iQOS to market and working with our trade partners.

PM USA estimates that cigarette industry volume declines were in line with the historical rate as the industry lapped the improving consumer conditions and benefits from lower gasoline prices. Against this backdrop, the industry remains competitive and PM USA saw several competitive product expansions and promotional changes. In this environment, PM USA remained focused on maximizing income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro across its measures of brand strength, which include equity, demographics, retail share and profitability. 
PM USA implemented leased price increases in March and continued to compete effectively at retail. PM USA was steady in its strategy and execution resulting in strong smokeable segment price realization. 
And the machine made large cigar category Middleton's focus on the more profitable tipped cigar segment continued to generate good results, and the business is performing very well. The cigar category strength and trade inventory movements drove Middleton's reported shipment volume up over 12% in the quarter. 
Turning to the smokeless products segment. It was a disappointing quarter resulting from the product recall caused by a product tampering incident. USSTC did the right thing by moving quickly to address the issue with consumers, the trade and other stakeholders, but the recalls affect shows in the numbers. Smokeless segment adjusted OCI declined 7.8% and USSTC estimates that the recall had an approximately 1 retail share point impact. 
The recall is concluded, and USSTC has now largely completed replenishing wholesale and retail inventories. We expect that USSTC will recover the share loss over time. 
Turning to innovative tobacco products. Altria continues to develop a portfolio of products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences. In April, Nu Mark announced the expansion of MarkTen to approximately 10,000 more stores and the availability of 3 more flavors for its adult papers: winter mint, summer fusion and smooth cream. 
In heated tobacco, Altria continues to partner with Philip Morris International in seeking regulatory authorization to commercialize the ICOS system in the U.S., both the Modified-Risk Tobacco Product and premarket tobacco product applications for ICOS now have been submitted with the FDA. PM USA's team continues to build its U.S. commercialization plan for ICOS. 
So in summary, we believe that Altria remains well positioned for the rest of the year, and thus, we are reaffirming our full year guidance. 
Now here's Billy for a more detail on our performance."
296308,408645119,1184907,"Altria Group, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 02, 2017",2017-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the smokeable product segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.9 percentage points in the first quarter to 51% due primarily to higher net pricing and lower resolution expenses. Smokeable rep",590,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the smokeable product segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.9 percentage points in the first quarter to 51% due primarily to higher net pricing and lower resolution expenses. Smokeable reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.7% in the quarter. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined approximately 3% in line with PM USA's estimate for the industry decline rate. 
In addition, California cigarette SCT, which went into effect on April 1, will also affect shipment volumes in the short term. PM USA's first quarter retail share was 51%, down 1/10 of a share point. Marlboro's retail share declined by two-tenths of a share point to 43.6%. In smokeless, adjusted OCI margins decreased by 3.6 percentage points to 61.9% driven principally by the recall impact partially offset by higher pricing. 
The recall drove USSTC shipment volume down 5% in the quarter. USSTC estimates that smokeless industry volume grew at approximately 2% over the past 6 months. 
It was a tough quarter for wine. Ste. Michelle's adjusted OCI of $21 million was 25% lower than last year and its margins contracted 4.6 percentage points to 15.4% due to lower volume and higher cost. Ste. Michelle's lower volume was driven by whole service reducing year-end inventory and the timing of the Easter holiday, which occurred in the first quarter of last year. 
Let's now turn to our beer investment. As a reminder, ABI's fourth quarter 2016 results are included in our first quarter results due to the reporting lag. 
In the quarter, Altria's reported equity earnings from our investment in ABI were $23 million. These results included net pretax charges of $73 million for ABI special items. 
As ABI noted in its fourth quarter earnings release, its underlying results were negatively impacted by a challenging environment in Brazil and mark-to-market losses related to ABI's hedging of its share-based compensation payment programs. 
We, of course, continue to focus on our shareholders. In the quarter, we returned a large amount of cash to them, paying nearly $1.2 [ billion ] in dividends and repurchasing over $550 million in shares. 
As of March 31, Altria had approximately $1.4 billion remaining in the current $3 billion share repurchase program. We continue to expect completing this program by the end of the second quarter of 2018. 
As Marty mentioned, we continue to expect that our 2017 adjusted diluted earnings growth will be higher in the second half. This is primarily -- this is due primary to the [ potential ] effect of USSTC's recall this quarter and the benefit of reporting 4 full quarters of equity income from our ABI investment. 
Lastly, a quick word on IRI's retail market share reporting. As a result of IRI's most recent database restatement, cigarette and smokeless retail market shares have been restated. Share information for each quarter of 2016 is available in our press release. You'll remember that IRR uses a sample of retail stores and certain wholesale shipments to project market share and depict share trends. Historical trends of restated numbers are generally consistent with those under IRI's previously reported numbers. That wraps up our results. 
Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations, we posted for your reference our usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.

As you know, Marlboro remains the strongest brand by far in the cigarette category. It's the iconic brand in the category. I think it's also useful to remember what our strategy is. Our strategy in smokeable is to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro over time. And so as we've explained, momentum is viewed by us across various metrics. Let me just mention a few of them. One is brand equity, and brand equity from Marlboro has never been higher, indeed. I think the number we gave was 14 points higher than the next nearest competitor. Demographics are good. As you know, we've stabilized its share among the important 21 to 29 cohort. And actually, Marlboro share is very good across all the rest of the cohorts as well. Its profitability is undeniable. I think the number we put up at CAGNY was $34 billion in retail share -- in retail sales in 2016. And then we come to share. And so which share, we look at it over time. It's down [ 2/10 ] in the quarter to be sure, but that's why we look at it over time because promotions and the like come in and out of the quarter. If you look at it over a longer period, I don't know, say, 2011, we've gained call it a share point and a half to 2 share points. So the strategy hasn't changed at all, hasn't changed at all. It's to be a leading brand in the category and to maximize its profitability."

They have a tough quarter, there's no denying it. There was inventory that got burned off from the end of the year and the Easter holiday was pushed back into the second quarter this year. So that has the effect on all the numbers if you called out in terms of the volume and obviously in terms of the margin. The wine company does a terrific job out there. No quarter is perfect, and this is ours, I guess, for the wine business, but they do a great job. I don't see the need for anyone to think that we have to step up in any materially way with investment in the wine company. It was just a tough quarter."

Altria is off to a solid start in 2017 despite some short-term headwinds. We grew first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share by 1.4%, against the difficult comparison in the year-ago quarter when we grew adjusted diluted EPS more than 14%. 
The smokeable products segment continue to generate strong results, which offset lower equity earnings from our beer investment and the effect of the voluntary product recall in the smokeless product segment. 
Our business fundamentals remain strong, and we believe we're well positioned for the rest of the year. 
Earlier this morning, we reaffirmed our 2017 full year adjusted diluted EPS growth guidance of 7.5% to 9.5%, and we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted to the second half. 
Here are some color on the businesses. The smokeable products segment grew its adjusted operating company's income by more than 8%. PM USA estimates that cigarette industry volume declines were in line with the historical rate as the industry lapped the improving consumer conditions and benefits from lower gasoline prices. Against this backdrop, the industry remains competitive and PM USA saw several competitive product expansions and promotional changes. In this environment, PM USA remained focused on maximizing income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro across its measures of brand strength, which include equity, demographics, retail share and profitability. 
PM USA implemented list price increases in March and continued to compete effectively at retail. PM USA was steady in its strategy and execution resulting in strong smokeable segment price realization. 
In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's focus on the more profitable tipped cigar segment continued to generate good results, and the business is performing very well. The cigar category strength and trade inventory movements drove Middleton's reported shipment volume up over 12% in the quarter. 
Turning to the smokeless products segment, it was a disappointing quarter resulting from the product recall caused by a product-tampering incident. USSTC did the right thing by moving quickly to address the issue with consumers, the trade and other stakeholders, but the recall's effect shows in the numbers. Smokeless segment adjusted OCI declined 7.8% and USSTC estimates that the recall had an approximately 1 retail share point impact. 
The recall is concluded, and USSTC has now largely completed replenishing wholesale and retail inventories. We expect that USSTC will recover the share loss over time. 
Turning to innovative tobacco products. Altria continues to develop a portfolio of products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences. In April, Nu Mark announced the expansion of MarkTen to approximately 10,000 more stores and the availability of 3 more flavors for its adult papers: winter mint, summer fusion and smooth cream. 
In heated tobacco, Altria continues to partner with Philip Morris International in seeking regulatory authorization to commercialize the ICOS system in the U.S., both the Modified-Risk Tobacco Product and premarket tobacco product applications for ICOS now have been submitted with the FDA. PM USA's team continues to build its U.S. commercialization plan for ICOS. 
So in summary, we believe that Altria remains well positioned for the rest of the year and thus, we are reaffirming our full year guidance. 
Now here's Billy for more detail on our performance."
296308,408645119,1185675,"Altria Group, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 02, 2017",2017-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the smokeable product segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.9 percentage points in the first quarter to 51%, due primarily to higher net pricing and lower resolution expenses. Smokeable re",585,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the smokeable product segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.9 percentage points in the first quarter to 51%, due primarily to higher net pricing and lower resolution expenses. Smokeable reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.7% in the quarter. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined approximately 3% in line with PM USA's estimate for the industry decline rate. 
In addition, California cigarette SCT, which went into effect on April 1, will also affect shipment volumes in the short term. PM USA's first quarter retail share was 51%, down 0.1 of a share point. Marlboro's retail share declined by 0.2 of a share point to 43.6%. In smokeless, adjusted OCI margins decreased by 3.6 percentage points to 61.9%, driven principally by the recall impact, partially offset by higher pricing. 
The recall drove USSTC shipment volume down 5% in the quarter. USSTC estimates that smokeless industry volume grew at approximately 2% over the past 6 months. 
It was a tough quarter for wine. Ste. Michelle's adjusted OCI of $21 million was 25% lower than last year, and its margins contracted 4.6 percentage points to 15.4% due to lower volume and higher cost. Ste. Michelle's lower volume was driven by wholesalers reducing year-end inventory and the timing of the Easter holiday, which occurred in the first quarter of last year. 
Let's now turn to our beer investment. As a reminder, ABI's fourth quarter 2016 results are included in our first quarter results due to the reporting lag. 
In the quarter, Altria's reported equity earnings from our investment in ABI were $23 million. These results included net pretax charges of $73 million for ABI special items. 
As ABI noted in its fourth quarter earnings release, its underlying results were negatively impacted by a challenging environment in Brazil and mark-to-market losses related to ABI's hedging of its share-based compensation payment programs. 
We, of course, continue to focus on our shareholders. In the quarter, we returned a large amount of cash to them, paying nearly $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchasing over $550 million in shares. 
As of March 31, Altria had approximately $1.4 billion remaining in the current $3 billion share repurchase program. We continue to expect completing this program by the end of the second quarter of 2018. 
As Marty mentioned, we continue to expect that our 2017 adjusted diluted earnings growth will be higher in the second half. This is primarily -- this is due primarily to the financial effect of USSTC's recall this quarter and the benefit of reporting 4 full quarters of equity income from our ABI investment. 
Lastly, a quick word on IRI's retail market share reporting. As a result of IRI's most recent database restatement, cigarette and smokeless retail market shares have been restated. Share information for each quarter of 2016 is available in our press release. You'll remember that IRI uses a sample of retail stores and certain wholesale shipments to project market share and depict share trends. Historical trends of restated numbers are generally consistent with those under IRI's previously reported numbers. That wraps up our results. 
Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations, we posted for your reference a usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.

As you know, Marlboro remains the strongest brand by far in the cigarette category. It's the iconic brand in the category. I think it's also useful to remember what our strategy is. Our strategy in smokeable is to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro over time. And so as we have explained, momentum is viewed by us across various metrics. Let me just mention a few of them: one is brand equity, and brand equity from Marlboro has never been higher, indeed. I think the number we gave was 14 points higher than the next nearest competitor. Demographics are good. As you know, we've stabilized its share among the important 21 to 29 cohort. And actually, Marlboro shares are very good across all the rest of the cohorts as well. Its profitability is undeniable. I think the number we put up at CAGNY was $34 billion in retail share -- in retail sales in 2016. And then we come to share. And so which share, we look at it over time. It's down 0.2 in the quarter to be sure, but that's why we look at it over time because promotions and the like come in and out of the quarter. If you look at it over a longer period, I don't know, say, 2011, we've gained I don't -- call it 1.5 share point to 2 share points. So the strategy hasn't changed at all, hasn't changed at all. It's to be a leading brand in the category and to maximize its profitability."

They had a tough quarter, there's no denying it. There was inventory that got burned off from the end of the year and the Easter holiday was pushed back into the second quarter this year. So that has the effect on all the numbers if you called out in terms of the volume and, obviously, in terms of the margin. The wine company does a terrific job out there. No quarter is perfect and this is ours, I guess, for the wine business, but they do a great job. I don't see the need for anyone to think that we have to step up in any materially way the investment in the wine company. It was just a tough quarter."

Altria is off to a solid start in 2017 despite some short-term headwinds. We grew first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share by 1.4%, against a difficult comparison in the year-ago quarter when we grew adjusted diluted EPS more than 14%. 
The smokeable products segment continue to generate strong results, which offset lower equity earnings from our beer investment and the effect of the voluntary product recall in the smokeless product segment. 
Our business fundamentals remain strong, and we believe we're well positioned for the rest of the year. 
Earlier this morning, we reaffirmed our 2017 full year adjusted diluted EPS growth guidance of 7.5% to 9.5%, and we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted to the second half. 
Here are some color on the businesses. The smokeable products segment grew its adjusted operating company's income by more than 8%. PM USA estimates that cigarette industry volume declines were in line with the historical rate as the industry lapped the improving consumer conditions and benefits from lower gasoline prices. Against this backdrop, the industry remains competitive and PM USA saw several competitive product expansions and promotional changes. In this environment, PM USA remained focused on maximizing income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro across its measures of brand strength, which include equity, demographics, retail share and profitability. 
PM USA implemented list price increases in March and continued to compete effectively at retail. PM USA was steady in its strategy and execution resulting in strong smokeable segment price realization. 
In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's focus on the more profitable tipped cigar segment continued to generate good results, and the business is performing very well. The cigar category strength and trade inventory movements drove Middleton's reported shipment volume up over 12% in the quarter. 
Turning to the smokeless products segment, it was a disappointing quarter resulting from the product recall caused by a product-tampering incident. USSTC did the right thing by moving quickly to address the issue with consumers, the trade and other stakeholders, but the recall's effect shows in the numbers. Smokeless segment adjusted OCI declined 7.8% and USSTC estimates that the recall had an approximately 1 retail share point impact. 
The recall is concluded, and USSTC has now largely completed replenishing wholesale and retail inventories. We expect that USSTC will recover the share loss over time. 
Turning to innovative tobacco products. Altria continues to develop a portfolio of products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences. In April, Nu Mark announced the expansion of MarkTen to approximately 10,000 more stores and the availability of 3 more flavors for its adult papers: winter mint, summer fusion and smooth cream. 
In heated tobacco, Altria continues to partner with Philip Morris International in seeking regulatory authorization to commercialize the ICOS system in the U.S., both the Modified-Risk Tobacco Product and premarket tobacco product applications for ICOS now have been submitted with the FDA. PM USA's team continues to build its U.S. commercialization plan for ICOS. 
So in summary, we believe that Altria remains well positioned for the rest of the year and thus, we are reaffirming our full year guidance. 
Now here's Billy for more detail on our performance."
296308,408645119,1185833,"Altria Group, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 02, 2017",2017-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the smokeable product segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.9 percentage points in the first quarter to 51%, due primarily to higher net pricing and lower resolution expenses. Smokeable re",585,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the smokeable product segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.9 percentage points in the first quarter to 51%, due primarily to higher net pricing and lower resolution expenses. Smokeable reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.7% in the quarter. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined approximately 3% in line with PM USA's estimate for the industry decline rate. 
In addition, California cigarette SCT, which went into effect on April 1, will also affect shipment volumes in the short term. PM USA's first quarter retail share was 51%, down 0.1 of a share point. Marlboro's retail share declined by 0.2 of a share point to 43.6%. In smokeless, adjusted OCI margins decreased by 3.6 percentage points to 61.9%, driven principally by the recall impact, partially offset by higher pricing. 
The recall drove USSTC shipment volume down 5% in the quarter. USSTC estimates that smokeless industry volume grew at approximately 2% over the past 6 months. 
It was a tough quarter for wine. Ste. Michelle's adjusted OCI of $21 million was 25% lower than last year, and its margins contracted 4.6 percentage points to 15.4% due to lower volume and higher cost. Ste. Michelle's lower volume was driven by wholesalers reducing year-end inventory and the timing of the Easter holiday, which occurred in the first quarter of last year. 
Let's now turn to our beer investment. As a reminder, ABI's fourth quarter 2016 results are included in our first quarter results due to the reporting lag. 
In the quarter, Altria's reported equity earnings from our investment in ABI were $23 million. These results included net pretax charges of $73 million for ABI special items. 
As ABI noted in its fourth quarter earnings release, its underlying results were negatively impacted by a challenging environment in Brazil and mark-to-market losses related to ABI's hedging of its share-based compensation payment programs. 
We, of course, continue to focus on our shareholders. In the quarter, we returned a large amount of cash to them, paying nearly $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchasing over $550 million in shares. 
As of March 31, Altria had approximately $1.4 billion remaining in the current $3 billion share repurchase program. We continue to expect completing this program by the end of the second quarter of 2018. 
As Marty mentioned, we continue to expect that our 2017 adjusted diluted earnings growth will be higher in the second half. This is primarily -- this is due primarily to the financial effect of USSTC's recall this quarter and the benefit of reporting 4 full quarters of equity income from our ABI investment. 
Lastly, a quick word on IRI's retail market share reporting. As a result of IRI's most recent database restatement, cigarette and smokeless retail market shares have been restated. Share information for each quarter of 2016 is available in our press release. You'll remember that IRI uses a sample of retail stores and certain wholesale shipments to project market share and depict share trends. Historical trends of restated numbers are generally consistent with those under IRI's previously reported numbers. That wraps up our results. 
Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations, we posted for your reference a usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.

As you know, Marlboro remains the strongest brand by far in the cigarette category. It's the iconic brand in the category. I think it's also useful to remember what our strategy is. And our strategy in smokeable is to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro over time. And so as we have explained, momentum is viewed by us across various metrics. Let me just mention a few of them: one is brand equity, and brand equity from Marlboro has never been higher, indeed. I think the number we gave was 14 points higher than the next nearest competitor. Demographics are good. As you know, we've stabilized its share among the important 21 to 29 cohort. And actually, Marlboro shares are very good across all the rest of the cohorts as well. Its profitability is undeniable. I think the number we put up at CAGNY was $34 billion in retail share -- in retail sales in 2016. And then we come to share. And so which share, we look at it over time. It's down 0.2 in the quarter to be sure, but that's why we look at it over time because promotions and the like come in and out of the quarter. If you look at it over a longer period, I don't know, say, 2011, we've gained I don't -- call it 1.5 share point to 2 share points. So the strategy hasn't changed at all, hasn't changed at all. It's to be the leading brand in the category and to maximize its profitability."

So that has the effect on all the numbers if you called out in terms of the volume and, obviously, in terms of the margin. The wine company does a terrific job out there. No quarter is perfect and this is ours, I guess, for the wine business, but they do a great job. I don't see the need for anyone to think that we have to step up in any materially way the investment in the wine company. It was just a tough quarter."

If you recall, when we look at the cigar category, you have it in basically 3 segments: you've got the tipped, where Black and Mild participates and has over about 90% of that segment. You have the untipped, and then you have the non-cigarillo form. We participate in the tipped and we have basically a large market share there. And so that's why we're running for profitability. That's where most of the profitability is in the cigar category. In the untipped segment, there's a basically a price we're going on where people are competing for volume, but at a very low profitability, and we are really not participating in that segment. So it hasn't been a change for us, but I think that describes the strategy and the approaches we have in the cigar category."

Altria is off to a solid start in 2017 despite some short-term headwinds. We grew first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share by 1.4%, against a difficult comparison in the year-ago quarter when we grew adjusted diluted EPS more than 14%. 
The smokeable products segment continue to generate strong results, which offset lower equity earnings from our beer investment and the effect of the voluntary product recall in the smokeless product segment. 
Our business fundamentals remain strong, and we believe we're well positioned for the rest of the year. 
Earlier this morning, we reaffirmed our 2017 full year adjusted diluted EPS growth guidance of 7.5% to 9.5%, and we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted to the second half. 
Here are some color on the businesses. The smokeable products segment grew its adjusted operating company's income by more than 8%. PM USA estimates that cigarette industry volume declines were in line with the historical rate as the industry lapped the improving consumer conditions and benefits from lower gasoline prices. Against this backdrop, the industry remains competitive and PM USA saw several competitive product expansions and promotional changes. In this environment, PM USA remained focused on maximizing income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro across its measures of brand strength, which include equity, demographics, retail share and profitability. 
PM USA implemented list price increases in March and continued to compete effectively at retail. PM USA was steady in its strategy and execution resulting in strong smokeable segment price realization. 
In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's focus on the more profitable tipped cigar segment continued to generate good results, and the business is performing very well. The cigar category strength and trade inventory movements drove Middleton's reported shipment volume up over 12% in the quarter. 
Turning to the smokeless products segment, it was a disappointing quarter resulting from the product recall caused by a product-tampering incident. USSTC did the right thing by moving quickly to address the issue with consumers, the trade and other stakeholders, but the recall's effect shows in the numbers. Smokeless segment adjusted OCI declined 7.8% and USSTC estimates that the recall had an approximately 1 retail share point impact. 
The recall is concluded, and USSTC has now largely completed replenishing wholesale and retail inventories. We expect that USSTC will recover the share loss over time. 
Turning to innovative tobacco products. Altria continues to develop a portfolio of products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences. In April, Nu Mark announced the expansion of MarkTen to approximately 10,000 more stores and the availability of 3 more flavors for its adult papers: winter mint, summer fusion and smooth cream. 
In heated tobacco, Altria continues to partner with Philip Morris International in seeking regulatory authorization to commercialize the ICOS system in the U.S., both the Modified-Risk Tobacco Product and premarket tobacco product applications for ICOS now have been submitted with the FDA. PM USA's team continues to build its U.S. commercialization plan for ICOS. 
So in summary, we believe that Altria remains well positioned for the rest of the year and thus, we are reaffirming our full year guidance. 
Now here's Billy for more detail on our performance."
296308,408645119,1188852,"Altria Group, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 02, 2017",2017-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the smokeable product segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.9 percentage points in the first quarter to 51%, due primarily to higher net pricing and lower resolution expenses. Smokeable re",585,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the smokeable product segment. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 2.9 percentage points in the first quarter to 51%, due primarily to higher net pricing and lower resolution expenses. Smokeable reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.7% in the quarter. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume declined approximately 3% in line with PM USA's estimate for the industry decline rate. 
In addition, California cigarette SCT, which went into effect on April 1, will also affect shipment volumes in the short term. PM USA's first quarter retail share was 51%, down 0.1 of a share point. Marlboro's retail share declined by 0.2 of a share point to 43.6%. In smokeless, adjusted OCI margins decreased by 3.6 percentage points to 61.9%, driven principally by the recall impact, partially offset by higher pricing. 
The recall drove USSTC shipment volume down 5% in the quarter. USSTC estimates that smokeless industry volume grew at approximately 2% over the past 6 months. 
It was a tough quarter for wine. Ste. Michelle's adjusted OCI of $21 million was 25% lower than last year, and its margins contracted 4.6 percentage points to 15.4% due to lower volume and higher cost. Ste. Michelle's lower volume was driven by wholesalers reducing year-end inventory and the timing of the Easter holiday, which occurred in the first quarter of last year. 
Let's now turn to our beer investment. As a reminder, ABI's fourth quarter 2016 results are included in our first quarter results due to the reporting lag. 
In the quarter, Altria's reported equity earnings from our investment in ABI were $23 million. These results included net pretax charges of $73 million for ABI special items. 
As ABI noted in its fourth quarter earnings release, its underlying results were negatively impacted by a challenging environment in Brazil and mark-to-market losses related to ABI's hedging of its share-based compensation payment programs. 
We, of course, continue to focus on our shareholders. In the quarter, we returned a large amount of cash to them, paying nearly $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchasing over $550 million in shares. 
As of March 31, Altria had approximately $1.4 billion remaining in the current $3 billion share repurchase program. We continue to expect completing this program by the end of the second quarter of 2018. 
As Marty mentioned, we continue to expect that our 2017 adjusted diluted earnings growth will be higher in the second half. This is primarily -- this is due primarily to the financial effect of USSTC's recall this quarter and the benefit of reporting 4 full quarters of equity income from our ABI investment. 
Lastly, a quick word on IRI's retail market share reporting. As a result of IRI's most recent database restatement, cigarette and smokeless retail market shares have been restated. Share information for each quarter of 2016 is available in our press release. You'll remember that IRI uses a sample of retail stores and certain wholesale shipments to project market share and depict share trends. Historical trends of restated numbers are generally consistent with those under IRI's previously reported numbers. That wraps up our results. 
Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations, we posted for your reference a usual list of quarterly metrics, including pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.

As you know, Marlboro remains the strongest brand by far in the cigarette category. It's the iconic brand in the category. I think it's also useful to remember what our strategy is. And our strategy in smokeable is to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro over time. And so as we have explained, momentum is viewed by us across various metrics. Let me just mention a few of them: one is brand equity, and brand equity from Marlboro has never been higher, indeed. I think the number we gave was 14 points higher than the next nearest competitor. Demographics are good. As you know, we've stabilized its share among the important 21 to 29 cohort. And actually, Marlboro shares are very good across all the rest of the cohorts as well. Its profitability is undeniable. I think the number we put up at CAGNY was $34 billion in retail share -- in retail sales in 2016. And then we come to share. And so which share, we look at it over time. It's down 0.2 in the quarter to be sure, but that's why we look at it over time because promotions and the like come in and out of the quarter. If you look at it over a longer period, I don't know, say, 2011, we've gained I don't -- call it 1.5 share point to 2 share points. So the strategy hasn't changed at all, hasn't changed at all. It's to be the leading brand in the category and to maximize its profitability."

So that has the effect on all the numbers if you called out in terms of the volume and, obviously, in terms of the margin. The wine company does a terrific job out there. No quarter is perfect and this is ours, I guess, for the wine business, but they do a great job. I don't see the need for anyone to think that we have to step up in any materially way the investment in the wine company. It was just a tough quarter."

296308,408645124,1254286,"Altria Group, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Well thanks, Bill, and good morning to everyone. Based on strong tobacco operating company performance, Altria delivered solid results in the second quarter and first half of 2017.

Based on strong tobacco operating company performance, Altria delivered solid results in the second quarter and first half of 2017. The smokeable products segment generated strong income growth despite a large cigarette excise tax increase in California and the smokeless product segment has largely rebounded from its first quarter voluntary product recall. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share 4.9% in the second quarter and 3.3% for the first half of 2017.
The smokeable products segment delivered to 6.4% adjusted operating company's income growth in the second quarter and strong pricing more than offset volume declines and higher promotional investments. For the first half, smokable product segment adjusted operating companies income grew 7.2%.
As I mentioned, the smokable segment's results were negatively impacted by California's $2 per pack cigarette excise tax increase, which went into effect on April 1. California is a high-volume state, previously accounting for approximately 7% of total U.S. cigarette industry volume. Following the tax increase, California's volume contribution dropped to 5%, which drove total U.S. industry volume down approximately 4.5% in the quarter. In addition, Marlboro has a strong share in California of over 50%. Thus, Marlboro was disproportionately impacted by the tax increase contributing to its decline of 3/10 of a national retail share point in the second quarter to 43.5%. We expect these dynamics will continue to dampen Marlboro's share through the back half. Outside of California, Marlboro's second quarter share remained stable sequentially.
Past experience shows that tax increases of this magnitude are most destructive immediately following implementation, after which, the rate of decline moderates. We continue to anticipate and approximate 1% negative impact on industry volumes for the full year as a result of the excise tax increases in California on April 1 in Pennsylvania last August.
Looking to the back half of the year, PM USA recently announced the national expansion of Marlboro Black Menthol 72's, a product PM USA expects will further enhance Marlboro's position in the growing in the growing menthol segment and among adult smokers aged 21 to 29.
Moving to the smokeless product segment, USSTC has largely rebounded from its first quarter product recall. It delivered 9.8% adjusted operating company's income growth in the second quarter. USSTC grew smokeless products volume, 1.4% in the quarter and gained retail share sequentially, growing 6/10 of a share point over the first quarter. USSTC estimates that the recall had about a half of a share point impact on its total retail share in the second quarter.
And Copenhagen continued to gain ground in the second quarter, growing 7/10 of a retail share point to a record share of 34.1%, that was a particularly strong performance as it lapped the Copenhagen mint national expansion in 2016. Through the first half, Copenhagen remains both the largest and the fastest-growing smokeless tobacco product in the U.S. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 7/10 of a share point in the second quarter driven by Skoal's 1.4 share point decline. For the first half, combined Copenhagen and Skoal a retail share declined 6/10 of a share point.
The smokeless product segment delivered 1.6% adjusted operating company's income growth for the first half of 2017 as higher pricing was partially offset by the first quarter recall. Now that the product recall is complete and trade inventories are substantially replenished, USSTC is well positioned moving into the second half of the year.
Finally, an update on our innovative tobacco products' efforts. In e-vapor Nu Mark's, MarkTen brand continues to grow volume and retail share. It is currently the #2 e-vapor brand nationally with a second quarter national retail market share of approximately 13% in mainstream channels. MarkTen is now present in stores, representing nearly 65% of e-vapor volume in those channels. And amongst stores with MarkTen distribution through the full second quarter, MarkTen's retail share was approximately 24%. We're pleased with MarkTen's progress and Nu Mark plans to continue growing the brand in the back half.
In the heated tobacco, the FDA began its substantive review of Philip Morris International's modified risk tobacco product application for iQOS in late May. The FDA published PMI's executive summary and research summaries its website for public review and comment, and the agency plans to publish additional sections of the application on a rolling basis. We continue to work closely with PMI throughout the review process. As a reminder, PMI submitted its premarket tobacco product application or iQOS to the FDA on March 31. Our to my PM USA continues to build its U.S. commercialization plans, which we look forward to sharing with you in the future.
I'll wrap up with guidance. Obviously, our business fundamentals remain strong. We continue to expect higher adjusted diluted EPS growth in the second half of the year as some first half headwinds moderate and because the fourth quarter will include equity earnings from our beer investment, whereas the fourth quarter of 2016 did not. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth.
Here's Billy for more details on our performance."

I'll start with the smokeable products segment. As Marty discussed, cigarette industry volumes declined approximately 4.5% in the second quarter, impacted by the significant cigarette excise tax increase in California. The smokeable product  segment's reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.9%, moderated by trade inventory movements. And adjusted for these inventory movements, PM USA's cigarette shipment volume was down an estimated 5%. For the first half, cigarette industry volumes declined by an estimated 3.5%. The smokeable products segment's cigarette shipment volume decreased 2.8% on a reported basis. In adjusted for trade inventory movements, PM USA's cigarette shipment volume declined an estimated 4%.
The cigar business continues to perform well, delivering volume growth of 13.1% for the second quarter and 12.7% for the first half of 2017. Smokeable products segment, adjusted OCI margins expanded by 1.6 percentage points to 51.7% in the second quarter, driven by higher pricing. For the first half, adjusted OCI margins expanded 2.2 percentage points to 51.4%.
In the smokeless products segment, industry volume grew at an estimated 1% in the past 6 months. USSTC's reported shipment volume grew 1.4% in the second quarter, but declined 1.7% in the first half due to the recall. Smokeless products segment's adjusted OCI margins increased by 7/10 of a percentage point in the quarter to 70%, driven principally by higher pricing, partially offset by higher SG&A spending and unfavorable mix. For the first half, smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins decreased to by 1.1 percentage points, primary due to the recall, partially offset by higher pricing.
 Looking ahead, we expect to see some impact on the smokeless category from California's excise tax increase on smokeless tobacco products, which went into effect in July 4. California accounts for roughly 4% of U.S. smokeless industry volume and we expect the average price per can in California to increased by over $1 or approximately 25% in the third quarter.
Turning to our alcohol assets. Ste. Michelle faced headwinds in the first half. Largely due to trade inventory reductions and increased competitive activity. In recent quarters, we have observed a slowdown in premium wine category growth in measured channels, and the trade ended 2016 with excess inventory Ste. Michelle products. As the trade reduced their inventories, Ste. Michelle's shipment volume was negatively impacted, down 12.4% for the first half. Ste. Michelle is working closely with its major distributors to manage to do this and believes that volume trends will improve in the second half versus the first half.
In beer, adjusted equity earnings from our investment and in Anheuser-Busch InBev were $142 in the second quarter, reflecting AB InBev's first quarter results, which it reported in May. This excludes a $408 million gain related to AB InBev divestitures in the quarter, which were planned as a closing condition of the SAB Miller business combination.
I'll wrap up by underscoring our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. First, through the first half of 2017, we paid shareholders nearly $2.4 billion in dividends. Second, we repurchased $1.6 billion in shares, leaving approximately $335 million in the program as of June 30. This week, our board authorized a $1 billion expansion to the share repurchase program. We expect to complete the $4 billion program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com.

In fact, it's essentially flat, down a tenth. But there is some difference between the branded discount, which is down 5/10 and deep discount, which is up 4/10, so looks to us like it's basically churned there. I mean, importantly, for us, there does not appear to have any significant affect on Marlboro or in indeed, if you look at the share chart in the earnings release, you can see that the discount category for us was actually up a tenth over the half.

I think what you maybe getting at though that it if there is a segment of consumers in our category who will go into the store and ask the clerk for the lowest priced brand, and they may be picking up some share there. But again, it appears to be coming at a perhaps the branded discount segment certainly no effect on our brand, so we don't see it in premium, generally. I hope that's helpful."

We over indexed in California. And so I think that explains that. In competitive environment, I think we would describe as it's always competitive. it maybe useful for a couple of comments on that. One is, if you think of competitive activity is occurring within, say, a band, it looks to us like the competitive activity remains within the band, although perhaps a bit on the high side of the band.

In our view and the view of many others who waited on the FDA is that there is not. For San Francisco to try to create its own set of rules out there doesn't seem to be good public policy to us. But this happens, local jurisdictions have used about tobacco issues and while we fight them, they go ahead and reimplement them, obviously, as a tiny fraction of the volume."

296308,408645124,1254579,"Altria Group, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Well thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Based on strong tobacco operating company performance, Altria delivered solid results in the second quarter and first half of 2017.

Based on strong tobacco operating company performance, Altria delivered solid results in the second quarter and first half of 2017. The smokeable products segment generated strong income growth despite a large cigarette excise tax increase in California and the smokeless products segment has largely rebounded from its first quarter voluntary product recall. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share 4.9% in the second quarter and 3.3% for the first half of 2017.
The smokeable products segment delivered 6.4% adjusted operating companies income growth in the second quarter as strong pricing more than offset volume declines and higher promotional investments. For the first half, smokable products segment adjusted operating companies income grew 7.2%.
As I mentioned, the smokable segment's results were negatively impacted by California's $2 per pack cigarette excise tax increase, which went into effect on April 1. California is a high-volume state, previously accounting for approximately 7% of total U.S. cigarette industry volume. Following the tax increase, California's volume contribution dropped to 5%, which drove total U.S. industry volume down approximately 4.5% in the quarter. In addition, Marlboro has a strong share in California of over 50%. Thus, Marlboro was disproportionately impacted by the tax increase contributing to its decline of 3/10 of a national retail share point in the second quarter to 43.5%. We expect these dynamics will continue to dampen Marlboro's share through the back half. Outside of California, Marlboro's second quarter share remained stable sequentially.
Past experience shows that tax increases of this magnitude are most disruptive immediately following implementation, after which, the rate of decline moderates. We continue to anticipate and approximate 1% negative impact on industry volumes for the full year as a result of the excise tax increases in California on April 1 and Pennsylvania last August.
Looking to the back half of the year, PM USA recently announced the national expansion of Marlboro Black Menthol 72s, a product PM USA expects will further enhance Marlboro's position in the growing menthol segment and among adult smokers aged 21 to 29.
Moving to the smokeless products segment. USSTC has largely rebounded from its first quarter product recall. It delivered 9.8% adjusted operating companies income growth in the second quarter. USSTC grew smokeless products volume 1.4% in the quarter and gained retail share sequentially, growing 6/10 of a share point over the first quarter. USSTC estimates that the recall had about a half of a share point impact on its total retail share in the second quarter.
And Copenhagen continued to gain ground in the second quarter, growing 7/10 of a retail share point to a record share of 34.1%, that was a particularly strong performance as it lapped the Copenhagen Mint national expansion in 2016. Through the first half, Copenhagen remains both the largest and the fastest-growing smokeless tobacco product in the U.S. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 7/10 of a share point in the second quarter, driven by Skoal's 1.4 share point decline. For the first half, combined Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 6/10 of a share point.  
The smokeless products segment delivered 1.6% adjusted operating companies income growth for the first half of 2017 as higher pricing was partially offset by the first quarter recall. Now that the product recall is complete and trade inventories are substantially replenished, USSTC is well positioned moving into the second half of the year.
Finally, an update on our innovative tobacco products' efforts. In e-vapor, Nu Mark's MarkTen brand continues to grow volume and retail share. It is currently the #2 e-vapor brand nationally, with a second quarter national retail market share of approximately 13% in mainstream channels. MarkTen is now present in stores, representing nearly 65% of e-vapor volume in those channels. And amongst stores with MarkTen distribution through the full second quarter, MarkTen's retail share was approximately 24%. We're pleased with MarkTen's progress and Nu Mark plans to continue growing the brand in the back half.
In the heated tobacco, the FDA began its substantive review of Philip Morris International's modified risk tobacco product application for iQOS in late May. The FDA published PMI's executive summary and research summaries to its website for public review and comment, and the agency plans to publish additional sections of the application on a rolling basis. We continue to work closely with PMI throughout the review process. As a reminder, PMI submitted its premarket tobacco product application or iQOS to the FDA on March 31. Our team at PM USA continues to build its U.S. commercialization plans, which we look forward to sharing with you in the future.
I'll wrap up with guidance. Obviously, our business fundamentals remained strong. We continue to expect higher adjusted diluted EPS growth in the second half of the year as some first half headwinds moderate and because the fourth quarter will include equity earnings from our beer investment, whereas the fourth quarter of 2016 did not. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth.
Here's Billy for more details on our performance."

I'll start with the smokeable products segment. As Marty discussed, cigarette industry volumes declined approximately 4.5% in the second quarter, impacted by the significant cigarette excise tax increase in California. The smokeable products segment's reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.9%, moderated by trade inventory movements. When adjusted for these inventory movements, PM USA's cigarette shipment volume was down an estimated 5%. For the first half, cigarette industry volumes declined by an estimated 3.5%. The smokeable products segment's cigarette shipment volume decreased 2.8% on a reported basis. When adjusted for trade inventory movements, PM USA's cigarette shipment volume declined an estimated 4%.
The cigar business continues to perform well, delivering volume growth of 13.1% for the second quarter and 12.7% for the first half of 2017. Smokeable products segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 1.6 percentage points to 51.7% in the second quarter, driven by higher pricing. For the first half, adjusted OCI margins expanded 2.2 percentage points to 51.4%.
In the smokeless products segment, industry volume grew an estimated 1% in the past 6 months. USSTC's reported shipment volume grew 1.4% in the second quarter but declined 1.7% in the first half due to the recall. Smokeless products segment's adjusted OCI margins increased by 7/10 of a percentage point in the quarter to 70%, driven principally by higher pricing, partially offset by higher SG&A spending and unfavorable mix. For the first half, smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins decreased to by 1.1 percentage points, primarily due to the recall, partially offset by higher pricing.
 Looking ahead, we expect to see some impact on the smokeless category from California's excise tax increase on smokeless tobacco products, which went into effect on July 4. California accounts for roughly 4% of U.S. smokeless industry volume and we expect the average price per can in California to increased by over $1 or approximately 25% in the third quarter.
Turning to our alcohol assets. Ste. Michelle faced headwinds in the first half, largely due to trade inventory reductions and increased competitive activity. In recent quarters, we have observed a slowdown in premium wine category growth in measured channels, and the trade ended 2016 with excess inventory of Ste. Michelle products. As the trade reduced their inventories, Ste. Michelle's shipment volume was negatively impacted, down 12.4% for the first half. Ste. Michelle is working closely with its major distributors to manage through this and believes that volume trends will improve in the second half versus the first half.
In beer, adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev were $142 in the second quarter, reflecting AB InBev's first quarter results, which it reported in May. This excludes a $408 million gain related to AB InBev divestitures in the quarter, which were planned as a closing condition of the SABMiller business combination.
I'll wrap up by underscoring our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. First, through the first half of 2017, we paid shareholders nearly $2.4 billion in dividends. Second, we repurchased $1.6 billion in shares, leaving approximately $335 million in the program as of June 30. This week, our board authorized a $1 billion expansion to the share repurchase program. We expect to complete the $4 billion program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items. You'll see that we've included a few additional data points on the discount cigarette category. This is a response to a series of questions we received on that topic.

But there is some difference between the branded discount, which is down 5/10 and deep discount, which is up 4/10, so looks to us like it's basically churned there. I mean, importantly, for us, there does not appear to have any significant effect on Marlboro or in L&M. Indeed, if you look at the share chart in the earnings release, you can see that the discount category for us was actually up 1/10 over the half. Bill can talk about the geographies, but there's no question that when you have a major excise tax increase in the state, some people do trade down. I don't know, Billy, do you want to talk about discount?"

So the share in Marlboro is down, primarily because of the California effect, but other metrics on Marlboro continue to be strong, its equity is great. As you can see, we've got very good pricing through the first half, Michael. The demographics have stabilized since Marlboro architecture. We just had a massive increase in California. We over indexed in California, and so I think that explains that. A competitive environment, I think we would describe as it's always competitive. It maybe useful for a couple of comments on that. One is, if you think of competitive activity is occurring within, say, a band, it looks to us like the competitive activity remains within the band, although perhaps a bit on the high side of the band. We have some promotional launches and some promotional activity from other competitors, but we monitor that carefully, as you know, and what we basically do is we adjust as we need to adjust.

If we look at -- when we went back and looked to some data through June, and the small exception of maybe, I don't know, call it, 2, 3 or 4 SKUs, all of the orders were being completely fulfilled. So that's a pretty quick snapback from a recall and a transition from a 2-factory environment to a 1-factory environment. I'd like to take the occasion to congratulate the UST team on such a good job. There was a brief hiatus during the July 4th holiday. Our people have been working very hard in the factory, and we gave them an appropriate July 4th holiday. And there was a short period there where a few more SKUs were not available and we had to limit some orders. But on the whole, the vast majority of the SKUs are at full fulfillment. And as you can see from the numbers in the second quarter by the smokeless team, I think they've done a very good job. So our view is, is that we're pretty much back in business in the smokeless business. We have not seen any pantry loading that I'm aware of."

Based on strong tobacco operating company performance, Altria delivered solid results in the second quarter and first half of 2017.

Based on strong tobacco operating company performance, Altria delivered solid results in the second quarter and first half of 2017. The smokeable products segment generated strong income growth despite a large cigarette excise tax increase in California and the smokeless products segment has largely rebounded from its first quarter voluntary product recall. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share 4.9% in the second quarter and 3.3% for the first half of 2017.
The smokeable products segment delivered 6.4% adjusted operating companies income growth in the second quarter as strong pricing more than offset volume declines and higher promotional investments. For the first half, smokable products segment adjusted operating companies income grew 7.2%.
As I mentioned, the smokable segment's results were negatively impacted by California's $2 per pack cigarette excise tax increase, which went into effect on April 1. California is a high-volume state, previously accounting for approximately 7% of total U.S. cigarette industry volume. Following the tax increase, California's volume contribution dropped to 5%, which drove total U.S. industry volume down approximately 4.5% in the quarter. In addition, Marlboro has a strong share in California of over 50%. Thus, Marlboro was disproportionately impacted by the tax increase contributing to its decline of 3/10 of a national retail share point in the second quarter to 43.5%. We expect these dynamics will continue to dampen Marlboro's share through the back half. Outside of California, Marlboro's second quarter share remained stable sequentially.
Past experience shows that tax increases of this magnitude are most disruptive immediately following implementation, after which, the rate of decline moderates. We continue to anticipate and approximate 1% negative impact on industry volumes for the full year as a result of the excise tax increases in California on April 1 and Pennsylvania last August.
Looking to the back half of the year, PM USA recently announced the national expansion of Marlboro Black Menthol 72s, a product PM USA expects will further enhance Marlboro's position in the growing menthol segment and among adult smokers aged 21 to 29.
Moving to the smokeless products segment. USSTC has largely rebounded from its first quarter product recall. It delivered 9.8% adjusted operating companies income growth in the second quarter. USSTC grew smokeless products volume 1.4% in the quarter and gained retail share sequentially, growing 6/10 of a share point over the first quarter. USSTC estimates that the recall had about a half of a share point impact on its total retail share in the second quarter.
And Copenhagen continued to gain ground in the second quarter, growing 7/10 of a retail share point to a record share of 34.1%, that was a particularly strong performance as it lapped the Copenhagen Mint national expansion in 2016. Through the first half, Copenhagen remains both the largest and the fastest-growing smokeless tobacco product in the U.S. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 7/10 of a share point in the second quarter, driven by Skoal's 1.4 share point decline. For the first half, combined Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 6/10 of a share point.  
The smokeless products segment delivered 1.6% adjusted operating companies income growth for the first half of 2017 as higher pricing was partially offset by the first quarter recall. Now that the product recall is complete and trade inventories are substantially replenished, USSTC is well positioned moving into the second half of the year.
Finally, an update on our innovative tobacco products' efforts. In e-vapor, Nu Mark's MarkTen brand continues to grow volume and retail share. It is currently the #2 e-vapor brand nationally, with a second quarter national retail market share of approximately 13% in mainstream channels. MarkTen is now present in stores, representing nearly 65% of e-vapor volume in those channels. And amongst stores with MarkTen distribution through the full second quarter, MarkTen's retail share was approximately 24%. We're pleased with MarkTen's progress and Nu Mark plans to continue growing the brand in the back half.
In the heated tobacco, the FDA began its substantive review of Philip Morris International's modified risk tobacco product application for iQOS in late May. The FDA published PMI's executive summary and research summaries to its website for public review and comment, and the agency plans to publish additional sections of the application on a rolling basis. We continue to work closely with PMI throughout the review process. As a reminder, PMI submitted its premarket tobacco product application or iQOS to the FDA on March 31. Our team at PM USA continues to build its U.S. commercialization plans, which we look forward to sharing with you in the future.
I'll wrap up with guidance. Obviously, our business fundamentals remained strong. We continue to expect higher adjusted diluted EPS growth in the second half of the year as some first half headwinds moderate and because the fourth quarter will include equity earnings from our beer investment, whereas the fourth quarter of 2016 did not. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth.
Here's Billy for more details on our performance."

I'll start with the smokeable products segment. As Marty discussed, cigarette industry volumes declined approximately 4.5% in the second quarter, impacted by the significant cigarette excise tax increase in California. The smokeable products segment's reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.9%, moderated by trade inventory movements. When adjusted for these inventory movements, PM USA's cigarette shipment volume was down an estimated 5%. For the first half, cigarette industry volumes declined by an estimated 3.5%. The smokeable products segment's cigarette shipment volume decreased 2.8% on a reported basis. When adjusted for trade inventory movements, PM USA's cigarette shipment volume declined an estimated 4%.
The cigar business continues to perform well, delivering volume growth of 13.1% for the second quarter and 12.7% for the first half of 2017. Smokeable products segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 1.6 percentage points to 51.7% in the second quarter, driven by higher pricing. For the first half, adjusted OCI margins expanded 2.2 percentage points to 51.4%.
In the smokeless products segment, industry volume grew an estimated 1% in the past 6 months. USSTC's reported shipment volume grew 1.4% in the second quarter but declined 1.7% in the first half due to the recall. Smokeless products segment's adjusted OCI margins increased by 7/10 of a percentage point in the quarter to 70%, driven principally by higher pricing, partially offset by higher SG&A spending and unfavorable mix. For the first half, smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins decreased to by 1.1 percentage points, primarily due to the recall, partially offset by higher pricing.
 Looking ahead, we expect to see some impact on the smokeless category from California's excise tax increase on smokeless tobacco products, which went into effect on July 4. California accounts for roughly 4% of U.S. smokeless industry volume and we expect the average price per can in California to increased by over $1 or approximately 25% in the third quarter.
Turning to our alcohol assets. Ste. Michelle faced headwinds in the first half, largely due to trade inventory reductions and increased competitive activity. In recent quarters, we have observed a slowdown in premium wine category growth in measured channels, and the trade ended 2016 with excess inventory of Ste. Michelle products. As the trade reduced their inventories, Ste. Michelle's shipment volume was negatively impacted, down 12.4% for the first half. Ste. Michelle is working closely with its major distributors to manage through this and believes that volume trends will improve in the second half versus the first half.
In beer, adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev were $142 in the second quarter, reflecting AB InBev's first quarter results, which it reported in May. This excludes a $408 million gain related to AB InBev divestitures in the quarter, which were planned as a closing condition of the SABMiller business combination.
I'll wrap up by underscoring our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. First, through the first half of 2017, we paid shareholders nearly $2.4 billion in dividends. Second, we repurchased $1.6 billion in shares, leaving approximately $335 million in the program as of June 30. This week, our board authorized a $1 billion expansion to the share repurchase program. We expect to complete the $4 billion program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items. You'll see that we've included a few additional data points on the discount cigarette category. This is a response to a series of questions we received on that topic.
With that, operator, do we have any questions?"

But if Nielsen is any guide and some of the other public company competitors closures is a guide as well, deep discount has been gaining share already prior to what's happening in California and Pennsylvania. And if that's the case then, Marty, I was just hoping to get your thoughts on why you think we're seeing that dynamic."

The gain in deep discount -- so for reference for people who -- we're referring to the quarterly metrics report where we've put these data in that Billy referenced, and we showed there that the discount category has not grown year-over-year. In fact, it's essentially flat, down 1/10. But there is some difference between the branded discount, which is down 5/10 and deep discount, which is up 4/10, so looks to us like it's basically churned there. I mean, importantly, for us, there does not appear to have any significant effect on Marlboro or in L&M. Indeed, if you look at the share chart in the earnings release, you can see that the discount category for us was actually up 1/10 over the half. Bill can talk about the geographies, but there's no question that when you have a major excise tax increase in the state, some people do trade down.

So the share in Marlboro is down, primarily because of the California effect, but other metrics on Marlboro continue to be strong, its equity is great. As you can see, we've got very good pricing through the first half, Michael. The demographics have stabilized since Marlboro architecture. We just had a massive increase in California. We over indexed in California, and so I think that explains that. A competitive environment, I think we would describe as it's always competitive. It maybe useful for a couple of comments on that. One is, if you think of competitive activity as occurring within, say, a band, it looks to us like the competitive activity remains within the band, although perhaps a bit on the high side of the band. We have some promotional launches and some promotional activity from other competitors, but we monitor that carefully, as you know, and what we basically do is we adjust as we need to adjust. So I think it's pretty steady as she goes, and we're very happy.

But we have seen a pickup, both in volume and in dollar sales in 2017, so I don't know, maybe 8% on volume year-over-year. And then there has been some price mix, as you know. A lot of that is driven by MarkTen, which has really gotten traction with the consumer, and we've put out some share numbers on that today. The other phenomenon that's happening in the category, as I know you know, is there's poly-use. So adult tobacco consumers do shift between segments of the tobacco category, and I think that what you're seeing, as vapor moves up and down, and maybe even MST, as you see people moving among and between those categories. I think those are all factors that go into the growth rate for vapor. And then, of course, when there's new technologies that are put in the market, we find high trial, and that drives some of the growth."

I'd like to take the occasion to congratulate the UST team on such a good job. There was a brief hiatus during the July 4th holiday. Our people have been working very hard in the factory, and we gave them an appropriate July 4th holiday. And there was a short period there where a few more SKUs were not available and we had to limit some orders. But on the whole, the vast majority of the SKUs are at full fulfillment.

Based on strong tobacco operating company performance, Altria delivered solid results in the second quarter and first half of 2017.

Based on strong tobacco operating company performance, Altria delivered solid results in the second quarter and first half of 2017. The smokeable products segment generated strong income growth despite a large cigarette excise tax increase in California and the smokeless products segment has largely rebounded from its first quarter voluntary product recall. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share 4.9% in the second quarter and 3.3% for the first half of 2017.
The smokeable products segment delivered 6.4% adjusted operating companies income growth in the second quarter as strong pricing more than offset volume declines and higher promotional investments. For the first half, smokable products segment adjusted operating companies income grew 7.2%.
As I mentioned, the smokable segment's results were negatively impacted by California's $2 per pack cigarette excise tax increase, which went into effect on April 1. California is a high-volume state, previously accounting for approximately 7% of total U.S. cigarette industry volume. Following the tax increase, California's volume contribution dropped to 5%, which drove total U.S. industry volume down approximately 4.5% in the quarter. In addition, Marlboro has a strong share in California of over 50%. Thus, Marlboro was disproportionately impacted by the tax increase contributing to its decline of 3/10 of a national retail share point in the second quarter to 43.5%. We expect these dynamics will continue to dampen Marlboro's share through the back half. Outside of California, Marlboro's second quarter share remained stable sequentially.
Past experience shows that tax increases of this magnitude are most disruptive immediately following implementation, after which, the rate of decline moderates. We continue to anticipate and approximate 1% negative impact on industry volumes for the full year as a result of the excise tax increases in California on April 1 and Pennsylvania last August.
Looking to the back half of the year, PM USA recently announced the national expansion of Marlboro Black Menthol 72s, a product PM USA expects will further enhance Marlboro's position in the growing menthol segment and among adult smokers aged 21 to 29.
Moving to the smokeless products segment. USSTC has largely rebounded from its first quarter product recall. It delivered 9.8% adjusted operating companies income growth in the second quarter. USSTC grew smokeless products volume 1.4% in the quarter and gained retail share sequentially, growing 6/10 of a share point over the first quarter. USSTC estimates that the recall had about a half of a share point impact on its total retail share in the second quarter.
And Copenhagen continued to gain ground in the second quarter, growing 7/10 of a retail share point to a record share of 34.1%, that was a particularly strong performance as it lapped the Copenhagen Mint national expansion in 2016. Through the first half, Copenhagen remains both the largest and the fastest-growing smokeless tobacco product in the U.S. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 7/10 of a share point in the second quarter, driven by Skoal's 1.4 share point decline. For the first half, combined Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 6/10 of a share point.  
The smokeless products segment delivered 1.6% adjusted operating companies income growth for the first half of 2017 as higher pricing was partially offset by the first quarter recall. Now that the product recall is complete and trade inventories are substantially replenished, USSTC is well positioned moving into the second half of the year.
Finally, an update on our innovative tobacco products' efforts. In e-vapor, Nu Mark's MarkTen brand continues to grow volume and retail share. It is currently the #2 e-vapor brand nationally, with a second quarter national retail market share of approximately 13% in mainstream channels. MarkTen is now present in stores, representing nearly 65% of e-vapor volume in those channels. And amongst stores with MarkTen distribution through the full second quarter, MarkTen's retail share was approximately 24%. We're pleased with MarkTen's progress and Nu Mark plans to continue growing the brand in the back half.
In the heated tobacco, the FDA began its substantive review of Philip Morris International's modified risk tobacco product application for iQOS in late May. The FDA published PMI's executive summary and research summaries to its website for public review and comment, and the agency plans to publish additional sections of the application on a rolling basis. We continue to work closely with PMI throughout the review process. As a reminder, PMI submitted its premarket tobacco product application or iQOS to the FDA on March 31. Our team at PM USA continues to build its U.S. commercialization plans, which we look forward to sharing with you in the future.
I'll wrap up with guidance. Obviously, our business fundamentals remained strong. We continue to expect higher adjusted diluted EPS growth in the second half of the year as some first half headwinds moderate and because the fourth quarter will include equity earnings from our beer investment, whereas the fourth quarter of 2016 did not. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth.
Here's Billy for more details on our performance."
296308,408645124,1256394,"Altria Group, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the smokeable products segment. As Marty discussed, cigarette industry volumes declined approximately 4.5% in the second quarter, impacted by the significant cigarette excise tax increase in Calif",638,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the smokeable products segment. As Marty discussed, cigarette industry volumes declined approximately 4.5% in the second quarter, impacted by the significant cigarette excise tax increase in California. The smokeable products segment's reported cigarette shipment volume declined 2.9%, moderated by trade inventory movements. When adjusted for these inventory movements, PM USA's cigarette shipment volume was down an estimated 5%. For the first half, cigarette industry volumes declined by an estimated 3.5%. The smokeable products segment's cigarette shipment volume decreased 2.8% on a reported basis. When adjusted for trade inventory movements, PM USA's cigarette shipment volume declined an estimated 4%.
The cigar business continues to perform well, delivering volume growth of 13.1% for the second quarter and 12.7% for the first half of 2017. Smokeable products segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 1.6 percentage points to 51.7% in the second quarter, driven by higher pricing. For the first half, adjusted OCI margins expanded 2.2 percentage points to 51.4%.
In the smokeless products segment, industry volume grew an estimated 1% in the past 6 months. USSTC's reported shipment volume grew 1.4% in the second quarter but declined 1.7% in the first half due to the recall. Smokeless products segment's adjusted OCI margins increased by 7/10 of a percentage point in the quarter to 70%, driven principally by higher pricing, partially offset by higher SG&A spending and unfavorable mix. For the first half, smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins decreased to by 1.1 percentage points, primarily due to the recall, partially offset by higher pricing.
 Looking ahead, we expect to see some impact on the smokeless category from California's excise tax increase on smokeless tobacco products, which went into effect on July 4. California accounts for roughly 4% of U.S. smokeless industry volume and we expect the average price per can in California to increase by over $1 or approximately 25% in the third quarter.
Turning to our alcohol assets. Ste. Michelle faced headwinds in the first half, largely due to trade inventory reductions and increased competitive activity. In recent quarters, we have observed a slowdown in premium wine category growth in measured channels, and the trade ended 2016 with excess inventory of Ste. Michelle products. As the trade reduced their inventories, Ste. Michelle's shipment volume was negatively impacted, down 12.4% for the first half. Ste. Michelle is working closely with its major distributors to manage through this and believes that volume trends will improve in the second half versus the first half.
In beer, adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev were $142 in the second quarter, reflecting AB InBev's first quarter results, which it reported in May. This excludes a $408 million gain related to AB InBev divestitures in the quarter, which were planned as a closing condition of the SABMiller business combination.
I'll wrap up by underscoring our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. First, through the first half of 2017, we paid shareholders nearly $2.4 billion in dividends. Second, we repurchased $1.6 billion in shares, leaving approximately $335 million in the program as of June 30. This week, our board authorized a $1 billion expansion to the share repurchase program. We expect to complete the $4 billion program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items. You'll see that we've included a few additional data points on the discount cigarette category. This is a response to a series of questions we received on that topic.
With that, operator, do we have any questions?"

And if that's the case then, Marty, I was just hoping to get your thoughts on why you think we're seeing that dynamic."

The gain in deep discount -- so for reference for people who -- we're referring to the quarterly metrics report where we've put these data in that Billy referenced, and we showed there that the discount category has not grown year-over-year. In fact, it's essentially flat, down 1/10. But there is some difference between the branded discount, which is down 5/10 and deep discount, which is up 4/10, so looks to us like it's basically churned there. I mean, importantly, for us, there does not appear to have any significant effect on Marlboro or in L&M. Indeed, if you look at the share chart in the earnings release, you can see that the discount category for us was actually up 1/10 over the half. Bill can talk about the geographies, but there's no question that when you have a major excise tax increase in the state, some people do trade down. I don't know, Billy, do you want to talk about discount?"

I think what you maybe getting at, though, that there is a segment of consumers in our category who will go into the store and ask the clerk for the lowest-priced brand, and they may be picking up some share there. But again, it appears to be coming at out of, perhaps, the branded discount segment without -- certainly no effect on our brands, and we don't see it in premium, generally. I hope that's helpful."

So the share in Marlboro is down, primarily because of the California effect, but other metrics on Marlboro continue to be strong, its equity is great. As you can see, we've got very good pricing through the first half, Michael. The demographics have stabilized since Marlboro architecture. We just had a massive increase in California. We over indexed in California, and so I think that explains that. A competitive environment, I think we would describe as it's always competitive. It may be useful for a couple of comments on that. One is, if you think of competitive activity as occurring within, say, a band, it looks to us like the competitive activity remains within the band, although perhaps a bit on the high side of the band. We have some promotional launches and some promotional activity from other competitors, but we monitor that carefully, as you know, and what we basically do is we adjust as we need to adjust. So I think it's pretty steady as she goes, and we're very happy.

A lot of that is driven by MarkTen, which has really gotten traction with the consumer, and we've put out some share numbers on that today. The other phenomenon that's happening in the category, as I know you know, is there's poly-use. So adult tobacco consumers do shift between segments of the tobacco category, and I think that what you're seeing, as vapor moves up and down, and maybe even MST, as you see people moving among and between those categories. I think those are all factors that go into the growth rate for vapor.

I'd like to take the occasion to congratulate the UST team on such a good job. There was a brief hiatus during the July 4th holiday. Our people have been working very hard in the factory, and we gave them an appropriate July 4th holiday. And there was a short period there where a few more SKUs were not available and we had to limit some orders. But on the whole, the vast majority of the SKUs are at full fulfillment. And as you can see from the numbers in the second quarter by the smokeless team, I think they've done a very good job.

Altria delivered outstanding financial performance in the third quarter contributing to a strong first 9 months of 2017. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share of 9.8% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first",1029,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Altria delivered outstanding financial performance in the third quarter contributing to a strong first 9 months of 2017. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share of 9.8% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first 9 months. As we expected, our earnings growth is accelerating as we move through the second half of the year.
We continue to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase as Billy will describe in more detail, and in August, our Board of Directors approved to increase our quarterly dividend by 8.2%, and that's the 51st increase in the past 48 years.
Our core tobacco businesses were the primary drivers of our earnings growth. In the quarter, the smokeable products segment delivered 7.7%, adjusted operating company's income growth, a strong pricing and lower cost more than offset volume declines.  For the first 9 months, smokeable products segment adjusted operating company's income grew 7.4%. 
Reported cigarette volumes were challenged in the quarter due to the industry's rate of decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines and 1 fewer shipping day. We're very pleased with the financial performance in the smokeable segment. Our strategy continues to be to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro and Black and Mild over the long term.
As you know, we view momentum has continued the strength across various been metrics, including equity, demographics, profitability and retail share. Marlboro continues to have category leading equity, strong demographics and is, of course, highly profitable.
As for retail share, Marlboro declined by 0.5 a point to 43.2% in the quarter and 0.3 for the first 9 months to 43.4%, so let's look at what's happening here beginning with California.
As we described in the second quarter call, we expected the dynamics related to the California $2 per pack SCT increase to dampen Marlboro share through the back half and that's continuing to happen. You are familiar with Marlboro's over-indexed share in California at over 50%, and Marlboro thus continue to experience disproportionate share impact during this period due to the SEC increase -- SCT increase. Second, there was elevated competitive activity in the quarter, including high levels of promotional spending and a competitive brand launch. In fact, there have been 5 such launches by major competitors this year, many with multiple packings behind them. Those launches and the promotional resources accompanying them have increased the short-term share pressure on Marlboro at the share leader. 
Share performance is best measured over years, not quarters, of course, but it's important to understand that PM USA is addressing Marlboro's recent share declines. First, it is reallocating certain marketing resources, including in California. These have included changes to promotional resources and product expansions. For example, PM USA has revised its retail trade programs to focus retailers on the profitability of Marlboro brings to their stores. In this process, PM USA has reallocated resources from underperforming retail program options to promotions that support maintaining Marlboro's leadership position.
Second, PM USA recently announced the expansion of Marlboro Black label in California and Washington state. Marlboro Black label features the latest in Marlboro's packaging innovation, its exclusive soft touch technology. We expect these actions to help stabilize Marlboro share while staying on strategy to maximize income. Look for more product news from PM USA at our investor day next week.
Moving to the smokeless product segment. USSTC delivered outstanding adjusted operating company's income growth of 15.7% in the third quarter as higher net pricing and lower costs more than offset lower shipment volume. The smokeless product segment delivered 6.3% adjusted operating company's income growth for the first 9 months of 2017.
Copenhagen's retail share grew 0.2 to 33.9% in the third quarter, and by 0.6 for the first 9 months to 33.6%. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 1.2 share points in the third quarter, and 0.9 for the first 9 months driven by Skoal declines. These results reflect USSTC's continued focus on growing Copenhagen while refining its goal investments to enhance its profitability.
In e-vapor, Nu Mark grew MarkTen's third quarter volume by more than 50%, driven by expanded distribution and category growth. MarkTen had a third quarter national retail share of approximately 13.5% in mainstream channels. And Nu Mark recently announced plans to expand the distribution of MarkTen Gold to approximately 15,000 additional stores in the fourth quarter.
In heated tobacco, the team at PM USA has made significant progress on its commercialization plans for iQOS, which we're excited to share with you next week at our Investor Day.
Another focus of our investor day will be the regulatory environment. As everyone knows, in July, FDA announced its comprehensive plan for U.S. tobacco in nicotine regulation. FDA stated its belief that this approach will strike an appropriate balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes. We're encouraged by this important evolution in the agency's stance on innovation, having long advocated for a comprehensive regulatory policy that acknowledges the continuum of risk.  We also support FDA's stated intention to issue regulations, outlining what information it expects to be included in product applications and in reports to demonstrate substantial equivalence. 
Obviously, establishing the rules before any decisions are taken is simple regulatory fairness. And we further support Commissioner Gotlieb's direction to the Center for tobacco products to reconsider its approach to substantial equivalence for provisional products, a process we previously have described as increasingly onerous and expensive. 
Finally, FDA also stated this intention to explore a product standard relating to nicotine, a possibility since the act became a law in 2009, and for which PM USA has been preparing. As the FDA itself of knowledge, developing such a standard will be a long and complex process by requiring significant stakeholder comment an engagement, and again, we'll say more about all this next week.
In summary, we're very pleased with our performance through what's been a challenging 9 months. Thus, we reaffirm our 2017 full year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth. And here's Billy for more detail on our performance."

Cigarette industry volumes declined an estimated 3.5% in the third quarter. The smokeable products segments reported cigarette shipment volume declined by 6.2%, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines and 1 fewer shipping day. When adjusted for inventory movements and calendar differences, PM USA's signature been volume declined by an estimated 4.5%. The better look is probably the first 9 months, where industry cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 3.5% and PM USA's cigarette shipment volumes decreased 4% from both the reported and adjusted basis.
The cigar business continues to perform extremely well, delivering volume growth of 6.6% in the third quarter and 10.6% for the first 9 months. Smokeable segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 4.5 percentage points to 52.2% in the third quarter, driven by higher pricing and lower SG&A and resolution expense. The favorable cost comparison is driven in part by California ballot spending in the year ago period and NPM-related credits booked in this quarter.
For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI margins expanded by 3 percentage points to 51.6%.
In the smokeless products segment, industry volume grew by an estimated 0.5% over the past 6 months. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its adjusted smokeless products shipment volume declined by 3% in the third quarter and 1.5% for the first 9 months. 
Smokeless products segment's adjusted OCI margins increased by 6.8 percentage points in the quarter to 70.3%, driven primarily by higher net pricing and lower cost, partially offset by unfavorable mix. For the first 9 months, smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 1.6 percentage points to 67.7%, primarily due to higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix.
Turning to our alcohol assets. Wine segment adjusted OCI declined 5.3% in the quarter, due primarily to higher costs. Ste. Michelle's volume trends that improved in the third quarter relative to the first half and were essentially unchanged compared to the year ago level. 
In beer, third quarter adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev were $203 million, reflecting AB InBev second quarter results which are reported in July.
I'll wrap up by highlighting our cash returns to shareholders. Through the first 9 months of 2017, we paid shareholders more than $3.5 billion in dividends and increased the dividend in August. We repurchased nearly $2.4 billion in shares, leaving $576 million in the program as of September 30. We expect to complete the program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release, and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items. With that, operator, do we have any questions?"

So we've discussed recently, Chris, that elasticity, with respect to cigarettes, and we've had the big before like the one that we've experienced in California. And what happens is, as you know, there's an immediate disruption, and you get a deep decline. And then it comes back to the curve that we've observed over the years, which is about negative 0.3. So a lot of it depends on how big the shock yes. California is $2 a pack, after not having had an increase for decades, really. So it's coming back. We expect it'll come back to where it is on the curve, and we see some improvement there. But it's going to take some time -- it was a big shock to the system. And you see that in the numbers, I think. So in Marlboro -- we're very pleased actually with Marlboro's product pipeline. You see that what we try to do is we try to bring out SKUs to the market where we think that there's a niche, where Marlboro can gain some business from competitive the smokers. We're also frankly, trying to create news in the marketplace about Marlboro to keep its momentum moving forward, and so we're going to talk about this next week. And I mentioned, I think, Black label already in the remarks."

And so when you look at back at Marlboro shares, we don't decompose it down to the SKU level, despite I know there's quite a lot of interest in that -- we don't do it for competitive reasons. But if we go back to Marlboro share gains, for example, during the period, 2011 through 2016, we actually gained ahead of what the historical rate has been been. It was about 1.7 percentage points of share gain. And you can see in the first 9 months, we've given back about 0.3. So I think the reasons are pretty straightforward, it is California for the reasons we just finished discussing. There were all these competitive launches and then I think there is a market dynamic change, which is -- because of the industry consolidation, there are very few brands left, frankly, that don't have market support on them. So Marlboro used to gain share by picking up some of the share from those unprotected brands as with other competitive brands, that's the market dynamic change. But overall, I think we're on the strategy, particularly when you see the income performance. So we'll talk more about the Marlboro brand family next week. We just don't break it down -- sort of at the level that you're asking. I hope you can appreciate that."

I don't want to put you off on your question but I'll give you a high-level sort of a lead-in, if you will. There's quite a lot to do, obviously, seen of any nicotine a standard or any other standard, for that matter, wherever it will be implemented. There has to be science and evidence-based, and in the nicotine area, there's a lot of science that would have to be answered, so let me just call out a few for instance. So I think folks are going to have to understand how consumers might react to a nicotine standard, and including the question of whether compensation would occur, because the -- obviously, from the public health point of view, we wouldn't want people smoking more cigarettes to get their nicotine. There is no standard that is currently developed with respect to what the level should be, or where it should be measured -- is it in the aerosol or is in the filler? How would be permitted?  with the pace in time, what we've done more limited basis. So those are the question that would have to be answered that are not answered yet. The government has researched going on that in that regard. As you might expect, we -- our scientists are fully engaged in all the scientific questions, both tracking government research, as well as -- doing our own research so that we are fully informed on this. There are be questions around technical achievability, which is an area that you're asking about. Now the possibility of a standard of nicotine has been a statute since 2009, so it won't surprise anyone to know that we have been looking at ways that we might need any potential standard. You can look at product design, you can look at tobacco lead treatments, you can look at tobacco seed technologies, most of which are proprietary, so I won't comment beyond them, but I think people should be assured that we have been looking at this. And then finally, I think another area that that's going to be wrestled with, is what about the intended consequence of it if the standard comes in. We don't have to make sure that the market still works. So as you can tell, just from that high-level description, there's quite a lot that has to be wrestled around and again, we'll talk more about that next week."

We continue to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase as Billy will describe in more detail. And in August, our Board of Directors voted to increase our dividend quarterly by 8.2% and that's the 51st increase in the past 48 years.
Our core tobacco businesses were the primary drivers of our earnings growth. In the quarter, the smokeable products segment delivered 7.7% adjusted operating company's income growth, a strong pricing and lower cost more than offset volume declines.  For the first 9 months, smokeable products segment adjusted operating company's income grew 7.4%. 
Reported cigarette volumes were challenged in the quarter due to the industry's rate of decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines and one fewer shipping day. We're very pleased with the financial performance in the smokeable segment. Our strategy continues to be to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro and Black & Mild over the long term.
As you know, we view momentum has continued the strength across various brand metrics including equity, demographics, profitability and retail share. Marlboro continues to have category-leading equity, strong demographics and is, of course, highly profitable.
As for retail share, Marlboro declined by 0.5 share point to 43.2% in the quarter and 0.3 for the first 9 months to 43.4%. So let's look at what's happening here beginning with California.
As we described in the second quarter call, we expected the dynamics related to the California $2 per pack SET increase to dampen Marlboro share through the back half and that's continuing to happen. You are familiar with Marlboro's over-indexed share in California at over 50%, and Marlboro thus continues to experience disproportionate share impact during this period due to the SEC increase -- SET increase. Second, there was elevated competitive activity in the quarter, including high levels of promotional spending and a competitive brand launch. In fact, there have been 5 such launches by major competitors this year, many with multiple packings behind them. Those launches and the promotional resources accompanying them have increased the short-term share pressure on Marlboro as the share leader. 
Share performance is best measured over years, not quarters, of course, but it's important to understand that PM USA is addressing Marlboro's recent share declines. First, it is reallocating certain marketing resources, including in California. These have included changes to promotional resources and product expansions. For example, PM USA has revised its retail trade programs to focus retailers on the profitability Marlboro brings to their stores. In this process, PM USA has reallocated resources from underperforming retail program options to promotions that support maintaining Marlboro's leadership position.
Second, PM USA recently announced the expansion of Marlboro black label in California and Washington state. Marlboro black label features the latest in Marlboro's packaging innovation, it's exclusive, soft-touch technology. We expect these actions to help stabilize Marlboro share while staying on strategy to maximize income. Look for more product news from PM USA at our Investor Day next week.
Moving to the smokeless product segment. USSTC delivered outstanding adjusted operating company's income growth of 15.7% in the third quarter as higher net pricing and lower costs more than offset lower shipment volume. The smokeless product segment delivered 6.3% adjusted operating company's income growth for the first 9 months of 2017.
Copenhagen's retail share grew 0.2 to 33.9% in the third quarter and by 0.6 for the first 9 months to 33.6%. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 1.2 share points in the third quarter and 0.9 for the first 9 months, driven by Skoal declines. These results reflect USSTC's continued focus on growing Copenhagen while refining Skoal investments to enhance its profitability.
In e-vapor, Nu Mark grew MarkTen's third quarter volume by more than 50%, driven by expanded distribution and category growth. MarkTen had a third quarter national retail share of approximately 13.5% in mainstream channels. And Nu Mark recently announced plans to expand the distribution of MarkTen Bold to approximately 15,000 additional stores in the fourth quarter.
In heated tobacco, the team at PM USA has made significant progress on its commercialization plans for iQOS, which we're excited to share with you next week at our Investor Day.
Another focus of our Investor Day will be the regulatory environment. As everyone knows, in July, FDA announced its comprehensive plan for U.S. tobacco in nicotine regulation. FDA stated its belief that this approach will strike an appropriate balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes. We're encouraged by this important evolution in the agency's stance on innovation, having long advocated for a comprehensive regulatory policy that acknowledges the continuum of risk. We also support FDA's stated intention to issue regulations, outlining what information it expects to be included in product applications and in reports to demonstrate substantial equivalence. 
Obviously, establishing the rules before any decisions are taken is simple regulatory fairness. And we further support Commissioner Gotlieb's direction to the Center for Tobacco Products to reconsider its approach to substantial equivalence for provisional products, a process we previously have described as increasingly onerous and expensive. 
Finally, FDA also stated its intention to explore a product standard relating to nicotine, a possibility since the act became law in 2009 and for which PM USA has been preparing. As the FDA itself acknowledge, developing such a standard will be a long and complex process requiring significant stakeholder comment and engagement. And again, we'll say more about all this next week.
In summary, we're very pleased with our performance through what's been a challenging 9 months. Thus, we reaffirm our 2017 full year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth. And here's Billy for more detail on our performance."

Cigarette industry volumes declined an estimated 3.5% in the third quarter. The smokeable products segments reported cigarette shipment volume declined by 6.2%, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines and one fewer shipping day. When adjusted for inventory movements and calendar differences, PM USA's cigarettes shipment volume declined by an estimated 4.5%. The better look is probably the first 9 months where industry cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 3.5% and PM USA's cigarettes shipment volume decreased 4% on both the reported and adjusted basis.
The cigar business continues to perform extremely well, delivering volume growth of 6.6% in the third quarter and 10.6% for the first 9 months. Smokeable segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 4.5 percentage points to 52.2% in the third quarter, driven by higher pricing and lower SG&A and resolution expense. The favorable cost comparison is driven in part by California ballot spending in the year-ago period and NPM-related credits booked in this quarter. For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI margins expanded by 3 percentage points to 51.6%.
In the smokeless products segment, industry volume grew by an estimated 0.5% over the past 6 months. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its adjusted smokeless products shipment volume declined by 3% in the third quarter and 1.5% for the first 9 months. 
Smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins increased by 6.8 percentage points in the quarter to 70.3%, driven primarily by higher net pricing and lower cost, partially offset by unfavorable mix. For the first 9 months, smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 1.6 percentage points to 67.7%, primarily due to higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix.
Turning to our alcohol assets. Wine segment adjusted OCI declined 5.3% in the quarter due primarily to higher cost. Ste. Michelle's volume trends improved in the third quarter relative to the first half and were essentially unchanged compared to the year-ago level. 
In beer, third quarter adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev were $203 million, reflecting AB InBev second quarter results, which it reported in July.
I'll wrap up by highlighting our cash returns to shareholders. Through the first 9 months of 2017, we paid shareholders more than $3.5 billion in dividends and increased the dividend in August. We repurchased nearly $2.4 billion in shares, leaving $576 million in the program as of September 30. We expect to complete the program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.
With that, operator, do we have any questions?"

So we've discussed previously, Chris, the elasticities with respect to cigarettes, and we've had big jolts before like the one that we've experienced in California. And what happens is, as you know, there's an immediate disruption and you get a deep decline. And then it comes back to the curve that we've observed over the years, which is about negative 0.3. So a lot of it depends on how big the shock is. California, $2 a pack after not having had an increase for decades really. So it's coming back. We expect it'll come back to where it is on the curve, and we see some improvement there. But it's going to take some time. It was a big shock to the system, and you see that in the numbers, I think. So on Marlboro, we're very pleased actually with Marlboro's product pipeline. You see that what we try to do is we try to bring out SKUs to the market, where we think that there's a niche where Marlboro can gain some business from competitive smokers. We're also, frankly, trying to create news in the marketplace about Marlboro to keep its momentum moving forward. And so we're going to talk about this next week.

But if we go back to Marlboro share gains, for example, during the period 2011 through 2016, we actually gained ahead of what the historical rate had been. It was about 1.7 percentage points of share gain. And you can see in the first 9 months, we've given back about 0.3. So I think the reasons are pretty straightforward. It is California for the reasons we just finished discussing. There were all these competitive launches. And then I think there is a market dynamic change, which is -- because of the industry consolidation, there are very few brands left, frankly, that don't have marketing support on them. So Marlboro used to gain share by picking up some of the share from those unprotected brands as did other competitive brands, that's the market dynamic change. But overall, I think we're on strategy, particularly when you see the income performance. So we'll talk more about the Marlboro brand family next week.

And so PMI, with our assistance, is getting ready for all those things and we are working really hard to be ready so that when that authorization comes, as we hope it does, that we can get to market quickly.

So I don't want to put you off on your question, but I'll give you a high level sort of a lead-in, if you will. There's quite a lot to do, obviously, as you know of any nicotine standard or any other standard, for that matter, wherever to be implemented, there has to be science and evidence-based. And in the nicotine area, there's a lot of science that would have to be answered, so let me just call out a few for instance. So I think folks are going to have to understand how consumers might react to a nicotine standard, including the question of whether compensation would occur because you, obviously, from the public health point of view, wouldn't want people smoking more cigarettes to get their nicotine. There is no standard that is currently developed with respect to what the level should be or where it should be measured. Is it in the aerosol or is in the filler? How would it be implemented, would it be phased in time or would it be done more immediate basis? So those are the questions which have to be answered that are not answered yet. The government has research going on in that regard. As you might expect, we -- our scientists are fully engaged in all the scientific questions, both tracking government research as well as doing our own research so that we're fully informed on those. There are big questions around technical achievability, which is an area that you're asking about. Now the possibility of a standard about nicotine has been in the statute since 2009, so it won't surprise anyone to know that we have been looking at ways that we might need any potential standard. You can look at product design, you can look at tobacco leaf treatments, you can look at tobacco seed technologies, most of which are proprietary, so I won't comment beyond them. But I think people should be assured that we have been looking at this. And then, finally, I think another area that's going to have to be wrestled with is what about our intended consequences of a standard comes in. We have got to make sure that the market still works. So as you can tell, just from that high-level description, there's quite a lot that has to be wrestled around and, again, we'll talk more about that next week."

Altria delivered outstanding financial performance in the third quarter contributing to a strong first 9 months of 2017. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share of 9.8% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first 9 months. As we expected, our earnings growth is accelerating as we move through the second half of the year.
We continue to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase as Billy will describe in more detail. And in August, our Board of Directors voted to increase our dividend quarterly by 8.2% and that's the 51st increase in the past 48 years.
Our core tobacco businesses were the primary drivers of our earnings growth. In the quarter, the smokeable products segment delivered 7.7% adjusted operating company's income growth, as strong pricing and lower cost more than offset volume declines.  For the first 9 months, smokeable products segment adjusted operating company's income grew 7.4%. 
Reported cigarette volumes were challenged in the quarter due to the industry's rate of decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines and one fewer shipping day. We're very pleased with the financial performance in the smokeable segment. Our strategy continues to be to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro and Black & Mild over the long term.
As you know, we view momentum as continued strength across various brand metrics including equity, demographics, profitability and retail share. Marlboro continues to have category-leading equity, strong demographics and is, of course, highly profitable.
As for retail share, Marlboro declined by 0.5 share point to 43.2% in the quarter and 0.3 for the first 9 months to 43.4%. So let's look at what's happening here beginning with California.
As we described in the second quarter call, we expected the dynamics related to the California $2 per pack SET increase to dampen Marlboro share through the back half and that's continuing to happen. You are familiar with Marlboro's over-indexed share in California at over 50%, and Marlboro thus continues to experience disproportionate share impact during this period due to the SEC increase -- SET increase. Second, there was elevated competitive activity in the quarter, including high levels of promotional spending and a competitive brand launch. In fact, there have been 5 such launches by major competitors this year, many with multiple packings behind them. Those launches and the promotional resources accompanying them have increased the short-term share pressure on Marlboro as the share leader. 
Share performance is best measured over years, not quarters, of course, but it's important to understand that PM USA is addressing Marlboro's recent share declines. First, it is reallocating certain marketing resources, including in California. These have included changes to promotional resources and product expansions. For example, PM USA has revised its retail trade programs to focus retailers on the profitability Marlboro brings to their stores. In this process, PM USA has reallocated resources from underperforming retail program options to promotions that support maintaining Marlboro's leadership position.
Second, PM USA recently announced the expansion of Marlboro black label in California and Washington state. Marlboro black label features the latest in Marlboro's packaging innovation, it's exclusive, soft-touch technology. We expect these actions to help stabilize Marlboro share while staying on strategy to maximize income. Look for more product news from PM USA at our Investor Day next week.
Moving to the smokeless product segment. USSTC delivered outstanding adjusted operating company's income growth of 15.7% in the third quarter as higher net pricing and lower costs more than offset lower shipment volume. The smokeless product segment delivered 6.3% adjusted operating company's income growth for the first 9 months of 2017.
Copenhagen's retail share grew 0.2 to 33.9% in the third quarter and by 0.6 for the first 9 months to 33.6%. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 1.2 share points in the third quarter and 0.9 for the first 9 months, driven by Skoal declines. These results reflect USSTC's continued focus on growing Copenhagen while refining Skoal investments to enhance its profitability.
In e-vapor, Nu Mark grew MarkTen's third quarter volume by more than 50%, driven by expanded distribution and category growth. MarkTen had a third quarter national retail share of approximately 13.5% in mainstream channels. And Nu Mark recently announced plans to expand the distribution of MarkTen Bold to approximately 15,000 additional stores in the fourth quarter.
In heated tobacco, the team at PM USA has made significant progress on its commercialization plans for iQOS, which we're excited to share with you next week at our Investor Day.
Another focus of our Investor Day will be the regulatory environment. As everyone knows, in July, FDA announced its comprehensive plan for U.S. tobacco in nicotine regulation. FDA stated its belief that this approach will strike an appropriate balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes. We're encouraged by this important evolution in the agency's stance on innovation, having long advocated for a comprehensive regulatory policy that acknowledges the continuum of risk. We also support FDA's stated intention to issue regulations, outlining what information it expects to be included in product applications and in reports to demonstrate substantial equivalence. 
Obviously, establishing the rules before any decisions are taken is simple regulatory fairness. And we further support Commissioner Gotlieb's direction to the Center for Tobacco Products to reconsider its approach to substantial equivalence for provisional products, a process we previously have described as increasingly onerous and expensive. 
Finally, FDA also stated its intention to explore a product standard relating to nicotine, a possibility since the act became law in 2009 and for which PM USA has been preparing. As the FDA itself acknowledge, developing such a standard will be a long and complex process requiring significant stakeholder comment and engagement. And again, we'll say more about all this next week.
In summary, we're very pleased with our performance through what's been a challenging 9 months. Thus, we reaffirm our 2017 full year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth. And here's Billy for more detail on our performance."

Cigarette industry volumes declined an estimated 3.5% in the third quarter. The smokeable products segments reported cigarette shipment volume declined by 6.2%, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines and one fewer shipping day. When adjusted for inventory movements and calendar differences, PM USA's cigarettes shipment volume declined by an estimated 4.5%. The better look is probably the first 9 months where industry cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 3.5% and PM USA's cigarettes shipment volume decreased 4% on both a reported and adjusted basis.
The cigar business continues to perform extremely well, delivering volume growth of 6.6% in the third quarter and 10.6% for the first 9 months. Smokeable segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 4.5 percentage points to 52.2% in the third quarter, driven by higher pricing and lower SG&A and resolution expense. The favorable cost comparison is driven in part by California ballot spending in the year-ago period and NPM-related credits booked in this quarter. For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI margins expanded by 3 percentage points to 51.6%.
In the smokeless products segment, industry volume grew by an estimated 0.5% over the past 6 months. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its adjusted smokeless products shipment volume declined by 3% in the third quarter and 1.5% for the first 9 months. 
Smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins increased by 6.8 percentage points in the quarter to 70.3%, driven primarily by higher net pricing and lower cost, partially offset by unfavorable mix. For the first 9 months, smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 1.6 percentage points to 67.7%, primarily due to higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix.
Turning to our alcohol assets. Wine segment adjusted OCI declined 5.3% in the quarter due primarily to higher cost. Ste. Michelle's volume trends improved in the third quarter relative to the first half and were essentially unchanged compared to the year-ago level. 
In beer, third quarter adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev were $203 million, reflecting AB InBev second quarter results, which it reported in July.
I'll wrap up by highlighting our cash returns to shareholders. Through the first 9 months of 2017, we paid shareholders more than $3.5 billion in dividends and increased the dividend in August. We repurchased nearly $2.4 billion in shares, leaving $576 million in the program as of September 30. We expect to complete the program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.
With that, operator, do we have any questions?"

So we've discussed previously, Chris, the elasticities with respect to cigarettes, and we've had big jolts before like the one that we've experienced in California. And what happens is, as you know, there's an immediate disruption and you get a deep decline. And then it comes back to the curve that we've observed over the years, which is about negative 0.3. So a lot of it depends on how big the shock is. California, $2 a pack after not having had an increase for decades really. So it's coming back. We expect it'll come back to where it is on the curve, and we see some improvement there. But it's going to take some time. It was a big shock to the system, and you see that in the numbers, I think. So on Marlboro, we're very pleased actually with Marlboro's product pipeline. You see that what we try to do is we try to bring out SKUs to the market, where we think that there's a niche where Marlboro can gain some business from competitive smokers. We're also, frankly, trying to create news in the marketplace about Marlboro to keep its momentum moving forward. And so we're going to talk about this next week.

And so when we look at back at Marlboro shares, we don't decompose it down to the SKU level despite I know there's quite a lot of interest in that, we don't do it for competitive reasons. But if we go back to Marlboro share gains, for example, during the period 2011 through 2016, we actually gained ahead of what the historical rate had been. It was about 1.7 percentage points of share gain. And you can see in the first 9 months, we've given back about 0.3. So I think the reasons are pretty straightforward. It is California for the reasons we just finished discussing. There were all these competitive launches. And then I think there is a market dynamic change, which is -- because of the industry consolidation, there are very few brands left, frankly, that don't have marketing support on them. So Marlboro used to gain share by picking up some of the share from those unprotected brands as did other competitive brands, that's the market dynamic change. But overall, I think we're on strategy, particularly when you see the income performance. So we'll talk more about the Marlboro brand family next week.

And so PMI, with our assistance, is getting ready for all those things and we are working really hard to be ready so that when that authorization comes, as we hope it does, that we can get to market quickly. But I think your understanding of the process is correct, and I don't really have anything new to add except, perhaps, the possibility of a TPSAC hearing should they announce one."

So I don't want to put you off on your question, but I'll give you a high level sort of a lead-in, if you will. There's quite a lot to do, obviously, as you know of any nicotine standard or any other standard, for that matter, wherever to be implemented, there has to be science and evidence-based. And in the nicotine area, there's a lot of science that would have to be answered, so let me just call out a few for instance. So I think folks are going to have to understand how consumers might react to a nicotine standard, including the question of whether compensation would occur because you, obviously, from the public health point of view, wouldn't want people smoking more cigarettes to get their nicotine. There is no standard that is currently developed with respect to what the level should be or where it should be measured. Is it in the aerosol or is in the filler? How would it be implemented, would it be phased in time or would it be done more immediate basis? So those are the questions which have to be answered that are not answered yet. The government has research going on in that regard. As you might expect, we -- our scientists are fully engaged in all the scientific questions, both tracking government research as well as doing our own research so that we're fully informed on those. There are big questions around technical achievability, which is an area that you're asking about. Now the possibility of a standard about nicotine has been in the statute since 2009, so it won't surprise anyone to know that we have been looking at ways that we might need any potential standard. You can look at product design, you can look at tobacco leaf treatments, you can look at tobacco seed technologies, most of which are proprietary, so I won't comment beyond them. But I think people should be assured that we have been looking at this. And then, finally, I think another area that's going to have to be wrestled with is what about unintended consequences if a standard comes in. We have got to make sure that the market still works. So as you can tell, just from that high-level description, there's quite a lot that has to be wrestled around and, again, we'll talk more about that next week."

Altria delivered outstanding financial performance in the third quarter contributing to a strong first 9 months of 2017. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share of 9.8% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first",1021,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Altria delivered outstanding financial performance in the third quarter contributing to a strong first 9 months of 2017. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share of 9.8% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first 9 months. As we expected, our earnings growth is accelerating as we move through the second half of the year.
We continue to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase as Billy will describe in more detail. And in August, our Board of Directors voted to increase our dividend quarterly by 8.2% and that's the 51st increase in the past 48 years.
Our core tobacco businesses were the primary drivers of our earnings growth. In the quarter, the smokeable products segment delivered 7.7% adjusted operating company's income growth, as strong pricing and lower cost more than offset volume declines.  For the first 9 months, smokeable products segment adjusted operating company's income grew 7.4%. 
Reported cigarette volumes were challenged in the quarter due to the industry's rate of decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines and one fewer shipping day. We're very pleased with the financial performance in the smokeable segment. Our strategy continues to be to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro and Black & Mild over the long term.
As you know, we view momentum as continued strength across various brand metrics including equity, demographics, profitability and retail share. Marlboro continues to have category-leading equity, strong demographics and is, of course, highly profitable.
As for retail share, Marlboro declined by 0.5 share point to 43.2% in the quarter and 0.3 for the first 9 months to 43.4%. So let's look at what's happening here beginning with California.
As we described in the second quarter call, we expected the dynamics related to the California $2 per pack SET increase to dampen Marlboro share through the back half and that's continuing to happen. You are familiar with Marlboro's over-indexed share in California at over 50%, and Marlboro thus continues to experience disproportionate share impact during this period due to the SEC increase -- SET increase. Second, there was elevated competitive activity in the quarter, including high levels of promotional spending and a competitive brand launch. In fact, there have been 5 such launches by major competitors this year, many with multiple packings behind them. Those launches and the promotional resources accompanying them have increased the short-term share pressure on Marlboro as the share leader. 
Share performance is best measured over years, not quarters, of course, but it's important to understand that PM USA is addressing Marlboro's recent share declines. First, it is reallocating certain marketing resources, including in California. These have included changes to promotional resources and product expansions. For example, PM USA has revised its retail trade programs to focus retailers on the profitability Marlboro brings to their stores. In this process, PM USA has reallocated resources from underperforming retail program options to promotions that support maintaining Marlboro's leadership position.
Second, PM USA recently announced the expansion of Marlboro black label in California and Washington state. Marlboro black label features the latest in Marlboro's packaging innovation, it's exclusive, soft-touch technology. We expect these actions to help stabilize Marlboro share while staying on strategy to maximize income. Look for more product news from PM USA at our Investor Day next week.
Moving to the smokeless product segment. USSTC delivered outstanding adjusted operating company's income growth of 15.7% in the third quarter as higher net pricing and lower costs more than offset lower shipment volume. The smokeless product segment delivered 6.3% adjusted operating company's income growth for the first 9 months of 2017.
Copenhagen's retail share grew 0.2 to 33.9% in the third quarter and by 0.6 for the first 9 months to 33.6%. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 1.2 share points in the third quarter and 0.9 for the first 9 months, driven by Skoal declines. These results reflect USSTC's continued focus on growing Copenhagen while refining Skoal investments to enhance its profitability.
In e-vapor, Nu Mark grew MarkTen's third quarter volume by more than 50%, driven by expanded distribution and category growth. MarkTen had a third quarter national retail share of approximately 13.5% in mainstream channels. And Nu Mark recently announced plans to expand the distribution of MarkTen Bold to approximately 15,000 additional stores in the fourth quarter.
In heated tobacco, the team at PM USA has made significant progress on its commercialization plans for iQOS, which we're excited to share with you next week at our Investor Day.
Another focus of our Investor Day will be the regulatory environment. As everyone knows, in July, FDA announced its comprehensive plan for U.S. tobacco in nicotine regulation. FDA stated its belief that this approach will strike an appropriate balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes. We're encouraged by this important evolution in the agency's stance on innovation, having long advocated for a comprehensive regulatory policy that acknowledges the continuum of risk. We also support FDA's stated intention to issue regulations, outlining what information it expects to be included in product applications and in reports to demonstrate substantial equivalence. 
Obviously, establishing the rules before any decisions are taken is simple regulatory fairness. And we further support Commissioner Gotlieb's direction to the Center for Tobacco Products to reconsider its approach to substantial equivalence for provisional products, a process we previously have described as increasingly onerous and expensive. 
Finally, FDA also stated its intention to explore a product standard relating to nicotine, a possibility since the act became law in 2009 and for which PM USA has been preparing. As the FDA itself acknowledge, developing such a standard will be a long and complex process requiring significant stakeholder comment and engagement. And again, we'll say more about all this next week.
In summary, we're very pleased with our performance through what's been a challenging 9 months. Thus, we reaffirm our 2017 full year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth. And here's Billy for more detail on our performance."

Cigarette industry volumes declined an estimated 3.5% in the third quarter. The smokeable products segments reported cigarette shipment volume declined by 6.2%, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines and one fewer shipping day. When adjusted for inventory movements and calendar differences, PM USA's cigarettes shipment volume declined by an estimated 4.5%. The better look is probably the first 9 months where industry cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 3.5% and PM USA's cigarettes shipment volume decreased 4% on both a reported and adjusted basis.
The cigar business continues to perform extremely well, delivering volume growth of 6.6% in the third quarter and 10.6% for the first 9 months. Smokeable segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 4.5 percentage points to 52.2% in the third quarter, driven by higher pricing and lower SG&A and resolution expense. The favorable cost comparison is driven in part by California ballot spending in the year-ago period and NPM-related credits booked in this quarter. For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI margins expanded by 3 percentage points to 51.6%.
In the smokeless products segment, industry volume grew by an estimated 0.5% over the past 6 months. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its adjusted smokeless products shipment volume declined by 3% in the third quarter and 1.5% for the first 9 months. 
Smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins increased by 6.8 percentage points in the quarter to 70.3%, driven primarily by higher net pricing and lower cost, partially offset by unfavorable mix. For the first 9 months, smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 1.6 percentage points to 67.7%, primarily due to higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix.
Turning to our alcohol assets. Wine segment adjusted OCI declined 5.3% in the quarter due primarily to higher cost. Ste. Michelle's volume trends improved in the third quarter relative to the first half and were essentially unchanged compared to the year-ago level. 
In beer, third quarter adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev were $203 million, reflecting AB InBev second quarter results, which it reported in July.
I'll wrap up by highlighting our cash returns to shareholders. Through the first 9 months of 2017, we paid shareholders more than $3.5 billion in dividends and increased the dividend in August. We repurchased nearly $2.4 billion in shares, leaving $576 million in the program as of September 30. We expect to complete the program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.
With that, operator, do we have any questions?"

So we've discussed previously, Chris, the elasticities with respect to cigarettes, and we've had big jolts before like the one that we've experienced in California. And what happens is, as you know, there's an immediate disruption and you get a deep decline. And then it comes back to the curve that we've observed over the years, which is about negative 0.3. So a lot of it depends on how big the shock is. California, $2 a pack after not having had an increase for decades really. So it's coming back. We expect it'll come back to where it is on the curve, and we see some improvement there. But it's going to take some time. It was a big shock to the system, and you see that in the numbers, I think. So on Marlboro, we're very pleased actually with Marlboro's product pipeline. You see that what we try to do is we try to bring out SKUs to the market, where we think that there's a niche where Marlboro can gain some business from competitive smokers. We're also, frankly, trying to create news in the marketplace about Marlboro to keep its momentum moving forward. And so we're going to talk about this next week.

And so when we look at back at Marlboro shares, we don't decompose it down to the SKU level despite I know there's quite a lot of interest in that, we don't do it for competitive reasons. But if we go back to Marlboro share gains, for example, during the period 2011 through 2016, we actually gained ahead of what the historical rate had been. It was about 1.7 percentage points of share gain. And you can see in the first 9 months, we've given back about 0.3. So I think the reasons are pretty straightforward. It is California for the reasons we just finished discussing. There were all these competitive launches. And then I think there is a market dynamic change, which is -- because of the industry consolidation, there are very few brands left, frankly, that don't have marketing support on them. So Marlboro used to gain share by picking up some of the share from those unprotected brands as did other competitive brands, that's the market dynamic change. But overall, I think we're on strategy, particularly when you see the income performance. So we'll talk more about the Marlboro brand family next week. We just don't break it down, sort of, at a level that you're asking. I hope you can appreciate that."

So I don't want to put you off on your question, but I'll give you a high level sort of a lead-in, if you will. There's quite a lot to do, obviously, as you know of any nicotine standard or any other standard, for that matter, wherever to be implemented, there has to be science and evidence-based. And in the nicotine area, there's a lot of science that would have to be answered, so let me just call out a few for instance. So I think folks are going to have to understand how consumers might react to a nicotine standard, including the question of whether compensation would occur because you, obviously, from the public health point of view, wouldn't want people smoking more cigarettes to get their nicotine. There is no standard that is currently developed with respect to what the level should be or where it should be measured. Is it in the aerosol or is in the filler? How would it be implemented, would it be phased in time or would it be done more immediate basis? So those are the questions which have to be answered that are not answered yet. The government has research going on in that regard. As you might expect, we -- our scientists are fully engaged in all the scientific questions, both tracking government research as well as doing our own research so that we're fully informed on those. There are big questions around technical achievability, which is an area that you're asking about. Now the possibility of a standard about nicotine has been in the statute since 2009, so it won't surprise anyone to know that we have been looking at ways that we might need any potential standard. You can look at product design, you can look at tobacco leaf treatments, you can look at tobacco seed technologies, most of which are proprietary, so I won't comment beyond them. But I think people should be assured that we have been looking at this. And then, finally, I think another area that's going to have to be wrestled with is what about unintended consequences if a standard comes in. We have got to make sure that the market still works. So as you can tell, just from that high-level description, there's quite a lot that has to be wrestled around and, again, we'll talk more about that next week."

Altria delivered outstanding financial performance in the third quarter contributing to a strong first 9 months of 2017. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share of 9.8% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first",1021,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Altria delivered outstanding financial performance in the third quarter contributing to a strong first 9 months of 2017. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share of 9.8% in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first 9 months. As we expected, our earnings growth is accelerating as we move through the second half of the year.
We continue to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase as Billy will describe in more detail. And in August, our Board of Directors voted to increase our dividend quarterly by 8.2% and that's the 51st increase in the past 48 years.
Our core tobacco businesses were the primary drivers of our earnings growth. In the quarter, the smokeable products segment delivered 7.7% adjusted operating company's income growth, as strong pricing and lower cost more than offset volume declines.  For the first 9 months, smokeable products segment adjusted operating company's income grew 7.4%. 
Reported cigarette volumes were challenged in the quarter due to the industry's rate of decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines and one fewer shipping day. We're very pleased with the financial performance in the smokeable segment. Our strategy continues to be to maximize income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro and Black & Mild over the long term.
As you know, we view momentum as continued strength across various brand metrics including equity, demographics, profitability and retail share. Marlboro continues to have category-leading equity, strong demographics and is, of course, highly profitable.
As for retail share, Marlboro declined by 0.5 share point to 43.2% in the quarter and 0.3 for the first 9 months to 43.4%. So let's look at what's happening here beginning with California.
As we described in the second quarter call, we expected the dynamics related to the California $2 per pack SET increase to dampen Marlboro share through the back half and that's continuing to happen. You are familiar with Marlboro's over-indexed share in California at over 50%, and Marlboro thus continues to experience disproportionate share impact during this period due to the SEC increase -- SET increase. Second, there was elevated competitive activity in the quarter, including high levels of promotional spending and a competitive brand launch. In fact, there have been 5 such launches by major competitors this year, many with multiple packings behind them. Those launches and the promotional resources accompanying them have increased the short-term share pressure on Marlboro as the share leader. 
Share performance is best measured over years, not quarters, of course, but it's important to understand that PM USA is addressing Marlboro's recent share declines. First, it is reallocating certain marketing resources, including in California. These have included changes to promotional resources and product expansions. For example, PM USA has revised its retail trade programs to focus retailers on the profitability Marlboro brings to their stores. In this process, PM USA has reallocated resources from underperforming retail program options to promotions that support maintaining Marlboro's leadership position.
Second, PM USA recently announced the expansion of Marlboro black label in California and Washington state. Marlboro black label features the latest in Marlboro's packaging innovation, it's exclusive, soft-touch technology. We expect these actions to help stabilize Marlboro share while staying on strategy to maximize income. Look for more product news from PM USA at our Investor Day next week.
Moving to the smokeless product segment. USSTC delivered outstanding adjusted operating company's income growth of 15.7% in the third quarter as higher net pricing and lower costs more than offset lower shipment volume. The smokeless product segment delivered 6.3% adjusted operating company's income growth for the first 9 months of 2017.
Copenhagen's retail share grew 0.2 to 33.9% in the third quarter and by 0.6 for the first 9 months to 33.6%. On a combined basis, Copenhagen and Skoal retail share declined 1.2 share points in the third quarter and 0.9 for the first 9 months, driven by Skoal declines. These results reflect USSTC's continued focus on growing Copenhagen while refining Skoal investments to enhance its profitability.
In e-vapor, Nu Mark grew MarkTen's third quarter volume by more than 50%, driven by expanded distribution and category growth. MarkTen had a third quarter national retail share of approximately 13.5% in mainstream channels. And Nu Mark recently announced plans to expand the distribution of MarkTen Bold to approximately 15,000 additional stores in the fourth quarter.
In heated tobacco, the team at PM USA has made significant progress on its commercialization plans for iQOS, which we're excited to share with you next week at our Investor Day.
Another focus of our Investor Day will be the regulatory environment. As everyone knows, in July, FDA announced its comprehensive plan for U.S. tobacco in nicotine regulation. FDA stated its belief that this approach will strike an appropriate balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes. We're encouraged by this important evolution in the agency's stance on innovation, having long advocated for a comprehensive regulatory policy that acknowledges the continuum of risk. We also support FDA's stated intention to issue regulations, outlining what information it expects to be included in product applications and in reports to demonstrate substantial equivalence. 
Obviously, establishing the rules before any decisions are taken is simple regulatory fairness. And we further support Commissioner Gotlieb's direction to the Center for Tobacco Products to reconsider its approach to substantial equivalence for provisional products, a process we previously have described as increasingly onerous and expensive. 
Finally, FDA also stated its intention to explore a product standard relating to nicotine, a possibility since the act became law in 2009 and for which PM USA has been preparing. As the FDA itself acknowledge, developing such a standard will be a long and complex process requiring significant stakeholder comment and engagement. And again, we'll say more about all this next week.
In summary, we're very pleased with our performance through what's been a challenging 9 months. Thus, we reaffirm our 2017 full year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth. And here's Billy for more detail on our performance."

Cigarette industry volumes declined an estimated 3.5% in the third quarter. The smokeable products segments reported cigarette shipment volume declined by 6.2%, primarily driven by the industry's rate of decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines and one fewer shipping day. When adjusted for inventory movements and calendar differences, PM USA's cigarettes shipment volume declined by an estimated 4.5%. The better look is probably the first 9 months where industry cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 3.5% and PM USA's cigarettes shipment volume decreased 4% on both a reported and adjusted basis.
The cigar business continues to perform extremely well, delivering volume growth of 6.6% in the third quarter and 10.6% for the first 9 months. Smokeable segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 4.5 percentage points to 52.2% in the third quarter, driven by higher pricing and lower SG&A and resolution expense. The favorable cost comparison is driven in part by California ballot spending in the year-ago period and NPM-related credits booked in this quarter. For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI margins expanded by 3 percentage points to 51.6%.
In the smokeless products segment, industry volume grew by an estimated 0.5% over the past 6 months. After adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, USSTC estimates that its adjusted smokeless products shipment volume declined by 3% in the third quarter and 1.5% for the first 9 months. 
Smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins increased by 6.8 percentage points in the quarter to 70.3%, driven primarily by higher net pricing and lower cost, partially offset by unfavorable mix. For the first 9 months, smokeless products segment adjusted OCI margins expanded by 1.6 percentage points to 67.7%, primarily due to higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix.
Turning to our alcohol assets. Wine segment adjusted OCI declined 5.3% in the quarter due primarily to higher cost. Ste. Michelle's volume trends improved in the third quarter relative to the first half and were essentially unchanged compared to the year-ago level. 
In beer, third quarter adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Anheuser-Busch InBev were $203 million, reflecting AB InBev second quarter results, which it reported in July.
I'll wrap up by highlighting our cash returns to shareholders. Through the first 9 months of 2017, we paid shareholders more than $3.5 billion in dividends and increased the dividend in August. We repurchased nearly $2.4 billion in shares, leaving $576 million in the program as of September 30. We expect to complete the program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And Marty and I are now happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other housekeeping items.
With that, operator, do we have any questions?"

So we've discussed previously, Chris, the elasticities with respect to cigarettes, and we've had big jolts before like the one that we've experienced in California. And what happens is, as you know, there's an immediate disruption and you get a deep decline. And then it comes back to the curve that we've observed over the years, which is about negative 0.3. So a lot of it depends on how big the shock is. California, $2 a pack after not having had an increase for decades really. So it's coming back. We expect it'll come back to where it is on the curve, and we see some improvement there. But it's going to take some time. It was a big shock to the system, and you see that in the numbers, I think. So on Marlboro, we're very pleased actually with Marlboro's product pipeline. You see that what we try to do is we try to bring out SKUs to the market, where we think that there's a niche where Marlboro can gain some business from competitive smokers. We're also, frankly, trying to create news in the marketplace about Marlboro to keep its momentum moving forward. And so we're going to talk about this next week.

And so when we look at back at Marlboro shares, we don't decompose it down to the SKU level despite I know there's quite a lot of interest in that, we don't do it for competitive reasons. But if we go back to Marlboro share gains, for example, during the period 2011 through 2016, we actually gained ahead of what the historical rate had been. It was about 1.7 percentage points of share gain. And you can see in the first 9 months, we've given back about 0.3. So I think the reasons are pretty straightforward. It is California for the reasons we just finished discussing. There were all these competitive launches. And then I think there is a market dynamic change, which is -- because of the industry consolidation, there are very few brands left, frankly, that don't have marketing support on them. So Marlboro used to gain share by picking up some of the share from those unprotected brands as did other competitive brands, that's the market dynamic change. But overall, I think we're on strategy, particularly when you see the income performance. So we'll talk more about the Marlboro brand family next week.

So I don't want to put you off on your question, but I'll give you a high level sort of a lead-in, if you will. There's quite a lot to do, obviously, as you know of any nicotine standard or any other standard, for that matter, wherever to be implemented, there has to be science and evidence-based. And in the nicotine area, there's a lot of science that would have to be answered, so let me just call out a few for instance. So I think folks are going to have to understand how consumers might react to a nicotine standard, including the question of whether compensation would occur because you, obviously, from the public health point of view, wouldn't want people smoking more cigarettes to get their nicotine. There is no standard that is currently developed with respect to what the level should be or where it should be measured. Is it in the aerosol or is in the filler? How would it be implemented, would it be phased in time or would it be done more immediate basis? So those are the questions which have to be answered that are not answered yet. The government has research going on in that regard. As you might expect, we -- our scientists are fully engaged in all the scientific questions, both tracking government research as well as doing our own research so that we're fully informed on those. There are big questions around technical achievability, which is an area that you're asking about. Now the possibility of a standard about nicotine has been in the statute since 2009, so it won't surprise anyone to know that we have been looking at ways that we might need any potential standard. You can look at product design, you can look at tobacco leaf treatments, you can look at tobacco seed technologies, most of which are proprietary, so I won't comment beyond them. But I think people should be assured that we have been looking at this. And then, finally, I think another area that's going to have to be wrestled with is what about unintended consequences if a standard comes in. We have got to make sure that the market still works. So as you can tell, just from that high-level description, there's quite a lot that has to be wrestled around and, again, we'll talk more about that next week."
