I'm very pleased to say that in 2016, we deliver our fourth consecutive year of operational revenue growth and improved profitability since becoming a public company. 
We completed the significant initiative to shape our business for greater efficiency and cash generation. And we continue to make investment that will sustain our future growth, innovation and market leadership. Our growth in 2016 was driven by the successful launch of several new products; the strength of our diverse portfolio; and the deeper commitment to the direct customer relationships, productive R&D and high-quality manufacturing that are the foundation of our business model. 
Let me highlight some of the headlines for 2016. We delivered on our financial goals for the year despite some challenging market conditions for livestock producers, especially in the U.S. We generated 5% operational growth in revenue for the full year, and 8% growth based on normalized organic operational view that Glenn will discuss in his remarks. As expected, our companion animal portfolio led the way with 13% operational growth, thanks to Apoquel and other new product launches. Our livestock portfolio grew 1% operationally, overcoming the negative revenue impact of our product rationalization initiative and business changes in Venezuela and India. We posted 17% operational growth in adjusted net income and improved our adjusted EBIT margin to 32%. 
These measures demonstrate the positive impact of our operational efficiency changes and the benefits of new product launches like Apoquel. We're able to deliver these strong results and innovation while implementing important changes to our business last year. 
For example, we completed the implementation of our ERP system, which has been -- given us more efficient tools and better visibility across our operations. We eliminated approximately 5,000 low-revenue, low-margin SKUs from our product portfolio. And we have sold or exited 6 manufacturing sites. 
During 2016, we strengthened our industry leadership with more than 200 product approvals, including: Cytopoint in the U.S., the first monoclonal antibody approved to help dogs suffering from atopic dermatitis; Simparica, our new oral antiparasitic; and several new VANGUARD vaccines. We continue to look at this productive R&D engine as critical to our future and spend more on R&D than any of our peers. 
We also continue to see the value of investing in external business development opportunities. Last year, we acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices in the diagnostic space for approximately $80 million. And our previous prior acquisition of PHARMAQ contributed $90 million in revenue in 2016 while achieving rapid adoption of its ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon. Fish farmers in Chile have responded very favorably to the introduction of this vaccine. 
Finally, we returned $488 million in excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we announced plan for a multi-year, $1.5 billion share repurchase plan beginning in 2017. All of these investments are consistent with the capital allocation priorities we have shared with you in the past. 
All of the work that we have done in 2016 and in previous years, such as building our infrastructure, investing in new systems and becoming more efficient, has positioned us for success in 2017 and beyond. 
In 2017, we will target operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and continue improving our adjusted EBIT margin as we realize the full benefit of our operational efficiency initiative this year. All major actions of the operational efficiency program that we announced in 2015 has been implemented. And we expect to exceed the initial target of $600 million in savings in 2017. 
These additional savings will be used to support our short- and long-term growth in several ways. In 2017, we plan to initiate direct-to-consumer marketing and advertising campaigns in the U.S. for 2 of our companion animal products. In the case of Apoquel, we want to increase awareness of atopic dermatitis among pet owners, especially those whose dogs may be suffering from acute conditions. And in the case of Simparica, we want to demonstrate the advantages of our product and increase our share of voice in the highly competitive parasiticide market. [ph] These companies will include national television ads and the digital promotions online that are targeted to begin with in the first half of this year. 
We also support new product launches like Cytopoint, which was approved in the U.S. last year; and Stronghold Plus, which is expected to be launched this year in the European Union. Stronghold Plus is a topical parasiticide for cats that combines sarolaner, the active ingredient of Simparica, with selamectin, the active ingredient in our current Stronghold and REVOLUTION product lines. This is our first combination product for sarolaner, and it's a great example of how we used an R&D focus on life cycle innovation to expand our platform and maintain a durable and valuable product line for decades. 
We also will remain focused on improving the way we interact with and support our customers. Our people and technology are important parts of any customer experience, and they remain critical areas of investment. For example, we'll be deploying new tools and capabilities on our ERP system, and we have been expanding our field force in markets like Brazil and China, where we see significant and sustainable growth opportunities. 
We also see R&D, manufacturing and business development as areas where we'll allocate increased capital this year to support our long-term growth plans. Our internal R&D programs will help discover new products as well as develop life cycle innovation across our approximately 300 product lines. Our business development team will continue exploring acquisitions, partnerships and alliances that enable us to fill gaps in our portfolio and expand further in complementary spaces and geographies. And we will continue executing our long-term supply network strategy to improve the quality and the reliability of key growth platforms in manufacturing. 
We have become the profitable business and market leader we always envisioned when we launched in 2013, and the outlook for Zoetis in 2017 is very positive. We expect to see strong growth from our companion animal portfolio again this year, driven by our dermatology portfolio, Apoquel and Cytopoint, further penetration of Simparica and ongoing uptake of our new vaccines. And in our livestock portfolio, we expect a recovery and improved growth across our cattle, swine and poultry business [ph]. 
And in the case of fish, we expect PHARMAQ to capitalize on the success of the new ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine in Chile. And we recently received a favorable legal ruling in Norway, the world's largest farmed salmon market, which will allow us to launch our vaccine for salmon pancreatic disease this year. A great result and opportunity that demonstrates the value we saw for this acquisition. 
In closing, we are proud of our ability to deliver better-than-expected results in 2016 despite the market challenges we faced and the business changes we implemented. I want to thank all our Zoetis colleagues for their commitment and personal contribution to these results. 
As we look ahead in 2017, we see a brighter future. We have reshaped our business for long-term profitable growth based on our diverse portfolio, customer focus, innovative R&D, high-quality manufacturing and improved capital efficiency. I thank you, our shareholders, for your confidence in Zoetis, and look forward to reporting to you on our progress. 
With that, let me turn things over to Glenn. Glenn?"
215548781,414734400,1134397,"Zoetis Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2017",2017-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Ramón.

We delivered revenue and adjusted EPS at the high end of our guidance ranges. Our new companion animal product, increased efficiency and margin improvements, all helped drive that performance throughout the year. 
Operational revenue growth for the year was 5%, but a better indicator of our underlying performance is what we refer to as our normalized organic operational growth. That was 8% for the year. It excludes the negative impact of our operational efficiency initiative and the positive impact of M&A. You can find the details of these items in the tables on our website. Of this 8% growth, 5 percentage points came from new products, including Apoquel, 3 percentage points came from the in-line portfolio, with 2 points of that from price and 1 from volume. 
This will be the last quarter that we will report our normalized revenue growth metric as our operational efficiency initiative will have only a small impact on our revenue in 2017. 
There will be some continued drag on our revenue growth from product rationalization, especially in the first 2 quarters of the year, and we will help you understand the magnitude of those items as we go through 2017. As we've said in the past, we take a long-term view of our business and prefer to assess our financial performance on an annual basis rather than taking a quarterly focus. 
During the year, we saw many of the familiar seasonal fluctuations that occur in our industry. But as we progressed through the year, our expectations for our performance steadily increased. Our team delivered on those higher expectations, with 17% operational growth in adjusted net income compared to the 6% to 12% we expected at the beginning of the year. This success demonstrates the strength of our diverse portfolio and business model and it builds on many years of strong performance. We're especially pleased to have achieved these results during a period of significant change in how we operate our company. 
Turning to the quarter. We delivered double-digit operational growth in adjusted net income, overcoming the negative impact to revenue of fewer accounts days and business changes related to our operational efficiency initiative. Both reported and operational revenue growth were flat for the quarter. We saw no impact from foreign change to revenue, unlike many of our prior quarters. 
Our operational efficiency initiative reduced revenue by 3% and fewer calendar days in the quarter had approximately a 4% impact. M&A activity, primarily PHARMAQ, contributed 2% to our revenue growth. 
PHARMAQ was below our revenue projections for the year, but we feel very good about the value we are getting from this acquisition. 
Our positive views are supported by the strong performance of our SRS vaccine in Chile and a recent legal win in Norway that opens the door to an important category in the aquaculture market. These 2 PHARMAQ drivers represent a meaningful portion of the value we saw in this company. While market conditions in Chile were challenging in 2016, the long-term structural drivers of growth that attracted us to the aquaculture market remain intact. 
Going back to our overall results. Our normalized organic operational revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter. Again, this backs out the negative effects of our operational efficiency initiative, fewer calendar days in the quarter and the benefit from M&A. This growth was balanced between our geographic segments on a normalized basis, with international growing 6% and the U.S. growing at 5%. In both segments, the main growth driver was new companion animal products. We continue to see strong growth of Apoquel and our vaccine franchises, and we are steadily establishing Simparica in the U.S. and other markets. 
In the U.S., we continued to absorb the decline in surgical fluid products. This was partially offset, however, by additional sales in the quarter as we expanded distributor relationship on other products. U.S. companion animal grew 7% on a normalized basis. U.S. livestock grew 3% on a normalized basis, with growth in cattle and poultry offset by declines in swine. 
Market conditions in cattle continue to be difficult and results were somewhat lighter than expected in the fourth quarter. However, our U.S. cattle business delivered low to mid single-digit growth on the same normalized basis for the quarter and year despite very challenging market conditions for our beef and dairy customers. Again, this demonstrates the resiliency of the animal health industry and Zoetis even in challenging market conditions. 
International companion animal normalized growth of 16% was supported by new product contributions as well as higher levels of medicalization in emerging markets, a fundamental long-term structural driver of our business. 
2% normalized growth for international livestock was supported by growth in China, Mexico and Brazil, offset by lower usage of antibiotics in Western Europe. You can see the full results of our top 11 markets in the table, but let me highlight a few items. 
Growth in key emerging markets like Brazil and China continues to be strong. Operational revenue growth in Brazil of 8% was driven by price, new companion animal products and favorable cattle conditions. High demand for beef exports from Brazil more than offset the difficult market conditions in poultry and swine, where producers saw higher input prices. 
Operational growth in China of 17% was driven by continued strength in the swine market and growth in companion animal vaccines due to increases in routine care. For the year, China grew 24% operationally, our fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth since becoming public. 
Our recent field force expansions in Brazil and China have been productive, and we'll continue to deploy selling resources in these and other markets where we see significant and sustainable growth drivers combined with high returns on our investments. Emerging market growth was not limited to Brazil and China. Our other emerging markets category grew 6% operationally. 
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. I'll quickly cover a few items of note in the quarter and then move to review our guidance. Adjusted gross margin increased 110 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange, which was partially offset by higher inventory charges. Adjusted other income included a $15 million charge for the devaluation of the Egyptian pound that occurred in November after our most recent guidance update. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. This rate included the effects of discrete items and this jurisdictional mix of earning. This brought our full year adjusted tax rate to 30%, which was 2 points below our guidance for the year. 
Adjusted net income grew 13% operationally despite the fewer selling days in the quarter. GAAP net income grew significantly on a reported basis in the quarter. This was due to the charge in the year ago quarter related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela as well as lower stand up [ph] and operational efficiency cost. 
Versus our full year guidance, our onetime cost were above the range as we settled the product dispute with poultry customers in Mexico and had higher-than-expected severance cost associated with our efficiency initiative. In the quarter, we also incurred a net tax charge as a result of the implementation of certain operational changes, including the revaluation of tax assets associated with the change in our operating model. 
All in all, Q4 was a good quarter, wrapping up a great year. We delivered normalized organic operational growth of 8%, adjusted gross margin improvement of almost 200 basis points, 23% operational growth in adjusted EBIT and 17% operational growth in adjusted net income. 
Now let's talk about guidance for full year 2017. We are updating our previous guidance for changes in foreign exchange rate since our last update in November. Our guidance now reflects rates as of late January, which reduced revenue guidance by approximately $50 million and adjusted EPS by $0.03.  On an operational basis, our guidance is unchanged. We have, however, updated our growth rate to reflect the higher base of revenue and income achieved in 2016. 
For the year, we expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 15% to 20%. 
We continue to see companion animal driving much of our growth in 2017. We will have additional penetration of Apoquel, including its expansion into more acute and seasonal cases. We will continue the launch of Cytopoint in the U.S. as we build our dermatology portfolio. And we will see additional market penetration of Simparica as well as the launch of Stronghold Plus in Europe. 
All of the necessary actions to deliver our 2017 efficiency goals were largely completed by the end of 2016. We expect to deliver more than the $300 million in savings we initially targeted, some of which we will be investing back in the business. 
Despite the lower tax rate in the fourth quarter, our guidance for adjusted ETR is unchanged. We do not expect the favorable discrete items from Q4 to recur. Our guidance for adjusted ETR is based on current year's tax law and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. There are also other items that can impact our taxes going forward, such as border adjustability and the impact of Dean [ph] repatriation. We will be in a position to articulate the potential effect of these items as we gain more clarity. 
While we don't guide to quarters, I do want do want to reiterate my comments from last quarter that expect to see our revenue and income growth weighs more significantly towards the second half of the year. 
As a reminder, in 2017, we will face approximately a $50 million drag on revenue growth from the product rationalizations. This will disproportionately affect the first quarter. We are expecting first quarter gross margin to be generally in line with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the timing of recognition of cost to goods sold. We're also reinvesting a portion of our additional cost savings and investments in product launches and key brands like Apoquel, Cytopoint and Simparica early in the year. We expect to begin seeing the revenue effect of these investments in the second half of the year. The result is that we currently see limited adjusted income growth in the first half, with significantly stronger growth later in the year. 
A final point on capital allocation. We have completed our initial share repurchase program. And in December, we announced the $1.5 billion authorization. We view this repurchase plan as multi-year and flexible in nature depending on other capital allocation priority. We have increased the pace of our repurchase from last year to $125 million per quarter. This pace is related to the improved cash flow we expect in 2017 now that we are beyond the cost of our operational efficiency initiatives. Our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS assumes only that we offset dilution from equity awards. 
As a general rule, we view 2017 adjusted net income as a good proxy for the operating cash flow we expect to generate. We do expect to maintain CapEx in line with the last 2 years as we invest in manufacturing to deliver our in-line and new product growth. 
So let me wrap up before we go to Q&A. We achieved our 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, and we affirmed our outlook for 2017 with updates to foreign exchange. We continue to see a path to continued margin expansion, increased cash flow and greater efficiency as we achieve the full benefit of our operational efficiency program. And we're prioritizing and funding investments in long-term growth in all of our core capabilities.

So this year also, we included as part of the agreement with distributors our parasiticide products and Simparica and this will be part now with the agreement with distributor. With these extended pharmaceutical distributors, we are confident that we will be able to increase our share of voice and also penetration in veterinarian clinics. Also the changes with distributors -- with these changes we have considered that it's much more attractive model to have the franchise with distributors based on total volume rather than exclusivity for small number of problems. Having said that, also, we remain committed to our commercial model-based and direct interaction with customers. Through highly qualified field force, we generate demand for our problems and the result of all the changes that we expect are positive impact in our business, and the outlook for generics that is also something that may be some questions in the market. We remain unchanged from what we said in the past. So in summary, we confident that this new model will be very attractive. We also have better support from distributors while we maintain our presence in the market with our customer.

To your question on the underlying trend in companion animal and livestock, as we've discussed, we do expect again companion animal to grow stronger than livestock in 2017. I think when you look at it for 2016 on a normalized organic basis, life growth in livestock was 4%. Growth in companion animal is 14% I think we do expect that difference to come closer in 2017.

These prices continue to remain challenged in the U.S. market, but still within that -- we expect a recovery in the second half of the year. And in the dairy segment in terms of profitability normalizing, which is also positive. So we will see also that the volume in terms of prevention and the productivity will continue growing and maybe slowdown in terms of the use of anti-infective. As I said, 2% to 3%, the market, and we are projecting that we'll be growing faster than the market. In poultry, we expect flat to 1% market growth, and we expect our growth in this segment for Zoetis. So we'll see continued pressure on Zoetis, but we also have a portfolio that can be alternative which are considered as medically important for human, and we can offer alternative that will generate growth in our portfolio.

In the past, we try to meet all customer needs in terms of -- not only problems that we met, we made significant large number produce, but recent expectations in terms of dosages, formulations that in many cases were any complexity and limiting our ability to be reliable in terms of supply.

And I think the last lesson that we learn through the process is that definitely, there were significant opportunities of eliminating not added value activities, and this was not related to marketing. It was related to some of the activities that we were doing in terms of meetings and travels that are not adding value to our growth and not adding value to our operations.

I'm very pleased to say that in 2016, we deliver our fourth consecutive year of operational revenue growth and improved profitability since becoming a public company. 
We completed the significant initiative to shape our business for greater efficiency and cash generation. And we continue to make investment that will sustain our future growth, innovation and market leadership. Our growth in 2016 was driven by the successful launch of several new products; the strength of our diverse portfolio; and the deeper commitment to the direct customer relationships, productive R&D and high-quality manufacturing that are the foundation of our business model. 
Let me highlight some of the headlines for 2016. We delivered on our financial goals for the year despite some challenging market conditions for livestock producers, especially in the U.S. We generated 5% operational growth in revenue for the full year, and 8% growth based on normalized organic operational view that Glenn will discuss in his remarks. As expected, our companion animal portfolio led the way with 13% operational growth, thanks to Apoquel and other new product launches. Our livestock portfolio grew 1% operationally, overcoming the negative revenue impact of our product rationalization initiative and business changes in Venezuela and India. We posted 17% operational growth in adjusted net income and improved our adjusted EBIT margin to 32%. 
These measures demonstrate the positive impact of our operational efficiency changes and the benefits of new product launches like Apoquel. We're able to deliver these strong results and innovation while implementing important changes to our business last year. 
For example, we completed the implementation of our ERP system, which has been -- given us more efficient tools and better visibility across our operations. We eliminated approximately 5,000 low-revenue, low-margin SKUs from our product portfolio. And we have sold or exited 6 manufacturing sites. 
During 2016, we strengthened our industry leadership with more than 200 product approvals, including: Cytopoint in the U.S., the first monoclonal antibody approved to help dogs suffering from atopic dermatitis; Simparica, our new oral antiparasitic; and several new VANGUARD vaccines. We continue to look at this productive R&D engine as critical to our future and spend more on R&D than any of our peers. 
We also continue to see the value of investing in external business development opportunities. Last year, we acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices in the diagnostic space for approximately $80 million. And our previous prior acquisition of PHARMAQ contributed $90 million in revenue in 2016 while achieving rapid adoption of its ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon. Fish farmers in Chile have responded very favorably to the introduction of this vaccine. 
Finally, we returned $488 million in excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we announced plan for a multi-year, $1.5 billion share repurchase plan beginning in 2017. All of these investments are consistent with the capital allocation priorities we have shared with you in the past. 
All of the work that we have done in 2016 and in previous years, such as building our infrastructure, investing in new systems and becoming more efficient, has positioned us for success in 2017 and beyond. 
In 2017, we will target operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and continue improving our adjusted EBIT margin as we realize the full benefit of our operational efficiency initiative this year. All major actions of the operational efficiency program that we announced in 2015 has been implemented. And we expect to exceed the initial target of $600 million in savings in 2017. 
These additional savings will be used to support our short- and long-term growth in several ways. In 2017, we plan to initiate direct-to-consumer marketing and advertising campaigns in the U.S. for 2 of our companion animal products. In the case of Apoquel, we want to increase awareness of atopic dermatitis among pet owners, especially those whose dogs may be suffering from acute conditions. And in the case of Simparica, we want to demonstrate the advantages of our product and increase our share of voice in the highly competitive parasiticide market. These campaigns will include national television ads and digital promotions online that -- and they are targeted to begin in the first half of this year. 
We'll also support new product launches like Cytopoint, which was approved in the U.S. last year; and Stronghold Plus, which is expected to be launched this year in the European Union. Stronghold Plus is a topical parasiticide for cats that combines sarolaner, the active ingredient of Simparica, with selamectin, the active ingredient in our current Stronghold and REVOLUTION product lines. This is our first combination product for sarolaner, and it's a great example of how we used an R&D focus on life cycle innovation to expand our platform and maintain a durable and valuable product line for decades. 
We also will remain focused on improving the way we interact with and support our customers. Our people and technology are important parts of any customer experience, and they remain critical areas of investment. For example, we'll be deploying new tools and capabilities on our ERP system, and we have been expanding our field force in markets like Brazil and China, where we see significant and sustainable growth opportunities. 
We also see R&D, manufacturing and business development as areas where we'll allocate increased capital this year to support our long-term growth plans. Our internal R&D programs will help discover new products as well as develop life cycle innovation across our approximately 300 product lines. Our business development team will continue exploring acquisitions, partnerships and alliances that enable us to fill gaps in our portfolio and expand further in complementary spaces and geographies. And we will continue executing our long-term supply network strategy to improve the quality and the reliability of key growth platforms in manufacturing. 
We have become the profitable business and market leader we always envisioned when we launched in 2013, and the outlook for Zoetis in 2017 is very positive. We expect to see strong growth from our companion animal portfolio again this year, driven by our dermatology portfolio, Apoquel and Cytopoint, further penetration of Simparica and ongoing uptake of our new vaccines. And in our livestock portfolio, we expect a recovery and improved growth across our cattle, swine and poultry species. 
And in the case of fish, we expect PHARMAQ to capitalize on the success of the new ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine in Chile. And we recently received a favorable legal ruling in Norway, the world's largest farmed salmon market, which will allow us to launch our vaccine for salmon pancreatic disease this year. A great result and opportunity that demonstrates the value we saw for this acquisition. 
In closing, we are proud of our ability to deliver better-than-expected results in 2016 despite the market challenges we faced and the business changes we implemented. I want to thank all our Zoetis colleagues for their commitment and personal contribution to these results. 
As we look ahead in 2017, we see a brighter future. We have reshaped our business for long-term profitable growth based on our diverse portfolio, customer focus, innovative R&D, high-quality manufacturing and improved capital efficiency. I thank you, our shareholders, for your confidence in Zoetis, and look forward to reporting to you on our progress.

215548781,414734400,1134582,"Zoetis Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2017",2017-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Ramón. Before discussing the fourth quarter and 2017 guidance, let we offer a quick perspective on the full year. We delivered revenue and adjusted EPS at the high end of our guidance ranges. Our new companion animal product, increased ef",2016,"Thank you, Juan Ramón. Before discussing the fourth quarter and 2017 guidance, let we offer a quick perspective on the full year. We delivered revenue and adjusted EPS at the high end of our guidance ranges. Our new companion animal product, increased efficiency and margin improvements, all helped drive that performance throughout the year. 
Operational revenue growth for the year was 5%, but a better indicator of our underlying performance is what we refer to as our normalized organic operational growth. That was 8% for the year. It excludes the negative impact of our operational efficiency initiative and the positive impact of M&A. You can find the details of these items in the tables on our website. Of this 8% growth, 5 percentage points came from new products, including Apoquel, 3 percentage points came from the in-line portfolio, with 2 points of that from price and 1 from volume. 
This will be the last quarter that we will report our normalized revenue growth metric as our operational efficiency initiative will have only a small impact on our revenue in 2017. 
There will be some continued drag on our revenue growth from product rationalization, especially in the first 2 quarters of the year, and we will help you understand the magnitude of those items as we go through 2017. As we've said in the past, we take a long-term view of our business and prefer to assess our financial performance on an annual basis rather than taking a quarterly focus. 
During the year, we saw many of the familiar seasonal fluctuations that occur in our industry. But as we progressed through the year, our expectations for our performance steadily increased. Our team delivered on those higher expectations, with 17% operational growth in adjusted net income compared to the 6% to 12% we expected at the beginning of the year. This success demonstrates the strength of our diverse portfolio and business model and it builds on many years of strong performance. We're especially pleased to have achieved these results during a period of significant change in how we operate our company. 
Turning to the quarter. We delivered double-digit operational growth in adjusted net income, overcoming the negative impact to revenue of fewer accounts days and business changes related to our operational efficiency initiative. Both reported and operational revenue growth were flat for the quarter. We saw no impact from foreign change to revenue, unlike many of our prior quarters. 
Our operational efficiency initiative reduced revenue by 3% and fewer calendar days in the quarter had approximately a 4% impact. M&A activity, primarily PHARMAQ, contributed 2% to our revenue growth. 
PHARMAQ was below our revenue projections for the year, but we feel very good about the value we are getting from this acquisition. 
Our positive views are supported by the strong performance of our SRS vaccine in Chile and a recent legal win in Norway that opens the door to an important category in the aquaculture market. These 2 PHARMAQ drivers represent a meaningful portion of the value we saw in this company. While market conditions in Chile were challenging in 2016, the long-term structural drivers of growth that attracted us to the aquaculture market remain intact. 
Going back to our overall results. Our normalized organic operational revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter. Again, this backs out the negative effects of our operational efficiency initiative, fewer calendar days in the quarter and the benefit from M&A. This growth was balanced between our geographic segments on a normalized basis, with international growing 6% and the U.S. growing at 5%. In both segments, the main growth driver was new companion animal products. We continue to see strong growth of Apoquel and our vaccine franchises, and we are steadily establishing Simparica in the U.S. and other markets. 
In the U.S., we continued to absorb the decline in surgical fluid products. This was partially offset, however, by additional sales in the quarter as we expanded distributor relationship on other products. U.S. companion animal grew 7% on a normalized basis. U.S. livestock grew 3% on a normalized basis, with growth in cattle and poultry offset by declines in swine. 
Market conditions in cattle continue to be difficult and results were somewhat lighter than expected in the fourth quarter. However, our U.S. cattle business delivered low to mid single-digit growth on the same normalized basis for the quarter and year despite very challenging market conditions for our beef and dairy customers. Again, this demonstrates the resiliency of the animal health industry and Zoetis even in challenging market conditions. 
International companion animal normalized growth of 16% was supported by new product contributions as well as higher levels of medicalization in emerging markets, a fundamental long-term structural driver of our business. 
2% normalized growth for international livestock was supported by growth in China, Mexico and Brazil, offset by lower usage of antibiotics in Western Europe. You can see the full results of our top 11 markets in the table, but let me highlight a few items. 
Growth in key emerging markets like Brazil and China continues to be strong. Operational revenue growth in Brazil of 8% was driven by price, new companion animal products and favorable cattle conditions. High demand for beef exports from Brazil more than offset the difficult market conditions in poultry and swine, where producers saw higher input prices. 
Operational growth in China of 17% was driven by continued strength in the swine market and growth in companion animal vaccines due to increases in routine care. For the year, China grew 24% operationally, our fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth since becoming public. 
Our recent field force expansions in Brazil and China have been productive, and we'll continue to deploy selling resources in these and other markets where we see significant and sustainable growth drivers combined with high returns on our investments. Emerging market growth was not limited to Brazil and China. Our other emerging markets category grew 6% operationally. 
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. I'll quickly cover a few items of note in the quarter and then move to review our guidance. Adjusted gross margin increased 110 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange, which was partially offset by higher inventory charges. Adjusted other income included a $15 million charge for the devaluation of the Egyptian pound that occurred in November after our most recent guidance update. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. This rate included the effects of discrete items and this jurisdictional mix of earning. This brought our full year adjusted tax rate to 30%, which was 2 points below our guidance for the year. 
Adjusted net income grew 13% operationally despite the fewer selling days in the quarter. GAAP net income grew significantly on a reported basis in the quarter. This was due to the charge in the year ago quarter related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela as well as lower stand up [ph] and operational efficiency cost. 
Versus our full year guidance, our onetime cost were above the range as we settled the product dispute with poultry customers in Mexico and had higher-than-expected severance cost associated with our efficiency initiative. In the quarter, we also incurred a net tax charge as a result of the implementation of certain operational changes, including the revaluation of tax assets associated with the change in our operating model. 
All in all, Q4 was a good quarter, wrapping up a great year. We delivered normalized organic operational growth of 8%, adjusted gross margin improvement of almost 200 basis points, 23% operational growth in adjusted EBIT and 17% operational growth in adjusted net income. 
Now let's talk about guidance for full year 2017. We are updating our previous guidance for changes in foreign exchange rate since our last update in November. Our guidance now reflects rates as of late January, which reduced revenue guidance by approximately $50 million and adjusted EPS by $0.03.  On an operational basis, our guidance is unchanged. We have, however, updated our growth rate to reflect the higher base of revenue and income achieved in 2016. 
For the year, we expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 15% to 20%. 
We continue to see companion animal driving much of our growth in 2017. We will have additional penetration of Apoquel, including its expansion into more acute and seasonal cases. We will continue the launch of Cytopoint in the U.S. as we build our dermatology portfolio. And we will see additional market penetration of Simparica as well as the launch of Stronghold Plus in Europe. 
All of the necessary actions to deliver our 2017 efficiency goals were largely completed by the end of 2016. We expect to deliver more than the $300 million in savings we initially targeted, some of which we will be investing back in the business. 
Despite the lower tax rate in the fourth quarter, our guidance for adjusted ETR is unchanged. We do not expect the favorable discrete items from Q4 to recur. Our guidance for adjusted ETR is based on current year's tax law and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. There are also other items that can impact our taxes going forward, such as border adjustability and the impact of Dean [ph] repatriation. We will be in a position to articulate the potential effect of these items as we gain more clarity. 
While we don't guide to quarters, I do want to reiterate my comments from last quarter that expect to see our revenue and income growth weighs more significantly towards the second half of the year. 
As a reminder, in 2017, we will face approximately a $50 million drag on revenue growth from the product rationalizations. This will disproportionately affect the first quarter. We are expecting first quarter gross margin to be generally in line with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the timing of recognition of cost to goods sold. We're also reinvesting a portion of our additional cost savings and investments in product launches and key brands like Apoquel, Cytopoint and Simparica early in the year. We expect to begin seeing the revenue effect of these investments in the second half of the year. The result is that we currently see limited adjusted income growth in the first half, with significantly stronger growth later in the year. 
A final point on capital allocation. We have completed our initial share repurchase program. And in December, we announced the $1.5 billion authorization. We view this repurchase plan as multi-year and flexible in nature depending on other capital allocation priority. We have increased the pace of our repurchase from last year to $125 million per quarter. This pace is related to the improved cash flow we expect in 2017 now that we are beyond the cost of our operational efficiency initiatives. Our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS assumes only that we offset dilution from equity awards. 
As a general rule, we view 2017 adjusted net income as a good proxy for the operating cash flow we expect to generate. We do expect to maintain CapEx in line with the last 2 years as we invest in manufacturing to deliver our in-line and new product growth. 
So let me wrap up before we go to Q&A. We achieved our 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, and we affirmed our outlook for 2017 with updates to foreign exchange. We continue to see a path to continued margin expansion, increased cash flow and greater efficiency as we achieve the full benefit of our operational efficiency program. And we're prioritizing and funding investments in long-term growth in all of our core capabilities.  
With that, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

So this year also, we included as part of the agreement with distributors our parasiticide product. So the REVOLUTION, ProHeart 6 and Simparica, and this will be part now of the agreement with distributors. With these extended partnership with distributors, we are confident that we will be able to increase our share of voice and also penetration in veterinarian clinics. Also the changes with distributors, with these changes, we have considered that it's a much more attractive model to have that contrast with distributors based on total volume rather than exclusivity for a small number of products. Having said that, also, we remain committed to our commercial model based on direct interactions with customers through highly qualified field force, who generate demand for our products. And the result of all the changes is that we expect a positive impact in our business. And the outlook for generics, that is also something that may be some questions in the market. We remain unchanged from what we said in the past. So in summary, so we are confident that this new model will be very attractive, will also have better support from distributors while we'll maintain our presence in the market with our direct interaction with customers.

The offset to that in evaluating the companion animal growth, particularly in the U.S., is the impact of the surgical fluid business and the decline we saw there that was slightly greater than the impact of the stocking. To your question on the underlying trends in companion animal and livestock, as we've discussed, we do expect, again, companion animal to grow stronger than livestock in 2017. I think when you look at it for 2016 on a normalized organic basis, right, growth in livestock was 4%, growth in companion animal was 14%. I think we'd expect that difference to come closer in 2017.

Still, in '17, we expect the herd to be -- continue growing. But something that is new, it's we expect that in '18 and '19, also, this herd expansion will be now stable. Beef prices continue being challenged in the U.S. market. But still we think that in the -- we expect a recovery in the second half of the year. And the dairy segment, it's in terms of profitability sort of normalizing, which is also positive. So we will see also that the volume in terms of prevention and the productivity will continue growing and maybe will be a slowdown in terms of the use of anti-infective. But as I said, 2% to 3%, the market, and we are projecting that we'll be growing faster than the market. In poultry, we expect flat to 1% market growth, and we expect growth in this segment for Zoetis.

At the same time, we went to a process of building our structure, implementing ERP. And we considered that it was too much, trying to implement everything at the same time. But when we have a full control of our operations, we really focus on improving our efficiency. And the result of these operational efficiency program is first now, we learn that managing so many SKUs is not adding any value to our customers. We -- in the past, we tried to meet all customer needs in terms of not only products that we made, with a significant large number products, but recent expectations in terms of dosages, formulations that, in many cases, were adding only complexity and limiting our ability to be reliable in terms of supply. So this, one of the first lessons. So it's reducing complexity in terms of SKUs, in terms of a market, it's providing to add opportunity to be much more focused and provide more value to our customers. The second lesson is that the reaction of Zoetis team in terms of embracing all these opportunities and really targeting all these savings with the objective of not only being more efficient, but also supporting our future growth in a way that, that will be stronger. And I think the last lesson that we learned through the process is that definitely, there were significant opportunities of eliminating not-added-value activities. And this was related to marketing, it was related to some of the activities that we were doing in terms of meetings and travels that were not adding value to our growth and not adding value to our operations. And what we are very pleased, what we have achieved. Definitely, we have now, models that are much more efficient in commercial, also in finance and in many other parts of the company.

I'm very pleased to say that in 2016, we deliver our fourth consecutive year of operational revenue growth and improved profitability since becoming a public company. 
We completed the significant initiative to shape our business for greater efficiency and cash generation. And we continue to make investment that will sustain our future growth, innovation and market leadership. Our growth in 2016 was driven by the successful launch of several new products; the strength of our diverse portfolio and the deeper commitment to the direct customer relationships, productive R&D and high-quality manufacturing that are the foundation of our business model. 
Let me highlight some of the headlines for 2016. We delivered on our financial goals for the year despite some challenging market conditions for livestock producers, especially in the U.S. We generated 5% operational growth in revenue for the full year, and 8% growth based on normalized organic operational view that Glenn will discuss in his remarks. As expected, our companion animal portfolio led the way with 13% operational growth, thanks to Apoquel and other new product launches. Our livestock portfolio grew 1% operationally, overcoming the negative revenue impact of our product rationalization initiative and business changes in Venezuela and India. We posted 17% operational growth in adjusted net income and improved our adjusted EBIT margin to 32%. 
These measures demonstrate the positive impact of our operational efficiency changes and the benefits of new product launches like Apoquel. We're able to deliver these strong results and innovation while implementing important changes to our business last year. 
For example, we completed the implementation of our ERP system, which has been -- given us more efficient tools and better visibility across our operations. We eliminated approximately 5,000 low-revenue, low-margin SKUs from our product portfolio. And we have sold or exited 6 manufacturing sites. 
During 2016, we strengthened our industry leadership with more than 200 product approvals, including: Cytopoint in the U.S., the first monoclonal antibody approved to help dogs suffering from atopic dermatitis; Simparica, our new oral antiparasitic; and several new VANGUARD vaccines. We continue to look at this productive R&D engine as critical to our future and spend more on R&D than any of our peers. 
We also continue to see the value of investing in external business development opportunities. Last year, we acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices in the diagnostic space for approximately $80 million. And our previous prior acquisition of PHARMAQ contributed $90 million in revenue in 2016 while achieving rapid adoption of its ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon. Fish farmers in Chile have responded very favorably to the introduction of this vaccine. 
Finally, we returned $488 million in excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we announced plan for a multi-year, $1.5 billion share repurchase plan beginning in 2017. All of these investments are consistent with the capital allocation priorities we have shared with you in the past. 
All of the work that we have done in 2016 and in previous years, such as building our infrastructure, investing in new systems and becoming more efficient, has positioned us for success in 2017 and beyond. 
In 2017, we will target operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and continue improving our adjusted EBIT margin as we realize the full benefit of our operational efficiency initiative this year. All major actions of the operational efficiency program that we announced in 2015 has been implemented. And we expect to exceed the initial target of $600 million in savings in 2017. 
These additional savings will be used to support our short- and long-term growth in several ways. In 2017, we plan to initiate direct-to-consumer marketing and advertising campaigns in the U.S. for 2 of our companion animal products. In the case of Apoquel, we want to increase awareness of atopic dermatitis among pet owners, especially those whose dogs may be suffering from acute conditions. And in the case of Simparica, we want to demonstrate the advantages of our product and increase our share of voice in the highly competitive parasiticide market. These campaigns will include national television ads and digital promotions online that -- and they are targeted to begin in the first half of this year. 
We'll also support new product launches like Cytopoint, which was approved in the U.S. last year; and Stronghold Plus, which is expected to be launched this year in the European Union. Stronghold Plus is a topical parasiticide for cats that combines sarolaner, the active ingredient of Simparica, with selamectin, the active ingredient in our current Stronghold and REVOLUTION product lines. This is our first combination product for sarolaner, and it's a great example of how we use an R&D focus on life cycle innovation to expand our platform and maintain a durable and valuable product line for decades. 
We also will remain focused on improving the way we interact with and support our customers. Our people and technology are important parts of any customer experience, and they remain critical areas of investment. For example, we'll be deploying new tools and capabilities on our ERP system, and we have been expanding our field force in markets like Brazil and China, where we see significant and sustainable growth opportunities. 
We also see R&D, manufacturing and business development as areas where we'll allocate increased capital this year to support our long-term growth plans. Our internal R&D programs will help discover new products as well as develop life cycle innovation across our approximately 300 product lines. Our business development team will continue exploring acquisitions, partnerships and alliances that enable us to fill gaps in our portfolio and expand further in complementary spaces and geographies. And we will continue executing our long-term supply network strategy to improve the quality and the reliability of key growth platforms in manufacturing. 
We have become the profitable business and market leader we always envisioned when we launched in 2013, and the outlook for Zoetis in 2017 is very positive. We expect to see strong growth from our companion animal portfolio again this year, driven by our dermatology portfolio, Apoquel and Cytopoint, further penetration of Simparica and ongoing uptake of our new vaccines. And in our livestock portfolio, we expect a recovery and improved growth across our cattle, swine and poultry species. 
And in the case of fish, we expect PHARMAQ to capitalize on the success of the new ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine in Chile. And we recently received a favorable legal ruling in Norway, the world's largest farmed salmon market, which will allow us to launch our vaccine for salmon pancreatic disease this year. A great result and opportunity that demonstrates the value we saw for this acquisition. 
In closing, we are proud of our ability to deliver better-than-expected results in 2016 despite the market challenges we faced and the business changes we implemented. I want to thank all our Zoetis colleagues for their commitment and personal contribution to these results. 
As we look ahead in 2017, we see a brighter future. We have reshaped our business for long-term profitable growth based on our diverse portfolio, customer focus, innovative R&D, high-quality manufacturing and improved capital efficiency. I thank you, our shareholders, for your confidence in Zoetis, and look forward to reporting to you on our progress. 
With that, let me turn things over to Glenn. Glenn?"

Before discussing the fourth quarter and 2017 guidance, let we offer a quick perspective on the full year. We delivered revenue and adjusted EPS at the high end of our guidance ranges. Our new companion animal products, increased e",2013,"Thank you, Juan Ramón. Before discussing the fourth quarter and 2017 guidance, let we offer a quick perspective on the full year. We delivered revenue and adjusted EPS at the high end of our guidance ranges. Our new companion animal products, increased efficiency and margin improvements, all helped drive that performance throughout the year. 
Operational revenue growth for the year was 5%, but a better indicator of our underlying performance is what we refer to as our normalized organic operational growth. That was 8% for the year. It excludes the negative impact of our operational efficiency initiative and the positive impact of M&A. You can find the details of these items in the tables on our website. Of this 8% growth, 5 percentage points came from new products, including Apoquel, 3 percentage points came from the in-line portfolio, with 2 points of that from price and 1 from volume. 
This will be the last quarter that we will report our normalized revenue growth metric as our operational efficiency initiative will have only a small impact on our revenue in 2017. 
There will be some continued drag on our revenue growth from product rationalization, especially in the first 2 quarters of the year, and we will help you understand the magnitude of those items as we go through 2017. As we've said in the past, we take a long-term view of our business and prefer to assess our financial performance on an annual basis rather than taking a quarterly focus. 
During the year, we saw many of the familiar seasonal fluctuations that occur in our industry. But as we progressed through the year, our expectations for our performance steadily increased. Our team delivered on those higher expectations, with 17% operational growth in adjusted net income compared to the 6% to 12% we expected at the beginning of the year. This success demonstrates the strength of our diverse portfolio and business model and it builds on many years of strong performance. We're especially pleased to have achieved these results during a period of significant change in how we operate our company. 
Turning to the quarter. We delivered double-digit operational growth in adjusted net income, overcoming the negative impact to revenue of fewer calendar days and business changes related to our operational efficiency initiative. Both reported and operational revenue growth were flat for the quarter. We saw no impact from foreign change to revenue, unlike many of our prior quarters. 
Our operational efficiency initiative reduced revenue by 3% and fewer calendar days in the quarter had approximately a 4% impact. M&A activity, primarily PHARMAQ, contributed 2% to our revenue growth. 
PHARMAQ was below our revenue projections for the year, but we feel very good about the value we are getting from this acquisition. 
Our positive views are supported by the strong performance of our SRS vaccine in Chile and a recent legal win in Norway that opens the door to an important category in the aquaculture market. These 2 PHARMAQ drivers represent a meaningful portion of the value we saw in this company. While market conditions in Chile were challenging in 2016, the long-term structural drivers of growth that attracted us to the aquaculture market remain intact. 
Going back to our overall results. Our normalized organic operational revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter. Again, this backs out the negative effects of our operational efficiency initiative, fewer calendar days in the quarter and the benefit from M&A. This growth was balanced between our geographic segments on a normalized basis, with international growing 6% and the U.S. growing at 5%. In both segments, the main growth driver was new companion animal products. We continue to see strong growth of Apoquel and our vaccine franchises, and we are steadily establishing Simparica in the U.S. and other markets. 
In the U.S., we continued to absorb the decline in surgical fluid products. This was partially offset, however, by additional sales in the quarter as we expanded distributor relationship on other products. U.S. companion animal grew 7% on a normalized basis. U.S. livestock grew 3% on a normalized basis, with growth in cattle and poultry offset by declines in swine. 
Market conditions in cattle continue to be difficult and results were somewhat lighter than expected in the fourth quarter. However, our U.S. cattle business delivered low to mid-single-digit growth on the same normalized basis for the quarter and year despite very challenging market conditions for our beef and dairy customers. Again, this demonstrates the resiliency of the animal health industry and Zoetis even in challenging market conditions. 
International companion animal normalized growth of 16% was supported by new product contributions as well as higher levels of medicalization in emerging markets, a fundamental long-term structural driver of our business. 
2% normalized growth for international livestock was supported by growth in China, Mexico and Brazil, offset by lower usage of antibiotics in Western Europe. You can see the full results of our top 11 markets in the table, but let me highlight a few items. 
Growth in key emerging markets like Brazil and China continues to be strong. Operational revenue growth in Brazil of 8% was driven by price, new companion animal products and favorable cattle conditions. High demand for beef exports from Brazil more than offset the difficult market conditions in poultry and swine, where producers saw higher input prices. 
Operational growth in China of 17% was driven by continued strength in the swine market and growth in companion animal vaccines due to increases in routine care. For the year, China grew 24% operationally, our fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth since becoming public. 
Our recent field force expansions in Brazil and China have been productive, and we'll continue to deploy selling resources in these and other markets where we see significant and sustainable growth drivers combined with high returns on our investments. Emerging market growth was not limited to Brazil and China. Our other emerging markets category grew 6% operationally. 
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. I'll quickly cover a few items of note in the quarter and then move to review our guidance. Adjusted gross margin increased 110 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange, which was partially offset by higher inventory charges. Adjusted other income included a $15 million charge for the devaluation of the Egyptian pound that occurred in November after our most recent guidance update. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. This rate included the effects of discrete items and this jurisdictional mix of earning. This brought our full year adjusted tax rate to 30%, which was 2 points below our guidance for the year. 
Adjusted net income grew 13% operationally despite the fewer selling days in the quarter. GAAP net income grew significantly on a reported basis in the quarter. This was due to the charge in the year ago quarter related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela as well as lower stand-up [ph] and operational efficiency costs. 
Versus our full year guidance, our onetime cost were above the range as we settled the product dispute with poultry customers in Mexico and had higher-than-expected severance cost associated with our efficiency initiative. In the quarter, we also incurred a net tax charge as a result of the implementation of certain operational changes, including the revaluation of tax assets associated with the change in our operating model. 
All in all, Q4 was a good quarter, wrapping up a great year. We delivered normalized organic operational growth of 8%, adjusted gross margin improvement of almost 200 basis points, 23% operational growth in adjusted EBIT and 17% operational growth in adjusted net income. 
Now let's talk about guidance for full year 2017. We are updating our previous guidance for changes in foreign exchange rate since our last update in November. Our guidance now reflects rates as of late January, which reduced revenue guidance by approximately $50 million and adjusted EPS by $0.03. On an operational basis, our guidance is unchanged. We have, however, updated our growth rate to reflect the higher base of revenue and income achieved in 2016. 
For the year, we expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 15% to 20%. 
We continue to see companion animal driving much of our growth in 2017. We will have additional penetration of Apoquel, including its expansion into more acute and seasonal cases. We will continue the launch of Cytopoint in the U.S. as we build our dermatology portfolio. And we will see additional market penetration of Simparica as well as the launch of Stronghold Plus in Europe. 
All of the necessary actions to deliver our 2017 efficiency goals were largely completed by the end of 2016. We expect to deliver more than the $300 million in savings we initially targeted, some of which we will be investing back in the business. 
Despite the lower tax rate in the fourth quarter, our guidance for adjusted ETR is unchanged. We do not expect the favorable discrete items from Q4 to recur. Our guidance for adjusted ETR is based on current year's tax law and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. There are also other items that can impact our taxes going forward, such as border adjustability and the impact of deemed repatriation. We will be in a position to articulate the potential effect of these items as we gain more clarity. 
While we don't guide to quarters, I do want to reiterate my comments from last quarter that expect to see our revenue and income growth weighted more significantly towards the second half of the year. 
As a reminder, in 2017, we will face approximately a $50 million drag on revenue growth from the product rationalizations. This will disproportionately affect the first quarter. We are expecting first quarter gross margin to be generally in line with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the timing of recognition of cost to goods sold. We're also reinvesting a portion of our additional cost savings and investments in product launches and key brands like Apoquel, Cytopoint and Simparica early in the year. We expect to begin seeing the revenue effect of these investments in the second half of the year. The result is that we currently see limited adjusted income growth in the first half, with significantly stronger growth later in the year. 
A final point on capital allocation. We have completed our initial share repurchase program. And in December, we announced the $1.5 billion authorization. We view this repurchase plan as multi-year and flexible in nature depending on other capital allocation priorities. We have increased the pace of our repurchase from last year to $125 million per quarter. This pace is related to the improved cash flow we expect in 2017 now that we are beyond the cost of our operational efficiency initiatives. Our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS assumes only that we offset dilution from equity awards. 
As a general rule, we view 2017 adjusted net income as a good proxy for the operating cash flow we expect to generate. We do expect to maintain CapEx in line with the last 2 years as we invest in manufacturing to deliver our in-line and new product growth. 
So let me wrap up before we go to Q&A. We achieved our 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, and we affirmed our outlook for 2017 with updates to foreign exchange. We continue to see a path to continued margin expansion, increased cash flow and greater efficiency as we achieve the full benefit of our operational efficiency program. And we're prioritizing and funding investments in long-term growth in all of our core capabilities.

So this year also, we included as part of the agreement with distributors our parasiticide product. So the REVOLUTION, ProHeart 6 and Simparica, and this will be part now of the agreement with distributors. With this extended partnership with distributors, we are confident that we will be able to increase our share of voice and also penetration in veterinarian clinics. Also the changes with distributors, with these changes, we have considered that it's a much more attractive model to have that contrast with distributors based on total volume rather than exclusivity for a small number of products. Having said that, also, we remain committed to our commercial model based on direct interactions with customers through highly qualified field force, who generate demand for our products. And the result of all the changes is that we expect a positive impact in our business. And the outlook for generics, that is also something that may be some questions in the market.

In poultry, we expect flat to 1% market growth, and we expect growth in this segment for Zoetis. So we'll see continued pressure on antibiotics, but we also have a portfolio that can be alternative to the antibiotics, which are considered as medically important for human. And we can offer alternative that will generate growth in our portfolio. And finally, pork. About 1% to 2% growth in the market. And again, we expect also to grow faster than the market, mainly driven by now the entrance of the new PCV2 vaccines in our portfolio that we expect that to go into -- during the year. And we'll continue working on new combinations of vaccines -- or vaccines that will be adding antigen. That also will reinforce our position in pork. We have another question that Glenn will talk about."

In the Q3 call, we talked a lot about the fact that there was some initial stocking in Japan. So again, for the quarter, a total of $70 million. And for the year, we had $248 million in sales in Apoquel, with $170 million of that in the U.S. and $78 million international. In terms of how we're going to disclose that moving forward between Apoquel, Cytopoint or the derm portfolio, we're still early on in that.

So we are investing in the market because we see the opportunities that this market will continue growing. And we see that this market will also grow in terms of export. So the projections for Brazil continue have been very positive. Still one of the things that is difficult to predict in exactly how much will be the impact of the different discussions in terms of trade. But we are confident that maybe Brazil can have a benefit on all these trade discussions on including the export that has been based on in the past. In companion animal, definitely, we see the opportunity of increasing that medicalization in dogs. There will be also having the benefit of having the entire portfolio of Zoetis now approved in Brazil. We have Apoquel, we have also Simparica.

The lessons that we learned, that we understood from the beginning that there were opportunities for being much more efficient. At the same time, we went to a process of building our structure, implementing ERP. And we considered that it was too much, trying to implement everything at the same time. But when we have a full control of our operations, we really focus on improving our efficiency. And the result of this operational efficiency program is first now, we learned that managing so many SKUs is not adding any value to our customers. We -- in the past, we tried to meet all customer needs in terms of not only products that remain with a significant large number products, but recent expectations in terms of dosages, formulations that, in many cases, were adding only complexity and limiting our ability to be reliable in terms of supply. So this, one of the first lessons. So it's reducing complexity in terms of SKUs, in terms of a market, it's providing to add opportunity to be much more focused and provide more value to our customers. The second lesson is that the reaction of the Zoetis team in terms of embracing all these opportunities and really targeting all these savings with the objective of not only being more efficient, but also supporting our future growth in a way that, that will be stronger. And I think the last lesson that we learned through the process is that definitely, there were significant opportunities of eliminating not-added-value activities. And this was related to marketing, it was related to some of the activities that we were doing in terms of meetings and travels that were not adding value to our growth and not adding value to our operations. And what we are very pleased, what we have achieved. Definitely, we have now, models that are much more efficient in commercial, also in finance and in many other parts of the company. But definitely, we learned that it's important to focus on improving profitability. But even more important than just improving the profitability is ensuring the future growth of Zoetis.

And we also targeting in livestock, opportunities of improving profitability, for productivity, including the productivity in livestock. So we know that there are now products that are helping that feed efficiencies. We think that there will be opportunity for adding new products that will support these additional productivity in livestock."

I'm very pleased to say that in 2016, we deliver our fourth consecutive year of operational revenue growth and improved profitability since becoming a public company. 
We completed the significant initiative to shape our business for greater efficiency and cash generation. And we continue to make investment that will sustain our future growth, innovation and market leadership. Our growth in 2016 was driven by the successful launch of several new products; the strength of our diverse portfolio and the deeper commitment to the direct customer relationships, productive R&D and high-quality manufacturing that are the foundation of our business model. 
Let me highlight some of the headlines for 2016. We delivered on our financial goals for the year despite some challenging market conditions for livestock producers, especially in the U.S. We generated 5% operational growth in revenue for the full year, and 8% growth based on normalized organic operational view that Glenn will discuss in his remarks. As expected, our companion animal portfolio led the way with 13% operational growth, thanks to Apoquel and other new product launches. Our livestock portfolio grew 1% operationally, overcoming the negative revenue impact of our product rationalization initiative and business changes in Venezuela and India. We posted 17% operational growth in adjusted net income and improved our adjusted EBIT margin to 32%. 
These measures demonstrate the positive impact of our operational efficiency changes and the benefits of new product launches like Apoquel. We're able to deliver these strong results and innovation while implementing important changes to our business last year. 
For example, we completed the implementation of our ERP system, which has been -- given us more efficient tools and better visibility across our operations. We eliminated approximately 5,000 low-revenue, low-margin SKUs from our product portfolio. And we have sold or exited 6 manufacturing sites. 
During 2016, we strengthened our industry leadership with more than 200 product approvals, including: Cytopoint in the U.S., the first monoclonal antibody approved to help dogs suffering from atopic dermatitis; Simparica, our new oral antiparasitic; and several new VANGUARD vaccines. We continue to look at this productive R&D engine as critical to our future and spend more on R&D than any of our peers. 
We also continue to see the value of investing in external business development opportunities. Last year, we acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices in the diagnostic space for approximately $80 million. And our previous prior acquisition of PHARMAQ contributed $90 million in revenue in 2016 while achieving rapid adoption of its ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon. Fish farmers in Chile have responded very favorably to the introduction of this vaccine. 
Finally, we returned $488 million in excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we announced plan for a multi-year, $1.5 billion share repurchase plan beginning in 2017. All of these investments are consistent with the capital allocation priorities we have shared with you in the past. 
All of the work that we have done in 2016 and in previous years, such as building our infrastructure, investing in new systems and becoming more efficient, has positioned us for success in 2017 and beyond. 
In 2017, we will target operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and continue improving our adjusted EBIT margin as we realize the full benefit of our operational efficiency initiative this year. All major actions of the operational efficiency program that we announced in 2015 has been implemented. And we expect to exceed the initial target of $600 million in savings in 2017. 
These additional savings will be used to support our short- and long-term growth in several ways. In 2017, we plan to initiate direct-to-consumer marketing and advertising campaigns in the U.S. for 2 of our companion animal products. In the case of Apoquel, we want to increase awareness of atopic dermatitis among pet owners, especially those whose dogs may be suffering from acute conditions. And in the case of Simparica, we want to demonstrate the advantages of our product and increase our share of voice in the highly competitive parasiticide market. These campaigns will include national television ads and digital promotions online that -- and they are targeted to begin in the first half of this year. 
We'll also support new product launches like Cytopoint, which was approved in the U.S. last year; and Stronghold Plus, which is expected to be launched this year in the European Union. Stronghold Plus is a topical parasiticide for cats that combines sarolaner, the active ingredient of Simparica, with selamectin, the active ingredient in our current Stronghold and REVOLUTION product lines. This is our first combination product for sarolaner, and it's a great example of how we use an R&D focus on life cycle innovation to expand our platform and maintain a durable and valuable product line for decades. 
We also will remain focused on improving the way we interact with and support our customers. Our people and technology are important parts of any customer experience, and they remain critical areas of investment. For example, we'll be deploying new tools and capabilities on our ERP system, and we have been expanding our field force in markets like Brazil and China, where we see significant and sustainable growth opportunities. 
We also see R&D, manufacturing and business development as areas where we'll allocate increased capital this year to support our long-term growth plans. Our internal R&D programs will help discover new products as well as develop life cycle innovation across our approximately 300 product lines. Our business development team will continue exploring acquisitions, partnerships and alliances that enable us to fill gaps in our portfolio and expand further in complementary spaces and geographies. And we will continue executing our long-term supply network strategy to improve the quality and the reliability of key growth platforms in manufacturing. 
We have become the profitable business and market leader we always envisioned when we launched in 2013, and the outlook for Zoetis in 2017 is very positive. We expect to see strong growth from our companion animal portfolio again this year, driven by our dermatology portfolio, Apoquel and Cytopoint, further penetration of Simparica and ongoing uptake of our new vaccines. And in our livestock portfolio, we expect a recovery and improved growth across our cattle, swine and poultry species. 
And in the case of fish, we expect PHARMAQ to capitalize on the success of the new ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine in Chile. And we recently received a favorable legal ruling in Norway, the world's largest farmed salmon market, which will allow us to launch our vaccine for salmon pancreatic disease this year. A great result and opportunity that demonstrates the value we saw for this acquisition. 
In closing, we are proud of our ability to deliver better-than-expected results in 2016 despite the market challenges we faced and the business changes we implemented. I want to thank all our Zoetis colleagues for their commitment and personal contribution to these results. 
As we look ahead in 2017, we see a brighter future. We have reshaped our business for long-term profitable growth based on our diverse portfolio, customer focus, innovative R&D, high-quality manufacturing and improved capital efficiency. I thank you, our shareholders, for your confidence in Zoetis, and look forward to reporting to you on our progress. 
With that, let me turn things over to Glenn. Glenn?"
215548781,414734400,1136097,"Zoetis Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2017",2017-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Ramón. Before discussing the fourth quarter and 2017 guidance, let we offer a quick perspective on the full year. We delivered revenue and adjusted EPS at the high end of our guidance ranges.

We delivered revenue and adjusted EPS at the high end of our guidance ranges. Our new companion animal products, increased efficiency and margin improvements, all helped drive that performance throughout the year. 
Operational revenue growth for the year was 5%, but a better indicator of our underlying performance is what we refer to as our normalized organic operational growth. That was 8% for the year. It excludes the negative impact of our operational efficiency initiative and the positive impact of M&A. You can find the details of these items in the tables on our website. Of this 8% growth, 5 percentage points came from new products, including Apoquel, 3 percentage points came from the in-line portfolio, with 2 points of that from price and 1 from volume. 
This will be the last quarter that we will report our normalized revenue growth metric as our operational efficiency initiative will have only a small impact on our revenue in 2017. 
There will be some continued drag on our revenue growth from product rationalization, especially in the first 2 quarters of the year, and we will help you understand the magnitude of those items as we go through 2017. As we've said in the past, we take a long-term view of our business and prefer to assess our financial performance on an annual basis rather than taking a quarterly focus. 
During the year, we saw many of the familiar seasonal fluctuations that occur in our industry. But as we progressed through the year, our expectations for our performance steadily increased. Our team delivered on those higher expectations, with 17% operational growth in adjusted net income compared to the 6% to 12% we expected at the beginning of the year. This success demonstrates the strength of our diverse portfolio and business model and it builds on many years of strong performance. We're especially pleased to have achieved these results during a period of significant change in how we operate our company. 
Turning to the quarter. We delivered double-digit operational growth in adjusted net income, overcoming the negative impact to revenue of fewer calendar days and business changes related to our operational efficiency initiative. Both reported and operational revenue growth were flat for the quarter. We saw no impact from foreign change to revenue, unlike many of our prior quarters. 
Our operational efficiency initiative reduced revenue by 3% and fewer calendar days in the quarter had approximately a 4% impact. M&A activity, primarily PHARMAQ, contributed 2% to our revenue growth. 
PHARMAQ was below our revenue projections for the year, but we feel very good about the value we are getting from this acquisition. 
Our positive views are supported by the strong performance of our SRS vaccine in Chile and a recent legal win in Norway that opens the door to an important category in the aquaculture market. These 2 PHARMAQ drivers represent a meaningful portion of the value we saw in this company. While market conditions in Chile were challenging in 2016, the long-term structural drivers of growth that attracted us to the aquaculture market remain intact. 
Going back to our overall results. Our normalized organic operational revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter. Again, this backs out the negative effects of our operational efficiency initiative, fewer calendar days in the quarter and the benefit from M&A. This growth was balanced between our geographic segments on a normalized basis, with international growing 6% and the U.S. growing at 5%. In both segments, the main growth driver was new companion animal products. We continue to see strong growth of Apoquel and our vaccine franchises, and we are steadily establishing Simparica in the U.S. and other markets. 
In the U.S., we continued to absorb the decline in surgical fluid products. This was partially offset, however, by additional sales in the quarter as we expanded distributor relationship on other products. U.S. companion animal grew 7% on a normalized basis. U.S. livestock grew 3% on a normalized basis, with growth in cattle and poultry offset by declines in swine. 
Market conditions in cattle continue to be difficult and results were somewhat lighter than expected in the fourth quarter. However, our U.S. cattle business delivered low to mid-single-digit growth on the same normalized basis for the quarter and year despite very challenging market conditions for our beef and dairy customers. Again, this demonstrates the resiliency of the animal health industry and Zoetis even in challenging market conditions. 
International companion animal normalized growth of 16% was supported by new product contributions as well as higher levels of medicalization in emerging markets, a fundamental long-term structural driver of our business. 
2% normalized growth for international livestock was supported by growth in China, Mexico and Brazil, offset by lower usage of antibiotics in Western Europe. You can see the full results of our top 11 markets in the table, but let me highlight a few items. 
Growth in key emerging markets like Brazil and China continues to be strong. Operational revenue growth in Brazil of 8% was driven by price, new companion animal products and favorable cattle conditions. High demand for beef exports from Brazil more than offset the difficult market conditions in poultry and swine, where producers saw higher input prices. 
Operational growth in China of 17% was driven by continued strength in the swine market and growth in companion animal vaccines due to increases in routine care. For the year, China grew 24% operationally, our fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth since becoming public. 
Our recent field force expansions in Brazil and China have been productive, and we'll continue to deploy selling resources in these and other markets where we see significant and sustainable growth drivers combined with high returns on our investments. Emerging market growth was not limited to Brazil and China. Our other emerging markets category grew 6% operationally. 
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. I'll quickly cover a few items of note in the quarter and then move to review our guidance. Adjusted gross margin increased 110 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange, which was partially offset by higher inventory charges. Adjusted other income included a $15 million charge for the devaluation of the Egyptian pound that occurred in November after our most recent guidance update. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. This rate included the effects of discrete items and this jurisdictional mix of earning. This brought our full year adjusted tax rate to 30%, which was 2 points below our guidance for the year. 
Adjusted net income grew 13% operationally despite the fewer selling days in the quarter. GAAP net income grew significantly on a reported basis in the quarter. This was due to the charge in the year ago quarter related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela as well as lower stand-up [ph] and operational efficiency costs. 
Versus our full year guidance, our onetime cost were above the range as we settled the product dispute with poultry customers in Mexico and had higher-than-expected severance cost associated with our efficiency initiative. In the quarter, we also incurred a net tax charge as a result of the implementation of certain operational changes, including the revaluation of tax assets associated with the change in our operating model. 
All in all, Q4 was a good quarter, wrapping up a great year. We delivered normalized organic operational growth of 8%, adjusted gross margin improvement of almost 200 basis points, 23% operational growth in adjusted EBIT and 17% operational growth in adjusted net income. 
Now let's talk about guidance for full year 2017. We are updating our previous guidance for changes in foreign exchange rate since our last update in November. Our guidance now reflects rates as of late January, which reduced revenue guidance by approximately $50 million and adjusted EPS by $0.03. On an operational basis, our guidance is unchanged. We have, however, updated our growth rate to reflect the higher base of revenue and income achieved in 2016. 
For the year, we expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 15% to 20%. 
We continue to see companion animal driving much of our growth in 2017. We will have additional penetration of Apoquel, including its expansion into more acute and seasonal cases. We will continue the launch of Cytopoint in the U.S. as we build our dermatology portfolio. And we will see additional market penetration of Simparica as well as the launch of Stronghold Plus in Europe. 
All of the necessary actions to deliver our 2017 efficiency goals were largely completed by the end of 2016. We expect to deliver more than the $300 million in savings we initially targeted, some of which we will be investing back in the business. 
Despite the lower tax rate in the fourth quarter, our guidance for adjusted ETR is unchanged. We do not expect the favorable discrete items from Q4 to recur. Our guidance for adjusted ETR is based on current year's tax law and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. There are also other items that can impact our taxes going forward, such as border adjustability and the impact of deemed repatriation. We will be in a position to articulate the potential effect of these items as we gain more clarity. 
While we don't guide to quarters, I do want to reiterate my comments from last quarter that expect to see our revenue and income growth weighted more significantly towards the second half of the year. 
As a reminder, in 2017, we will face approximately a $50 million drag on revenue growth from the product rationalizations. This will disproportionately affect the first quarter. We are expecting first quarter gross margin to be generally in line with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the timing of recognition of cost to goods sold. We're also reinvesting a portion of our additional cost savings and investments in product launches and key brands like Apoquel, Cytopoint and Simparica early in the year. We expect to begin seeing the revenue effect of these investments in the second half of the year. The result is that we currently see limited adjusted income growth in the first half, with significantly stronger growth later in the year. 
A final point on capital allocation. We have completed our initial share repurchase program. And in December, we announced the $1.5 billion authorization. We view this repurchase plan as multi-year and flexible in nature depending on other capital allocation priorities. We have increased the pace of our repurchase from last year to $125 million per quarter. This pace is related to the improved cash flow we expect in 2017 now that we are beyond the cost of our operational efficiency initiatives. Our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS assumes only that we offset dilution from equity awards. 
As a general rule, we view 2017 adjusted net income as a good proxy for the operating cash flow we expect to generate. We do expect to maintain CapEx in line with the last 2 years as we invest in manufacturing to deliver our in-line and new product growth. 
So let me wrap up before we go to Q&A. We achieved our 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, and we affirmed our outlook for 2017 with updates to foreign exchange. We continue to see a path to continued margin expansion, increased cash flow and greater efficiency as we achieve the full benefit of our operational efficiency program. And we're prioritizing and funding investments in long-term growth in all of our core capabilities.

And this product has been already approved in Europe, and we plan to launch this product very soon in the European markets. Definitely, this is only the first step. We'll continue working internally to combine the same principle of different agents to have a broader spectrum of coverage in parasiticide, including dermal parasiticides, in this case, for dogs. We have not yet provided the timing of the launch, but definitely, our R&D team is working in these combo, but also working in future formulations that can also include injectable formulations and the longer duration of protection. When we have more clarity on the timing, then we'll provide an update on this information. And then in terms of the clinic consolidation. So now Banfield, that has around 900 clinics in the U.S., will be consolidated with VCA, that has another 800 clinics. So this would represent 1,700 to 1,800 clinics of a total of 30,000 clinics in the U.S. market for companion animal. We have good collaboration with both companies, with Banfield and VCA, and we expect also to continue this collaboration.

So in previous year, we had the exclusivity provisions for a few products, and with certain distributors.

So this year also, we included as part of the agreement with distributors our parasiticide product. So the REVOLUTION, ProHeart 6 and Simparica, and this will be part now of the agreement with distributors. With this extended partnership with distributors, we are confident that we will be able to increase our share of voice and also penetration in veterinarian clinics. Also the changes with distributors, with these changes, we have considered that it's a much more attractive model to have that contrast with distributors based on total volume rather than exclusivity for a small number of products. Having said that, also, we remain committed to our commercial model based on direct interactions with customers through highly qualified field force, who generate demand for our products. And the result of all the changes is that we expect a positive impact in our business. And the outlook for generics, that is also something that may be some questions in the market. We remain unchanged from what we said in the past. So in summary, so we are confident that this new model will be very attractive, will also have better support from distributors while we'll maintain our presence in the market with our direct interaction with customers.

The offset to that in evaluating the companion animal growth, particularly in the U.S., is the impact of the surgical fluid business and the decline we saw there that was slightly greater than the impact of the stocking. To your question on the underlying trends in companion animal and livestock, as we've discussed, we do expect, again, companion animal to grow stronger than livestock in 2017. I think when you look at it for 2016 on a normalized organic basis, right, growth in livestock was 4%, growth in companion animal was 14%. I think we'd expect that difference to come closer in 2017.

Still, in '17, we expect the herd to be -- continue growing. But something that is new, it's we expect that in '18 and '19, also, this herd expansion will be now stable. Beef prices continue being challenged in the U.S. market. But still we think that in the -- we expect a recovery in the second half of the year. And the dairy segment, it's in terms of profitability sort of normalizing, which is also positive. So we will see also that the volume in terms of prevention and the productivity will continue growing and maybe will be a slowdown in terms of the use of anti-infective. But as I said, 2% to 3%, the market, and we are projecting that we'll be growing faster than the market. In poultry, we expect flat to 1% market growth, and we expect growth in this segment for Zoetis.

At the same time, we went to a process of building our structure, implementing ERP. And we considered that it was too much, trying to implement everything at the same time. But when we have a full control of our operations, we really focus on improving our efficiency. And the result of this operational efficiency program is first now, we learned that managing so many SKUs is not adding any value to our customers. We -- in the past, we tried to meet all customer needs in terms of not only products that remain with a significant large number products, but recent expectations in terms of dosages, formulations that, in many cases, were adding only complexity and limiting our ability to be reliable in terms of supply. So this, one of the first lessons. So it's reducing complexity in terms of SKUs, in terms of a market, it's providing to add opportunity to be much more focused and provide more value to our customers. The second lesson is that the reaction of the Zoetis team in terms of embracing all these opportunities and really targeting all these savings with the objective of not only being more efficient, but also supporting our future growth in a way that, that will be stronger. And I think the last lesson that we learned through the process is that definitely, there were significant opportunities of eliminating not-added-value activities. And this was related to marketing, it was related to some of the activities that we were doing in terms of meetings and travels that were not adding value to our growth and not adding value to our operations. And what we are very pleased, what we have achieved. Definitely, we have now, models that are much more efficient in commercial, also in finance and in many other parts of the company.

So in companion animal, the majority of the portfolio will be Merial. They will be adding some products there, especially in pain, coming from BI. We don't see a significant change in the competition landscape in terms of companion animal. For cattle, it's where we see that the combined portfolio will strengthen the position of the new company. In swine, basically portfolio will be the portfolio that BI had in the past. So no changes in the competitive landscape. And the same for the poultry. Poultry will be mainly the Merial portfolio. So we don't expect significant changes in terms of competition in terms of species. They will have definitely bigger critical mass. This critical mass, that can help them in terms of investments and also especially in smaller markets. And definitely, it will be stronger competitor than the 2 companies separated. At the same time, so the combined company, they will need to manage higher complexity. And I'm sure that they will manage that in the future, but they will have to understand that how to manage the diversity of this extended portfolio. And also, they will be facing the distraction of the integration. So in 2017, probably we see challenge and opportunities, not too big changes in terms of competition by species. And it's something that we are confident that we'll be managing. You asked about Elanco. Elanco, it's also has been reinforced in recent acquisitions. But this is something that is already part of our competitive landscape. So we don't see that Elanco in '17 will have a different type of challenge in terms of competition compared to '16."

Before I discuss our first quarter results, I want to share some overviews on the animal health industry. Our industry continues to showing steady and profitable growth in the mid-single digits with about 5%",1023,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. 
Before I discuss our first quarter results, I want to share some overviews on the animal health industry. Our industry continues to showing steady and profitable growth in the mid-single digits with about 5% to 6% growth for 2017, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. 
In 2017, companion animal and poultry are expected to grow faster than the industry average of 5% to 6% while cattle and swine will be going below those rates. 
Companion animal growth will be driven by the increase of oral parasiticides and specialty care products in areas like dermatology, where our portfolio of Apoquel and Cytopoint is driven category growth. 
We should also see increased in clear consumption of chicken, driving growth in poultry while expecting slower-growth. Cattle and swine will benefit from positive trends, driven by additional [indiscernible] for cattle, higher prices of meat and an increase of global pork production especially in China. 
As I have mentioned many times in the past, the diversity of the animal health industry in terms of species, specific areas and geographies is an important part in prosperity and the profitable long-term performance. 
And in this industry, Zoetis stands as the most diversified animal health company and continue delivering revenue growth above the industry average, thanks to the strength of our portfolio and business model. 
We continue investing in our portfolio with a highly productive products, resulting in your product launches and life cycle innovations. In fact, we have continued to spun our canine dermatology portfolio with internally discover and develop product Cytopoint. 
Last week, Cytopoint became the first monoclonal antibody approved in European Union for veterinary use after having been previously approved in the U.S. in December and in Canada in March. Cytopoint is the first monoclonal antibody therapy approved to help reduce the clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis such as itching in dogs. We are very excited of the early market adoption of this product in the U.S. and the treatment of choice it offers our veterinarian customers. 
In February, we also announced that the European Commission granted us a full license for Stronghold Plus, a topical parasiticide for cat that combine sarolaner, the active ingredient in Simparica with selamectin, the active ingredient in our current Stronghold Plus and Evolution product lines. 
We continue to look at the ways to use sarolaner as a plan for or rather combinations in other markets. 
We also continue to pursue life cycle innovation that help ensure the availability of our revenue streams from approximately 300 Zoetis product lines. 
In the first quarter, we received approval for new indications, formulations and geographic expansion of key livestock brands such as Bovi-Shield and Fostera vaccine families and the Excenel RTU and Excede anti-infective. 
We continue to strengthen our portfolio in areas like diagnostics with the approvals in the U.S. for our Witness and Serelisa lines, both diagnostic [indiscernible]. You can read more about this in our press release. 
We also combined our internal investment in R&D with external opportunities in both our core business of medicine vaccine and the expansion of our portfolio in complementary spaces like diagnostics, genetics and bio devices. 
You have heard me speak in the past about acquisitions like PHARMAQ in the fish market and SMB in the diagnostic space. 
And just few weeks ago, we announced another investment in our core business for picking the same in companion animals. 
We announced an agreement to purchase Nexvet Biopharma, which is a mAb innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals. 
This acquisition is expected to strengthen our R&D pipeline in this area and help to stay in our category leadership in chronic pain for dogs while expanding the market opportunity in cats. 
Innovations like these are being supported by other investment with additional [indiscernible] from our operational efficiency program. And these have been included in our guidance. 
For example, field force expansion in key markets like China and Brazil, direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns for Apoquel and Simparica and capital investment in our manufacturing network to ensure we have the technology, capacity and capability to support our long-term revenue growth. All of these elements are working together to make sure we can capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us to continue growing revenues in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than savings. 
In the first quarter of 2017, we continue to see positive results from our diverse portfolio, innovative new companion animal products and more a efficient cost structure. 
Our revenue grew 6% operationally. And excluding the impact of product rationalization, which will also affect the second quarter results, our growth, which has been 8% in the first quarter. 
We believe this growth is, again, faster than the market. The main driver of our revenue growth remained in companion animal products, which grew 12% operationally, driven largely by sales of Simparica, Apoquel and Cytopoint.  And our livestock portfolio do 3% operationally, which increases in the swine, cattle and fish being partially offset by declines in poultry products. Glenn will discuss more of the market drivers and details in his remarks. 
We posted 10% operational growth in adjusted net income, once again, faster than the revenue growth. We saw a modest 2% operational growth in operating expenses as we made investment in the promotional support of new product launches, which were partially offset by savings from our operational efficiency initiative. We continue to stay focused on ways to simplify our operations and drive efficiency, including through the ongoing implementation of our supply network strategy. 
In March, we announced plans to sell our manufacturing site in [indiscernible], Brazil. We expect to complete that transaction during the second half of 2017. It will be the eighth site that has been either divested or exited as part of the operational efficiency problem and supply network strategy. We are pleased with a strong start to the year from a revenue and adjusted earnings perspective, and we are affirming our full year 2017 guidance. 
With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our first quarter results. Glenn?"

Total company r",1706,"Thank you, Juan Ramón. We performed well, again, in the first quarter based on our newest companion animal products and strength across many of our international markets, most notably China, Brazil, Australia and other emerging markets. 
Total company revenue grew 6% operationally, including a negative 2% impact from product rationalization. We saw on net impact from foreign exchange in the quarter, however, as our financial table show, there was a meaningful changes in some individual currency. 
Of that 6% growth, 5% came from companion animal growth in Simparica, Apoquel and Cytopoint. Sales of Simparica were $29 million for the quarter and our total dermatology sales were $77 million. 
Additional growth drivers for the quarter were 1% from the introduction of other new products and 2% impact from price increases. These growth drivers were partially offset by a negative 2% impact from product rationalization. 
In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 10% operational growth in adjusted net income and 10% operational growth in adjusted diluted EPS. As we realize the benefits of our operational efficiency initiative, we have stay disciplined on expenses to drive more profitable revenue while making the appropriate investments to grow the value of our business. Juan Ramón spoke about these in terms of commercial and manufacturing investments. 
Now let's discuss segment revenues. Our international segment generated operational revenue growth of 9% while the U.S. grew 4%. In the international segment, product rationalization had negative 4% impact on growth. China had an exceptionally strong quarter, growing 47% operationally. This growth is broad-based with contributions from both swine and companion animal with much of the growth coming from vaccine. 
In swine, we continue to see strong market conditions with high pork prices for customers as well as greater adoption of animal health product that can help drive more efficiency in protein production. 
In companion animal in China, our peer force is capitalizing on the growing pet population and increases in medicalization rates for pets. 
Brazil was also a strong contributor in the quarter, growing 15% operationally with our price increases driving growth across our portfolio there. 
Significant growth in livestock benefited from strong market conditions for beef producers and new companion animal products drove higher sales with Simparic, and it's know in Brazil, getting off to a strong start to its launch in the fourth quarter. 
Our growth in both China and Brazil were aided by field force expansions in lead markets, which we have discussed before. 
Mexico made a significant contribution this quarter as well with 10% operational growth. And our other emerging markets category grew 14% despite a significant impact from our product rationalization. 
Shifting to developed markets. Australia grew 10%, drawing on performance in several key brands in cattle, sheep and companion animals as well as price increases and growth in Simparica and Apoquel. 
And Japan also contributed to growth in the quarter while France declined 15% primarily due to the comparison to a strong Q1 2016. We are expecting France to return to growth in the second quarter. 
To summarize. Very strong growth in our international business is coming from a number of sources, including strong market trends, strategic investments and our success in bringing new value-added products to market. 
Turning to the U.S. Revenue grew 4%. Companion animal grew 10% in the quarter while being offset by a decline of 2% in livestock. The livestock decline were due to our swine business, where the timing of customer purchases had a negative impact in the quarter, and we continue to see competitive pressure on our vaccine franchise. 
In the U.S., we have made some changes to our Fostera TCV and higher vaccine and based on a recently large comparative trial, we believe for these products to be well received by customers and make us more competitive in this space. 
The decline in our swine business was partially offset by growth in poultry, where we've seen higher sales of antibiotic alternatives such as Solvex. 
Our cattle business in the U.S. was flat for the quarter as an increase in the heard side is contributing to growth in our reproductive franchise. Performance was also supported by growth in academe and our student [indiscernible] franchise, which was offset by a higher mix of low-risk cattle moving to Pea box. 
Our medicated [indiscernible] sales, both cattle and swine, were negatively impacted in the first quarter by livestock producers implementation of the veterinarian directive. This impacted U.S. livestock growth by about 3% as we continue to work with our customers on the implementations of BFT. 
Companion animals sales grew 10% primarily due to the launches of Simparica and Cytopoint as well as growth in Apoquel. This growth is partially offset by initial sales into expanded distributor relationships in the prior year quarter. 
We are pleased so far with the performance of Simparica in the first swine buying season that is fully available in the U.S. We've initiated direct-to-consumer and additional promotional campaigns, which we believe will help build upon the success we've seen so far. 
In U.S. dermatology, sales were $57 million for the quarter. Cytopoint has been well received in its full first full quarter with a full USDA license and Apoquel is sustaining the base it built through the second half of last year. 
 --
As we regain more experience with full supply of our dermatology portfolio throughout the calendar year, we do believe there will be seasonality to the revenue with the second and third quarter dermatology revenue being higher than the first and fourth quarters. 
Overall, we continue to hear very positive feedback from our customers about Apoquel and Cytopoint. With the launch of additional promotional campaigns and B2C advertising, we expect acceleration of sales in the coming quarter. 
With a continued strong performance in the U.S. and the prospect for additional growth in international markets, we believe our global dermatology portfolio can grow to between $400 million and $500 million in the next 3 years. 
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 64.4% declined approximately 300 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis and were sequentially flat with the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Coming into 2017, we have made additional cost improvements in our manufacturing network. 
In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized higher costs associated with previously produced inventory, which depressed our gross margin. This will also negatively impact Q2. 
As we progress into the second half of the year, our results will fully reflect more of the impact of our manufacturing cost improvement. 
In addition, Q1 2016 contains favorable items and Q1 2017 gross margin is negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange versus last year. The first quarter results for adjusted gross margin and in line with our expectation, and we reaffirmed our adjusted cost of sales guidance for the year. 
Adjusted SG&A grew by 2% in the quarter with higher promotional expenses to support new product launches and higher penetration of Apoquel, offsetting expense reductions from the operational efficiency initiatives. 
Adjusted R&D was flat for the quarter with an increase in project spending, offsetting fixed expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiative. 
Adjusted other income included lower foreign exchange losses compared with the prior year and a positive impact of a legal victory in Norway for our PHARMAQ business. This single win will allow us to launch the vaccine for pancreatic disease in the world's largest farmed salmon market this year. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 28%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly improved in the prior year due to the realization of benefits that resulted from operational changes implemented in the third quarter last year. It also reflects the effects of discrete items, including a small benefit from divesting and exercise of employee equity awards. 
The year-over-year improvement in our adjusted effective tax rate was a significant driver of adjustable income growth of 10% operationally. 
Of note, our onetime cash costs have come down significantly over time as we are moving on the efforts to stand up our company and execute on our operational efficiency initiative. 
Now moving to guidance for full year 2017. The year is off to a good start price, particularly in revenue. We are reaffirming our previous guidance and expect accelerated growth in adjusted net income as we get into the second half in the the year primarily due to the cost of sales trends I discussed earlier. 
As I said in our fourth quarter call, we expect slower income growth in the first half of the year and our current expectations are consistent with that view. 
For the year, we continue to expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35% and operational growth and adjusted net income of 15% to 20%. 
Our guidance for adjusted EPR of approximately 30% is based on current U.S. tax law and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington. 
With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S, a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate will have a meaningful benefit to us. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased $125 million in shares and our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflect the share repurchase completed through Q1. 
Just to summarize before we go to Q&A. We're off to a good start to the year with continued momentum in the areas we expected such as new companion animal products in market like China and Brazil. We see a good runway for continued growth that is in line with or faster than the market based on our diverse portfolio and recently relaunched products. Our operational efficiency program has been fully implemented at this point and is expected to achieve more than $300 million in savings in 2017.  We will continue to work some of the savings both internally and externally to support sound investments in our business and return excess capital to shareholders. And we are reaffirming our outlook for 2017 and continue to project a stronger second half to achieve our full year targets. 
With that, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

For the year, we expect for Zoetis that the cattle will be growing mid-single digits, which is positive. And also, the positive element that we have seen that the consumption of beef is also growing, driven in some part because of China consumption. But this also accelerate in the export, which also helping producers to capitalize on the investment that they have been making in the last year. So we see that in the cattle business, will be showing the positive trend. In general for the market and also positive for Zoetis. We understand that in the first quarter, we had some challenge, especially in the U.S. The challenge there came from mild winter. It also generated low risk profile for animals and this affected our premium antibiotics. The other impact that we have there in the first quarter in cattle was related to the implementation of the veterinary seat directive that created some challenge in the cattle, especially in the small customers but they were not having veterinarians associated with this operation. We expect also that this will be corrected in the coming months. But again, saw positive outlook for cattle, both in the U.S. and international.

We launched many products in companion animal and then with these launches, we decided to review the correlation with our distributors in the U.S. And then as a result of this review in 2016, we decided in agreement with our distributors also to include in their promotional portfolio our vaccines for companion animal. The result of this correlation was very positive for them and also for Zoetis. And then in 2017, we decided to expand this correlation, not only to vaccines plus some other products that they weren't responsible before. Also to our parasiticide portfolio, revolution for parasitics and Simparica. All indicators are very positive.

First of all, I think that you had mentioned 12% operational companion animal growth in the first quarter. Just wondering if we should expect that to accelerate or decelerate in coming quarters. Second, with respect to other expenses and the tax rate, which surprised me this quarter, the other expense item was $35 million in the first quarter. Wanted to get your guidance for how we should think about in the second quarter and for the full year. And then the same thing on the tax rate, the tax rate was 27.8%. Wanted to understand what you would suggest for the second quarter sequentially. And then finally, it sounds like the 2% price increase that you've seen historically and you saw this quarter is sustainable. Just wanted to confirm that, that in coming quarters and for the foreseeable future, you continue to expect the 2% benefit from price for your business."

And I will provide the comment on the outlook for companion animal, and then Glenn will go through the details of tax and some other questions that you asked, including the price. So on -- look, what we have is 12% in companion animal. So we expect for the year that companion animal will continue growing at double-digit. And we think that this 12%, it's probably a sign that we will see for the rest of the year. We should also have the benefit of the growth of Apoquel, mainly coming from also the full introduction of international market where now, there are -- some of the market, they're now at the launching phase. We also expect that Apoquel in the U.S. will continue growing. But now more than Apoquel, I think it's important to discuss about the dermatology portfolio, including Apoquel and Cytopoint. But we talked about Apoquel in the U.S. for instance,, we are very pleased with the level of penetration in clinics. It's about 94%, which is very good. But we only have 49% market share in terms of patients. So we still see opportunities for continued growing and painting the shares from [indiscernible] but still accounts for 30% of patients. Cytopoint, it's definitely has been very well accepted by the market, but still very low market share in terms of patients, only 5%. But going also very fast in terms of authorization. So both products will drive growth and very important also Simparica in where we have seen very positive [indiscernible] of our results. Now we have the benefit of this year of enjoying the full vision, so we have the total there, and we have seen that this are performing extremely well. And one of the things that we've seen that is also helping that is the correlation with distribution, and we expect also that in the next coming months, we'll see the impact also of our DTC campaign. So in summary, we expect that this 12% growth in companion animal will be maintained for the year."

I'm not necessarily going to breakdown quarter-by-quarter but just how Q1 relates to the full year. So the 2% price increase that we saw for the quarter, we do expect to be maintained throughout the year and then in general, we expect to generate 2% to 3% price increase, so nothing's changed from that perspective. In terms of the tax rate, the guidance on the adjusted ETR for the year is 30%. We came in at about 28% in Q1, really, driven by: A, some discrete favorable items, and also the recognition some of the benefits related to stock options and restricted stock units and the fact that of those in the quarter. So those had favorable impact in the quarter versus what the trending will be for the full year. And then related to other expense, so our other income in the top line was favorable in the quarter really driven by 2 key things. A, we have lower hedging cost than we have in past and also we have the PHARMAQ settlement for the PV vaccine that Juan Ramón spoke about just before."

And the answer to the U.S. livestock, I think we expect growth in the U.S. for our livestock. But maybe it will be important to provide some details on the different species in livestock, starting with swine. We expect mid to low single digits, and we expect that the [indiscernible] vaccine will help also to gain momentum in terms of revenues. We also think that the swine business in the U.S., it's also having the benefit of high exports. The exports are growing 18% in the U.S. and this is also helping producers to generate profitable results. And we are now, in our opinion, having the portfolio that will be generating growth in the rest of the year. In the case of poultry -- well, poultry we expect that the market will be showing very little growth. But on the contrary, Zoetis will be generating positive growth and they're growing faster than the market in poultry in the U.S. And finally, in cattle. In cattle, we face some challenge in the first quarter. The challenge of milder winter, lower risk profile that also had an impact in our premium anti-infective. Also as I mentioned implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive that also have an impact in some of our medicated feed additives. We expect that all these challenge in implementation that affected small producers will be managed in the future. And this will help also to have the full use of products in the coming months. In the case of positive for cattle, that makes us positive about this segment. Prices are increasing and as I mentioned, the future of prices are highest in the stock. Also, the placement of the feedlot increased by 3% and very positive also. The animals are now moved with medium-sized compared to heavy size in the future, which is also increasing the reach profile of these animals. And again, another indicator which is positive in cattle is that as the feedlot and stalkers are back to profit. So overall, we think that the cattle market are having positive prospects, and we have the portfolio in our company also to generate positive growth in the rest of the year."

In terms of dividend, we'll continue to grow dividend pretty much at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income and really where it will exhibit flexibility in terms of returning capital to shareholders would share repurchase. So we recently announced $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We indicated that was flexible in nature. Just for context, in Q1, we repurchased $125 million in share and as we go throughout the year, we'll continue to evaluate the magnitude and pace of share repurchase. And also just in terms of tax reform, as we've said, we do have more than half of our pretax income in the U.S. so a change in the U.S. grade definitely will be favorable to us. Really, the magnitude and our favorability will really depend on the totality of the legislation. We'll understand that more as that becomes more clear."

Definitely, something that will be providing this information on actual, but I think it's important thing is that we expect to generate $400 million to $500 million revenues in 3 years time, which in my opinion, are increased compared to previous estimations. And this related to the reaction of the market. We still see significant opportunities for growing that in international. And international, we have many countries where we still have on launching phase. But in the U.S., we see great opportunities. As I mentioned, we take Apoquel and Cytopoint combined, the number of the market share in terms of patients is about 50%, 52%.

Before I discuss our first quarter results, I want to share some overviews on the animal health industry. Our industry continues to showing steady and profitable growth in the mid-single digits with about 5%",1024,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. 
Before I discuss our first quarter results, I want to share some overviews on the animal health industry. Our industry continues to showing steady and profitable growth in the mid-single digits with about 5% to 6% growth for 2017, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. 
In 2017, companion animal and poultry are expected to grow faster than the industry average of 5% to 6% while cattle and swine will be going below those rates.
Companion animal growth will be driven by the increase of oral parasiticides and specialty care products in areas like dermatology, where our portfolio of Apoquel and Cytopoint is driven category growth. 
We should also see increased in clear consumption of chicken, driving growth in poultry while expecting slower-growth. Cattle and swine will benefit from positive trends, driven by additional [indiscernible] cattle, higher prices of milk and an increase of global pork production especially in China.
As I have mentioned many times in the past, the diversity of the animal health industry in terms of species, specific areas and geographies is an important part in prosperity and the profitable long-term performance.
And in this industry, Zoetis stands as the most diversified animal health company and continue delivering revenue growth above the industry average, thanks to the strength of our portfolio and business model.
We continue investing in our portfolio with a highly productive [indiscernible], resulting in your product launches and life cycle innovations. In fact, we have continued to spun our canine dermatology portfolio with internally discover and develop product Cytopoint.
Last week, Cytopoint became the first monoclonal antibody approved in European Union for veterinary use, after having been previously approved in the U.S. in December and in Canada in March. Cytopoint is the first monoclonal antibody therapy approved to help reduce the clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis such as itching in dogs. We are very excited for the early market adoption of this product in the U.S. and the treatment of choice it offers our veterinarian customers.
In February, we also announced that the European Commission granted us a full license for Stronghold Plus, a topical parasiticide for cat that combine sarolaner, the active ingredient in Simparica with selamectin, the active ingredient in our current Stronghold Plus and Evolution product lines.
We continue to look at the ways we use sarolaner as a plan for or other combinations and in other markets.
We also continue to pursue life cycle innovation that help ensure the availability of our revenue streams from approximately 300 Zoetis product lines.
In the first quarter, we received approval for new indications, formulations and geographic expansion of key livestock brands such as BOVI-SHIELD and Fostera vaccine families and the Excenel RTU and Excede anti-infective.
We continue to strengthen our portfolio in areas like diagnostics with the approvals in the U.S. for our Witness and Serelisa lines, both diagnostic test kits. You can read more about this in our press release.
We also combined our internal investment in R&D with external opportunities in both our core business of medicine and vaccine and the expansion of our portfolio in complementary spaces like diagnostics, genetics and bio devices.
You have heard me speak in the past about acquisitions like PHARMAQ in the fish market and SMB in the diagnostic space.
And just few weeks ago, we announced another investment in our core business for picking the pain in companion animals.
We announced an agreement to purchase Nexvet Biopharma, which is a mAb innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals.
This acquisition is expected to strengthen our R&D pipeline in this area and help to stay in our category leadership in chronic pain for dogs while expanding the market opportunity in cats. 
Innovations like these are being supported by other investment with additional savings from our operational efficiency program. And these have included in our guidance.
For example, field force expansion in key markets like China and Brazil, direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns for Apoquel and Simparica and capital investment in our manufacturing network to ensure we have the technology, capacity and capability to support our long-term revenue growth. All of these elements are working together to make sure we can capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us to continue growing revenues in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than savings.
In the first quarter of 2017, we continue to see positive results from our diverse portfolio, innovative new companion animal products and more a efficient cost structure.
Our revenue grew 6% operationally. And excluding the impact of product rationalization, which will also affect the second quarter results, our growth, which has been 8% in the first quarter.
We believe this growth is, again, faster than the market. The main driver of our revenue growth remained in companion animal products, which grew 12% operationally, driven largely by sales of Simparica, Apoquel and Cytopoint.  And our livestock portfolio do 3% operationally, which increases in the swine, cattle and fish being partially offset by declines in poultry products. Glenn will discuss more of the market drivers and details in his remarks.
We posted 10% operational growth in adjusted net income, once again, faster than the revenue growth. We saw a modest 2% operational growth in operating expenses and we made investments in the promotional support of new product launches, which were partially offset by savings from our operational efficiency initiative. We continue to stay focused on ways to simplify our operations and drive efficiency, including through the ongoing implementation of our supply network strategy.
In March, we announced plans to sell our manufacturing site in  [indiscernible], Brazil. We expect to complete that transaction during the second half of 2017. It will be the eighth site that has been either divested or exited as part of the operational efficiency problem and supply network strategy. We are pleased with a strong start to the year from a revenue and adjusted earnings perspective, and we are affirming our full year 2017 guidance.
With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our first quarter results. Glenn?"
215548781,426199996,1190331,"Zoetis Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Ramón. We performed well, again, in the first quarter based on our newest companion animal products and strength across many of our international markets, most notably China, Brazil, Australia and other emerging markets.Total company re",1706,"Thank you, Juan Ramón. We performed well, again, in the first quarter based on our newest companion animal products and strength across many of our international markets, most notably China, Brazil, Australia and other emerging markets.
Total company revenue grew 6% operationally, including a negative 2% impact from product rationalization. We saw no net impact from foreign exchange in the quarter, however, as our financial table show, there were some meaningful changes in some individual currency.
Of that 6% growth, 5% came from companion animal growth in Simparica, Apoquel and Cytopoint. Sales of Simparica were $29 million for the quarter and our total dermatology sales were $77 million.
Additional growth drivers for the quarter were 1% from the introduction of other new products and 2% impact from price increases. These growth drivers were partially offset by a negative 2% impact from product rationalization.
In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 10% operational growth in adjusted net income and 10% operational growth in adjusted diluted EPS. As we realize the benefits of our operational efficiency initiative, we have stay disciplined on expenses to drive more profitable revenue while making the appropriate investments to grow the value of our business. Juan Ramón spoke about these in terms of commercial and manufacturing investments.
Now let's discuss segment revenues. Our international segment generated operational revenue growth of 9% while the U.S. grew 4%. In the international segment, product rationalization had negative 4% impact on growth. China had an exceptionally strong quarter, growing 47% operationally. This growth is broad-based with contributions from both swine and companion animal with much of the growth coming from vaccine.
In swine, we continue to see strong market conditions with high pork prices to customers as well as greater adoption of animal health product that can help drive more efficiency in protein production.
In companion animal in China, our peer force is capitalizing on the growing pet population and increases in medicalization rates for pets.
Brazil is also a strong contributor in the quarter, growing 15% operationally with our price increases driving growth across our portfolio there.
Significant growth in livestock benefited from strong market conditions for beef producers and new companion animal products drove higher sales with Simparic, and it's know in Brazil, getting off to a strong start from its launch in the fourth quarter.
Our growth in both China and Brazil was aided by field force expansions in lead markets, which we have discussed before.
Mexico made a significant contribution this quarter as well with 10% operational growth. And our other emerging markets category grew 14% despite a significant impact from our product rationalization.
Shifting to developed markets. Australia grew 10%, drawing on performance in several key brands in cattle, sheep and companion animals as well as price increases and growth in Simparica and Apoquel.
[indiscernible] Japan also contributed to growth in the quarter while France declined 15% primarily due to the comparison to a strong Q1 2016. We are expecting France to return to growth in the second quarter. 
To summarize. Very strong growth in our international business is coming from a number of sources, including strong market trends, strategic investments and our success in bringing new value-added products to market. 
Turning to the U.S. Revenue grew 4%. Companion animal grew 10% in the quarter while being offset by a decline of 2% in livestock. The livestock decline were due to our swine business, where the timing of customer purchases had a negative impact in the quarter, and we continue to see competitive pressure on our vaccine franchise. 
In the U.S., we have made some changes to our Fostera, TCV and [indiscernible] vaccine and based on a recent launch comparative trial, we believe this products should be well received by customers and make us more competitive in this space.
The decline in our swine business was partially offset by growth in poultry, where we've seen higher sales of antibiotic alternatives such as Zoamix.
Our cattle business in the U.S. was flat for the quarter as an increase in the herd side is contributing to growth in our reproductive franchise. Performance was also supported by growth in ACTOGAIN and [indiscernible] franchise, which was offset by a higher mix of low-risk cattle moving to [indiscernible].
Our medicated [indiscernible] of sales, both cattle and swine, were negatively impacted in the first quarter by livestock producers implementation of the veterinarian seat directive. This impacted U.S. livestock growth by about 3% as we continue to work with our customers on the implementations of VFD.
Companion animals sales grew 10% primarily due to the launches of Simparica and Cytopoint as well as growth in Apoquel. This growth is partially offset by initial sales into expanded distributor relationships in the prior year quarter.
We are pleased so far with the performance of Simparica in the first spring buying season that it was fully available in the U.S. We've initiated direct-to-consumer and additional promotional campaigns, which we believe will help build upon the success we've seen so far.
In U.S. dermatology, sales were $57 million for the quarter. Cytopoint has been well received in its full first full quarter with a full USDA license and Apoquel sustaining the base it built through the second half of last year.
As we regain more experience with the full supply of our dermatology portfolio throughout a calendar year, we do believe there will be seasonality to the revenue with the second and third quarter dermatology revenue being higher than the first and fourth quarters. 
Overall, we continue to hear very positive feedback from our customers about Apoquel and Cytopoint. With the launch of additional promotional campaigns and BTC advertising, we expect acceleration of sales in the coming quarter.
With a continued strong performance in the U.S. and the prospect for additional growth in international markets, we believe our global dermatology portfolio can grow to between $400 million and $500 million in the next 3 years.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 64.4% declined approximately 300 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis and were sequentially flat with the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Coming into 2017, we have made additional cost improvements in our manufacturing network. 
In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized higher costs associated with previously produced inventory, which depressed our gross margin. This will also negatively impact Q2.
As we progress into the second half of the year, our results will fully reflect more of the impact of our manufacturing cost improvement. 
In addition, Q1 2016 contains some favorable items and Q1 2017 gross margin was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange versus last year. The first quarter results for adjusted gross margin are in line with our expectation, and we reaffirmed our adjusted cost of sales guidance for the year.
Adjusted SG&A grew by 2% in the quarter with higher promotional expenses to support new product launches and higher penetration of Apoquel, offsetting expense reductions from the operational efficiency initiatives.
Adjusted R&D was flat for the quarter with an increase in project spending, offsetting fixed expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiative.
Adjusted other income included lower foreign exchange losses compared with the prior year and a positive impact of a legal victory in Norway for our PHARMAQ business. This single win will allow us to launch the vaccine for pancreatic disease in the world's largest farmed salmon market this year.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 28%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly improved in the prior year due to the realization of benefits that resulted from operational changes implemented in the third quarter last year. It also reflects the effects of discrete items, including a small benefit from divesting and exercise of employee equity awards.
The year-over-year improvement in our adjusted effective tax rate was a significant driver of adjusted net income growth of 10% operationally.
Of note, our onetime cash costs have come down significantly over time as we are moving on the efforts to stand up our company and execute on our operational efficiency initiative. 
Now moving to guidance for full year 2017. The year is off to a good start price, particularly at revenue. We are reaffirming our previous guidance and expect accelerated growth in adjusted net income as we get into the second half of the the year primarily due to the cost of sales trends I discussed earlier. 
As I said in our fourth quarter call, we expect slower income growth in the first half of the year and our current expectations are consistent with that view.
For the year, we continue to expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 15% to 20%.
Our guidance for adjusted EPR of approximately 30% is based on current U.S. tax law and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington.
With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S, a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate will have a meaningful benefit to us.
In the first quarter, we repurchased $125 million in shares and our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchase completed through Q1.
Just to summarize before we go to Q&A. We're off to a good start to the year with continued momentum in the areas we expected such as new companion animal products in market like China and Brazil. We see a good runway for continued growth that is in line with or faster than the market based on our diverse portfolio and recently launched products. Our operational efficiency program has been fully implemented at this point and is expected to achieve more than $300 million in savings in 2017.  We will continue to do some of these savings both internally and externally to support sound investments in our business and return excess capital to shareholders. And we are reaffirming our outlook for 2017 and continue to project the stronger second half to achieve our full year targets.

Also in the U.S, the [indiscernible] and stock growth are back to profitability. So all of these are indicating that the cattle business are showing positive signs. For the year, we expect for Zoetis that the cattle will be growing mid-single digits, which is positive. And also, the positive element that we have seen that the consumption of beef is also growing, driven in some part because of China consumption. But this also accelerate in the export, which also helping producers to capitalize on the investment that they have been making in the last year. So we see that in the cattle business, will be showing the positive trend. In general for the market and also positive for Zoetis. We understand that in the first quarter, we had some challenge, especially in the U.S. The challenge came from mild winter. It also generated low risk profile for animals and then this affected our premium antibiotics. The other impact that we had there in the first quarter in cattle was related to the implementation of the veterinary seat directive that created some challenge in the cattle, especially in the small customers that they were not having veterinarians associated with this operation.

Definitely, what we see with the acquisition of Nexvet, we don't get into any details of products or timing of launches. So definitely, the innovations that we have seen at the Nexvet in terms of monoclonal antibody combined with the expertise that we have developed with Cytopoint and the manufacturing capabilities that we also developed at the time of Cytopoint, there will be a significant opportunity in combining Nexvet's capabilities with our capabilities. On top of that, we have very strong presence and knowledge on how to commercialize monoclonal antibody, and we see a significant opportunity of bringing to the market new options in terms of pain. Still, pain is unmet need in the companion animal market and definitely we see another opportunity of expanding the market with the interaction of monoclonal antibodies for cats. So we see that it has significant strategic rationale on this acquisition, and we feel also that this will generate significant value to us right this over time."

We expect that these antibiotics will be replaced by vaccines. PHARMAQ, it's leader in terms of developing vaccines. We are very pleased with the introduction of a new vaccine in Chille or SRS, which is also helping the reduction of antibiotic use in this country. But then the next opportunity should be China, Vietnam and other countries in where already they are #1 in terms of farmed fish production. And again, so we are working on developing vaccines, that we'll be targeting these countries. Both the results of the legal litigation in Norway is offering to us the opportunity of launching a new vaccine for pancreatic disease, which is very important in Norway. It is also helping us really to support the rest of the portfolio in Norway. We communicated that in 2017, we expect to generate $125 million, that will be a significant growth. In the first quarter also, we show very positive growth for PHARMAQ, and we are expecting for the year to generate more than 30% growth in terms of PHARMAQ.

And we think that this 12%, it's probably a sign that we will see for the rest of the year. We should also have the benefit of the growth of Apoquel, mainly coming from also the full introduction of international market where now, they are -- some of the market, they're now at the launching phase. We also expect that Apoquel in the U.S. will continue growing. But now more than Apoquel, I think it's important to discuss about the dermatology portfolio, including Apoquel and Cytopoint. But we talked about Apoquel in the U.S. for instance, we are very pleased with the level of penetration in clinics. It's about 94%, which is very good. But we only have 49% market share in terms of patients. So we still see opportunities for continued growing and painting the shares from [indiscernible] but this still accounts for 30% of patients. Cytopoint, it's definitely has been very well accepted by the market, but still very low market share in terms of patients, only 5%. But going also very fast in terms of authorization. So both products will drive growth and very important also Simparica in where we have seen very positive interaction of results. Now we have the benefit of this year of enjoying the full vision, so we have the total there, and we have seen that this are performing extremely well. And one of the things that we've seen that is also helping that is the correlation with distribution, and we expect also that in the next coming months, we'll see the impact also of our DTC campaign. So in summary, we expect that this 12% growth in companion animal will be maintained for the year."

We came in at about 28% in Q1, really, driven by: A, some discrete favorable items, and also the recognition of some of the benefits related to employee stock options and restricted stock units and the fact of those in the quarter.

But maybe it will be important to provide some details on the different species in livestock, starting with swine. We expect mid- to low single digits, and we expect that the PCV2 vaccine will help also to gain momentum in terms of revenues. We also think that the swine business in the U.S., it's also having the benefit of high exports. The exports are growing 18% in the U.S. and this is also helping producers to generate profitable results. And we are now, in our opinion, having the portfolio that will be generating growth in the rest of the year. In the case of poultry -- well, poultry we expect that the market will be showing very little growth. But on the contrary, Zoetis will be generating positive growth and they're growing faster than the market in poultry in the U.S. And finally, in cattle. In cattle, we face some challenge in the first quarter. The challenge of milder winter, lower risk profile that also had an impact in our premium anti-infective. Also as I mentioned implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive that also have an impact in some of our medicated feed additives. We expect that all these challenge in implementation that affected small producers will be managed in the future. And this will help also to have the full use of products in the coming months. In the case of [indiscernible] positive for cattle, that makes us positive about this segment. Prices are increasing and as I mentioned, the future of prices are hitting highest in the stock. Also, the placement of the feedlot increased by 6% and very positive also. The animals are now moved with medium-sized compared to heavy size in the future, which is also increasing the reach profile of these animals. And again, another indicator which is positive in cattle is that [indiscernible] and stoker are back to profit. So overall, we think that the cattle market are having positive prospects, and we have the portfolio in our company also to generate positive growth in the rest of the year."

We also aggressively look business development as well as an area. In terms of dividend, we'll continue to grow our dividend pretty much at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income and really where it will exhibit flexibility in terms of returning capital to shareholders will be share repurchase. So we recently announced $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We indicated that was flexible in nature. Just for context, in Q1, we repurchased $125 million in share and as we go throughout the year, we'll continue to evaluate the magnitude and pace of share repurchase. And also just in terms of tax reform, as we've said, we do have more than half of our pretax income in the U.S. so a change in the U.S. grade will definitely be favorable to us.

215548781,426199996,1190801,"Zoetis Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our first quarter results, I want to share some overviews on the animal health industry. Our industry continues to showing steady and profitable growth in the mid-single digits with about 5%",1028,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. 
Before I discuss our first quarter results, I want to share some overviews on the animal health industry. Our industry continues to showing steady and profitable growth in the mid-single digits with about 5% to 6% growth for 2017, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. 
In 2017, companion animal and poultry are expected to grow faster than the industry average of 5% to 6% while cattle and swine will be going below those rates.
Companion animal growth will be driven by the increase of oral parasiticides and specialty care products in areas like dermatology, where our portfolio of Apoquel and Cytopoint is driven category growth. 
We should also see increased in [ clear ] consumption of chicken, driving growth in poultry while expecting slower-growth. Cattle and swine will benefit from positive trends, driven by additional [indiscernible] cattle, higher prices of milk and an increase of global pork production especially in China.
As I have mentioned many times in the past, the diversity of the animal health industry in terms of species, specific areas and geographies is an important part in prosperity and the profitable long-term performance.
And in this industry, Zoetis stands as the most diversified animal health company and continue delivering revenue growth above the industry average, thanks to the strength of our portfolio and business model.
We continue investing in our portfolio with a highly productive [indiscernible], resulting in new product launches and life cycle innovations. In fact, we have continued to spun our canine dermatology portfolio with internally discover and develop product Cytopoint.
Last week, Cytopoint became the first monoclonal antibody approved in European Union for veterinary use, after having been previously approved in the U.S. in December and in Canada in March. Cytopoint is the first monoclonal antibody therapy approved to help reduce the clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis such as itching in dogs. We are very excited for the early market adoption of this product in the U.S. and the treatment of choice it offers our veterinarian customers.
In February, we also announced that the European Commission granted us a full license for Stronghold Plus, a topical parasiticide for cat that combine sarolaner, the active ingredient in Simparica with selamectin, the active ingredient in our current Stronghold Plus and Evolution product lines.
We continue to look at the ways we use sarolaner as a plan for or other combinations and in other markets.
We also continue to pursue life cycle innovation that help ensure the availability of our revenue streams from approximately 300 Zoetis product lines.
In the first quarter, we received approval for new indications, formulations and geographic expansion of key livestock brands such as BOVI-SHIELD and Fostera vaccine families and the Excenel RTU and EXCEDE anti-infective.
We continue to strengthen our portfolio in areas like diagnostics with the approvals in the U.S. for our Witness and Serelisa lines, both diagnostic test kits. You can read more about this in our press release.
We also combined our internal investment in R&D with external opportunities in both our core business of medicine and vaccine and the expansion of our portfolio in complementary spaces like diagnostics, genetics and bio devices.
You have heard me speak in the past about acquisitions like PHARMAQ in the fish market and SMB in the diagnostic space.
And just few weeks ago, we announced another investment in our core business for [ picking ] the pain in companion animals.
We announced an agreement to purchase Nexvet Biopharma, which is a mAb innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals.
This acquisition is expected to strengthen our R&D pipeline in this area and help to stay in our category leadership in chronic pain for dogs while expanding the market opportunity in cats. 
Innovations like these are being supported by other investment with additional savings from our operational efficiency program. And these have included in our guidance.
For example, field force expansion in key markets like China and Brazil, direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns for Apoquel and Simparica and capital investment in our manufacturing network to ensure we have the technology, capacity and capability to support our long-term revenue growth. All of these elements are working together to make sure we can capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us to continue growing revenues in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than savings.
In the first quarter of 2017, we continue to see positive results from our diverse portfolio, innovative new companion animal products and more a efficient cost structure.
Our revenue grew 6% operationally. And excluding the impact of product rationalization, which will also affect the second quarter results, our growth, which has been 8% in the first quarter.
We believe this growth is, again, faster than the market. The main driver of our revenue growth remained in companion animal products, which grew 12% operationally, driven largely by sales of Simparica, Apoquel and Cytopoint.  And our livestock portfolio do 3% operationally, which increases in the swine, cattle and fish being partially offset by declines in poultry products. Glenn will discuss more of the market drivers and details in his remarks.
We posted 10% operational growth in adjusted net income, once again, faster than the revenue growth. We saw a modest 2% operational growth in operating expenses and we made investments in the promotional support of new product launches, which were partially offset by savings from our operational efficiency initiative. We continue to stay focused on ways to simplify our operations and drive efficiency, including through the ongoing implementation of our supply network strategy.
In March, we announced plans to sell our manufacturing site in  [indiscernible], Brazil. We expect to complete that transaction during the second half of 2017. It will be the eighth site that has been either divested or exited as part of the operational efficiency problem and supply network strategy. We are pleased with a strong start to the year from a revenue and adjusted earnings perspective, and we are affirming our full year 2017 guidance.
With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our first quarter results. Glenn?"

We performed well, again, in the first quarter based on our newest companion animal products and strength across many of our international markets, most notably China, Brazil, Australia and other emerging markets.Total company re",1709,"Thank you, Juan Ramón. We performed well, again, in the first quarter based on our newest companion animal products and strength across many of our international markets, most notably China, Brazil, Australia and other emerging markets.
Total company revenue grew 6% operationally, including a negative 2% impact from product rationalization. We saw no net impact from foreign exchange in the quarter, however, as our financial table show, there were some meaningful changes in some individual currency.
Of that 6% growth, 5% came from companion animal growth in Simparica, Apoquel and Cytopoint. Sales of Simparica were $29 million for the quarter and our total dermatology sales were $77 million.
Additional growth drivers for the quarter were 1% from the introduction of other new products and 2% impact from price increases. These growth drivers were partially offset by a negative 2% impact from product rationalization.
In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 10% operational growth in adjusted net income and 10% operational growth in adjusted diluted EPS. As we realize the benefits of our operational efficiency initiative, we have stayed disciplined on expenses to drive more profitable revenue while making the appropriate investments to grow the value of our business. Juan Ramón spoke about these in terms of commercial and manufacturing investments.
Now let's discuss segment revenues. Our international segment generated operational revenue growth of 9% while the U.S. grew 4%. In the international segment, product rationalization had a negative 4% impact on growth. China had an exceptionally strong quarter, growing 47% operationally. This growth is broad-based with contributions from both swine and companion animal with much of the growth coming from vaccine.
In swine, we continue to see strong market conditions with high pork prices for customers as well as greater adoption of animal health product that can help drive more efficiency safe protein production.
In companion animal in China, our peer force is capitalizing on the growing pet population and increases in medicalization rates for pets.
Brazil is also a strong contributor in the quarter, growing 15% operationally with our price increases driving growth across our portfolio there.
Significant growth in livestock benefited from strong market conditions for beef producers and new companion animal products drove higher sales with Simparic, and it's know in Brazil, getting off to a strong start from its launch in the fourth quarter.
Our growth in both China and Brazil was aided by field force expansions in lead markets, which we have discussed before.
Mexico made a significant contribution this quarter as well with 10% operational growth. And our other emerging markets category grew 14% despite a significant impact from our product rationalization.
Shifting to developed markets. Australia grew 10%, drawing on performance in several key brands in cattle, sheep and companion animals as well as price increases and growth in Simparica and Apoquel.
Italy, Spain and Japan also contributed to growth in the quarter while France declined 15% primarily due to the comparison to a strong Q1 2016. We are expecting France to return to growth in the second quarter. 
To summarize. Very strong growth in our international business is coming from a number of sources, including strong market trends, strategic investments and our success in bringing new value-added products to market. 
Turning to the U.S. Revenue grew 4%. Companion animal grew 10% in the quarter while being offset by a decline of 2% in livestock. The livestock decline was due to our swine business, where the timing of customer purchases had a negative impact in the quarter, and we continue to see competitive pressure on our vaccine franchise. 
In the U.S., we have made some changes to our Fostera, TCV and [indiscernible] vaccine and based on a recent launch comparative trial, we believe this products should be well received by customers and make us more competitive in this space.
The decline in our swine business was partially offset by growth in poultry, where we've seen higher sales of antibiotic alternatives such as Zoamix.
Our cattle business in the U.S. was flat for the quarter as an increase in the herd side is contributing to growth in our reproductive franchise. Performance was also supported by growth in ACTOGAIN and our SYNOVEX franchise, which was offset by a higher mix of low-risk cattle moving to [indiscernible].
Our medicated feed additive sales, both cattle and swine, were negatively impacted in the first quarter by livestock producers implementation of the veterinarian seat directive. This impacted U.S. livestock growth by about 3% as we continue to work with our customers on the implementations of VFD.
Companion animals sales grew 10% primarily due to the launches of Simparica and Cytopoint as well as growth in Apoquel. This growth is partially offset by initial sales into expanded distributor relationships in the prior year quarter.
We are pleased so far with the performance of Simparica in the first spring buying season that it was fully available in the U.S. We've initiated direct-to-consumer and additional promotional campaigns, which we believe will help build upon the success we've seen so far.
In U.S. dermatology, sales were $57 million for the quarter. Cytopoint has been well received in its full first full quarter with a full USDA license and Apoquel sustaining the base it built through the second half of last year.
As we regain more experience with the full supply of our dermatology portfolio throughout a calendar year, we do believe there will be seasonality to the revenue with the second and third quarter dermatology revenue being higher than the first and fourth quarters. 
Overall, we continue to hear very positive feedback from our customers about Apoquel and Cytopoint. With the launch of additional promotional campaigns and BTC advertising, we expect acceleration of sales in the coming quarter.
With a continued strong performance in the U.S. and the prospect for additional growth in international markets, we believe our global dermatology portfolio can grow to between $400 million and $500 million in the next 3 years.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 64.4% declined approximately 300 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis and were sequentially flat with the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Coming into 2017, we have made additional cost improvements in our manufacturing network. 
In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized higher costs associated with previously produced inventory, which depressed our gross margin. This will also negatively impact Q2.
As we progress into the second half of the year, our results will fully reflect more of the impact of our manufacturing cost improvement. 
In addition, Q1 2016 contains some favorable items and Q1 2017 gross margin was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange versus last year. The first quarter results for adjusted gross margin are in line with our expectation, and we reaffirmed our adjusted cost of sales guidance for the year.
Adjusted SG&A grew by 2% in the quarter with higher promotional expenses to support new product launches and higher penetration of Apoquel, offsetting expense reductions from the operational efficiency initiatives.
Adjusted R&D was flat for the quarter with an increase in project spending, offsetting fixed expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiative.
Adjusted other income included lower foreign exchange losses compared with the prior year and a positive impact of a legal victory in Norway for our PHARMAQ business. This single win will allow us to launch a vaccine for pancreatic disease in the world's largest farmed salmon market this year.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 28%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly improved in the prior year due to the realization of benefits that resulted from operational changes implemented in the third quarter last year. It also reflects the effects of discrete items, including a small benefit from divesting and exercise of employee equity awards.
The year-over-year improvement in our adjusted effective tax rate was a significant driver of adjusted net income growth of 10% operationally.
Of note, our onetime cash costs have come down significantly over time as we are moving on the efforts to stand up our company and execute on our operational efficiency initiative. 
Now moving to guidance for full year 2017. The year is off to a good start price, particularly at revenue. We are reaffirming our previous guidance and expect accelerated growth in adjusted net income as we get into the second half of the year primarily due to the cost of sales trends I discussed earlier. 
As I said in our fourth quarter call, we expect slower income growth in the first half of the year and our current expectations are consistent with that view.
For the year, we continue to expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 15% to 20%.
Our guidance for adjusted ETR of approximately 30% is based on current U.S. tax law and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington.
With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S, a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate will have a meaningful benefit to us.
In the first quarter, we repurchased $125 million in shares and our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchase completed through Q1.
Just to summarize before we go to Q&A. We're off to a good start to the year with continued momentum in the areas we expected such as new companion animal products in market like China and Brazil. We see a good runway for continued growth that is in line with or faster than the market based on our diverse portfolio and recently launched products. Our operational efficiency program has been fully implemented at this point and is expected to achieve more than $300 million in savings in 2017.  We will continue to use some of these savings both internally and externally to support sound investments in our business and return excess capital to shareholders. And we are reaffirming our outlook for 2017 and continue to project the stronger second half to achieve our full year targets.

Also in the U.S, the [indiscernible] and stock growth are back to profitability. So all of these are indicating that the cattle business are showing positive signs. For the year, we expect for Zoetis that the cattle will be growing mid-single digits, which is positive.

But this also accelerate in the export, which also helping producers to capitalize on the investment that they have been making in the last year. So we see that in the cattle business, will be showing the positive trend. In general for the market and also positive for Zoetis. We understand that in the first quarter, we had some challenge, especially in the U.S. The challenge came from mild winter. It also generated low risk profile for animals and then this affected our premium antibiotics. The other impact that we had there in the first quarter in cattle was related to the implementation of the veterinary seat directive that created some challenge in the cattle, especially in the small customers that they were not having veterinarians associated with this operation. We expect also that this will be corrected in the coming months. But again, saw positive outlook for cattle, both in the U.S. and international.

Let me answer question on distribution and a little bit background on these question. So we launched many new products in companion animal and then with these launches, we decided to review the correlation with our distributors in the U.S. And then as a result of this review in 2016, we decided in agreement with our distributors also to include in their promotional portfolio our vaccines for companion animal. The result of this correlation was very positive for them and also for Zoetis. Then in 2017, we decided to expand this collaboration, not only to vaccines plus some other products that they weren't responsible before. Also to our parasiticide portfolio, revolution for parasitics and Simparica. All indicators are very positive. And now, thanks to our direct presence together with the support of distributors, we have been increasing significantly our sales voice. And in market that we know that are highly competitive. And this additional volume that has been generating through all these additional portfolio has been also supporting the rest of the portfolio, products that are affected by generic competition, but thanks to this new strategy, the field is performing in line with expectations. And we have not seen significant change on the strength of [indiscernible] but in 2017.

But then the next opportunity should be China, Vietnam and other countries in where already they are #1 in terms of farmed fish production. And again, so we are working on developing vaccines, that we'll be targeting these countries.

We should also have the benefit of the growth of Apoquel, mainly coming from also the full introduction of international market where now, they are -- some of the market, they're now at the launching phase. We also expect that Apoquel in the U.S. will continue growing. But now more than Apoquel, I think it's important to discuss about the dermatology portfolio, including Apoquel and Cytopoint. But we talked about Apoquel in the U.S. for instance, we are very pleased with the level of penetration in clinics. It's about 94%, which is very good. But we only have 49% market share in terms of patients. So we still see opportunities for continued growing and painting the shares from [indiscernible] but this still accounts for 30% of patients. Cytopoint, it's definitely has been very well accepted by the market, but still very low market share in terms of patients, only 5%. But growing also very fast in terms of authorization.

We came in at about 28% in Q1, really, driven by: A, some discrete favorable items, and also the recognition of some of the benefits related to employee stock options and restricted stock units and the tax effect of those in the quarter.

The exports are growing 18% in the U.S. and this is also helping producers to generate profitable results. And we are now, in our opinion, having the portfolio that will be generating growth in the rest of the year. In the case of poultry -- well, poultry we expect that the market will be showing very little growth. But on the contrary, Zoetis will be generating positive growth and they're growing faster than the market in poultry in the U.S. And finally, in cattle. In cattle, we face some challenge in the first quarter. The challenge of milder winter, lower risk profile that also had an impact in our premium anti-infective. Also as I mentioned implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive that also have an impact in some of our medicated feed additives. We expect that all these challenge in implementation that affected small producers will be managed in the future. And this will help also to have the full use of products in the coming months. In the case of [indiscernible] positive for cattle, that makes us positive about this segment. Prices are increasing and as I mentioned, the future of prices are hitting highest in the stock. Also, the placement of the feedlot increased by 6% and very positive also. The animals are now moved with medium-sized compared to heavy size in the future, which is also increasing the reach profile of these animals.

So we recently announced $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We indicated that was flexible in nature. Just for context, in Q1, we repurchased $125 million in share and as we go throughout the year, we'll continue to evaluate the magnitude and pace of share repurchase. And also just in terms of tax reform, as we've said, we do have more than half of our pretax income in the U.S. so a change in the U.S. rate will definitely be favorable to us.

Both the products are targeting the same type of medical conditions. It's true that Apoquel, they have more indications than the Cytopoint, but still, it's something that the market is understanding fully how to use this product, concerning the dogs, concerning pet owners, veterinarians and also the division of the veterinarians. So I think it's important that we are not trying now to identify how much will be coming from Apoquel, how much with Cytopoint. Definitely, something that will be providing this information on actual, but I think the important thing is that we expect to generate $400 million to $500 million revenues in 3-years time, which is in my opinion, are increased compared to previous estimations. And this related to the reaction of the market. We still see significant opportunities for growing that in international. And international, we have many countries in where we still are on launching phase. But in the U.S., we see great opportunities. As I mentioned, we take Apoquel and Cytopoint combined, the number of the market share in terms of patients is about 50%, 52%. So still we have a lot of opportunities for continuing growing in this area. We expect also that the growth also will come from increasing awareness of performance through our DTC campaign in the U.S. So we expect that there are still significant growing opportunities for our dermatology portfolio in both international and the U.S."

215548781,426199996,1194392,"Zoetis Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our first quarter results, I want to share some overviews on the animal health industry. Our industry continues to showing steady and profitable growth in the mid-single digits with about 5%",1028,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. 
Before I discuss our first quarter results, I want to share some overviews on the animal health industry. Our industry continues to showing steady and profitable growth in the mid-single digits with about 5% to 6% growth for 2017, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. 
In 2017, companion animal and poultry are expected to grow faster than the industry average of 5% to 6% while cattle and swine will be going below those rates.
Companion animal growth will be driven by the increase of oral parasiticides and specialty care products in areas like dermatology, where our portfolio of Apoquel and Cytopoint is driven category growth. 
We should also see increased in [ clear ] consumption of chicken, driving growth in poultry while expecting slower-growth. Cattle and swine will benefit from positive trends, driven by additional [indiscernible] cattle, higher prices of milk and an increase of global pork production especially in China.
As I have mentioned many times in the past, the diversity of the animal health industry in terms of species, specific areas and geographies is an important part in prosperity and the profitable long-term performance.
And in this industry, Zoetis stands as the most diversified animal health company and continue delivering revenue growth above the industry average, thanks to the strength of our portfolio and business model.
We continue investing in our portfolio with a highly productive [indiscernible], resulting in new product launches and life cycle innovations. In fact, we have continued to spun our canine dermatology portfolio with internally discover and develop product Cytopoint.
Last week, Cytopoint became the first monoclonal antibody approved in European Union for veterinary use, after having been previously approved in the U.S. in December and in Canada in March. Cytopoint is the first monoclonal antibody therapy approved to help reduce the clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis such as itching in dogs. We are very excited for the early market adoption of this product in the U.S. and the treatment of choice it offers our veterinarian customers.
In February, we also announced that the European Commission granted us a full license for Stronghold Plus, a topical parasiticide for cat that combine sarolaner, the active ingredient in Simparica with selamectin, the active ingredient in our current Stronghold Plus and Evolution product lines.
We continue to look at the ways we use sarolaner as a plan for or other combinations and in other markets.
We also continue to pursue life cycle innovation that help ensure the availability of our revenue streams from approximately 300 Zoetis product lines.
In the first quarter, we received approval for new indications, formulations and geographic expansion of key livestock brands such as BOVI-SHIELD and Fostera vaccine families and the Excenel RTU and EXCEDE anti-infective.
We continue to strengthen our portfolio in areas like diagnostics with the approvals in the U.S. for our Witness and Serelisa lines, both diagnostic test kits. You can read more about this in our press release.
We also combined our internal investment in R&D with external opportunities in both our core business of medicine and vaccine and the expansion of our portfolio in complementary spaces like diagnostics, genetics and bio devices.
You have heard me speak in the past about acquisitions like PHARMAQ in the fish market and SMB in the diagnostic space.
And just few weeks ago, we announced another investment in our core business for [ picking ] the pain in companion animals.
We announced an agreement to purchase Nexvet Biopharma, which is a mAb innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals.
This acquisition is expected to strengthen our R&D pipeline in this area and help to stay in our category leadership in chronic pain for dogs while expanding the market opportunity in cats. 
Innovations like these are being supported by other investment with additional savings from our operational efficiency program. And these have included in our guidance.
For example, field force expansion in key markets like China and Brazil, direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns for Apoquel and Simparica and capital investment in our manufacturing network to ensure we have the technology, capacity and capability to support our long-term revenue growth. All of these elements are working together to make sure we can capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us to continue growing revenues in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than savings.
In the first quarter of 2017, we continue to see positive results from our diverse portfolio, innovative new companion animal products and more a efficient cost structure.
Our revenue grew 6% operationally. And excluding the impact of product rationalization, which will also affect the second quarter results, our growth, which has been 8% in the first quarter.
We believe this growth is, again, faster than the market. The main driver of our revenue growth remained in companion animal products, which grew 12% operationally, driven largely by sales of Simparica, Apoquel and Cytopoint. And our livestock portfolio do 3% operationally, which increases in the swine, cattle and fish being partially offset by declines in poultry products. Glenn will discuss more of the market drivers and details in his remarks.
We posted 10% operational growth in adjusted net income, once again, faster than the revenue growth. We saw a modest 2% operational growth in operating expenses and we made investments in the promotional support of new product launches, which were partially offset by savings from our operational efficiency initiative. We continue to stay focused on ways to simplify our operations and drive efficiency, including through the ongoing implementation of our supply network strategy.
In March, we announced plans to sell our manufacturing site in [indiscernible], Brazil. We expect to complete that transaction during the second half of 2017. It will be the eighth site that has been either divested or exited as part of the operational efficiency problem and supply network strategy. We are pleased with a strong start to the year from a revenue and adjusted earnings perspective, and we are affirming our full year 2017 guidance.
With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our first quarter results. Glenn?"

We performed well, again, in the first quarter based on our newest companion animal products and strength across many of our international markets, most notably China, Brazil, Australia and other emerging markets.
Total company revenue grew 6% operationally, including a negative 2% impact from product rationalization. We saw no net impact from foreign exchange in the quarter, however, as our financial table show, there were some meaningful changes in some individual currency.
Of that 6% growth, 5% came from companion animal growth in Simparica, Apoquel and Cytopoint. Sales of Simparica were $29 million for the quarter and our total dermatology sales were $77 million.
Additional growth drivers for the quarter were 1% from the introduction of other new products and 2% impact from price increases. These growth drivers were partially offset by a negative 2% impact from product rationalization.
In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 10% operational growth in adjusted net income and 10% operational growth in adjusted diluted EPS. As we realize the benefits of our operational efficiency initiative, we have stayed disciplined on expenses to drive more profitable revenue while making the appropriate investments to grow the value of our business. Juan Ramón spoke about these in terms of commercial and manufacturing investments.
Now let's discuss segment revenues. Our international segment generated operational revenue growth of 9% while the U.S. grew 4%. In the international segment, product rationalization had a negative 4% impact on growth. China had an exceptionally strong quarter, growing 47% operationally. This growth is broad-based with contributions from both swine and companion animal with much of the growth coming from vaccine.
In swine, we continue to see strong market conditions with high pork prices for customers as well as greater adoption of animal health product that can help drive more efficiency safe protein production.
In companion animal in China, our peer force is capitalizing on the growing pet population and increases in medicalization rates for pets.
Brazil is also a strong contributor in the quarter, growing 15% operationally with our price increases driving growth across our portfolio there.
Significant growth in livestock benefited from strong market conditions for beef producers and new companion animal products drove higher sales with Simparic, and it's know in Brazil, getting off to a strong start from its launch in the fourth quarter.
Our growth in both China and Brazil was aided by field force expansions in lead markets, which we have discussed before.
Mexico made a significant contribution this quarter as well with 10% operational growth. And our other emerging markets category grew 14% despite a significant impact from our product rationalization.
Shifting to developed markets. Australia grew 10%, drawing on performance in several key brands in cattle, sheep and companion animals as well as price increases and growth in Simparica and Apoquel.
Italy, Spain and Japan also contributed to growth in the quarter while France declined 15% primarily due to the comparison to a strong Q1 2016. We are expecting France to return to growth in the second quarter. 
To summarize. Very strong growth in our international business is coming from a number of sources, including strong market trends, strategic investments and our success in bringing new value-added products to market. 
Turning to the U.S. Revenue grew 4%. Companion animal grew 10% in the quarter while being offset by a decline of 2% in livestock. The livestock decline was due to our swine business, where the timing of customer purchases had a negative impact in the quarter, and we continue to see competitive pressure on our vaccine franchise. 
In the U.S., we have made some changes to our Fostera, TCV and [indiscernible] vaccine and based on a recent launch comparative trial, we believe this products should be well received by customers and make us more competitive in this space.
The decline in our swine business was partially offset by growth in poultry, where we've seen higher sales of antibiotic alternatives such as Zoamix.
Our cattle business in the U.S. was flat for the quarter as an increase in the herd side is contributing to growth in our reproductive franchise. Performance was also supported by growth in ACTOGAIN and our SYNOVEX franchise, which was offset by a higher mix of low-risk cattle moving to [indiscernible].
Our medicated feed additive sales, both cattle and swine, were negatively impacted in the first quarter by livestock producers implementation of the veterinarian seat directive. This impacted U.S. livestock growth by about 3% as we continue to work with our customers on the implementations of VFD.
Companion animals sales grew 10% primarily due to the launches of Simparica and Cytopoint as well as growth in Apoquel. This growth is partially offset by initial sales into expanded distributor relationships in the prior year quarter.
We are pleased so far with the performance of Simparica in the first spring buying season that it was fully available in the U.S. We've initiated direct-to-consumer and additional promotional campaigns, which we believe will help build upon the success we've seen so far.
In U.S. dermatology, sales were $57 million for the quarter. Cytopoint has been well received in its full first full quarter with a full USDA license and Apoquel sustaining the base it built through the second half of last year.
As we regain more experience with the full supply of our dermatology portfolio throughout a calendar year, we do believe there will be seasonality to the revenue with the second and third quarter dermatology revenue being higher than the first and fourth quarters. 
Overall, we continue to hear very positive feedback from our customers about Apoquel and Cytopoint. With the launch of additional promotional campaigns and BTC advertising, we expect acceleration of sales in the coming quarter.
With a continued strong performance in the U.S. and the prospect for additional growth in international markets, we believe our global dermatology portfolio can grow to between $400 million and $500 million in the next 3 years.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 64.4% declined approximately 300 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis and were sequentially flat with the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Coming into 2017, we have made additional cost improvements in our manufacturing network. 
In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized higher costs associated with previously produced inventory, which depressed our gross margin. This will also negatively impact Q2.
As we progress into the second half of the year, our results will fully reflect more of the impact of our manufacturing cost improvement. 
In addition, Q1 2016 contains some favorable items and Q1 2017 gross margin was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange versus last year. The first quarter results for adjusted gross margin are in line with our expectation, and we reaffirmed our adjusted cost of sales guidance for the year.
Adjusted SG&A grew by 2% in the quarter with higher promotional expenses to support new product launches and higher penetration of Apoquel, offsetting expense reductions from the operational efficiency initiatives.
Adjusted R&D was flat for the quarter with an increase in project spending, offsetting fixed expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiative.
Adjusted other income included lower foreign exchange losses compared with the prior year and a positive impact of a legal victory in Norway for our PHARMAQ business. This single win will allow us to launch a vaccine for pancreatic disease in the world's largest farmed salmon market this year.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 28%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly improved in the prior year due to the realization of benefits that resulted from operational changes implemented in the third quarter last year. It also reflects the effects of discrete items, including a small benefit from divesting and exercise of employee equity awards.
The year-over-year improvement in our adjusted effective tax rate was a significant driver of adjusted net income growth of 10% operationally.
Of note, our onetime cash costs have come down significantly over time as we are moving on the efforts to stand up our company and execute on our operational efficiency initiative. 
Now moving to guidance for full year 2017. The year is off to a good start price, particularly at revenue. We are reaffirming our previous guidance and expect accelerated growth in adjusted net income as we get into the second half of the year primarily due to the cost of sales trends I discussed earlier. 
As I said in our fourth quarter call, we expect slower income growth in the first half of the year and our current expectations are consistent with that view.
For the year, we continue to expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 15% to 20%.
Our guidance for adjusted ETR of approximately 30% is based on current U.S. tax law and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington.
With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S, a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate will have a meaningful benefit to us.
In the first quarter, we repurchased $125 million in shares and our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchase completed through Q1.
Just to summarize before we go to Q&A. We're off to a good start to the year with continued momentum in the areas we expected such as new companion animal products in market like China and Brazil. We see a good runway for continued growth that is in line with or faster than the market based on our diverse portfolio and recently launched products. Our operational efficiency program has been fully implemented at this point and is expected to achieve more than $300 million in savings in 2017. We will continue to use some of these savings both internally and externally to support sound investments in our business and return excess capital to shareholders. And we are reaffirming our outlook for 2017 and continue to project the stronger second half to achieve our full year targets.

And also in Brazil now, we have also -- almost all our portfolio approved and products like Simparica has been extremely well accepted by the market and are generating very positive growth. Glenn?"

Also in the U.S, the [indiscernible] and stock growth are back to profitability. So all of these are indicating that the cattle business are showing positive signs. For the year, we expect for Zoetis that the cattle will be growing mid-single digits, which is positive. And also, the positive element that we have seen that the consumption of beef is also growing, driven in some part because of China consumption. But this also accelerate in the export, which also helping producers to capitalize on the investment that they have been making in the last year. So we see that in the cattle business, will be showing the positive trend. In general for the market and also positive for Zoetis. We understand that in the first quarter, we had some challenge, especially in the U.S. The challenge came from mild winter. It also generated low risk profile for animals and then this affected our premium antibiotics. The other impact that we had there in the first quarter in cattle was related to the implementation of the veterinary seat directive that created some challenge in the cattle, especially in the small customers that they were not having veterinarians associated with this operation. We expect also that this will be corrected in the coming months. But again, saw positive outlook for cattle, both in the U.S. and international.

And the answer to the U.S. livestock, I think we expect growth in the U.S. for our livestock. But maybe it will be important to provide some details on the different species in livestock, starting with swine. We expect mid- to low single digits, and we expect that the PCV2 vaccine will help also to gain momentum in terms of revenues. We also think that the swine business in the U.S., it's also having the benefit of high exports. The exports are growing 18% in the U.S. and this is also helping producers to generate profitable results. And we are now, in our opinion, having the portfolio that will be generating growth in the rest of the year. In the case of poultry -- well, poultry we expect that the market will be showing very little growth. But on the contrary, Zoetis will be generating positive growth and they're growing faster than the market in poultry in the U.S. And finally, in cattle. In cattle, we face some challenge in the first quarter. The challenge of milder winter, lower risk profile that also had an impact in our premium anti-infective. Also as I mentioned implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive that also have an impact in some of our medicated feed additives. We expect that all these challenge in implementation that affected small producers will be managed in the future. And this will help also to have the full use of products in the coming months. In the case of [indiscernible] positive for cattle, that makes us positive about this segment. Prices are increasing and as I mentioned, the future of prices are hitting highest in the stock. Also, the placement of the feedlot increased by 6% and very positive also. The animals are now moved with medium-sized compared to heavy size in the future, which is also increasing the reach profile of these animals. And again, another indicator which is positive in cattle is that [indiscernible] and stoker are back to profit. So overall, we think that the cattle market are having positive prospects, and we have the portfolio in our company also to generate positive growth in the rest of the year."

In terms of how we'll prioritize that additional availability, A, we'll continue to look internally for areas of high-growth and investment. We also aggressively look business development as well as an area. In terms of dividend, we'll continue to grow our dividend pretty much at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income and really where it will exhibit flexibility in terms of returning capital to shareholders will be share repurchase. So we recently announced $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We indicated that was flexible in nature. Just for context, in Q1, we repurchased $125 million in share and as we go throughout the year, we'll continue to evaluate the magnitude and pace of share repurchase. And also just in terms of tax reform, as we've said, we do have more than half of our pretax income in the U.S. so a change in the U.S. rate will definitely be favorable to us. Really, the magnitude and our favorability will really depend on the totality of the legislation. We'll understand that more as that becomes more clear."

Definitely, something that will be providing this information on actual, but I think the important thing is that we expect to generate $400 million to $500 million revenues in 3 years’ time, which is in my opinion, are increased compared to previous estimations. And this related to the reaction of the market. We still see significant opportunities for growing that in international. And international, we have many countries in where we still are on launching phase. But in the U.S., we see great opportunities. As I mentioned, we take Apoquel and Cytopoint combined, the number of the market share in terms of patients is about 50%, 52%.

As in previous quarters, the innovation we bring to the market and the diversity of our portfolio across geographies [indiscernible] are also the consistency of our financial results. Our innovation include the recent introduction of new products like Cytopoint, Simparica and [indiscernible] and lifecycle innovation that [indiscernible] develop across our approximately [ 300 ] product lines.
Our diverse portfolio help us overcome economic cycles and [indiscernible] with other political situations and weather conditions that can affect market, species or product categories. We are seeing this diversity once again in the second quarter. And along with the excellent execution of our Zoetis team and our single focus on animal health, all these factors helped deliver excellent results.
In the second quarter, our revenue grew 6% operationally. And excluding the impact of product rationalizations that we have discussed before, our operational growth would have been 7%. We expect this will be the last quarter that we see any significant impact from the rationalizations as those efforts and comparisons are largely complete.
The main driver of our second quarter revenue growth remains companion animal products, which grew 10% operationally, driven largely by sales of our industry-leading dermatology portfolio consisting of Apoquel and Cytopoint and our new oral parasiticide, Simparica. 
In the U.S., companion animal growth grew [ 7% ], and in international markets, they grew 15% operationally. We continue to see product penetration of new products in key countries outside of the U.S., [indiscernible], Japan, Brazil and Canada. 
We have been supporting growth for Simparica and Apoquel with directed to consumer advertising that we started in the second quarter in the U.S. We have made similar efforts in Brazil.
Initial report on DTC in the U.S. are positive, and we look forward to analyzing the more data as we evaluated the full year impact. 
Our total dermatology portfolio has shown significant growth, achieving our first ever quarter of more than $100 million in sales. We continue to deal disease awareness to our DTC campaign and expect to expand the market. 
Our latest data shows that [ 85% ] of dogs with dermatology problems in the U.S. are treated with Apoquel or Cytopoint, up from [ 52% ] in the first quarter. 
Cytopoint has gotten good traction in the U.S. this year. And in new countries, we are conducting an early experience program and expect to fully launch in September. We believe the earlier adoption and [indiscernible] reaction in the U.S. is a good indication of the success we can achieve in the European markets.
Although Simparica sales were lower than in the first quarter, we continue to track well with our expectation for the year in this highly competitive market. 
In the U.S., we have seen sales from clinic, and pet owners grew market share in the beginning of the year. 
Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 3% operationally, with increases in cattle and poultry products being partially offset by a decline in fish products. Our swine product sales in the quarter were flat. 
In the cattle market, we reported 4% of operational growth. Export demand for U.S. beef has been increasing due to the lower average retail prices, and we continue to see positive signs in other major beef producers in the market like Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Australia and Canada.
In the case of poultry products, we grew 4% operationally. We have seen strong growth in the U.S. driven mostly for our broad portfolio and expertise to help customers address a range of our consumers and retailer references. 
Combining our vaccines with product side as [indiscernible], we are helping certain producers shift to nonperiodic [indiscernible] production.
In swine products, although we have taken action with [indiscernible] our vaccine portfolio in the U.S., we are still showing a decline in U.S. sales. 
In international, however, our swine business is growing very strongly led by China, the world's largest pork market. 
In fish produce in the second quarter, we have seen a decline of 5% operationally, mainly due to lower uptake of [indiscernible] in Chile. Nevertheless, we still expect double-digit growth for fish produce this year, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects for this business.
We fostered 11% operational growth in adjusted net income once again faster than revenue growth of 6% and in line of our value proposition to shareholders grow adjusted net income faster than revenue.
And the full implementation of our efficiency initiative is enabling us to invest in additional promotional activities like DTC while showing only a modest 1% operational growth in operating expenses. 
With our increasing cash flow, we continue to look at other investment we can make to support our future growth. One key area is ensuring reliable, high-quality supply to drive our growth. As part of our supply network strategy, we expect to complete the sales of our [indiscernible] plant in Brazil in the [ fourth ] quarter. At the same time, we are planning to expand our vaccine plant and invest in manufacturing capacity for other innovative products. We will share more details as plan moves further along. 
While new products like Simparica and Cytopoint may get well-deserved headline, we also focus on lifecycle innovation to keep established brands, delivering value to customers over [ decades ]. For example, Zoetis received approval in May from the NDA for [indiscernible] workups. This lead [indiscernible] was first approved in the U.S. in 1994 and it provides a broad spectrum of treatment for various infections in dogs and cats. [indiscernible] joined the regional [indiscernible] and drug formulations, which will continue to market. And our internal innovation is complemented by M&A opportunities. 
Last week, we completed the acquisition of Nexvet Biopharma, an innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals in the regimen of chronic pain and other therapeutic areas. This attrition demonstrates how we use external innovation in key technologies and strategy areas to support future growth. Nexvet is present in our R&D pipeline in monoclonal antibodies and help us sustain our leadership in chronic pain management for companion animals, an area valued at an estimated $400 million a year and which is poised for innovation with the new monoclonal antibody set therapies. We are moving ahead with the work of integrating Nexvet into our existing research and manufacturing operations in order to advance with their promising product candidate. 
In the first half of the year now behind us, we are tracking to our expectations. We are pleased with a strong start to the year and we are increasing our full year 2017 guidance for revenue and net income based on foreign currency changes and our continued confidence. 
With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our second quarter results and full year guidance. Glenn?"

We had another solid quarter based on the strong growth of dermatology portfolio and other recently launched companion animal products as well as [indiscernible] growth in our global livestock portfoli",1790,"Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. 
We had another solid quarter based on the strong growth of dermatology portfolio and other recently launched companion animal products as well as [indiscernible] growth in our global livestock portfolio, which was balanced across our U.S. and international business segments. 
Total company revenue grew 6% operationally, which exclude the negative 1% impact from foreign exchange. Breaking down that 6% growth, 6% came from dermatology and other new products and 1% came from our in line portfolio with the product rationalization having a negative 1% impact on operational growth. 
As Juan Ramón mentioned, our dermatology portfolio reached a considerable milestone with sales in the quarter of $102 million. As we have said in the past, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis in the U.S. with a softer Q1 and Q4. As expected, Simparica sales were lower sequentially at $20 million. This was driven primarily by the U.S. and the timing of distributed purchases in Q1 in anticipation of the [indiscernible] tick season. 
Internationally, we saw strong growth sequentially in Simparica with additional penetration in most major markets.
In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 11% operational growth in adjusted net income and 12% operational growth in adjusted diluted EPS. Overall, we had another quarter of solid top line performance and we again grew our bottom line faster than our sales. We continue to deliver steady, long-term growth in our attractive and stable industry.
Our ability to bring innovative and differentiated products to market combined with our diverse portfolio and leading commercial capability gives a sustainable foundation for future long-term growth. 
Now let's discuss segment revenues. Our international segment generated operational revenue growth of 7% while the U.S. grew 5%. In the international segment, product rationalization has negative 1% impact on growth. 
But let me highlight a few markets. China delivered another strong quarter growing [ 14% ] operationally with growth coming from both our livestock and companion animal businesses. 
In livestock in China, we benefited from solid market dynamics in swine, including favorable core prices through the first half of the year. We expect some softening in this trend during the second half of the year. However, the continued modernization of production will drive greater long-term growth based on the use of vaccines and medicines to ensure safe, high-quality food supply. 
In companion animal, our recently expanded sales force continues to partner with local veterinarian to improve medicalization rates and increased routine care for pets in China. 
In Brazil, we grew 8% operationally in the quarter behind the strength of our cattle and companion animal businesses. Investments and sales force expansion and favorable market condition contributed to growth in cattle despite recent industry and government headline. And companion animal growth in Brazil was driven by new product introductions, including Simparica and Apoquel.
Japan also made a significant contribution in the quarter, growing 17% operationally over the same quarter last year. Apoquel sales began to normalize with distributors and better reflect the strong underlying demand in the local market. 
As a reminder, there was significant distributor stocking in Q3 of 2016 when we initially launched Apoquel.
Key markets in Europe performed well in the quarter as the U.K., Germany, France, Spain and Italy all exhibited operational growth. The U.K. and Germany led the way at 12% and 8% operational growth, respectively. Growth in the U.K. was driven primarily by Apoquel while Germany's performance was due to strength in both Apoquel and Simparica. 
To summarize, very strong growth in our international business coming from a number of sources, including strong market trends, strategic investments and our success in bringing new value-added products to market. 
Turning to the U.S. Revenue grew 5% in the second quarter. Companion animal grew 7% and livestock grew 3%. Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio, Simparica and a number of other new product launches. U.S. dermatology sales were $74 million for the quarter with Cytopoint sales reaching [ $15 ] million, exhibiting nice sequential growth as clinic penetration and dosing accelerate. As Juan Ramón said, patient share also continues to grow for Apoquel and Cytopoint. 
As I mentioned earlier, Simparica sales were lower this quarter then last but still in line with expectation. Our increased selling and promotional activity will lay the groundwork for continued revenue growth in this highly competitive market. We will continue to evaluate the performance of our direct-to-consumer promotional campaign for Apoquel and Simparica with earlier indications suggesting that we are on track to meet our business objective. 
Additional contributions to companion animal growth came from new products, including [indiscernible], which recently received approval for the treatment of dogs with heart worm. With the introduction of [indiscernible], [indiscernible] now offers veterinarian of full canine heart worm product portfolio, including prevention, detection and treatment. 
Moving U.S. livestock. Sales grew 3% in the quarter due primarily to our cattle and poultry businesses. Our cattle business return to growth this quarter due to the success of product, which is ACTOGAIN and SYNOVEX, while sales of our premium animal antibiotics continue to be impacted by healthier animals moving into the feedstock.
As certain poultry producers expand the antibiotic as a label, our portfolio of medicated [indiscernible] for these criteria are doing well and contributed to poultry growth in the U.S. We work closely with our customers to provide the necessary product and technical assistance to help them switch over when they choose. 
Our swine business declined again this quarter in the U.S., primarily due to competition for our Fostera PCV and [indiscernible] vaccine. Our updated vaccine has seen modest uptick with medium and smaller producers and will continue to work with customers to gain acceptance. 
Finally, both our cattle and swine businesses were impacted by the implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, which negatively impacted our medicated feed performance as producers are adjusting through the new regulation and how to adapt their protocols. 
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 65.6% decreased approximately 230 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, and on a sequential quarter basis, improved 120 basis points from the first quarter of this year. 
As I mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, in 2017, we have made additional cost improvements in our manufacturing network. As a result, in the first quarter of 2017, we recognized higher costs associated with previously produced inventory, which depressed our gross margin. This change also had a negative impact on our second quarter margin, which we had previously indicated. 
The second quarter results for adjusted gross margin, while showing improvement over the first quarter, are slightly below our initial expectations. We have been working to improve our inventory management, including reductions in the level of inventory write-offs we incur. While we still expect to improve in this area for 2017, the magnitude of improvement is less than we had expected and will continue to be an area of focus in the future. 
Gross margin was also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange in the quarter.
Adjusted SG&A grew by 1% in the quarter with higher investment in our DTC advertising campaign offsetting the expense reductions in other areas. Adjusted R&D declined 1% operationally for the quarter due to the timing of project spending and fixed expense reduction from our operational efficiency initiative. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 29%. The tax rate in the quarter has significantly improved from the prior year primarily due to the impact of operational changes implemented in the third quarter of last year. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, we generated 11% operational growth in adjusted net income for the quarter. 
Moving to guidance for full year 2017. This year, we continue to perform in line with our expectation with certain upside and downside, particularly with tax and cost of goods sold. 
For the year, we still expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35%. 
Since our last update in May, changes in FX rates in several markets are favorable to revenue and they're increasing both the lower end and higher end of the range as a result. We have also narrowed the range for revenue towards the high end of our guidance by $25 million to reflect our performance to date and our confidence in the remainder of the year. 
Our guidance for the range of cost of goods sold for the year has moved from 32% to 33% of revenue to approximately 33%. As we progress into the second half of the year, our results will more fully reflect the impact of our manufacturing cost improvement. Our updated view, however, also reflects the higher expense for inventory charges that I discussed earlier as well as unfavorable mix and foreign exchange. 
For SG&A, we're increasing the lower end of our range and maintaining the high end consistent with the change in our revenue guidance.
We have increased both the low end and high end of our R&D expense range to reflect additional investments, primarily as a result of the Nexvet acquisition and the impact of foreign exchange. 
Our guidance for an adjusted effective tax rate has been lowered to approximately 29% from our previous guidance of 30%. The favorable change is primarily due to jurisdictional mix and certain discrete items that have been realized in the first half of the year and does not take into account any potential tax changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S, a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate will have a meaningful benefit to us. 
As a result of the aforementioned changes, we have increased the low and high end of the range for adjusted net income for the year. In the second quarter, we also repurchased another $125 million in shares, and our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchase completed through Q2.
We expect our operating cash flow to grow through the year, allowing us to fund incremental investment in our business, including the $85 million used to purchase Nexvet last week. 
Just to summarize before we go to Q&A. We have delivered consistent operational revenue growth of 6% in the first half of the year. We expect positive trends in the uptake of new products and growth in [indiscernible] livestock to continue. Our earnings growth will accelerate meaningfully in the second half of the year, and cash flow generation will continue to improve giving us greater flexibility to invest in our business.

So first, on companion animals. So on companion animal, we expect that we'll continue generating very positive growth in the second half, and we expect that the differential between companion animal and livestock will remain in the second half of the year. We have seen in the second quarter growth in the U.S. of companion animal [indiscernible] 100% while international markets was [ 15% ]. I think it was in line with our expectations. In the U.S., in the second quarter, in companion animal, we had some additional promotional activities that also had an impact, a temporary impact, in terms of prices. But the growth in the [indiscernible] part of the anima portfolio has been in line with our expectations. Simparica also had additional revenues in the U.S. in the first quarter, but had an impact in the second quarter, but we don't see any situation of that is different than what we expected [indiscernible] with the performance of new products, Apoquel, Cytopoint, Simparica. All indicators are showing our progression in terms of market share improvement in both for dermatology and also for parasiticides segment. And in the other in line portfolio, again, we haven't seen any change in the generic assumptions. I think it's something that is in line with the trend we have seen in previous quarters. Maybe a comment on [indiscernible] that has been affected by the interaction of [indiscernible]. [indiscernible] is another product for treating pain. And we know that in this market, new products, they get significant attention and growth -- and this growth is maintained depending on the results that are showing in the mid- and long-term depending on the efficacy setting. But we are very pleased with our performance in companion animal. And definitely, it's a significant driver of our growth in the first half and we expect also a significant driver of our growth in the second half. In terms of the trends for the cattle in the U.S., you mentioned that the vaccine impact, I will say that maybe definitely the mild winter and also the [indiscernible] animals into the [indiscernible] have an impact in the use of [indiscernible] antibiotics. The other impact that we have seen was also the implementation of the veterinarian [ fee ] that has been affecting our cattle business, especially the medicated feed additive. We saw it affecting temporary to small producers in the U.S. and they will be adjusting how to use these products in the future. These adjustments are taking longer and we have incorporated in our guidance a more permanent impact in our revenue. But having said that, we expect more favorable conditions in the second half of the year for capital. And we also have seen that in the second quarter, premium antibiotics has been performing very well in the years. Next question."

And in the European market, the label, it will be different. It will be a 1 milligram for [ 4 ] weeks compared to 2 milligrams and 4 to 8 weeks in the U.S. But still the products are very consistent in terms of efficacy and also in terms of safety.

What we saw is that product, which is [indiscernible], it's a new product that has been introduced recently, it's a product developed by [indiscernible] and commercialized by  [indiscernible]. It has been gaining share in this pain market. We have seen also in the past that new products in this market are having rapid penetration because it's still some level of dissatisfaction in terms of safety and products coming to the market may have some opportunity, and definitely, the opportunity will be maintained if we can really deliver all the expectations in the medium and long term. But we don't think that we are confident that [indiscernible] with so many years in the market that very well established a profile in terms of efficacy and also in terms of safety will remain a key player in terms of managing pain for dogs. At the same time, so moving into the acquisition of Nexvet. It's very strategic for us to maintain our leadership in this area. We are convinced that there's still [indiscernible] in this market in terms of safety and efficacy and [indiscernible] really fill this gap in terms of providing alternative to current products in the market. And we're convinced that both in dogs and cats, [indiscernible] will play a significant role. In Brazil, definitely, the scandals are not helping, but we have been managing quite well our growth in Brazil despite of these political and scandal situation. And we -- the investment that we made in terms of expanding our sales force are having a very positive payback. We are growing sales in Brazil very rapidly, in [indiscernible] some of the areas, areas like companion animal is also driving significant growth. And Brazil, in general, has been a market export, in most of the cases, processed beef rather than fresh beef to some of the markets. And this is not really changing. And Brazil, they have a temporary challenge when it had the scandal in terms of the meat quality with China, but this has been already managed. And I think the prospects for Brazil are very positive. And definitely, Brazil will continue to competing with the U.S. Although today, they are competing with the different quality of meat. U.S. is much more focused on quality. While in Brazil, at this point, they are much more focused on process, which is have not shown an important [indiscernible] in quality. So very positive in terms of future growth in Brazil. And also, we see some additional opportunities in terms of export in the U.S. Next question, please."

Good morning, everyone. As in previous quarters, the innovation we bring to the market and the diversity of our portfolio across the geographies, species and the therapeutic areas are all supporting the consistency of our financial results. Our innovations include the recent introduction of new products like Cytopoint, Simparica and Stronghold Plus and lifecycle innovation that are developed across our approximately 300 product lines.
Our diverse portfolio help us overcome economic cycles and deal with other political situations and weather conditions that can affect market, species or product categories. We are seeing this diversity once again in the second quarter, and along with the excellent execution of our Zoetis team and our single focus on animal health, all these factors helped deliver excellent results.
In the second quarter, our revenue grew 6% operationally, and excluding the impact of product rationalizations that we have discussed before, our operational growth would have been 7%. We expect this will be the last quarter that we see any significant impact from the product rationalizations as those efforts and their comparisons are largely complete.
The main driver of our second quarter revenue growth remains companion animal products, which grew 10% operationally, driven largely by sales of our industry-leading dermatology portfolio consisting of Apoquel and Cytopoint, and our new oral parasiticide, Simparica. 
In the U.S., companion animal products grew 7%, and in international markets, they grew 15% operationally. We continue to see order penetration of new products in key countries outside of the U.S., [indiscernible] Japan, Brazil and Canada. 
We have been supporting growth for Simparica and Apoquel with direct-to-consumer advertising that we started in the second quarter in the U.S. We have made similar efforts in Brazil.
Initial reports on DTC in the U.S. are positive, and we look forward to analyzing more data as we evaluate the full year impact. 
Our total dermatology portfolio has shown significant growth, achieving our first ever quarter of more than $100 million in sales. We continue to build disease awareness through our DTC campaign and expect to expand the market. Our latest data shows that 85% of dogs with dermatology problems in the U.S. are treated with Apoquel or Cytopoint, up from 52% in the first quarter. 
Cytopoint has gotten good traction in the U.S. this year. And in new countries, we are conducting an early experience program and expect to fully launch in September. We believe the early adoption and favorable reaction in the U.S. is a good indication of the success we can achieve in the European markets.
Although Simparica sales were lower than in the first quarter, we continue to track well, with our expectation for the year in this highly competitive market. In the U.S., we have seen sales from clinic to pet owners growing market share since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 3% operationally, with increases in cattle and poultry products being partially offset by a decline in fish products. Our swine product sales in the quarter were flat. 
In the cattle market, we reported 4% operational growth. Export demand for U.S. beef has been increasing due to the lower average retail prices, and we continue to see positive signs in other major beef-producing markets like Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Australia and Canada.
In the case of poultry products, we grew 4% operationally. We have seen strong growth in the U.S., driven mostly for our broad portfolio and expertise to help customers address a range of consumer and retailer preferences. 
Combining our vaccines with product such as Zomig. [indiscernible], we are helping certain producers shift to nonperiodic [indiscernible] production.
In swine products, although we have taken actions to represent our vaccine portfolio in the U.S., we are still showing a decline in U.S. sales.  In international, however, our swine business is growing very strongly, led by China, the world's largest pork market. 
In fish produce in the second quarter, we have seen a decline of 5% operationally, mainly due to a lower uptake of our SRS vaccine in Chile. Nevertheless, we still expect double-digit growth for fish produced this year, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects for this business.
We posted 11% operational growth in adjusted net income. Once again faster than revenue growth of 6% and in line with our value proposition to shareholders to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue, and the full implementation of our efficiency initiative is enabling us to invest in additional promotional activities like DTC, while showing only a modest 1% operational growth in operating expenses. 
With our increasing cash flow, we continue to look at other investment we can make to support our future growth. One key area is ensuring reliable, high-quality supply to drive our growth. As part of our supply network strategy, we expect to complete the sales of our Guarulhos plant in Brazil in the fourth quarter. At the same time, we are planning to expand our vaccine plant and invest in manufacturing capacity for other innovative products. We will share more details as plans move further along. 
While new products like Simparica and Cytopoint may get well-deserved headline, we also focus on lifecycle innovation to keep established brands, delivering value to customers over decades. For example, Zoetis received approval in May from the NDA for CLAVAMOX CHEWABLE for dogs. This leading anti-infective was first approved in the U.S. in 1994 and it provides a broad spectrum of treatment for various infections in dogs and cats. CLAVAMOX CHEWABLE joined the regional tablet and liquid drop formulations, which we'll continue to market, and our internal innovation is complemented by M&A opportunities. 
Last week, we completed the acquisition of Nexvet Biopharma, an innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals in management of chronic pain and other therapeutic areas. This attrition demonstrates how we use external innovations in key technologies and therapeutic areas to support future growth. Nexvet strengthens our R&D pipeline in monoclonal antibodies and help us sustain our leadership in chronic pain management for companion animals, an area valued at an estimated $400 million a year and which is poised for innovation with the new monoclonal antibody therapies. We are moving ahead with the work of integrating Nexvet into our existing research and manufacturing operations in order to advance with their promising product candidate. 
With the first half of the year now behind us, we are tracking to our expectations. We are pleased with a strong start to the year, and we are increasing our full year 2017 guidance for revenue and net income based on foreign currency changes and our continued confidence. 
With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our second quarter results and full year guidance. Glenn?"

We had another solid quarter based on the strong growth of our dermatology portfolio and other recently launched companion animal products as well as growth in our global livestock portfolio, which was",1795,"Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. 
We had another solid quarter based on the strong growth of our dermatology portfolio and other recently launched companion animal products as well as growth in our global livestock portfolio, which was balanced across our U.S. and international business segment. 
Total company revenue grew 6% operationally, which exclude the negative 1% impact from foreign exchange. Breaking down that 6% growth, 6% came from dermatology and other new products and 1% came from our in line portfolio, with the product rationalization having a negative 1% impact on operational growth. 
As Juan Ramón mentioned, our dermatology portfolio reached a considerable milestone with sales in the quarter of $102 million. As we have said in the past, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis in the U.S., with a softer Q1 and Q4. As expected, Simparica sales were lower sequentially at $20 million. This was driven primarily by the U.S. and the timing of distributed purchases in Q1 in anticipation of the flea and tick season. 
Internationally, we saw strong growth sequentially in Simparica, with additional penetration in most major markets.
In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 11% operational growth in adjusted net income and 12% operational growth in adjusted diluted EPS. Overall, we had another quarter of solid top line performance, and we again grew our bottom line faster than our sales. We continue to deliver steady, long-term growth in an attractive and stable industry.
Our ability to bring innovative and differentiated products to market, combined with our diverse portfolio and leading commercial capabilities gives us a sustainable foundation for future long-term growth. 
Now let's discuss segment revenues. Our international segment generated operational revenue growth of 7% while the U.S. grew 5%. In the international segment, product rationalization has negative 1% impact on growth. 
So let me highlight a few markets. China delivered another strong quarter growing 14% operationally, with growth coming from both our livestock and companion animal businesses. 
In livestock in China, we benefited from solid market dynamics in swine, including favorable pork prices through the first half of the year. We expect some softening in this trend during the second half of the year. However, the continued modernization of production will drive greater long-term growth based on the use of vaccines and medicines to ensure safe, high-quality food supply. 
In companion animal, our recently expanded field force continues to partner with local veterinarian to improve medicalization rates and increased routine care for pets in China. 
In Brazil, we grew 8% operationally in the quarter behind the strength of our cattle and companion animal businesses. Investments in field force expansion and favorable market condition contributed to growth in cattle despite recent industry and government headline. And companion animal growth in Brazil was driven by new product introductions, including Simparica and Apoquel.
Japan also made a significant contribution in the quarter, growing 17% operationally over the same quarter last year. Apoquel sales began to normalize with distributors and better reflect the strong underlying demand in the local market. 
As a reminder, there was significant distributor stocking in Q3 of 2016 when we initially launched Apoquel.
Key markets in Europe performed well in the quarter as the U.K., Germany, France, Spain and Italy all exhibited operational growth. The U.K. and Germany led the way at 12% and 8% operational growth, respectively. Growth in the U.K. was driven primarily by Apoquel, while Germany's performance was due to strength in both Apoquel and Simparica. 
To summarize, very strong growth in our international business coming from a number of sources, including strong market trends, strategic investments and our success in bringing new value-added products to market. 
Turning to the U.S. Revenue grew 5% in the second quarter. Companion animal grew 7% and livestock grew 3%. Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio, Simparica and a number of other new product launches. U.S. dermatology sales was $74 million for the quarter, with Cytopoint sales reaching $15 million, exhibiting nice sequential growth as clinic penetration and dosing accelerates. As Juan Ramón said, patient share also continues to grow for Apoquel and Cytopoint. 
As I mentioned earlier, Simparica sales were lower this quarter then last, but still in line with expectation. Our increased selling and promotional activity will lay the groundwork for continued revenue growth in this highly competitive market. We will continue to evaluate the performance of our direct-to-consumer promotional campaign for Apoquel and Simparica, with earlier indications suggesting that we are on track to meet our business objectives.
Additional contributions to companion animal growth came from new products, including [indiscernible], which recently received approval for the treatment of dogs with heart worm. With the introduction of [indiscernible], Zoetis now offers veterinarians of full canine heart worm product portfolio, including prevention, detection and treatment. 
Moving to U.S. livestock. Sales grew 3% in the quarter, due primarily to our cattle and poultry businesses. Our cattle business returned to growth this quarter due to the success of products such as ACTOGAIN and SYNOVEX, while sales of our premium injectable antibiotics continue to be impacted by healthier animals moving into the feed block.
As certain poultry producers expand the no antibiotic as a label, our portfolio of medicated feed additives for these criteria are doing well and contributed to poultry growth in the U.S. We work closely with our customers to provide the necessary product and technical assistance to help them switch over when they choose. 
Our swine business declined again this quarter in the U.S., primarily due to competition for our Fostera PCV and [indiscernible] vaccine. Our updated vaccine products is seeing a modest uptick with medium and smaller producers and will continue to work with customers to gain acceptance. 
Finally, both our cattle and swine businesses were impacted by the implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, which negatively impacted our medicated feed additives performance as producers are adjusting to the new regulation and how to adapt their protocols. 
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 65.6% decreased approximately 230 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, and on a sequential quarter basis, improved 120 basis points from the first quarter of this year. 
As I had mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, in 2017, we have made additional cost improvements in our manufacturing network. As a result, in the first quarter of 2017, we recognized higher costs associated with previously produced inventory, which depressed our gross margin. This change also had a negative impact on our second quarter margin, which we had previously indicated. 
The second quarter results for adjusted gross margin, while showing improvement over the first quarter, are slightly below our initial expectations. We have been working to improve our inventory management, including reductions in the level of inventory write-offs we incur. While we still expect to improve in this area for 2017, the magnitude of improvement is less than we had expected and will continue to be an area of focus in the future. Gross margin was also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange in the quarter.
Adjusted SG&A grew by 1% in the quarter, with higher investment in our DTC advertising campaign offsetting the expense reductions in other areas. Adjusted R&D declined 1% operationally for the quarter due to the timing of project spending and fixed expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiative. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 29%. The tax rate in the quarter has significantly improved from the prior year primarily due to the impact of operational changes implemented in the third quarter of last year. Taking all these factors into consideration, we generated 11% operational growth in adjusted net income for the quarter. 
Moving to guidance for full year 2017. This year, we continue to perform in line with our expectations with certain upsides and downsides, particularly with tax and cost of goods sold. For the year, we still expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35%. 
Since our last update in May, changes in FX rates in several markets are favorable to revenue, and we're increasing both the lower end and higher end of the range as a result. We have also narrowed the range for revenue towards the high end of our guidance by $25 million to reflect our performance to date and our confidence in the remainder of the year. 
Our guidance for the range of cost of goods sold for the year has moved from 32% to 33% of revenue to approximately 33%. As we progress into the second half of the year, our results will more fully reflect the impact of our manufacturing cost improvement. Our updated view, however, also reflects the higher expense for inventory charges that I discussed earlier as well as unfavorable mix and foreign exchange. 
For SG&A, we're increasing the lower end of our range and maintaining the high end, consistent with the change in our revenue guidance.
We have increased both the low end and high end of R&D expense range to reflect additional investments, primarily as a result of the Nexvet acquisition and the impact of foreign exchange. 
Our guidance for an adjusted effective tax rate has been lowered to approximately 29% from our previous guidance of 30%. The favorable change is primarily due to jurisdictional mix and certain discrete items that had been realized in the first half of the year and does not take into account any potential tax changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S, a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. 
As a result of the aforementioned changes, we have increased the low and high end of the range for adjusted net income for the year. In the second quarter, we also repurchased another $125 million in shares, and our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchases completed through Q2.
We expect our operating cash flow to grow through the year, allowing us to fund incremental investment in our business, including the $85 million used to purchase Nexvet last week. 
Just to summarize before we go to Q&A. We have delivered consistent operational revenue growth of 6% in the first half of the year. We expect positive trends in the uptake of new products and growth in international livestock to continue. Our earnings growth will accelerate meaningfully in the second half of the year, and cash flow generation will continue to improve, giving us greater flexibility to invest in our business.

And then secondly, on the production animal side, you talked about the premium line of antibiotics like vaccine, did you say you expect the trend to reverse in the second half or kind of the midsized cattle will be in the feedlots and that could lead to increased sales?"

So first, on companion animals. So on companion animal, we expect that we'll continue generating very positive growth in the second half, and we expect that the differential between companion animal and livestock will remain in the second half of the year. We have seen in the second quarter growth in the U.S. of companion animal 7% while international markets was 15%. I think it was in line with our expectations. In the U.S., in the second quarter, in companion animal, we had some additional promotional activities that also had an impact, a temporary impact, in terms of prices. But the growth in the different part of companion animal portfolio has been in line with our expectations. Simparica also had additional revenues in the U.S. in the first quarter that had an impact in the second quarter, but we don't see any situation that is different than what we expected vaguely with the performance of new products, Apoquel, Cytopoint, Simparica. All indicators are showing our progression in terms of market share improvement in both for dermatology and also for parasiticides segment. And in the other, in line portfolio, again, so we haven't seen any change in the generic assumptions. So I think it's something that is in line with the trend that we have seen in previous quarters. Maybe a comment on RIMADYL that has been affected by the interaction of Galliprant. Galliprant is another product for treating pain. And we know that in this market, new products, they get significant attention and growth, and this growth is maintained depending on the results that are showing in the mid- and long-term in terms on efficacy and safety. But we are very pleased with our performance in companion animal. And definitely, it's a significant driver of our growth in the first half and we expect also a significant driver of our growth in the second half. In terms of the trends for the cattle in the U.S., you mentioned that the vaccine impact, I will say that maybe definitely the mild winter and also the heavier animals into the feedlots has an impact in terms of the use of premium antibiotics. The other impact that we have seen was also the implementation of the veterinarian feed that has been affecting our cattle business, especially the medicated feed additive. We saw that this was affecting temporarily to smaller producers in the U.S. and they will be adjusting how to use these products in the future. These adjustments are taking longer and we have incorporated in our guidance a more permanent impact in our revenue. But having said that, we expect more favorable conditions in the second half of the year for cattle. And we also have seen that in the second quarter, premium antibiotics has been performing very well in the years. Next question."

But combining both together, I think they are growing very nicely. And now I think we see the opportunity also to extend this experience to the European market in where we started early experience program, and we expect a full launch in September, in European market. And in the European markets, the label, it will be different. It will be a 1 milligram for 4 weeks compared to 2 milligrams in 4 to 8 weeks in the U.S. But still the products are very consistent in terms of efficacy and also in terms of safety. For Apoquel, we have seen now that Apoquel use has been extended or increased in terms of acute, but also in terms of seasonalized conditions of dogs. And this is a result of now full availability of product in the market. And also, we think -- we believe also the effort that we are making in terms of direct-to-consumer advertising. Current use will remain the main generator of revenues because the use will be very prolonged, but the acute or the seasonalized use of the product also will have significant opportunity. Next question."

So we are not saying that generic competition is not gaining share. It's gaining share in line with previous comment. And the -- well, the message I wanted to convey was that we have not seen significant changes in defense of generic penetration. What we saw is that product, which is Galliprant, it's a new product that has been introduced recently, it's a product developed by Aratana and commercialized by Elanco. It has been gaining share in this pain market. We have seen also in the past that new products in this market are having rapid penetration because it's still some level of dissatisfaction in terms of safety and products coming to the market may have some opportunity, and definitely, the opportunity will be maintained if it can really deliver all the expectations in the medium and long term. But we don't think that -- well this is something that we are confident that RIMADYL with so many years in the market with very well established profile in terms of efficacy and also in terms of safety will remain a key player in terms of managing pain for dogs. At the same time, so moving into the acquisition of Nexvet. It's very strategic for us to maintain our leadership in this area. We are convinced that there's still unmet need in this market in terms of safety and efficacy and this can really fill this gap in terms of providing alternative to current products in the market. And we're convinced that in both in dogs and cats, RIMADYL will play a significant role. In Brazil, definitely, the scandals are not helping, but we have been managing quite well our growth in Brazil, despite of these political and scandal situation. And we -- the investment that we made in terms of expanding our sales force are having a very positive payback. We are growing sales in Brazil very rapidly, in Preto, but also in some other areas, areas like companion animal is also driving significant growth. And Brazil, in general, has been a market exporting, in most of the cases processed beef rather than fresh beef to some of the markets. And this is not really changing. And Brazil, they have a temporary challenge when it had the scandal in terms of the meat quality with China, but this has been already managed. And I think the prospects for Brazil are very positive. And definitely, Brazil will continue to competing with the U.S. Although today, they are competing with different quality of meat. U.S. is much more focused on quality. While in Brazil, at this point, they are much more focused on process, which has not shown importance in terms of quality. So very positive in terms of future growth in Brazil. And also, we see some additional opportunities in terms of export in the U.S. Next question, please."

Good morning, everyone. As in previous quarters, the innovation we bring to the market and the diversity of our portfolio across the geographies, species and the therapeutic areas are all supporting the consistency of our financial results. Our innovations include the recent introduction of new products like Cytopoint, Simparica and Stronghold Plus and lifecycle innovation that are developed across our approximately 300 product lines.
Our diverse portfolio helps us overcome economic cycles and deal with other political situations and weather conditions that can affect market, species or product categories. We are seeing this diversity once again in the second quarter, and along with the excellent execution of our Zoetis team and our single focus on animal health, all these factors helped deliver excellent results.
In the second quarter, our revenue grew 6% operationally, and excluding the impact of product rationalizations that we have discussed before, our operational growth would have been 7%. We expect this will be the last quarter that we see any significant impact from the product rationalizations as those efforts and their comparisons are largely complete.
The main driver of our second quarter revenue growth remains companion animal products, which grew 10% operationally, driven largely by sales of our industry-leading dermatology portfolio consisting of Apoquel and Cytopoint, and our new oral parasiticide, Simparica. 
In the U.S., companion animal products grew 7%, and in international markets, they grew 15% operationally. We continue to see order penetration of new products in key countries outside of the U.S., [indiscernible] Japan, Brazil and Canada. 
We have been supporting growth for Simparica and Apoquel with direct-to-consumer advertising that we started in the second quarter in the U.S. We have made similar efforts in Brazil.
Initial reports on DTC in the U.S. are positive, and we look forward to analyzing more data as we evaluate the full year impact. 
Our total dermatology portfolio has shown significant growth, achieving our first ever quarter of more than $100 million in sales. We continue to build disease awareness through our DTC campaign and expect to expand the market. Our latest data shows that 85% of dogs with dermatology problems in the U.S. are treated with Apoquel or Cytopoint, up from 52% in the first quarter. 
Cytopoint has gotten good traction in the U.S. this year. And in new countries, we are conducting an early experience program and expect to fully launch in September. We believe the early adoption and favorable reaction in the U.S. is a good indication of the success we can achieve in the European markets.
Although Simparica sales were lower than in the first quarter, we continue to track well, with our expectation for the year in this highly competitive market. In the U.S., we have seen sales from clinic to pet owners growing market share since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 3% operationally, with increases in cattle and poultry products being partially offset by a decline in fish products. Our swine product sales in the quarter were flat. 
In the cattle market, we reported 4% operational growth. Export demand for U.S. beef has been increasing due to the lower average retail prices, and we continue to see positive signs in other major beef-producing markets like Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Australia and Canada.
In the case of poultry products, we grew 4% operationally. We have seen strong growth in the U.S., driven mostly for our broad portfolio and expertise to help customers address a range of consumer and retailer preferences. 
Combining our vaccines with product such as Zomig. [indiscernible]Cox, we are helping certain producers shift to nonperiodic Aero [indiscernible] production.
In swine products, although we have taken actions to represent our vaccine portfolio in the U.S., we are still showing a decline in U.S. sales.  In international, however, our swine business is growing very strongly, led by China, the world's largest pork market. 
In fish produce in the second quarter, we have seen a decline of 5% operationally, mainly due to a lower uptake of our SRS vaccine in Chile. Nevertheless, we still expect double-digit growth for fish produced this year, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects for this business.
We posted 11% operational growth in adjusted net income. Once again faster than revenue growth of 6% and in line with our value proposition to shareholders to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue, and the full implementation of our efficiency initiative is enabling us to invest in additional promotional activities like DTC, while showing only a modest 1% operational growth in operating expenses. 
With our increasing cash flow, we continue to look at other investment we can make to support our future growth. One key area is ensuring reliable, high-quality supply to drive our growth. As part of our supply network strategy, we expect to complete the sales of our Guarulhos plant in Brazil in the fourth quarter. At the same time, we are planning to expand our vaccine plant and invest in manufacturing capacity for other innovative products. We will share more details as plans move further along. 
While new products like Simparica and Cytopoint may get well-deserved headline, we also focus on lifecycle innovation to keep established brands, delivering value to customers over decades. For example, Zoetis received approval in May from the NDA for CLAVAMOX CHEWABLE for dogs. This leading anti-infective was first approved in the U.S. in 1994 and it provides a broad spectrum of treatment for various infections in dogs and cats. CLAVAMOX CHEWABLE joined the regional tablet and liquid drop formulations, which we'll continue to market, and our internal innovation is complemented by M&A opportunities. 
Last week, we completed the acquisition of Nexvet Biopharma, an innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals in management of chronic pain and other therapeutic areas. This attrition demonstrates how we use external innovations in key technologies and therapeutic areas to support future growth. Nexvet strengthens our R&D pipeline in monoclonal antibodies and help us sustain our leadership in chronic pain management for companion animals, an area valued at an estimated $400 million a year and which is poised for innovation with the new monoclonal antibody set therapies. We are moving ahead with the work of integrating Nexvet into our existing research and manufacturing operations in order to advance with their promising product candidate. 
With the first half of the year now behind us, we are tracking to our expectations. We are pleased with a strong start to the year, and we are increasing our full year 2017 guidance for revenue and net income based on foreign currency changes and our continued confidence. 
With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our second quarter results and full year guidance. Glenn?"

We had another solid quarter based on the strong growth of our dermatology portfolio and other recently launched companion animal products as well as growth in our global livestock portfolio, which was",1795,"Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. 
We had another solid quarter based on the strong growth of our dermatology portfolio and other recently launched companion animal products as well as growth in our global livestock portfolio, which was balanced across our U.S. and international business segment. 
Total company revenue grew 6% operationally, which exclude the negative 1% impact from foreign exchange. Breaking down that 6% growth, 6% came from dermatology and other new products and 1% came from our in line portfolio, with the product rationalization having a negative 1% impact on operational growth. 
As Juan Ramón mentioned, our dermatology portfolio reached a considerable milestone with sales in the quarter of $102 million. As we have said in the past, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis in the U.S., with a softer Q1 and Q4. As expected, Simparica sales were lower sequentially at $20 million. This was driven primarily by the U.S. and the timing of distributed purchases in Q1 in anticipation of the flea and tick season. 
Internationally, we saw strong growth sequentially in Simparica, with additional penetration in most major markets.
In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 11% operational growth in adjusted net income and 12% operational growth in adjusted diluted EPS. Overall, we had another quarter of solid top line performance, and we again grew our bottom line faster than our sales. We continue to deliver steady, long-term growth in an attractive and stable industry.
Our ability to bring innovative and differentiated products to market, combined with our diverse portfolio and leading commercial capabilities gives us a sustainable foundation for future long-term growth. 
Now let's discuss segment revenues. Our international segment generated operational revenue growth of 7% while the U.S. grew 5%. In the international segment, product rationalization has negative 1% impact on growth. 
So let me highlight a few markets. China delivered another strong quarter growing 14% operationally, with growth coming from both our livestock and companion animal businesses. 
In livestock in China, we benefited from solid market dynamics in swine, including favorable pork prices through the first half of the year. We expect some softening in this trend during the second half of the year. However, the continued modernization of production will drive greater long-term growth based on the use of vaccines and medicines to ensure safe, high-quality food supply. 
In companion animal, our recently expanded field force continues to partner with local veterinarian to improve medicalization rates and increased routine care for pets in China. 
In Brazil, we grew 8% operationally in the quarter behind the strength of our cattle and companion animal businesses. Investments in field force expansion and favorable market condition contributed to growth in cattle despite recent industry and government headline. And companion animal growth in Brazil was driven by new product introductions, including Simparica and Apoquel.
Japan also made a significant contribution in the quarter, growing 17% operationally over the same quarter last year. Apoquel sales began to normalize with distributors and better reflect the strong underlying demand in the local market. 
As a reminder, there was significant distributor stocking in Q3 of 2016 when we initially launched Apoquel.
Key markets in Europe performed well in the quarter as the U.K., Germany, France, Spain and Italy all exhibited operational growth. The U.K. and Germany led the way at 12% and 8% operational growth, respectively. Growth in the U.K. was driven primarily by Apoquel, while Germany's performance was due to strength in both Apoquel and Simparica. 
To summarize, very strong growth in our international business coming from a number of sources, including strong market trends, strategic investments and our success in bringing new value-added products to market. 
Turning to the U.S. Revenue grew 5% in the second quarter. Companion animal grew 7% and livestock grew 3%. Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio, Simparica and a number of other new product launches. U.S. dermatology sales was $74 million for the quarter, with Cytopoint sales reaching $15 million, exhibiting nice sequential growth as clinic penetration and dosing accelerates. As Juan Ramón said, patient share also continues to grow for Apoquel and Cytopoint. 
As I mentioned earlier, Simparica sales were lower this quarter then last, but still in line with expectation. Our increased selling and promotional activity will lay the groundwork for continued revenue growth in this highly competitive market. We will continue to evaluate the performance of our direct-to-consumer promotional campaign for Apoquel and Simparica, with earlier indications suggesting that we are on track to meet our business objectives.
Additional contributions to companion animal growth came from new products, including Ditropan, which recently received approval for the treatment of dogs with heart worm. With the introduction of Ditropan, Zoetis now offers veterinarians of full canine heart worm product portfolio, including prevention, detection and treatment. 
Moving to U.S. livestock. Sales grew 3% in the quarter, due primarily to our cattle and poultry businesses. Our cattle business returned to growth this quarter due to the success of products such as ACTOGAIN and SYNOVEX, while sales of our premium injectable antibiotics continue to be impacted by healthier animals moving into the feed block.
As certain poultry producers expand the no antibiotic as a label, our portfolio of medicated feed additives for these criteria are doing well and contributed to poultry growth in the U.S. We work closely with our customers to provide the necessary product and technical assistance to help them switch over when they choose. 
Our swine business declined again this quarter in the U.S., primarily due to competition for our Fostera PCV and [indiscernible] vaccine. Our updated vaccine products is seeing a modest uptick with medium and smaller producers and will continue to work with customers to gain acceptance. 
Finally, both our cattle and swine businesses were impacted by the implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, which negatively impacted our medicated feed additives performance as producers are adjusting to the new regulation and how to adapt their protocols. 
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 65.6% decreased approximately 230 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, and on a sequential quarter basis, improved 120 basis points from the first quarter of this year. 
As I had mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, in 2017, we have made additional cost improvements in our manufacturing network. As a result, in the first quarter of 2017, we recognized higher costs associated with previously produced inventory, which depressed our gross margin. This change also had a negative impact on our second quarter margin, which we had previously indicated. 
The second quarter results for adjusted gross margin, while showing improvement over the first quarter, are slightly below our initial expectations. We have been working to improve our inventory management, including reductions in the level of inventory write-offs we incur. While we still expect to improve in this area for 2017, the magnitude of improvement is less than we had expected and will continue to be an area of focus in the future. Gross margin was also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange in the quarter.
Adjusted SG&A grew by 1% in the quarter, with higher investment in our DTC advertising campaign offsetting the expense reductions in other areas. Adjusted R&D declined 1% operationally for the quarter due to the timing of project spending and fixed expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiative. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 29%. The tax rate in the quarter has significantly improved from the prior year primarily due to the impact of operational changes implemented in the third quarter of last year. Taking all these factors into consideration, we generated 11% operational growth in adjusted net income for the quarter. 
Moving to guidance for full year 2017. This year, we continue to perform in line with our expectations with certain upsides and downsides, particularly with tax and cost of goods sold. For the year, we still expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35%. 
Since our last update in May, changes in FX rates in several markets are favorable to revenue, and we're increasing both the lower end and higher end of the range as a result. We have also narrowed the range for revenue towards the high end of our guidance by $25 million to reflect our performance to date and our confidence in the remainder of the year. 
Our guidance for the range of cost of goods sold for the year has moved from 32% to 33% of revenue to approximately 33%. As we progress into the second half of the year, our results will more fully reflect the impact of our manufacturing cost improvement. Our updated view, however, also reflects the higher expense for inventory charges that I discussed earlier as well as unfavorable mix and foreign exchange. 
For SG&A, we're increasing the lower end of our range and maintaining the high end, consistent with the change in our revenue guidance.
We have increased both the low end and high end of R&D expense range to reflect additional investments, primarily as a result of the Nexvet acquisition and the impact of foreign exchange. 
Our guidance for an adjusted effective tax rate has been lowered to approximately 29% from our previous guidance of 30%. The favorable change is primarily due to jurisdictional mix and certain discrete items that had been realized in the first half of the year and does not take into account any potential tax changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S, a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. 
As a result of the aforementioned changes, we have increased the low and high end of the range for adjusted net income for the year. In the second quarter, we also repurchased another $125 million in shares, and our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchases completed through Q2.
We expect our operating cash flow to grow through the year, allowing us to fund incremental investment in our business, including the $85 million used to purchase Nexvet last week. 
Just to summarize before we go to Q&A. We have delivered consistent operational revenue growth of 6% in the first half of the year. We expect positive trends in the uptake of new products and growth in international livestock to continue. Our earnings growth will accelerate meaningfully in the second half of the year, and cash flow generation will continue to improve, giving us greater flexibility to invest in our business.

But the growth in the different part of companion animal portfolio has been in line with our expectations. Simparica also had additional revenues in the U.S. in the first quarter that had an impact in the second quarter, but we don't see any situation that is different than what we expected vaguely with the performance of new products, Apoquel, Cytopoint, Simparica. All indicators are showing our progression in terms of market share improvement in both for dermatology and also for parasiticides segment. And in the other, in line portfolio, again, so we haven't seen any change in the generic assumptions. So I think it's something that is in line with the trend that we have seen in previous quarters. Maybe a comment on RIMADYL that has been affected by the interaction of Galliprant. Galliprant is another product for treating pain. And we know that in this market, new products, they get significant attention and growth, and this growth is maintained depending on the results that are showing in the mid- and long-term in terms on efficacy and safety. But we are very pleased with our performance in companion animal. And definitely, it's a significant driver of our growth in the first half and we expect also a significant driver of our growth in the second half. In terms of the trends for the cattle in the U.S., you mentioned that the vaccine impact, I will say that maybe definitely the mild winter and also the heavier animals into the feedlots has an impact in terms of the use of premium antibiotics. The other impact that we have seen was also the implementation of the veterinarian feed that has been affecting our cattle business, especially the medicated feed additive. We saw that this was affecting temporarily to smaller producers in the U.S. and they will be adjusting how to use these products in the future. These adjustments are taking longer and we have incorporated in our guidance a more permanent impact in our revenue. But having said that, we expect more favorable conditions in the second half of the year for cattle. And we also have seen that in the second quarter, premium antibiotics has been performing very well in the years. Next question."

But combining both together, I think they are growing very nicely. And now I think we see the opportunity also to extend this experience to the European market in where we started early experience program, and we expect a full launch in September, in European market. And in the European markets, the label, it will be different. It will be a 1 milligram for 4 weeks compared to 2 milligrams in 4 to 8 weeks in the U.S. But still the products are very consistent in terms of efficacy and also in terms of safety. For Apoquel, we have seen now that Apoquel use has been extended or increased in terms of acute, but also in terms of seasonalized conditions of dogs. And this is a result of now full availability of product in the market. And also, we think -- we believe also the effort that we are making in terms of direct-to-consumer advertising. Current use will remain the main generator of revenues because the use will be very prolonged, but the acute or the seasonalized use of the product also will have significant opportunity. Next question."

My understanding is that the USDA has banned fresh beef imports from Brazil because of safety concerns; obviously, we know there's other concerns there as well in Brazil.

So we are not saying that generic competition is not gaining share. It's gaining share in line with previous comment. And the -- well, the message I wanted to convey was that we have not seen significant changes in defense of generic penetration. What we saw is that product, which is Galliprant, it's a new product that has been introduced recently, it's a product developed by Aratana and commercialized by Elanco. It has been gaining share in this pain market. We have seen also in the past that new products in this market are having rapid penetration because it's still some level of dissatisfaction in terms of safety and products coming to the market may have some opportunity, and definitely, the opportunity will be maintained if it can really deliver all the expectations in the medium and long term. But we don't think that -- well this is something that we are confident that RIMADYL with so many years in the market with very well established profile in terms of efficacy and also in terms of safety will remain a key player in terms of managing pain for dogs. At the same time, so moving into the acquisition of Nexvet. It's very strategic for us to maintain our leadership in this area. We are convinced that there's still unmet needs in this market in terms of safety and efficacy and this can really fill this gap in terms of providing alternative to current products in the market. And we're convinced that in both in dogs and cats, RIMADYL will play a significant role. In Brazil, definitely, the scandals are not helping, but we have been managing volume quite well our growth in Brazil, despite of these political and scandal situation. And we -- the investment that we made in terms of expanding our sales force are having a very positive payback. We are growing sales in Brazil very rapidly, in Preto, but also in some other areas, areas like companion animal is also driving significant growth. And Brazil, in general, has been a market exporting, in most of the cases processed beef rather than fresh beef to some of the markets. And this is not really changing. And Brazil, they have a temporary challenge when it had the scandal in terms of the meat quality with China, but this has been already managed. And I think the prospects for Brazil are very positive. And definitely, Brazil will continue competing with the U.S. Although today, they are competing with different quality of meat. U.S. is much more focused on quality. While in Brazil, at this point, they are much more focused on process, which has not shown importance in terms of quality. So very positive in terms of future growth in Brazil. And also, we see some additional opportunities in terms of export in the U.S. Next question, please."

Good morning, everyone. As in previous quarters, the innovation we bring to the market and the diversity of our portfolio across the geographies, species and the therapeutic areas are all supporting the consistency of our financial results. Our innovations include the recent introduction of new products like Cytopoint, Simparica and Stronghold Plus and lifecycle innovation that are developed across our approximately 300 product lines.
Our diverse portfolio helps us overcome economic cycles and deal with other political situations and weather conditions that can affect market, species or product categories. We are seeing this diversity once again in the second quarter, and along with the excellent execution of our Zoetis team and our single focus on animal health, all these factors helped deliver excellent results.
In the second quarter, our revenue grew 6% operationally, and excluding the impact of product rationalizations that we have discussed before, our operational growth would have been 7%. We expect this will be the last quarter that we see any significant impact from the product rationalizations as those efforts and their comparisons are largely complete.
The main driver of our second quarter revenue growth remains companion animal products, which grew 10% operationally, driven largely by sales of our industry-leading dermatology portfolio consisting of Apoquel and Cytopoint, and our new oral parasiticide, Simparica. 
In the U.S., companion animal products grew 7%, and in international markets, they grew 15% operationally. We continue to see order penetration of new products in key countries outside of the U.S., [indiscernible] Japan, Brazil and Canada. 
We have been supporting growth for Simparica and Apoquel with direct-to-consumer advertising that we started in the second quarter in the U.S. We have made similar efforts in Brazil.
Initial reports on DTC in the U.S. are positive, and we look forward to analyzing more data as we evaluate the full year impact. 
Our total dermatology portfolio has shown significant growth, achieving our first ever quarter of more than $100 million in sales. We continue to build disease awareness through our DTC campaign and expect to expand the market. Our latest data shows that 85% of dogs with dermatology problems in the U.S. are treated with Apoquel or Cytopoint, up from 52% in the first quarter. 
Cytopoint has gotten good traction in the U.S. this year. And in new countries, we are conducting an early experience program and expect to fully launch in September. We believe the early adoption and favorable reaction in the U.S. is a good indication of the success we can achieve in the European markets.
Although Simparica sales were lower than in the first quarter, we continue to track well, with our expectation for the year in this highly competitive market. In the U.S., we have seen sales from clinic to pet owners growing market share since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 3% operationally, with increases in cattle and poultry products being partially offset by a decline in fish products. Our swine product sales in the quarter were flat. 
In the cattle market, we reported 4% operational growth. Export demand for U.S. beef has been increasing due to the lower average retail prices, and we continue to see positive signs in other major beef-producing markets like Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Australia and Canada.
In the case of poultry products, we grew 4% operationally. We have seen strong growth in the U.S., driven mostly for our broad portfolio and expertise to help customers address a range of consumer and retailer preferences. 
Combining our vaccines with product such as Zomig. [indiscernible]Cox, we are helping certain producers shift to nonperiodic Aero [indiscernible] production.
In swine products, although we have taken actions to represent our vaccine portfolio in the U.S., we are still showing a decline in U.S. sales. In international, however, our swine business is growing very strongly, led by China, the world's largest pork market. 
In fish produce in the second quarter, we have seen a decline of 5% operationally, mainly due to a lower uptake of our SRS vaccine in Chile. Nevertheless, we still expect double-digit growth for fish produced this year, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects for this business.
We posted 11% operational growth in adjusted net income. Once again faster than revenue growth of 6% and in line with our value proposition to shareholders to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue, and the full implementation of our efficiency initiative is enabling us to invest in additional promotional activities like DTC, while showing only a modest 1% operational growth in operating expenses. 
With our increasing cash flow, we continue to look at other investment we can make to support our future growth. One key area is ensuring reliable, high-quality supply to drive our growth. As part of our supply network strategy, we expect to complete the sales of our Guarulhos plant in Brazil in the fourth quarter. At the same time, we are planning to expand our vaccine plant and invest in manufacturing capacity for other innovative products. We will share more details as plans move further along. 
While new products like Simparica and Cytopoint may get well-deserved headline, we also focus on lifecycle innovation to keep established brands, delivering value to customers over decades. For example, Zoetis received approval in May from the NDA for CLAVAMOX CHEWABLE for dogs. This leading anti-infective was first approved in the U.S. in 1994 and it provides a broad spectrum of treatment for various infections in dogs and cats. CLAVAMOX CHEWABLE joined the regional tablet and liquid drop formulations, which we'll continue to market, and our internal innovation is complemented by M&A opportunities. 
Last week, we completed the acquisition of Nexvet Biopharma, an innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals in management of chronic pain and other therapeutic areas. This attrition demonstrates how we use external innovations in key technologies and therapeutic areas to support future growth. Nexvet strengthens our R&D pipeline in monoclonal antibodies and help us sustain our leadership in chronic pain management for companion animals, an area valued at an estimated $400 million a year and which is poised for innovation with the new monoclonal antibody set therapies. We are moving ahead with the work of integrating Nexvet into our existing research and manufacturing operations in order to advance with their promising product candidate. 
With the first half of the year now behind us, we are tracking to our expectations. We are pleased with a strong start to the year, and we are increasing our full year 2017 guidance for revenue and net income based on foreign currency changes and our continued confidence. 
With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our second quarter results and full year guidance. Glenn?"

We had another solid quarter based on the strong growth of our dermatology portfolio and other recently launched companion animal products as well as growth in our global livestock portfolio, which was",1795,"Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. 
We had another solid quarter based on the strong growth of our dermatology portfolio and other recently launched companion animal products as well as growth in our global livestock portfolio, which was balanced across our U.S. and international business segment. 
Total company revenue grew 6% operationally, which exclude the negative 1% impact from foreign exchange. Breaking down that 6% growth, 6% came from dermatology and other new products and 1% came from our in line portfolio, with the product rationalization having a negative 1% impact on operational growth. 
As Juan Ramón mentioned, our dermatology portfolio reached a considerable milestone with sales in the quarter of $102 million. As we have said in the past, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis in the U.S., with a softer Q1 and Q4. As expected, Simparica sales were lower sequentially at $20 million. This was driven primarily by the U.S. and the timing of distributed purchases in Q1 in anticipation of the flea and tick season. 
Internationally, we saw strong growth sequentially in Simparica, with additional penetration in most major markets.
In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 11% operational growth in adjusted net income and 12% operational growth in adjusted diluted EPS. Overall, we had another quarter of solid top line performance, and we again grew our bottom line faster than our sales. We continue to deliver steady, long-term growth in an attractive and stable industry.
Our ability to bring innovative and differentiated products to market, combined with our diverse portfolio and leading commercial capabilities gives us a sustainable foundation for future long-term growth. 
Now let's discuss segment revenues. Our international segment generated operational revenue growth of 7% while the U.S. grew 5%. In the international segment, product rationalization has negative 1% impact on growth. 
So let me highlight a few markets. China delivered another strong quarter growing 14% operationally, with growth coming from both our livestock and companion animal businesses. 
In livestock in China, we benefited from solid market dynamics in swine, including favorable pork prices through the first half of the year. We expect some softening in this trend during the second half of the year. However, the continued modernization of production will drive greater long-term growth based on the use of vaccines and medicines to ensure safe, high-quality food supply. 
In companion animal, our recently expanded field force continues to partner with local veterinarian to improve medicalization rates and increased routine care for pets in China. 
In Brazil, we grew 8% operationally in the quarter behind the strength of our cattle and companion animal businesses. Investments in field force expansion and favorable market condition contributed to growth in cattle despite recent industry and government headline. And companion animal growth in Brazil was driven by new product introductions, including Simparica and Apoquel.
Japan also made a significant contribution in the quarter, growing 17% operationally over the same quarter last year. Apoquel sales began to normalize with distributors and better reflect the strong underlying demand in the local market. 
As a reminder, there was significant distributor stocking in Q3 of 2016 when we initially launched Apoquel.
Key markets in Europe performed well in the quarter as the U.K., Germany, France, Spain and Italy all exhibited operational growth. The U.K. and Germany led the way at 12% and 8% operational growth, respectively. Growth in the U.K. was driven primarily by Apoquel, while Germany's performance was due to strength in both Apoquel and Simparica. 
To summarize, very strong growth in our international business coming from a number of sources, including strong market trends, strategic investments and our success in bringing new value-added products to market. 
Turning to the U.S. Revenue grew 5% in the second quarter. Companion animal grew 7% and livestock grew 3%. Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio, Simparica and a number of other new product launches. U.S. dermatology sales was $74 million for the quarter, with Cytopoint sales reaching $15 million, exhibiting nice sequential growth as clinic penetration and dosing accelerates. As Juan Ramón said, patient share also continues to grow for Apoquel and Cytopoint. 
As I mentioned earlier, Simparica sales were lower this quarter than last, but still in line with expectation. Our increased selling and promotional activity will lay the groundwork for continued revenue growth in this highly competitive market. We will continue to evaluate the performance of our direct-to-consumer promotional campaign for Apoquel and Simparica, with earlier indications suggesting that we are on track to meet our business objectives.
Additional contributions to companion animal growth came from new products, including Ditropan, which recently received approval for the treatment of dogs with heart worm. With the introduction of Ditropan, Zoetis now offers veterinarians of full canine heart worm product portfolio, including prevention, detection and treatment. 
Moving to U.S. livestock. Sales grew 3% in the quarter, due primarily to our cattle and poultry businesses. Our cattle business returned to growth this quarter due to the success of products such as ACTOGAIN and SYNOVEX, while sales of our premium injectable antibiotics continue to be impacted by healthier animals moving into the feed block.
As certain poultry producers expand the no antibiotic as a label, our portfolio of medicated feed additives for these criteria are doing well and contributed to poultry growth in the U.S. We work closely with our customers to provide the necessary product and technical assistance to help them switch over when they choose. 
Our swine business declined again this quarter in the U.S., primarily due to competition for our Fostera PCV and [indiscernible] vaccine. Our updated vaccine products is seeing a modest uptick with medium and smaller producers and will continue to work with customers to gain acceptance. 
Finally, both our cattle and swine businesses were impacted by the implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, which negatively impacted our medicated feed additives performance as producers are adjusting to the new regulation and how to adapt their protocols. 
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 65.6% decreased approximately 230 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, and on a sequential quarter basis, improved 120 basis points from the first quarter of this year. 
As I had mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, in 2017, we have made additional cost improvements in our manufacturing network. As a result, in the first quarter of 2017, we recognized higher costs associated with previously produced inventory, which depressed our gross margin. This change also had a negative impact on our second quarter margin, which we had previously indicated. 
The second quarter results for adjusted gross margin, while showing improvement over the first quarter, are slightly below our initial expectations. We have been working to improve our inventory management, including reductions in the level of inventory write-offs we incur. While we still expect to improve in this area for 2017, the magnitude of improvement is less than we had expected and will continue to be an area of focus in the future. Gross margin was also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange in the quarter.
Adjusted SG&A grew by 1% in the quarter, with higher investment in our DTC advertising campaign offsetting the expense reductions in other areas. Adjusted R&D declined 1% operationally for the quarter due to the timing of project spending and fixed expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiative. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 29%. The tax rate in the quarter has significantly improved from the prior year primarily due to the impact of operational changes implemented in the third quarter of last year. Taking all these factors into consideration, we generated 11% operational growth in adjusted net income for the quarter. 
Moving to guidance for full year 2017. This year, we continue to perform in line with our expectations with certain upsides and downsides, particularly with tax and cost of goods sold. For the year, we still expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35%. 
Since our last update in May, changes in FX rates in several markets are favorable to revenue, and we're increasing both the lower end and higher end of the range as a result. We have also narrowed the range for revenue towards the high end of our guidance by $25 million to reflect our performance to date and our confidence in the remainder of the year. 
Our guidance for the range of cost of goods sold for the year has moved from 32% to 33% of revenue to approximately 33%. As we progress into the second half of the year, our results will more fully reflect the impact of our manufacturing cost improvement. Our updated view, however, also reflects the higher expense for inventory charges that I discussed earlier as well as unfavorable mix and foreign exchange. 
For SG&A, we're increasing the lower end of our range and maintaining the high end, consistent with the change in our revenue guidance.
We have increased both the low end and high end of R&D expense range to reflect additional investments, primarily as a result of the Nexvet acquisition and the impact of foreign exchange. 
Our guidance for an adjusted effective tax rate has been lowered to approximately 29% from our previous guidance of 30%. The favorable change is primarily due to jurisdictional mix and certain discrete items that had been realized in the first half of the year and does not take into account any potential tax changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S, a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. 
As a result of the aforementioned changes, we have increased the low and high end of the range for adjusted net income for the year. In the second quarter, we also repurchased another $125 million in shares, and our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchases completed through Q2.
We expect our operating cash flow to grow through the year, allowing us to fund incremental investment in our business, including the $85 million used to purchase Nexvet last week. 
Just to summarize before we go to Q&A. We have delivered consistent operational revenue growth of 6% in the first half of the year. We expect positive trends in the uptake of new products and growth in international livestock to continue. Our earnings growth will accelerate meaningfully in the second half of the year, and cash flow generation will continue to improve, giving us greater flexibility to invest in our business.

At the end of the quarter, we reached price agreement with fish customers in Chile, and we have seen already in the first 2 months of the third quarter the vaccine showing very good revenues and very good growth.

We have seen in the second quarter growth in the U.S. of companion animal 7% while international markets was 15%. I think it was in line with our expectations. In the U.S., in the second quarter, in companion animal, we had some additional promotional activities that also had an impact, a temporary impact, in terms of prices. But the growth in the different part of companion animal portfolio has been in line with our expectations. Simparica also had additional revenues in the U.S. in the first quarter that had an impact in the second quarter, but we don't see any situation that is different than what we expected vaguely with the performance of new products, Apoquel, Cytopoint, Simparica. All indicators are showing our progression in terms of market share improvement in both for dermatology and also for parasiticides segment. And in the other, in line portfolio, again, so we haven't seen any change in the generic assumptions. So I think it's something that is in line with the trend that we have seen in previous quarters. Maybe a comment on RIMADYL that has been affected by the interaction of Galliprant. Galliprant is another product for treating pain. And we know that in this market, new products, they get significant attention and growth, and this growth is maintained depending on the results that are showing in the mid and long term in terms on efficacy and safety.

And definitely, it's a significant driver of our growth in the first half and we expect also a significant driver of our growth in the second half.

The other impact that we have seen was also the implementation of the veterinarian feed that has been affecting our cattle business, especially the medicated feed additive. We saw that this was affecting temporarily to smaller producers in the U.S. and they will be adjusting how to use these products in the future. These adjustments are taking longer and we have incorporated in our guidance a more permanent impact in our revenue. But having said that, we expect more favorable conditions in the second half of the year for cattle. And we also have seen that in the second quarter, premium antibiotics has been performing very well in the years. Next question."

But combining both together, I think they are growing very nicely. And now I think we see the opportunity also to extend this experience to the European market in where we started early experience program, and we expect a full launch in September, in European market. And in the European markets, the label, it will be different. It will be a 1 milligram for 4 weeks compared to 2 milligrams in 4 to 8 weeks in the U.S. But still the products are very consistent in terms of efficacy and also in terms of safety. For Apoquel, we have seen now that Apoquel use has been extended or increased in terms of acute, but also in terms of seasonalized conditions of dogs. And this is a result of now full availability of product in the market. And also, we think -- we believe also the effort that we are making in terms of direct-to-consumer advertising. Current use will remain the main generator of revenues because the use will be very prolonged, but the acute or the seasonalized use of the product also will have significant opportunity.

So we are not saying that generic competition is not gaining share. It's gaining share in line with previous comment. And the -- well, the message I wanted to convey was that we have not seen significant changes in defense of generic penetration. What we saw is that product, which is Galliprant, it's a new product that has been introduced recently, it's a product developed by Aratana and commercialized by Elanco. It has been gaining share in this pain market. We have seen also in the past that new products in this market are having rapid penetration because it's still some level of dissatisfaction in terms of safety and products coming to the market may have some opportunity, and definitely, the opportunity will be maintained if it can really deliver all the expectations in the medium and long term. But we don't think that -- well this is something that we are confident that RIMADYL with so many years in the market with very well established profile in terms of efficacy and also in terms of safety will remain a key player in terms of managing pain for dogs. At the same time, so moving into the acquisition of Nexvet. It's very strategic for us to maintain our leadership in this area. We are convinced that there's still unmet needs in this market in terms of safety and efficacy and this can really fill this gap in terms of providing alternative to current products in the market. And we're convinced that in both in dogs and cats, RIMADYL will play a significant role. In Brazil, definitely, the scandals are not helping, but we have been managing volume quite well our growth in Brazil, despite of these political and scandal situation. And we -- the investment that we made in terms of expanding our sales force are having a very positive payback. We are growing sales in Brazil very rapidly, in Preto, but also in some other areas, areas like companion animal is also driving significant growth. And Brazil, in general, has been a market exporting, in most of the cases processed beef rather than fresh beef to some of the markets. And this is not really changing. And Brazil, they have a temporary challenge when it had the scandal in terms of the meat quality with China, but this has been already managed. And I think the prospects for Brazil are very positive. And definitely, Brazil will continue competing with the U.S. Although today, they are competing with different quality of meat. U.S. is much more focused on quality. While in Brazil, at this point, they are much more focused on process, which has not shown importance in terms of quality. So very positive in terms of future growth in Brazil. And also, we see some additional opportunities in terms of export in the U.S. Next question, please."

Our performance starts in the first 9 months has been consistent with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Companion animals has continued to drive our revenue growth in 2017 based on an innovative dermatology portfolio of our new oral parasiticide Simparica, another new product and life cycle innovations.
We have also our revenues and adjusted earnings and improve our margins in the third quarter. As our improvement have become more fully reflected in our results. We expect this to continue for the rest of the year as reflected in our updated guidance.
We are also delivering our strong performance despite the negative impact of implementation in the U.S. of the veterinary. Reset has a set higher and lower income turn on the U.S. businesses that the we usually expected. Once again, the diversity of our portfolio is helping us to deliver consistent result and market despite these and other challenges that the economic crisis, political stability and the regulatory changes.
Our results can seen our financial strength and we continue investing our capital and resources in internal and external opportunities. We are executing our brand for future growth and we are confident in our raised guidance for full year 2017.
In the third quarter, our revenue grew 8% operationally, and we are 20% operational growth for the third -- over the 9 month of the year. The main driver of our third quarter revenue growth remains at companion animal approach, which grew an impressive 19% operationally, a 30% through the first 9 months.
These were driven largely by sales of our industry-leading dermatology portfolio consisting of Apoquel and Cytopoint, our new oral parasiticide, Simparica and several other new companion [indiscernible].
In the U.S, companion animal products grew 21% and international market, they grew 15% operationally. We continue to expand our diversity in dermatology. Our latest data set in the U.S. shows that this 59% of we set the dermatology conditions in Apoquel and Cytopoint, up from 55% in the second quarter.
Cytopoint has now being at fully launched in the fourth quarter in the European Union. And we expect to generate further growth in these countries. As a result of this success in the U.S. and continued expansion in northern international market, our global dermatology portfolio achieved $134 million in sales in the third quarter, up from $102 million in the second quarter. Through the first 9 months of the year, our dermatology revenue is at $303 million. And now, we expect this sales of more than $500 million.
Simparica sales partially increased in the third quarter. And we continue to well with our expectation for the year in this large, but highly competitive market. We obtained approvals in new market like Japan and Taiwan. And expect to launch in the first quarter of the 2018.
We remain confident in the blockbuster potential of these [indiscernible]. The direct-to-consumer advertising campaign for Apoquel and Simparica which began in the second quarter in the U.S. has had a positive impact on sales and are in line with our expectations. We have been able to support business awareness for our topic dermatitis and has established more branded commission and the plantation for Simparica at a superior free and free tax protection. Meanwhile, our LUTALYSE portfolio grew 2% operationally. We saw increases in the fish, poultry and [indiscernible], offset by the decline in cattle products, we increased our third quarter at 52% operationally. Roughly equal to our total sales for the first half of this year.
This strong performance were driven by the launch of a new movie to prevent pancreatic disease in and this has I've also worked customers in Chile and see the assumptions of [indiscernible] for our [indiscernible].
We feel very positive about this new approach for the farmer and fish and we continue to lever directing markets for a support in time of production. Our expansion into the [indiscernible] portfolio and/or the lower market will help drive our future growth for our fishery business. In the case of poultry problems, we grew 10% operationally. We continue to generate strong growth in the U.S, where our expertise and broad pro portfolio are helping customers address evolving consumer and tailor our reference.
Using our [indiscernible], and such as Zoamix, is helping certain producers who are searching to know antibiotic better production. In the third quarter, our grew 1% operationally led by strong international sales of our end by sales of in Brazil. The growth was offset by decline in the U.S. [indiscernible] business. But our updated PCB and in the U.S. continues to demonstrate user customer [indiscernible]. We believe our U.S. core business is positioned to return to market growth at all market growth in 2018. Overall, our U.S. swine business and the U.S. cattle business were both impacted by the on going implementation of the veterinary and Testing [indiscernible] or VST, which has caused changes with some procedure's protocols for use of medicated [indiscernible] additive.
In the cattle markets, our sales declined 2% operationally. The decline was driven by the U.S. mainly due with the implementation as well as impact of promotional activities with last year and Healthcare animals. We continue to see positive growth in other major market like Brazil, Argentina and Australia. We also still see positive sign related to the export from the U.S. and increasing science in 2017 and into 2018.
We expect our U.S. cattle business really to growth in the fourth third quarter. After ending in the third quarter, we reported 25% operational growth in adjusted net income, significantly faster than the revenue growth of 8%. On year-to-date, we have also generated 16% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our volume proposition for shareholders that's always been based on the growing adjusted net income [indiscernible] while making the right investment in our commercial R&D and manufacturing cattle to ensure long-term profitable revenue growth.
In terms of innovation in the third quarter, European Commission granted us approval for a new addition to the vaccine [indiscernible] probably a vaccine for the swine. [indiscernible] is a multiclient vaccine that protects sicks against signs respiratory and the proactive syndrome, one of the most common diseases affecting the swine [indiscernible].
Also, in the third quarter, Zoetis extended its portfolio with approval of the new vaccine to prevent strains of infectious diseases. We are also continuing with our supply network and strategy to support our new products and long-term growth. Manufacture this critical to our past and future [indiscernible] over the last few years, we have eliminated a number of a low volume problem from our portfolio and they used our manufacturing footprint to improve our overall efficiency. While we still have the sales of the rural plans investment to complete, we also several opportunities to invest and position our manufacturing network, to best support our portfolio. They key manufacturing from high value products and improve their cost.
For example, we are trying to build a new manufacturing facility in China. This time will expand our capacity to develop and manufacture for swine, cattle and farmer fish for the Chinese market. We've also serve as a central research centering in China. We have been paid breaking ground in the spring of 2018.
In October, we also acquired the remaining 85% [indiscernible] in the Zoetis joint venture from our pharmacy in China and now we have that sold the ownership of which was founded in 2011 to producers swine vaccine. We usually acquire the former manufacturing in [indiscernible] this better control of anti-pharmaceutical ingredients, which are used in many of our [indiscernible]. We also make a less dependent of third parties and improve our long-term of cost for this durable assets.
We have also announced around with brand manufacturing capacity at our facility Michigan. To support more parasiticide Simparica, we expect to complete the regeneration by early 2019. And Iowa, we've been generalizing plants that expands our site and increase capacity for new in the coming years.
All this important users of our capital to build and ensure our capacity for growth. In summary, we continue to use our [indiscernible] presence, our diverse and innovative performance for growth and high-quality manufacturing network to achieve our financial growth in the first 9 months of the year.
As we move into the fourth quarter, we are raising our full year 2017 guidance for revenue and net income based on our continued confidence in our portfolio.
With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our third quarter results and full year guidance."

We delivered another solid quarter with top line growth from our dermatology portfolio and new companion animal products and with strong performance from our international livestock portfolio in key mark",1773,"Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter with top line growth from our dermatology portfolio and new companion animal products and with strong performance from our international livestock portfolio in key market, including Brazil, Australia, Japan and Mexico.
Total company revenue grew 8% operationally, excluded a favorable 1% impact from foreign exchange. Of that 8%, 4% came from dermatology product, 4% came from Simparica and other new product and the remaining portfolio is relatively flat. Unlike recent quarters, our prior rationalization has limited impact on our growth this quarter and we expect the same for the fourth quarter.
Now, let's see revenue highlights. Our dermatology portfolio once again passed the $100 million mark with $124 million of sales in the quarter. As we've indicated in the past, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis in the U.S. Sales of Simparica were $0.5 million in the quarter while 280% over the prior year and 21%, sequentially. In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 25% operational growth in both adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS.
We're able to achieved this significant level of growth due to the full year impact of cost reduction from our operational efficiency as well as leveraging our infrastructure. Our performance in this quarter is another example of our ability to execute and our value proposition of grow adjusted earnings, faster than sales over the long-term.
Now onto segment revenues. Our international segment generated operational revenue growth of 11% while the U.S. grew 6%. Our international segment displays balance growth across both BC and market. This growth is a testament to our diversity not only from a product portfolio perspective but geographically as well.
Turning to a few markets in the quarter. Regarding our Australia, pivotal market conditions with livestock drove growth 19% operational. Higher sheep prices provided a greater market penetration and contributed to growth and capital Australia continues this expansion following several years [indiscernible].
In companion animal, our growth has been driven by ADVEX. in brazil, we grew 14% operationally in the quarter behind the strength of our livestock and companion animal businesses. In large stock, investment we have made to expand our sales force in addition to favorable market conditions continue to contribute to growth in cattle farm.
In Swine, increased sales of IMPROVAC, driven by higher usage and greater penetration with larger customers. Meanwhile, our companion animal revenue in Brazil benefited from the continued growth of [indiscernible] of Dimona in Brazil. In Australia, we delivered another strong quarter, growing 42% operationally with growth coming from our animal vaccine business underlying demand for vaccine remains strong, we improving in the medicalization rates and a growing population.
And growth in the quarter was aided with supply reduction of water vaccine. Revenue in Japan declined 3% in operation in the quarter with a difficult comparison with the third quarter 2016, when we experienced a significant stocking of with Apoquel.
Inventory level have stabilized and we see a healthy rate of Apoquel in Japan, driven by strong demand.
which is the map experience significant growth in the quarter. This was driven by our recently introduced vaccine for pancreatic disease in Norway as well is in-line product growth across various markets, including Chile.
Normally in Chile, our the 2 largest markets in the world, which combined account for approximately 80% of global farm production. To summarize, a very strong quarter for our international segment with growth across the diversified portfolio, including all of our and key markets. This performance was driven by a combination of favorable market conditions, strategic investments and our ability to consistently drive commercial results.
Turning to the U.S. Revenue grew 6% in the third quarter. Companion animal grew 21% in the quarter while livestock declined by 6%. Companion animal products guide sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio, Simparica at a number of other recently new products. U.S. dermatology sales were $89 million for the quarter, with Cytopoint sales reaching $20 million in the U.S, exhibiting nice growth of both the prior year as well as on sequential basis.
In addition, as Juan Ramón previously mentioned, we continue to see increasing penetration in total patient care and reaching almost 50% in the quarter. This performance also resulted in 80% revenue share in the market. But the premium nature of dermatology product, we're significantly expanding the size of the market as we continue to grow patients share.
Simparica grew significantly over the same quarter last year as a direct-to-consumer investment, sales force focus and other promotion led to higher clinic penetration. Additional contribution to companion animal growth came from new product launches, including [indiscernible] our recently approved product for the treatment of heart worm and a number of line of expansion for our franchise. When we view our livestock, growth declined 6% in the quarter due to the performance of our cattle and swine businesses that nearly offset in the poultry business, declining sales in our prior visits have been impacted by a number of factors, including the impact of promotional activities in the prior year liver disease risk and incident as well as the continued implementation of the directed and has impact on all our license sale.
On a year-to-date basis, the impact of the on our cattle and swine business has been approximate $30 million. Our swine business declined again this quarter in the U.S, primarily due to competition in the PCV and higher vaccine market as well as a continued implementation of DFD.
On the positive side, our updated PCV vaccine continues to gain traction with small- and medium-sized users. And U.S. poultry for the portfolio for farmers for a full year of alternative antibiotic mitigated additive continues to be the primary driver of growth as certain producers expand, and no antibiotics ever labeled. [indiscernible] portfolio is well-positioned to address the evolving industry.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 67.9% increased approximately 40 on a reported basis versus prior year. And our sequential basis improved 230 basis points from the second quarter of this year.
Our cost in this quarter reflected impact of cost improvements in our manufacturing network as the higher the cost inventory for 2016 has largely worked its way through our P&L as expected. Adjusted SG&A declined were 2% in the quarter as we continue to see the full impact of the expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiative.
Adjusted R&D expense increased 6% for the quarter due primarily to the timing of project spending and incremental R&D associating with recent acquisitions, operating expenses in total was flat versus the same period last year and they reflect significant decrease in spending in G&A.
Those savings have been reallocated to value generating investment in commercial operation and innovation, including direct-to-consumer advertising, sales force expansion and the increased R&D.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 29%. It is significantly improved from the prior year due to the impact of a favorable jurisdiction on mix of earned. The year-over-year improvement and our adjusted effective tax rate was the driver of operational adjusted net income growth and contributed 5% in operational growth for the overall 25% for the quarter.
With our guidance for full year 2017, our consistent top line performance through the year, success of productive investment resulted with effective disciplined on cost, allowing us to improve our outlook to both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS.
For the year, we are raising and narrowing our revenue guidance and we now expect to deliver between $5,225,000,000, to $5,275,000,000 at revenue. The increase in our revenue expectation for the year is due continued strength in our business and the acceleration of our normal annual price increase in U.S. live stock to harmonize finding of our price increases across our business.
Our guidance for adjusted cost of sales for the full year continues to be approximately 33%, as we expect the continuation the improvement we saw in Q3. For SG&A, we are increasing the range to reflect variable vasts associative with our high outlook at revenue. We have increased the low end of adjusted R&D expense, as we continue to invest in future growth. On guidance to be roughly estimated tax rate of approximately 29% is consistent to our prior year and has not considered any changes discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S. are lowering our U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. As a result of the change above, we have increased the low and high end to operational adjustment net income and now expect growth from 18% to 21% corresponding with adjusted EPS expectation of $2.34, and $2.39 per share.
In the third quarter, we also repurchased another $125 million in shares and our guidance grew 40 in adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchases completed through Q3. In September, we announced the key offering of $1.2 billion, the financing is completed, has stable long-term rate with a blended coupon of 3.3%. The $750 million of these proceeds were used in October through a higher debt that was scheduled from the first quarter of 2018. The additional added to our balance sheet were aligned in EBITDA ratio within our preferred range between 2.5 and 3.05, as well as our incremental interest expense for the remainder which we have incorporated into guidance. Again, looking forward to 2018, we will have growth in our interest expense on both the higher debt balance sheet as well as the longer-term nature of the new debt.
Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we are undertaking a number of activities that serve as an indication of our commitment to sustainable and profitable growth.
In manufacturing, we are investing in additional capacity and new products, building sites and important emerging markets and bringing a strategic products under our full control while improving cost. In R&D, we continued to invest in the range innovation from new novel compound and expanding the life of existing brand, the groundbreaking platform technology such as [indiscernible].
On our commercial operation, we have invested in direct-to-consumer advertising to raise awareness and grow the market for important new products as well as expanded our sale force presence in fast-growing markets like China and Brazil. We continue to look for new external business development opportunities and invest in the recently acquired businesses, including Nexvet, chronic pain and format, which experienced significant growth in the quarter.

What you see is they are factors expert remains strong estate also that number of animals moving you'll be growing in 2018.

The problems affected by the veterinary directive as we based on terms of growth, we don't expect anything significant impact in 2018.

Well, today, we're only competing and we are competing with other problems that are probably not significant revenues in this market. We expect that in the future, some of our competitors will bring to the market, which we showed intricate significant opportunity that we have projected more than $500 million combining Apoquel and Cytopoint, we can expect there in the future.

Our performance through the first 9 months has been consistent with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Companion animal has continued to drive our revenue growth in 2017 based on an innovative",1499,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Our performance through the first 9 months has been consistent with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Companion animal has continued to drive our revenue growth in 2017 based on an innovative dermatology portfolio of our new oral parasiticide, Simparica, another new products and life cycle innovations.
We have also accelerated our revenues and adjusted earnings and improved our margins in the third quarter as our cost improvements have become more fully reflected in our results. We expect this to continue for the rest of the year as reflected in our updated guidance.
We are also delivering our strong performance despite the negative impact of implementation in the U.S. of the Veterinary Feed Directive. This has had a higher and lower impact term on the U.S. cattle and swine businesses than we usually expected. Once again, the diversity of our portfolio is helping us to deliver consistent results and growth factor in the market despite these and other challenges such as economic crisis, political instability and regulatory changes.
Our results are enhancing our financial strength, and we continue investing our capital and resources in internal and external opportunities. We are executing our brand for future growth, and we are confident in our raised guidance for full year 2017.
In the third quarter, our revenue grew 8% operationally, and we are at 7% operational growth for the first 9 months of the year. The main driver of our third quarter revenue growth remains companion animal products, which grew an impressive 19% operationally and 13% through the first 9 months. These were driven largely by sales of our industry-leading dermatology portfolio, consisting of Apoquel and Cytopoint, our new oral parasiticide, Simparica, and several other new companion animal products. In the U.S., companion animal products grew 21%, and in international markets, they grew 15% operationally.
We continue to expand our [indiscernible] in dermatology. Our latest data in the U.S. shows that 59% of dogs with dermatology conditions are treated with Apoquel or Cytopoint, up from 55% in the second quarter. Cytopoint has now been fully launched in the fourth quarter in the European Union, and we expect to generate further Cytopoint growth in these countries. As a result of this success in the U.S. and continued expansion in other international market, our global dermatology portfolio achieved $134 million in sales in the third quarter, up from $102 million in the second quarter. Through the first 9 months of the year, our dermatology revenue is at $303 million. And now we expect pig sales of more than $500 million.
Simparica sales also increased in the third quarter. And we continue to track well with our expectation for the year in this large but highly competitive market. We obtained approvals in new markets like Japan and Taiwan and expect to launch in the first quarter of 2018. We remain confident in the blockbuster potential of these products.
The direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns for Apoquel and Simparica, which began in the second quarter in the U.S., have had a positive impact on sales and are in line with our expectations. We have been able to support disease awareness for atopic dermatitis and have established more branded commission and product differentiation for Simparica as a superior flea and tick protection.
Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 2% operationally with increases in the fish, poultry and swine products, offset by a decline in cattle products. In fish products, we increased our third quarter sales 52% operationally, roughly equal to our total sales for the first half of this year.  This strong performance was driven by the launch of a new vaccine in Norway to prevent pancreatic disease in salmon, and we have also worked with customers in Chile and seen an expansion of strong sales there for our SRS vaccine for salmon. We feel very positive about this new approach for farmed fish, and we continue to lead the vaccine market for a support in the salmon production. Our expansion into vaccine for all of the fish species in other lower market will help drive future growth for our fishery business.
In the case of poultry problems, we grew 7% operationally. We continue to generate strong growth in the U.S., where our expertise and broad portfolio are helping customers address evolving consumer and retailer preferences. Using our Poulvac vaccine and medicated feed additives such as Zoamix, Robenz or Deccox, is helping certain producers who are choosing to shift to no-antibiotic cattle production.
In the third quarter, our swine products grew 1% operationally, led by strong international sales of our Suvaxyn PCV [ combo ] product and by sales of IMPROVAC in Brazil. The growth was offset by decline in the U.S. pork business. But our updated PCV and higher vaccine in the U.S. continues to demonstrate good customer adoption. We believe our U.S. pork business is positioned to return to at or above market growth in 2018. Overall, our U.S. swine business and U.S. cattle business were both impacted by ongoing implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, which had caused changes with some producers' protocols for use of medicated feed additive.
In the cattle market, our sales declined 2% operationally. The decline was driven by the U.S, mainly due to the VFD implementation as well as the impact of promotional activities last year on health care animals. We continue to see positive growth in other major beef markets like Brazil, Argentina and Australia. We also still see positive signs related to the export from the U.S. and increasing health science in 2017 and into 2018. We expect our U.S. cattle business will return to growth in the fourth quarter.
As for endings, in the third quarter, we reported 25% operational growth in adjusted net income, significantly faster than the revenue growth of 8%. And year-to-date, we have generated 16% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our value proposition for shareholders has always been based on the growing adjusted net income, [indiscernible] and sales while making the right investment in our commercial, R&D and manufacturing capabilities to ensure long-term profitable revenue growth.
In terms of innovation in the third quarter, the European Commission granted us approval for a new addition to the Suvaxyn/Fostera family of vaccines for swine. This new product is a modified live vaccine that protects pigs against porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome, one of the most common diseases affecting swine herds.
Also in the third quarter, Zoetis extended its poultry portfolio with the approval of the new Poulvac vaccine in Korea to prevent certain local strains of infectious diseases.
We are also continuing with our supply network strategy to support our new products and long-term growth. Manufacturing is critical to our path and future success. Over the last few years, we have eliminated a number of low-volume products from our portfolio and have used our manufacturing footprint to improve our overall efficiency. While we still have the imminent sales of our Guarulhos plant in Brazil to complete, we also have several opportunities to invest and position our manufacturing network and best support our portfolio, secure manufacturing control of our high-value products and improve their costs. For example, we are trying to build a new manufacturing facility in China. This [indiscernible] will expand our capacity to develop and manufacture vaccines for swine, cattle and farmed fish for the Chinese market  It also serves as a central research center in China. We anticipate breaking ground in spring of 2018.
In October, we also acquired the remaining 55% ownership stake in the Jilin Zoetis Guoyuan joint venture from our farmers in China, and now we have the sole ownership of the JV, which was founded in 2011 to produce swine vaccines.
In [indiscernible], we recently acquired the former [ MFV ] manufacturing site in [indiscernible]. This facility will give us better control of active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are used in many of our pig growth. It will also make us less dependent on third parties and improve our long-term costs for these durable assets.
We have also announced brands with manufacturing capacity at our facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan. To support more products like Simparica, we expect to complete the degeneration by early 2019. In Charles City, Iowa, we have been arising plants to expand our site and increase capacity for new poultry vaccines in the coming years. All these [indiscernible] important uses of our capital to build and ensure our capacity for growth.
In summary, we continue to use our direct sale presence, our diverse and innovative portfolio for growth and high-quality manufacturing network to achieve our financial growth in the first 9 months of the year. As we move into the fourth quarter, we are raising our full year 2017 guidance for revenue and net income based on our continued confidence in our performance.
With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our third quarter results and full year guidance."
215548781,539177808,1330905,"Zoetis Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter, with top line growth coming from our dermatology portfolio and new companion animal products and with strong performance from our international livestock portfolio in",1836,"Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter, with top line growth coming from our dermatology portfolio and new companion animal products and with strong performance from our international livestock portfolio in key markets, including Brazil, Australia, Japan and Mexico.
Total company revenue grew 8% operationally, excluding a favorable 1% impact from foreign exchange. Of that 8%, 4% came from dermatology product, 4% came from Simparica and other new products, and the remaining portfolio is relatively flat. Unlike recent quarters, our product rationalization has limited impact on our growth this quarter, and we expect the same for the fourth quarter.
Now let's see revenue highlights. Our dermatology portfolio once again passed the $100 million mark with $124 million of sales in the quarter. As we have indicated in the past, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis in the U.S. Sales of Simparica were $25 million in the quarter, growing 280% over the prior year and 21% sequentially. In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 25% operational growth in both adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS. We were able to achieve the significant level of growth due to the full year impact of cost reduction from our operational efficiency initiatives as well as leveraging our infrastructure. Our performance in this quarter is another example of our ability to execute on our value proposition of growing adjusted earnings faster than sales over the long term.
Now onto segment revenues. Our international segment generated operational revenue growth of 11%, while the U.S. grew 6%. Our international segment displayed balance growth across both DC and market. This growth is a testament to our diversity, not only from a product portfolio perspective but geographically as well.
Turning to a few markets in the quarter. Starting with Australia, favorable market conditions for livestock drove growth of 19% operationally. Higher sheep prices, combined with greater market penetration of VALBAZENE, contributed to growth, and the beef cattle herd in Australia continues its expansion following several years of drought.
In companion animal, our growth was driven by Apoquel. In Brazil, we grew 14% operationally in the quarter behind the strength of both our livestock and companion animal businesses. In livestock, investments we have made to expand our field force in addition to favorable market conditions continue to contribute to growth in cattle products.
In swine, increased sales of IMPROVAC were driven by higher usage and greater penetration with larger customers. Meanwhile, our companion animal revenue in Brazil benefited from the continued growth of Simparica [indiscernible] in Brazil.
Switching to China. We delivered another strong quarter, growing 22% operationally, with growth coming from our companion animal vaccine business. Underlying demand for our vaccines remains strong due to the improving medicalization rates and a growing population, and growth in the quarter was aided by supply reduction of water vaccine.
Revenue in Japan declined 3% operationally in the quarter due to a difficult comparison with the third quarter of 2016 when we experienced a significant initial stocking of Apoquel with wholesalers. Inventory levels have stabilized, and we see a healthy rate of sales to Apoquel in Japan, driven by strong demand.
PHARMAQ, which is reflected in other developed and other emerging markets, experienced significant growth in the quarter. This was driven by our recently introduced vaccine for pancreatic disease in Norway as well is in-line product growth across various markets, including Chile. Norway and Chile are the 2 largest farmed salmon markets in the world, which, combined, account for approximately 80% of global farmed salmon production.
To summarize, a very strong quarter for our international segment with growth across the diversified portfolio, including all of our [indiscernible] and key markets. This performance was driven by a combination of favorable market conditions, strategic investments and our ability to consistently drive commercial results.
Turning to the U.S. Revenue grew 6% in the third quarter. Companion animal grew 21% in the quarter, while livestock declined by 6%. Companion animal product sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio, Simparica and a number of other recently launched products. U.S. dermatology sales were $89 million for the quarter, with Cytopoint sales reaching $20 million in the U.S., exhibiting nice growth of both the prior year as well as on a sequential basis.
In addition, as Juan Ramón previously mentioned, we continue to see increasing penetration in total patient share, reaching almost 60% in the quarter. This performance also resulted in 80% revenue share in the market. With the premium nature of our dermatology product, we are significantly expanding the size of the market as we continue to grow patient share.
Simparica grew significantly over the same quarter last year as a direct-to-consumer investment, field force focus and other promotions led to higher clinic penetration. Additional contributions to companion animal growth came from new product launches, including DIROBAN, our recently approved product for the treatment of heartworm, and a number of line expansion for our VANGUARD vaccine franchise.
Moving to U.S. livestock. Sales declined 6% in the quarter due to the performance of our cattle and swine businesses that more than offset the robust growth in our poultry business. Declining sales in our cattle business have been impacted by a number of factors, including the impact of promotional activities in the prior year, lower disease risks and incidents as well as the continued implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive and its impact on our license sales. On a year-to-date basis, the impact of the VFD on our cattle and swine business has been approximately $30 million.
Our swine business declined again this quarter in the U.S., primarily due to competition in the PCV and higher vaccine markets as well as the continued implementation of VFD. On the positive side, our updated PCV and higher vaccine continues to gain traction with small and medium-sized producers. And in U.S. poultry, there's a [indiscernible] portfolio of alternatives to antibiotic medicated feed additive continues to be the primary driver of growth as certain producers expand and no antibiotics ever labeled. Our portfolio is well positioned to address this evolving industry practice.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 67.9% increased approximately 40 basis points on a reported basis versus prior year and on a sequential quarter basis, improved 230 basis points from the second quarter of this year.
Our costs in this quarter reflected impact of cost improvements in our manufacturing network as the higher cost inventory for 2016 has largely worked its way through our P&L as expected. Adjusted SG&A declined by 2% in the quarter as we continued to see the full impact of the expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiatives.
Adjusted R&D expense increased 6% for the quarter, due primarily to the timing of project spending and incremental R&D associating with recent acquisitions. Operating expenses in total were flat versus the same period last year, and they reflect significant decreased spending in G&A. Those savings have been reallocated to value-generating investments in commercial operation and innovation, including direct-to-consumer advertising, field force expansion and increased R&D.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 29%. It has significantly improved from the prior year due to the impact of a favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. The year-over-year improvement in our adjusted effective tax rate was the driver of operational adjusted net income growth and contributed 5% in operational growth for the overall 25% for the quarter.
We raised the guidance for full year 2017. Our consistent top line performance through the year, success of productive investments, results of effective discipline on costs are allowing us to improve our outlook for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS.
For the year, we are raising and narrowing our revenue guidance, and we now expect to deliver between $5,225,000,000 and $5,275,000,000 at revenue. The increase to our revenue expectation for the year is due to continued strength in our international business and the acceleration of our normal annual price increase in the U.S. livestock to harmonize filing of our price increases across our business.
Our guidance for adjusted cost of sales for the full year continues to be approximately 33% as we expect the continuation of the improvement we saw in Q3.
For SG&A, we are increasing the range to reflect variable costs associated with our higher outlook of revenue. We have increased the lower end of adjusted R&D expense as we continue to invest in future growth.
Our guidance for the adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 29% is consistent with our prior view and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us.
As a result of the changes above, we have increased the low and high end for operational adjusted net income and now expect growth of 18% to 21% corresponding with adjusted EPS expectation of $2.34 to $2.39 per share.
In the third quarter, we also repurchased another $125 million in shares, and our guidance grew 40 -- and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchases completed through Q3. In September, we announced a [indiscernible] debt offering of $1.25 billion. The financing was completed at favorable long-term rate with a blended coupon of 3.3%. $750 million of these proceeds were used in October to retire debt that was scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2018. The additional debt added to our balance sheet were aligned on gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio within our preferred range of between 2.5 and 3.0x as well as add incremental interest expense for the remainder of the year, which we have incorporated into guidance.
Again, looking forward to 2018, we will have growth in our interest expense based upon the higher debt balances as well as the longer-term nature of the new debt.
So just to summarize before we go to Q&A. We are undertaking a number of activities that serve as an indication of our commitment to sustainable and profitable growth. In manufacturing, we are investing in additional capacity and new products, building sites in important emerging markets and bringing strategic products under our full control while improving costs. In R&D, we continue to invest in a range of innovations, from new novel compound and extending the life of existing brands, the groundbreaking platform technologies such as monoclonal antibodies. In our commercial operations, we have invested in direct-to-consumer advertising to raise awareness and grow the market for important new products as well as expanded our field force presence in fast-growing markets like China and Brazil. We continue to look for new external business development opportunities and invest in the recently acquired businesses, including Nexvet for unmeet needs and chronic pain; and PHARMAQ for farmed fish, which experienced significant growth in the quarter.

In terms of the impact you saw in the current quarter, could you break down how much of it was the lower instance of disease versus the MFA headwinds? And then a quick follow-up in terms of volume and price contribution overall in the quarter. It sounds like you didn't see any price benefit. Is there an expectation that you overturn to sort of 100, 200 bps in 4Q and going forward? And what were the drivers of that?"

You asked what the drivers of the impact on the third quarter. Definitely, some of the impacts have been related to the Veterinary Feed Directive that has more permanent than higher impact as we initially estimated. So this has been year-to-date, as Glenn mentioned, something like $30 million. The other impact that was specific to the quarter was some promotional activities that we did in the third quarter of last year that we didn't repeat this year, and this caused the negative impact in the third quarter. And finally, we have seen that the animals, because of the weather conditions, has been showing healthier conditions. And this has been -- mainly affected the use of some autoimmune antibiotics. We expect this type of things are being corrected in the fourth quarter, and then as I said, in the fourth quarter showing a positive growth in U.S. cattle. And the second question was about the price volume, and Glenn would respond to that."

But in Chile, for instance, we have this disease which is not affecting Norway. So we're impacting many other parts of our business. Some of these diseases are raised with EBITDA in countries or regions, that's why we need also to respond to these diseases. We have different problems, depending on countries or regions. This year, we initially forecasted $125 million in the revenues for the farmed fish. Because we have challenges in the second quarter in Chile also related to this SRS vaccine, we had some negative impact in the quarter. That has been solved in the third quarter, and we expect continue growing on the SRS in Chile. But because of the impact of the second quarter, we have adjusted our projection for the year about $110 million, $115 million. Long term, I think we expect that this business will be growing faster than the average of the animal health industry, animal health industry growing at 5 to 6. We expect the farmed fish growing faster, especially the area of vaccine in where we are leading, and we expect that we will continue bringing in relation to the market."

That clearly implies that you need new products for growth. And the issue is on the U.S. livestock aside. I just want to get a better sense as to how you think you are competitively positioned.

I will respond to the U.S. livestock question first, and then we'll discuss about the competitive launch date in dermatology. So first, as I've said that we expect in the fourth quarter the U.S. cattle business sale returning to growth. In the U.S., the poultry business is doing very well. Pork has been challenging during the year. In both cases, in cattle and pork or swine, we expect growth in 2018. I mentioned that in the swine or pork business, we expect to grow at or above the market growth. In the case of cattle, what we see is that there are positive factors. Export remains strong. We stated also that the number of animals will continue growing in 2018. The market is a little bit more positive now about the expansion of herds and some of the [indiscernible]. And the other element that we expect also will have a positive impact in our revenue will be that the products affected by the Veterinary Feed Directive has been rebased. And in terms of growth, we don't expect any significant impact in 2018. So all these elements make us confident that the livestock, in general, for the U.S., will be showing positive numbers. One other thing that is always important to remember is that we have a portfolio, which is highly diverse in terms of geographies. And we know that in some cases, we'll be facing challenge in one market that will be compensated with the -- maybe acceleration of the revenues in other market, which is what is happening in 2017. And then we continue to expect that this will be an element that will provide more sustainable and predictable growth in our business. The second question about the competitive landscape in dermatology. Well, today, we are only competing with steroids, and we are competing with some other products that are today probably not significant revenues in this market. We expect that in the future, some of our competitors will bring our products into the market. This is a scenario that we show that it's a significant opportunity. Now we have projected more than $500 million combining Apoquel and Cytopoint. So it's something that clearly we can expect in the future. But just as a reference, so for us, developing Apoquel took about 8 years, Cytopoint 7 years. So even if competitors now are reacting based on this success that we are delivering, definitely, I think we feel comfortable that in the coming years, we'll maintain our very strong position in the market."

And we continue to expect to drive cash flow growth at a faster pace than adjusted net income as we do have opportunities in working capital, particularly inventory that will continue to leverage. In terms of the gross margin, so we saw nice improvement in gross margin in Q3. Just as a reminder, in the first half of the year, we had gross margin above 65%. As we moved into Q3, our gross margin is 67.9% as we got away from the costs of the previous year's inventory and how we worked that through our P&L.

Our performance through the first 9 months has been consistent with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.

Our performance through the first 9 months has been consistent with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Companion animal has continued to drive our revenue growth in 2017 based on an innovative dermatology portfolio; our new oral parasiticide, Simparica; and other new products and life cycle innovations.
We have also accelerated our revenues and adjusted earnings and improved our margins in the third quarter as our cost improvements have become more fully reflected in our results. We expect this to continue for the rest of the year as reflected in our updated guidance.
We are also delivering our strong performance despite the negative impact of implementation in the U.S. of the Veterinary Feed Directive. This has had a higher and lower impact term on the U.S. cattle and swine businesses than we usually expected. Once again, the diversity of our portfolio is helping us to deliver consistent results and growth factor in the market despite these and other challenges such as economic crisis, political instability and regulatory changes.
Our results are enhancing our financial strength, and we continue investing our capital and resources in internal and external opportunities. We are executing our plans for future growth, and we are confident in our raised guidance for full year 2017.
In the third quarter, our revenue grew 8% operationally, and we are at 7% operational growth for the first 9 months of the year. The main driver of our third quarter revenue growth remains companion animal products, which grew an impressive 19% operationally and 13% through the first 9 months. These were driven largely by sales of our industry-leading dermatology portfolio, consisting of Apoquel and Cytopoint; our new oral parasiticide, Simparica; and several other new companion animal products. In the U.S., companion animal products grew 21%, and in international markets, they grew 15% operationally.
We continue to expand our business in dermatology. Our latest data in the U.S. shows that 59% of dogs with dermatology conditions are treated with Apoquel or Cytopoint, up from 55% in the second quarter. Cytopoint has now been fully launched in the fourth quarter in the European Union, and we expect to generate further Cytopoint growth in these countries. As a result of this success in the U.S. and continued expansion in other international markets, our global dermatology portfolio achieved $124 million in sales in the third quarter, up from $102 million in the second quarter. Through the first 9 months of the year, our dermatology revenue is at $303 million. And now we expect peak sales of more than $500 million.
Simparica sales also increased in the third quarter. And we continue to track well with our expectation for the year in this large but highly competitive market. We obtained approvals in new markets like Japan and Taiwan and expect to launch in the first quarter of 2018. We remain confident in the blockbuster potential of these products.
The direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns for Apoquel and Simparica, which began in the second quarter in the U.S., have had a positive impact on sales and are in line with our expectations. We have been able to support disease awareness for atopic dermatitis and have established more brand recognition and product differentiation for Simparica as a superior flea and tick protection.
Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 2% operationally with increases in the fish, poultry and swine products, offset by a decline in cattle products. In fish products, we increased our third quarter sales 52% operationally, roughly equal to our total sales for the first half of this year.  This strong performance was driven by the launch of a new vaccine in Norway to prevent pancreatic disease in salmon, and we have also worked with customers in Chile and seen an expansion of strong sales there for our SRS vaccine for salmon. We feel very positive about this new 2 products for farmed fish, and we continue to lead the vaccine market for support in the salmon production. Our expansion into vaccines for all of fish species in all our markets will help drive future growth for our fishery business.
In the case of poultry products, we grew 7% operationally. We continue to generate strong growth in the U.S., where our expertise and broad product portfolio are helping customers address evolving consumer and retailer preferences. Using our Poulvac vaccine and medicated feed additives such as Zoamix, Robenz or Deccox, is helping certain producers who are choosing to shift to ""No Antibiotics Ever"" production.
In the third quarter, our swine products grew 1% operationally, led by strong international sales of our Suvaxyn PCV combo product and by sales of IMPROVAC in Brazil. The growth was offset by decline in the U.S. pork business. But our updated PCV M.hyo vaccine in the U.S. continues to demonstrate good customer adoption. We believe our U.S. pork business is positioned to return to at or above market growth in 2018. Overall, our U.S. swine business and U.S. cattle business were both impacted by ongoing implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, which had caused changes to some producers' protocols for use of medicated feed additive.
In the cattle market, our sales declined 2% operationally. The decline was driven by the U.S., mainly due to the VFD implementation as well as the impact of promotional activities last year on healthier animals. We continue to see positive growth in other major beef markets like Brazil, Argentina and Australia. We also still see positive signs related to the exports from the U.S. and increasing health signs in 2017 and into 2018. We expect our U.S. cattle business will return to growth in the fourth quarter.
As for earnings in the third quarter, we posted 25% operational growth in adjusted net income, significantly faster than the revenue growth of 8%. And year-to-date, we have generated 16% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our value proposition for shareholders has always been based on the growing adjusted net income, [indiscernible] and sales while making the right investment in our commercial, R&D and manufacturing capabilities to ensure long-term profitable revenue growth.
In terms of innovation in the third quarter, the European Commission granted us approval for a new addition to the Suvaxyn/Fostera family of vaccines for swine. This new product is a modified live vaccine that protects pigs against porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome, one of the most common diseases affecting swine herds.
Also in the third quarter, Zoetis extended its poultry portfolio with the approval of the new Poulvac vaccine in Korea to prevent certain local strains of infectious diseases.
We are also continuing with our supply network strategy to support our new products and long-term growth. Manufacturing is critical to our path and future success. Over the last few years, we have eliminated a number of low-volume products from our portfolio and have used our manufacturing footprint to improve our overall efficiency. While we still have the imminent sales of our Guarulhos plant in Brazil to complete, we also have several opportunities to invest and position our manufacturing network to best support our portfolio, secure manufacturing control of our high-value products and improve their costs. For example, we are trying to build a new manufacturing facility in China. This site will expand our capacity to develop and manufacture vaccines for swine, cattle and farmed fish for the Chinese market. It also serves as a central research center in China. We anticipate breaking ground in spring of 2018.
In October, we also acquired the remaining 55% ownership stake in the Jilin Zoetis Guoyuan joint venture from our partners in China, and now we have the sole ownership of the JV, which was founded in 2011 to produce swine vaccines.
In Ireland, we recently acquired the former MSD manufacturing site in Rathdrum. This facility will give us better control of active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are used in many of our key products. It will also make us less dependent on third parties and improve our long-term costs for these durable assets.
We have also announced plans to expand manufacturing capacity at our facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan, to support more products like Simparica, and we expect to complete these renovations by early 2019. And in Charles City, Iowa, we are finalizing plans to expand our site and increase capacity for new poultry vaccines in the coming years. All represent important uses of our capital to build and ensure our capacity for growth.
In summary, we continue to use our direct sale presence, our diverse and innovative portfolio of our products and high-quality manufacturing network to achieve our financial growth in the first 9 months of the year. As we move into the fourth quarter, we are raising our full year 2017 guidance for revenue and net income based on our continued confidence in our performance.
With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our third quarter results and full year guidance."
215548781,539177808,1332907,"Zoetis Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter, with top line growth coming from our dermatology portfolio and new companion animal products and with strong performance from our international livestock portfolio in",1837,"Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter, with top line growth coming from our dermatology portfolio and new companion animal products and with strong performance from our international livestock portfolio in key markets, including Brazil, Australia, Japan and Mexico.
Total company revenue grew 8% operationally, excluding a favorable 1% impact from foreign exchange. Of that 8%, 4% came from dermatology products, 4% came from Simparica and other new products, and the remaining portfolio is relatively flat. Unlike recent quarters, our product rationalization has limited impact on our growth this quarter, and we expect the same for the fourth quarter.
Now let's see revenue highlights. Our dermatology portfolio once again surpassed the $100 million mark with $124 million of sales in the quarter. As we have indicated in the past, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis in the U.S. Sales of Simparica were $25 million in the quarter, growing 280% over the prior year and 21% sequentially. In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 25% operational growth in both adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS. We were able to achieve the significant level of growth due to the full year impact of cost reductions from our operational efficiency initiatives as well as leveraging our infrastructure. Our performance in this quarter is another example of our ability to execute on our value proposition of growing adjusted earnings faster than sales over the long term.
Now onto segment revenues. Our international segment generated operational revenue growth of 11%, while the U.S. grew 6%. Our international segment displayed balance growth across both species and markets. This growth is a testament to our diversity, not only from a product portfolio perspective but geographically as well.
Turning to some key markets in the quarter. Starting with Australia, favorable market conditions for livestock drove growth of 19% operationally. Higher sheep prices, combined with greater market penetration of VALBAZEN contributed to growth, and the beef cattle herd in Australia continues its expansion following several years of drought.
In companion animal, our growth was driven by Apoquel. In Brazil, we grew 14% operationally in the quarter behind the strength of both our livestock and companion animal businesses. In livestock, investments we have made to expand our field force in addition to favorable market conditions continue to contribute to growth in cattle products.
In swine, increased sales of IMPROVAC were driven by higher usage and greater penetration with larger customers. Meanwhile, higher companion animal revenue in Brazil benefited from the continued growth of Simparic, as it's known in Brazil.
Switching to China. We delivered another strong quarter, growing 22% operationally, with growth coming from our companion animal vaccines business. Underlying demand for our vaccines remains strong due to the improving medicalization rates and a growing population, and growth in the quarter was aided by supply resumption of one of our vaccines.
Revenue in Japan declined 3% operationally in the quarter due to a difficult comparison with the third quarter of 2016 when we experienced a significant initial stocking of Apoquel with wholesalers. Inventory levels have stabilized, and we see a healthy rate of sales for Apoquel in Japan, driven by strong demand.
PHARMAQ, which is reflected in other developed and other emerging markets, experienced significant growth in the quarter. This was driven by our recently introduced vaccine for pancreatic disease in Norway as well is in-line product growth across various markets, including Chile. Norway and Chile are the 2 largest farmed salmon markets in the world, which, combined, account for approximately 80% of global farmed salmon production.
To summarize, a very strong quarter for our international segment with growth across the diversified portfolio, including all of our core species and key markets. This performance was driven by a combination of favorable market conditions, strategic investments and our ability to consistently drive commercial results.
Turning to the U.S. Revenue grew 6% in the third quarter. Companion animal grew 21% in the quarter, while livestock declined by 6%. Companion animal product sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio, Simparica and a number of other recently launched products. U.S. dermatology sales were $89 million for the quarter, with Cytopoint sales reaching $20 million in the U.S., exhibiting nice growth of both the prior year as well as on a sequential basis.
In addition, as Juan Ramón previously mentioned, we continue to see increasing penetration in total patient share, reaching almost 60% in the quarter. This performance also resulted in 80% revenue share in the market. With the premium nature of our dermatology product, we are significantly expanding the size of the market as we continue to grow patient share.
Simparica grew significantly over the same quarter last year as a direct-to-consumer investment, field force focus and other promotions led to higher clinic penetration. Additional contributions to companion animal growth came from new product launches, including DIROBAN, our recently approved product for the treatment of heartworm, and a number of line extensions for our VANGUARD vaccine franchise.
Moving to U.S. livestock. Sales declined 6% in the quarter due to the performance of our cattle and swine businesses that more than offset the robust growth in our poultry business. Declining sales in our cattle business have been impacted by a number of factors, including the impact of promotional activities in the prior year, lower disease risks and incidents as well as the continued implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive and its impact on AUREOMYCIN sales. On a year-to-date basis, the impact of the VFD on our cattle and swine business has been approximately $30 million.
Our swine business declined again this quarter in the U.S., primarily due to competition in the PCV M.hyo vaccine markets as well as the continued implementation of VFD. On the positive side, our updated PCV M.hyo vaccine continues to gain traction with small and medium-sized producers. And in U.S. poultry, the Zoetis portfolio of alternatives to antibiotic medicated feed additives continues to be the primary driver of growth as certain producers expand their ""No Antibiotics Ever"" labels. Our portfolio is well positioned to address these evolving industry practices.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 67.9% increased approximately 40 basis points on a reported basis versus prior year and on a sequential quarter basis, improved 230 basis points from the second quarter of this year.
Our costs in this quarter reflect the impact of cost improvements in our manufacturing network as the higher cost inventory for 2016 has largely worked its way through our P&L as expected. Adjusted SG&A declined by 2% in the quarter as we continue to see the full impact of the expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiatives.
Adjusted R&D expense increased 6% for the quarter, due primarily to the timing of project spending and incremental R&D associated with recent acquisitions. Operating expenses in total were flat versus the same period last year, and they reflect significant decreased spending in G&A. Those savings have been reallocated to value-generating investments in commercial operations and innovation, including direct-to-consumer advertising, field force expansion and increased R&D.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 29%. It has significantly improved from the prior year due to the impact of a favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. The year-over-year improvement in our adjusted effective tax rate was the driver of operational adjusted net income growth and contributed 5% in operational growth for the overall 25% for the quarter.
Moving to guidance for full year 2017. Our consistent top line performance through the year, success of productive investments, results of effective discipline on costs are allowing us to improve our outlook for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS.
For the year, we are raising and narrowing our revenue guidance, and we now expect to deliver between $5,225,000,000 and $5,275,000,000 at revenue. The increase to our revenue expectation for the year is due to continued strength in our international business and the acceleration of our normal annual price increase in the U.S. livestock to harmonize timing of our price increases across our business.
Our guidance for adjusted cost of sales for the full year continues to be approximately 33% as we expect the continuation of the improvement we saw in Q3.
For SG&A, we are increasing the range to reflect variable costs associated with our higher outlook at revenue. We have increased the lower end of adjusted R&D spend as we continue to invest in future growth.
Our guidance for the adjusted estimated tax rate of approximately 29% is consistent with our prior view and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us.
As a result of the changes above, we have increased the low and high end for operational adjusted net income and now expect growth of 18% to 21% corresponding with adjusted EPS expectation of $2.34 to $2.39 per share.
In the third quarter, we also repurchased another $125 million in shares, and our guidance grew 40 -- and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchases completed through Q3. In September, we announced a senior debt offering of $1.25 billion. The financing was completed at favorable long-term rate with a blended coupon of 3.3%. $750 million of these proceeds were used in October to retire debt that was scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2018. The additional debt added to our balance sheet will align our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio within our preferred range of between 2.5x and 3.0x as well as add incremental interest expense for the remainder of the year, which we have incorporated into guidance.
Again, looking forward to 2018, we will have growth in our interest expense based both on higher debt balances as well as the longer-term nature of the new debt.
So just to summarize before we go to Q&A. We are undertaking a number of activities that serve as an indication of our commitment to sustainable and profitable growth. In manufacturing, we are investing in additional capacity and new products, building sites in important emerging markets and bringing strategic products under our full control while improving costs. In R&D, we continue to invest in a range of innovations, from new novel compounds and extending the life of existing brands to groundbreaking platform technologies such as monoclonal antibodies. In our commercial operations, we have invested in direct-to-consumer advertising to raise awareness and grow the market for important new products as well as expanding our field force presence in fast-growing markets like China and Brazil. We continue to look for new external business development opportunities and invest in the recently acquired businesses, including Nexvet for unmet needs in chronic pain; and PHARMAQ for farmed fish, which experienced significant growth in the quarter.

Definitely, some of the impacts have been related to the Veterinary Feed Directive that has more permanent and higher impact that we initially estimated. So this has been year-to-date, as Glenn mentioned, something like $30 million. The other impact that was specific to the quarter was some promotional activities that we did in the third quarter of last year that we didn't repeat this year, and this caused a negative impact in the third quarter. And finally, we have seen that the animals, because of the weather conditions, has been showing healthier conditions. And this has been -- mainly affected the use of some autoimmune antibiotics.

It's a pancreatic disease that is a vaccine or it's a condition that is quite prevalent in some parts of Norway. And we were not participating in this business. Now we have a vaccine, and this vaccine's performance is doing well and also having a positive impact in the rest of the portfolio. We are not expecting that pancreatic disease affecting Chile. But in Chile, for instance, we have this SRS disease which is not affecting Norway. So we -- in fact, in many other parts of our business, some of these diseases are very specific to countries or regions, that's why we need also to respond to these diseases. We have different problems, depending on countries or regions. This year, we initially forecasted $125 million in revenues for the farmed fish. Because we have some challenge in the second quarter in Chile also related to this SRS vaccine, we had some negative impact in the quarter. That has been solved in the third quarter, and we expect to continue growing on the SRS in Chile. But because of the impact of the second quarter, we have adjusted our projection for the year about $110 million, $115 million. Long term, I think we expect that this business will be growing faster than the average of the animal health industry, animal health industry growing at 5 to 6. We expect the farmed fish growing faster, especially the area of vaccine in where we are leading, and we expect that we will continue bringing innovation to the market."

Glenn, I think you said 4% of the growth is coming from derm, 4% of the growth is coming from Simparica and the rest of the business was flat. That clearly implies that you need new products for growth. And the issues on the U.S. livestock aside, I just want to get a better sense as to how you think you are competitively positioned. And particularly, the derm space, I'm sure this growth hasn't gone unnoticed by your competitors. So as these launches moderate, a, how do you think you will compete relative to the competitors?

I will respond to the U.S. livestock question first, and then we'll discuss about the competitive landscape in dermatology. So first, as I've said that we expect the fourth quarter the U.S. cattle business returning to growth. In the U.S., the poultry business is doing very well. Pork has been challenging during the year. In both cases, in cattle and pork or swine, we expect growth in 2018. I mentioned that in the swine or pork business, we expect to grow at or above the market growth. In the case of cattle, what we see is that there are positive factors. Export remains strong. We expect also that the number of animals will continue growing in 2018. The market is a little bit more positive now about the expansion of herds than some months ago. And the other element that we expect also will have a positive impact in our revenues will be that the products affected by the Veterinary Feed Directive has been rebased. And in terms of growth, we don't expect any significant impact in 2018. So all these elements make us confident that the livestock, in general, for the U.S., will be showing positive numbers. One other thing that is always important to remember is that we have a portfolio, which is highly diverse in terms of geographies. And we know that in some cases, we'll be facing challenge in one market that will be compensated with the -- maybe acceleration of the revenues in other markets, which is what is happening in 2017. And then we continue to expect that this will be an element that will provide more sustainable and predictable growth in our business. The second question was about the competitive landscape in dermatology. Well, today, we are only competing with steroids, and we are competing with some other products that are creating probably not significant revenues in this market. We expect that in the future, some of our competitors will bring other products into the market. This is an area that we show that it's a significant opportunity. Now we have projected more than $500 million combining Apoquel and Cytopoint. So it's something that definitely we can expect in the future. But just as a reference, so for us, developing Apoquel took about 8 years, Cytopoint, 7 years. So even if competitors now are reacting based on this success that we are delivering, definitely, I think we feel comfortable that in the coming years, we'll maintain our very strong position in the market."

So on a cash flow generation perspective, I think when you look at 2017, we've guided that we see our operating cash flow pretty close to be approximating adjusted net income, and that implies significant growth in cash flow this year as we got a lot of the costs related to our operational efficiencies initiatives, the implementation of SAP and other costs. And we continue to expect to drive cash flow growth at a faster pace than adjusted net income as we do have opportunities in working capital, particularly in inventory that we'll continue to leverage. In terms of the gross margin, so we saw nice improvement in gross margin in Q3. And just as a reminder, in the first half of the year, we had gross margin above 65%. As we moved into Q3, our gross margin is 67.9% as we got away from the costs of the previous year's inventory and how we worked that through our P&L. And this was exactly as we expected, and it does give us greater confidence in our full-year guidance of cost of goods at approximately 33%. And in terms of how that moves forward, well, we're not giving specific guidance for 2018 at this point.

Our performance through the first 9 months has been consistent with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.

Our performance through the first 9 months has been consistent with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Companion animal has continued to drive our revenue growth in 2017 based on an innovative dermatology portfolio; our new oral parasiticide, Simparica; and other new products and life cycle innovations.
We have also accelerated our revenues and adjusted earnings and improved our margins in the third quarter as our cost improvements have become more fully reflected in our results. We expect this to continue for the rest of the year as reflected in our updated guidance.
We are also delivering our strong performance despite the negative impact of implementation in the U.S. of the Veterinary Feed Directive. This has had a higher and lower impact term on the U.S. cattle and swine businesses than we usually expected. Once again, the diversity of our portfolio is helping us to deliver consistent results and growth factor in the market despite these and other challenges such as economic crisis, political instability and regulatory changes.
Our results are enhancing our financial strength, and we continue investing our capital and resources in internal and external opportunities. We are executing our plans for future growth, and we are confident in our raised guidance for full year 2017.
In the third quarter, our revenue grew 8% operationally, and we are at 7% operational growth for the first 9 months of the year. The main driver of our third quarter revenue growth remains companion animal products, which grew an impressive 19% operationally and 13% through the first 9 months. These were driven largely by sales of our industry-leading dermatology portfolio, consisting of Apoquel and Cytopoint; our new oral parasiticide, Simparica; and several other new companion animal products. In the U.S., companion animal products grew 21%, and in international markets, they grew 15% operationally.
We continue to expand our business in dermatology. Our latest data in the U.S. shows that 59% of dogs with dermatology conditions are treated with Apoquel or Cytopoint, up from 55% in the second quarter. Cytopoint has now been fully launched in the fourth quarter in the European Union, and we expect to generate further Cytopoint growth in these countries. As a result of this success in the U.S. and continued expansion in other international markets, our global dermatology portfolio achieved $124 million in sales in the third quarter, up from $102 million in the second quarter. Through the first 9 months of the year, our dermatology revenue is at $303 million. And now we expect peak sales of more than $500 million.
Simparica sales also increased in the third quarter. And we continue to track well with our expectation for the year in this large but highly competitive market. We obtained approvals in new markets like Japan and Taiwan and expect to launch in the first quarter of 2018. We remain confident in the blockbuster potential of these products.
The direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns for Apoquel and Simparica, which began in the second quarter in the U.S., have had a positive impact on sales and are in line with our expectations. We have been able to support disease awareness for atopic dermatitis and have established more brand recognition and product differentiation for Simparica as a superior flea and tick protection.
Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 2% operationally with increases in the fish, poultry and swine products, offset by a decline in cattle products. In fish products, we increased our third quarter sales 52% operationally, roughly equal to our total sales for the first half of this year.  This strong performance was driven by the launch of a new vaccine in Norway to prevent pancreatic disease in salmon, and we have also worked with customers in Chile and seen an expansion of strong sales there for our SRS vaccine for salmon. We feel very positive about this new 2 products for farmed fish, and we continue to lead the vaccine market for support in the salmon production. Our expansion into vaccines for all of fish species in all our markets will help drive future growth for our fishery business.
In the case of poultry products, we grew 7% operationally. We continue to generate strong growth in the U.S., where our expertise and broad product portfolio are helping customers address evolving consumer and retailer preferences. Using our Poulvac vaccine and medicated feed additives such as Zoamix, Robenz or Deccox, is helping certain producers who are choosing to shift to ""No Antibiotics Ever"" production.
In the third quarter, our swine products grew 1% operationally, led by strong international sales of our Suvaxyn PCV combo product and by sales of IMPROVAC in Brazil. The growth was offset by decline in the U.S. pork business. But our updated PCV M.hyo vaccine in the U.S. continues to demonstrate good customer adoption. We believe our U.S. pork business is positioned to return to at or above market growth in 2018. Overall, our U.S. swine business and U.S. cattle business were both impacted by ongoing implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, which had caused changes to some producers' protocols for use of medicated feed additive.
In the cattle market, our sales declined 2% operationally. The decline was driven by the U.S., mainly due to the VFD implementation as well as the impact of promotional activities last year on healthier animals. We continue to see positive growth in other major beef markets like Brazil, Argentina and Australia. We also still see positive signs related to the exports from the U.S. and increasing health signs in 2017 and into 2018. We expect our U.S. cattle business will return to growth in the fourth quarter.
As for earnings in the third quarter, we posted 25% operational growth in adjusted net income, significantly faster than the revenue growth of 8%. And year-to-date, we have generated 16% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our value proposition for shareholders has always been based on the growing adjusted net income, [indiscernible] and sales while making the right investment in our commercial, R&D and manufacturing capabilities to ensure long-term profitable revenue growth.
In terms of innovation in the third quarter, the European Commission granted us approval for a new addition to the Suvaxyn/Fostera family of vaccines for swine. This new product is a modified live vaccine that protects pigs against porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome, one of the most common diseases affecting swine herds.
Also in the third quarter, Zoetis extended its poultry portfolio with the approval of the new Poulvac vaccine in Korea to prevent certain local strains of infectious diseases.
We are also continuing with our supply network strategy to support our new products and long-term growth. Manufacturing is critical to our path and future success. Over the last few years, we have eliminated a number of low-volume products from our portfolio and have used our manufacturing footprint to improve our overall efficiency. While we still have the imminent sales of our Guarulhos plant in Brazil to complete, we also have several opportunities to invest and position our manufacturing network to best support our portfolio, secure manufacturing control of our high-value products and improve their costs. For example, we are trying to build a new manufacturing facility in China. This site will expand our capacity to develop and manufacture vaccines for swine, cattle and farmed fish for the Chinese market. It also serves as a central research center in China. We anticipate breaking ground in spring of 2018.
In October, we also acquired the remaining 55% ownership stake in the Jilin Zoetis Guoyuan joint venture from our partners in China, and now we have the sole ownership of the JV, which was founded in 2011 to produce swine vaccines.
In Ireland, we recently acquired the former MSD manufacturing site in Rathdrum. This facility will give us better control of active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are used in many of our key products. It will also make us less dependent on third parties and improve our long-term costs for these durable assets.
We have also announced plans to expand manufacturing capacity at our facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan, to support more products like Simparica, and we expect to complete these renovations by early 2019. And in Charles City, Iowa, we are finalizing plans to expand our site and increase capacity for new poultry vaccines in the coming years. All represent important uses of our capital to build and ensure our capacity for growth.
In summary, we continue to use our direct sale presence, our diverse and innovative portfolio of our products and high-quality manufacturing network to achieve our financial growth in the first 9 months of the year. As we move into the fourth quarter, we are raising our full year 2017 guidance for revenue and net income based on our continued confidence in our performance.
With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our third quarter results and full year guidance."
215548781,539177808,1333494,"Zoetis Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter, with top line growth coming from our dermatology portfolio and new companion animal products and with strong performance from our international livestock portfolio in",1837,"Thank you, Juan Ramón, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter, with top line growth coming from our dermatology portfolio and new companion animal products and with strong performance from our international livestock portfolio in key markets, including Brazil, Australia, Japan and Mexico.
Total company revenue grew 8% operationally, excluding a favorable 1% impact from foreign exchange. Of that 8%, 4% came from dermatology products, 4% came from Simparica and other new products, and the remaining portfolio is relatively flat. Unlike recent quarters, our product rationalization has limited impact on our growth this quarter, and we expect the same for the fourth quarter.
Now let's see revenue highlights. Our dermatology portfolio once again surpassed the $100 million mark with $124 million of sales in the quarter. As we have indicated in the past, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis in the U.S. Sales of Simparica were $25 million in the quarter, growing 280% over the prior year and 21% sequentially. In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 25% operational growth in both adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS. We were able to achieve the significant level of growth due to the full year impact of cost reductions from our operational efficiency initiatives as well as leveraging our infrastructure. Our performance in this quarter is another example of our ability to execute on our value proposition of growing adjusted earnings faster than sales over the long term.
Now onto segment revenues. Our international segment generated operational revenue growth of 11%, while the U.S. grew 6%. Our international segment displayed balance growth across both species and markets. This growth is a testament to our diversity, not only from a product portfolio perspective but geographically as well.
Turning to some key markets in the quarter. Starting with Australia, favorable market conditions for livestock drove growth of 19% operationally. Higher sheep prices, combined with greater market penetration of VALBAZEN contributed to growth, and the beef cattle herd in Australia continues its expansion following several years of drought.
In companion animal, our growth was driven by Apoquel. In Brazil, we grew 14% operationally in the quarter behind the strength of both our livestock and companion animal businesses. In livestock, investments we have made to expand our field force in addition to favorable market conditions continue to contribute to growth in cattle products.
In swine, increased sales of IMPROVAC were driven by higher usage and greater penetration with larger customers. Meanwhile, higher companion animal revenue in Brazil benefited from the continued growth of Simparic, as it's known in Brazil.
Switching to China. We delivered another strong quarter, growing 22% operationally, with growth coming from our companion animal vaccines business. Underlying demand for our vaccines remains strong due to the improving medicalization rates and a growing population, and growth in the quarter was aided by supply resumption of one of our vaccines.
Revenue in Japan declined 3% operationally in the quarter due to a difficult comparison with the third quarter of 2016 when we experienced a significant initial stocking of Apoquel with wholesalers. Inventory levels have stabilized, and we see a healthy rate of sales for Apoquel in Japan, driven by strong demand.
PHARMAQ, which is reflected in other developed and other emerging markets, experienced significant growth in the quarter. This was driven by our recently introduced vaccine for pancreatic disease in Norway as well is in-line product growth across various markets, including Chile. Norway and Chile are the 2 largest farmed salmon markets in the world, which, combined, account for approximately 80% of global farmed salmon production.
To summarize, a very strong quarter for our international segment with growth across the diversified portfolio, including all of our core species and key markets. This performance was driven by a combination of favorable market conditions, strategic investments and our ability to consistently drive commercial results.
Turning to the U.S. Revenue grew 6% in the third quarter. Companion animal grew 21% in the quarter, while livestock declined by 6%. Companion animal product sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio, Simparica and a number of other recently launched products. U.S. dermatology sales were $89 million for the quarter, with Cytopoint sales reaching $20 million in the U.S., exhibiting nice growth of both the prior year as well as on a sequential basis.
In addition, as Juan Ramón previously mentioned, we continue to see increasing penetration in total patient share, reaching almost 60% in the quarter. This performance also resulted in 80% revenue share in the market. With the premium nature of our dermatology product, we are significantly expanding the size of the market as we continue to grow patient share.
Simparica grew significantly over the same quarter last year as a direct-to-consumer investment, field force focus and other promotions led to higher clinic penetration. Additional contributions to companion animal growth came from new product launches, including DIROBAN, our recently approved product for the treatment of heartworm, and a number of line extensions for our VANGUARD vaccine franchise.
Moving to U.S. livestock. Sales declined 6% in the quarter due to the performance of our cattle and swine businesses that more than offset the robust growth in our poultry business. Declining sales in our cattle business have been impacted by a number of factors, including the impact of promotional activities in the prior year, lower disease risks and incidents as well as the continued implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive and its impact on AUREOMYCIN sales. On a year-to-date basis, the impact of the VFD on our cattle and swine business has been approximately $30 million.
Our swine business declined again this quarter in the U.S., primarily due to competition in the PCV M.hyo vaccine markets as well as the continued implementation of VFD. On the positive side, our updated PCV M.hyo vaccine continues to gain traction with small and medium-sized producers. And in U.S. poultry, the Zoetis portfolio of alternatives to antibiotic medicated feed additives continues to be the primary driver of growth as certain producers expand their ""No Antibiotics Ever"" labels. Our portfolio is well positioned to address these evolving industry practices.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 67.9% increased approximately 40 basis points on a reported basis versus prior year and on a sequential quarter basis, improved 230 basis points from the second quarter of this year.
Our costs in this quarter reflect the impact of cost improvements in our manufacturing network as the higher cost inventory for 2016 has largely worked its way through our P&L as expected. Adjusted SG&A declined by 2% in the quarter as we continue to see the full impact of the expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiatives.
Adjusted R&D expense increased 6% for the quarter, due primarily to the timing of project spending and incremental R&D associated with recent acquisitions. Operating expenses in total were flat versus the same period last year, and they reflect significant decreased spending in G&A. Those savings have been reallocated to value-generating investments in commercial operations and innovation, including direct-to-consumer advertising, field force expansion and increased R&D.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 29%. It has significantly improved from the prior year due to the impact of a favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. The year-over-year improvement in our adjusted effective tax rate was the driver of operational adjusted net income growth and contributed 5% in operational growth for the overall 25% for the quarter.
Moving to guidance for full year 2017. Our consistent top line performance through the year, success of productive investments, results of effective discipline on costs are allowing us to improve our outlook for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS.
For the year, we are raising and narrowing our revenue guidance, and we now expect to deliver between $5,225,000,000 and $5,275,000,000 at revenue. The increase to our revenue expectation for the year is due to continued strength in our international business and the acceleration of our normal annual price increase in the U.S. livestock to harmonize timing of our price increases across our business.
Our guidance for adjusted cost of sales for the full year continues to be approximately 33% as we expect the continuation of the improvement we saw in Q3.
For SG&A, we are increasing the range to reflect variable costs associated with our higher outlook at revenue. We have increased the lower end of adjusted R&D spend as we continue to invest in future growth.
Our guidance for the adjusted estimated tax rate of approximately 29% is consistent with our prior view and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pretax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us.
As a result of the changes above, we have increased the low and high end for operational adjusted net income and now expect growth of 18% to 21% corresponding with adjusted EPS expectation of $2.34 to $2.39 per share.
In the third quarter, we also repurchased another $125 million in shares, and our guidance grew 40 -- and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchases completed through Q3. In September, we announced a senior debt offering of $1.25 billion. The financing was completed at favorable long-term rate with a blended coupon of 3.3%. $750 million of these proceeds were used in October to retire debt that was scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2018. The additional debt added to our balance sheet will align our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio within our preferred range of between 2.5x and 3.0x as well as add incremental interest expense for the remainder of the year, which we have incorporated into guidance.
Again, looking forward to 2018, we will have growth in our interest expense based both on higher debt balances as well as the longer-term nature of the new debt.
So just to summarize before we go to Q&A. We are undertaking a number of activities that serve as an indication of our commitment to sustainable and profitable growth. In manufacturing, we are investing in additional capacity and new products, building sites in important emerging markets and bringing strategic products under our full control while improving costs. In R&D, we continue to invest in a range of innovations, from new novel compounds and extending the life of existing brands to groundbreaking platform technologies such as monoclonal antibodies. In our commercial operations, we have invested in direct-to-consumer advertising to raise awareness and grow the market for important new products as well as expanding our field force presence in fast-growing markets like China and Brazil. We continue to look for new external business development opportunities and invest in the recently acquired businesses, including Nexvet for unmet needs in chronic pain; and PHARMAQ for farmed fish, which experienced significant growth in the quarter.

Definitely, some of the impacts have been related to the Veterinary Feed Directive that has more permanent and higher impact that we initially estimated. So this has been year-to-date, as Glenn mentioned, something like $30 million. The other impact that was specific to the quarter was some promotional activities that we did in the third quarter of last year that we didn't repeat this year, and this caused a negative impact in the third quarter. And finally, we have seen that the animals, because of the weather conditions, has been showing healthier conditions. And this has been -- mainly affected the use of some autoimmune antibiotics.

But in Chile, for instance, we have this SRS disease which is not affecting Norway. So we -- in fact, in many other parts of our business, some of these diseases are very specific to countries or regions, that's why we need also to respond to these diseases. We have different problems, depending on countries or regions. This year, we initially forecasted $125 million in revenues for the farmed fish. Because we have some challenge in the second quarter in Chile also related to this SRS vaccine, we had some negative impact in the quarter. That has been solved in the third quarter, and we expect to continue growing on the SRS in Chile. But because of the impact of the second quarter, we have adjusted our projection for the year about $110 million, $115 million. Long term, I think we expect that this business will be growing faster than the average of the animal health industry, animal health industry growing at 5 to 6.

So first, as I've said that we expect the fourth quarter the U.S. cattle business returning to growth. In the U.S., the poultry business is doing very well. Pork has been challenging during the year. In both cases, in cattle and pork or swine, we expect growth in 2018. I mentioned that in the swine or pork business, we expect to grow at or above the market growth. In the case of cattle, what we see is that there are positive factors. Export remains strong. We expect also that the number of animals will continue growing in 2018. The market is a little bit more positive now about the expansion of herds than some months ago. And the other element that we expect also will have a positive impact in our revenues will be that the products affected by the Veterinary Feed Directive has been rebased. And in terms of growth, we don't expect any significant impact in 2018. So all these elements make us confident that the livestock, in general, for the U.S., will be showing positive numbers. One other thing that is always important to remember is that we have a portfolio, which is highly diverse in terms of geographies. And we know that in some cases, we'll be facing challenge in one market that will be compensated with the -- maybe acceleration of the revenues in other markets, which is what is happening in 2017. And then we continue to expect that this will be an element that will provide more sustainable and predictable growth in our business. The second question was about the competitive landscape in dermatology. Well, today, we are only competing with steroids, and we are competing with some other products that are creating probably not significant revenues in this market. We expect that in the future, some of our competitors will bring other products into the market. This is an area that we show that it's a significant opportunity. Now we have projected more than $500 million combining Apoquel and Cytopoint. So it's something that definitely we can expect in the future. But just as a reference, so for us, developing Apoquel took about 8 years, Cytopoint, 7 years. So even if competitors now are reacting based on this success that we are delivering, definitely, I think we feel comfortable that in the coming years, we'll maintain our very strong position in the market."

So on a cash flow generation perspective, I think when you look at 2017, we've guided that we see our operating cash flow pretty close to be approximating adjusted net income, and that implies significant growth in cash flow this year as we got a lot of the costs related to our operational efficiencies initiatives, the implementation of SAP and other costs. And we continue to expect to drive cash flow growth at a faster pace than adjusted net income as we do have opportunities in working capital, particularly in inventory that we'll continue to leverage. In terms of the gross margin, so we saw nice improvement in gross margin in Q3. And just as a reminder, in the first half of the year, we had gross margin above 65%. As we moved into Q3, our gross margin is 67.9% as we got away from the costs of the previous year's inventory and how we worked that through our P&L. And this was exactly as we expected, and it does give us greater confidence in our full-year guidance of cost of goods at approximately 33%. And in terms of how that moves forward, well, we're not giving specific guidance for 2018 at this point. We still are committed to the 200 basis point improvement in gross margin by 2020, and we do expect to see some of that come forward in 2018."
