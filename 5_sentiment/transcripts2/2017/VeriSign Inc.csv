I'm pleased report another solid quarter, which capped another solid year for VeriSign. The year marks some significant milestones for the Internet community and for VeriSign with the completion of the IANA transition, our signing of the Root Zone Maintainer service agreement with ICANN and the .com registry agreement extension amendment, which extends the .com registry agreement until the end of November 2024.
Our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
During 2016, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1,142,000,000 in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $666 million and producing full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margins of 64.5%. Operationally, 2016 was a solid year for the company. VeriSign processed 35.8 million new .com and .net domain name registrations and finished the year with 142.2 million .com and .net names in the domain name base.
During the year, we marked more than 19 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net.
As part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2 million shares for $160 million. During the full year 2016, we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $637 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $641 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the year. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .nets was 142.2 million, consisting of 126.9 million names for .com and 15.3 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 1.7% year-over-year. As noted in prior conference calls, the fourth quarter of 2016 was somewhat unique as the volume of domain name registrations up for renewal in the quarter had a larger-than-normal percentage of first-time renewing registrations due to the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 2015 coming from China investors.
As first-time renewing names have a lower renewal rate than previously renewed names, fourth quarter 2016 deletes were elevated and resulted in the domain name base decrease of 1.9 million net names after processing 8.8 million new gross registrations during the quarter. This larger percentage of first-time renewing names also leading to an overall -- is also leading to an overall preliminary fourth quarter 2016 renewal rate of 67.5%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2015.
In the third quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 73% compared with 71.9% for the same quarter of 2015. While activity from China has normalized over the last few quarters, the China names surge of late 2015 declined but did carry over into the first quarter of 2016. As a result, we expect the small group of names to contribute to a slight increase in deletes towards the end of the current Q1 and the beginning of Q2.
Based on these and other factors, we expect full year 2017 domain name base growth of between 0.5% and 2.5% with an increase to the domain name base of between 0.7 million and 1.2 million registrations in the first quarter.
Now I'd like to provide 2 updates before handing the call over to George. First, as it relates to our becoming a registry operator for .web, on January 18, 2017, the company received a civil investigative demand from the Antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice requesting certain information related to VeriSign's potential operation of the .web TLD. The CID is not directed at VeriSign's existing registry agreements. As we said at the time of the auction last July, we strongly believe VeriSign is well positioned to grow and widely distribute .web to provide an additional option to the marketplace given our proven track record of reliability and stability, and we look forward to explaining our views as we respond to the CID and continue to cooperate with the DOJ.
Second, we continually evaluate the strategic opportunities for our business. And as you may have seen earlier today, we have decided it is in the best interest to sell our iDefense business to Accenture. As part of this sale, VeriSign will continue as an iDefense customer to benefit from the threat intelligence information provided by iDefense. The announcement of the iDefense sale only relates to iDefense and is not a sale of our other VeriSign security services offerings, including DDoS Protection and Managed DNS. The terms of this transaction are not being disclosed, and the financials associated with this business are not material to our overall business. We anticipate closing in the next few months, subject to customary closing conditions.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."
36216,414981540,1128675,"VeriSign, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2017",2017-02-09,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the company generated revenue of $1,142,000,000, up 7.8% from fiscal 2015 and delivered GAAP operating income of $687 million, up 13% from $606 million for the full year 2015",710,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the company generated revenue of $1,142,000,000, up 7.8% from fiscal 2015 and delivered GAAP operating income of $687 million, up 13% from $606 million for the full year 2015.
Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $286 million, up 5% year-over-year and down 0.4% sequentially. The small sequential decline was a result of the 1.9 million reduction in the domain name base during the quarter that Jim discussed earlier.
During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from international customers. GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter totaled $169 million, up 6.6% from $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 59% compared to 58.1% in the same quarter a year ago.
GAAP net income totaled $106 million compared to $102 million a year, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.84 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.76 for the fourth quarter last year.
As of December 31, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $368 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $14 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $103 million as compared to $100 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was primarily a result of increased marketing expenses deployed in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 63.9% compared to 62.4% in the same quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $115 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 125.5 million shares. This compares to $0.79 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $0.93 last quarter based on 133.4 million and 127.8 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 20.6 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 21.4 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 20.8 million shares last quarter.  The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 2 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow was $195 million and free cash flow was $198 million for the fourth quarter compared with $189 million and $176 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year.
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, the financial guidance that I would provide reflects the expected completion of the iDefense asset sales within the next few months. Revenue for 2017 is expected to be in the range of $1,138,000,000 to $1,158,000,000. Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 64% and 65%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $93 million and $100 million.
Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. And finally, cash taxes for the year are expected to be between $15 million and $25 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2017 are international, primarily because of domestic tax attributes including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. These convertible debentures continue to generate cash tax benefits while they remain outstanding and they are an important part of our capital structure. Although we will have the right to redeem these debentures under the terms of the indentures starting in August of 2017, our intention based on current conditions is not to redeem these debentures, which will allow the cash tax benefits to continue to accrue.
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2016. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

We were up 7.8%, I'm sorry, '16 we were up 7.8% in '16 versus 4.9% in 2015. And as we talk about from a lot of that, revenue growth was, from a unique event, which was attributed to the strong China investment community. And as we've mentioned, about 1/3 of those names renewed in the fourth quarter. So we do have some names as I just mentioned coming up in the first quarter that should, it had the same renewal rate, will delete out of the zone sometime in the late first quarter, early second quarter. And so that's part of what's influencing it. Also to a lesser extent, you're correct, the iDefense business, we expect that revenue to get out of the business as we close this transaction. And so without disclosing any ideals on the iDefense business, which we're not, I would say it's really those 2 factors that are giving our view of revenue today. And as always, we'll update our guidance each quarter as we get more visibility into the year."

We've certainly said consistently that we're certainly better suited to be a consumer rather than a producer of threat intelligence. Our primary business is obviously the secure and stable operation of infrastructure supporting .com and .net. That's our primary mission, that's the most important thing that we do. We obviously need good cyber defenses in order to that, but we will continue to be an iDefense customer and receive it. But it's a little different than the other security services. And as I mentioned in my remarks, this is specifically iDefense, it's not our managed DNS business and it's not our DDoS protection businesses.

I'm pleased report another solid quarter, which capped another solid year for VeriSign. The year marks some significant milestones for the Internet community and for VeriSign with the completion of the IANA transition, our signing of the Root Zone Maintainer service agreement with ICANN and the .com registry agreement extension amendment, which extends the .com registry agreement until the end of November 2024.
Our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
During 2016, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1,142,000,000 in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $666 million and producing full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margins of 64.5%. Operationally, 2016 was a solid year for the company. VeriSign processed 35.8 million new .com and .net domain name registrations and finished the year with 142.2 million .com and .net names in the domain name base.
During the year, we marked more than 19 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net.
As part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2 million shares for $160 million. During the full year 2016, we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $637 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $641 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the year. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .nets was 142.2 million, consisting of 126.9 million names for .com and 15.3 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 1.7% year-over-year. As noted in prior conference calls, the fourth quarter of 2016 was somewhat unique as the volume of domain name registrations up for renewal in the quarter had a larger-than-normal percentage of first-time renewing registrations due to the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 2015 coming from China investors.
As first-time renewing names have a lower renewal rate than previously renewed names, fourth quarter 2016 deletes were elevated and resulted in the domain name base decrease of 1.9 million net names after processing 8.8 million new gross registrations during the quarter. This larger percentage of first-time renewing names also leading to an overall -- is also leading to an overall preliminary fourth quarter 2016 renewal rate of 67.5%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2015.
In the third quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 73% compared with 71.9% for the same quarter of 2015. While activity from China has normalized over the last few quarters, the China names surge of late 2015 declined but did carry over into the first quarter of 2016. As a result, we expect the small group of names to contribute to a slight increase in deletes towards the end of the current Q1 and the beginning of Q2.
Based on these and other factors, we expect full year 2017 domain name base growth of between 0.5% and 2.5% with an increase to the domain name base of between 0.7 million and 1.2 million registrations in the first quarter.
Now I'd like to provide 2 updates before handing the call over to George. First, as it relates to our becoming a registry operator for .web, on January 18, 2017, the company received a civil investigative demand from the Antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice requesting certain information related to VeriSign's potential operation of the .web TLD. The CID is not directed at VeriSign's existing registry agreements. As we said at the time of the auction last July, we strongly believe VeriSign is well positioned to grow and widely distribute .web to provide an additional option to the marketplace given our proven track record of reliability and stability, and we look forward to explaining our views as we respond to the CID and continue to cooperate with the DOJ.
Second, we continually evaluate the strategic opportunities for our business. And as you may have seen earlier today, we have decided it is in the best interest to sell our iDefense business to Accenture. As part of this sale, VeriSign will continue as an iDefense customer to benefit from the threat intelligence information provided by iDefense. The announcement of the iDefense sale only relates to iDefense and is not a sale of our other VeriSign security services offerings, including DDoS Protection and Managed DNS. The terms of this transaction are not being disclosed, and the financials associated with this business are not material to our overall business. We anticipate closing in the next few months, subject to customary closing conditions.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the company generated revenue of $1,142,000,000, up 7.8% from fiscal 2015 and delivered GAAP operating income of $687 million, up 13% from $606 million for the full year 2015",710,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the company generated revenue of $1,142,000,000, up 7.8% from fiscal 2015 and delivered GAAP operating income of $687 million, up 13% from $606 million for the full year 2015.
Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $286 million, up 5% year-over-year and down 0.4% sequentially. The small sequential decline was a result of the 1.9 million reduction in the domain name base during the quarter that Jim discussed earlier.
During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from international customers. GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter totaled $169 million, up 6.6% from $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 59% compared to 58.1% in the same quarter a year ago.
GAAP net income totaled $106 million compared to $102 million a year, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.84 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.76 for the fourth quarter last year.
As of December 31, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $368 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $14 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $103 million as compared to $100 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was primarily a result of increased marketing expenses deployed in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 63.9% compared to 62.4% in the same quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $115 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 125.5 million shares. This compares to $0.79 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $0.93 last quarter based on 133.4 million and 127.8 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 20.6 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 21.4 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 20.8 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 2 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow was $195 million and free cash flow was $198 million for the fourth quarter compared with $189 million and $176 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year.
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, the financial guidance that I will provide reflects the expected completion of the iDefense asset sale within the next few months. Revenue for 2017 is expected to be in the range of $1,138,000,000 to $1,158,000,000. Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 64% and 65%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $93 million and $100 million. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. And finally, cash taxes for the year are expected to be between $15 million and $25 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2017 are international, primarily because of domestic tax attributes including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. These convertible debentures continue to generate cash tax benefits while they remain outstanding, and they are an important part of our capital structure. Although we will have the right to redeem these debentures under the terms of the indentures starting in August of 2017, our intention based on current conditions is not to redeem these debentures, which will allow the cash tax benefits to continue to accrue.
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2016.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

We were up 7.8% -- I'm sorry, '16, we were up 7.8% in '16 versus 4.9% in 2015. And as we've talked about, a lot of that revenue growth was from a unique event, which was attributed to the strong China investor community. And as we've mentioned, about 1/3 of those names renewed in the fourth quarter. So we do have some names, as I just mentioned, coming up in the first quarter that should -- if it had the same renewal rate will delete out of the zone sometime in the late first quarter, early second quarter. And so that's part of what's influencing it. Also to a lesser extent, you're correct, the iDefense business, we expect that revenue to get out of the business as we close this transaction.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which capped another solid year for VeriSign. The year marks some significant milestones for the Internet community and for VeriSign with the completion of the IANA",857,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which capped another solid year for VeriSign. The year marks some significant milestones for the Internet community and for VeriSign with the completion of the IANA transition, our signing of the Root Zone Maintainer service agreement with ICANN and the .com registry agreement extension amendment, which extends the .com registry agreement until the end of November 2024.
Our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
During 2016, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1,142,000,000 in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $666 million and producing full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margins of 64.5%. Operationally, 2016 was a solid year for the company. VeriSign processed 35.8 million new .com and .net domain name registrations and finished the year with 142.2 million .com and .net names in the domain name base.
During the year, we marked more than 19 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net.
As part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2 million shares for $160 million. During the full year 2016, we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $637 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $641 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the year. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net was 142.2 million, consisting of 126.9 million names for .com and 15.3 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 1.7% year-over-year. As noted in prior conference calls, the fourth quarter of 2016 was somewhat unique as the volume of domain name registrations up for renewal in the quarter had a larger-than-normal percentage of first-time renewing registrations due to the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 2015 coming from China investors.
As first-time renewing names have a lower renewal rate than previously renewed names, fourth quarter 2016 deletes were elevated and resulted in the domain name base decrease of 1.9 million net names after processing 8.8 million new gross registrations during the quarter. This larger percentage of first-time renewing names also leading to an overall -- is also leading to an overall preliminary fourth quarter 2016 renewal rate of 67.5%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2015.
In the third quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 73% compared with 71.9% for the same quarter of 2015. While activity from China has normalized over the last few quarters, the China names surge of late 2015 declined but did carry over into the first quarter of 2016. As a result, we expect the small group of names to contribute to a slight increase in deletes towards the end of the current Q1 and the beginning of Q2.
Based on these and other factors, we expect full year 2017 domain name base growth of between 0.5% and 2.5%, with an increase to the domain name base of between 0.7 million and 1.2 million registrations in the first quarter.
Now I'd like to provide 2 updates before handing the call over to George. First, as it relates to our becoming a registry operator for .web, on January 18, 2017, the company received a civil investigative demand from the Antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice requesting certain information related to VeriSign's potential operation of the .web TLD. The CID is not directed at VeriSign's existing registry agreements. As we said at the time of the auction last July, we strongly believe VeriSign is well positioned to grow and widely distribute .web to provide an additional option to the marketplace given our proven track record of reliability and stability, and we look forward to explaining our views as we respond to the CID and continue to cooperate with the DOJ.
Second, we continually evaluate the strategic opportunities for our business. And as you may have seen earlier today, we have decided it is in the best interest to sell our iDefense business to Accenture. As part of this sale, VeriSign will continue as an iDefense customer to benefit from the threat intelligence information provided by iDefense. The announcement of the iDefense sale only relates to iDefense and is not a sale of our other VeriSign security services offerings, including DDoS Protection and Managed DNS. The terms of this transaction are not being disclosed, and the financials associated with this business are not material to our overall business. We anticipate closing in the next few months, subject to customary closing conditions.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the company generated revenue of $1,142,000,000, up 7.8% from fiscal 2015 and delivered GAAP operating income of $687 million, up 13% from $606 million for the full year 2015.
Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $286 million, up 5% year-over-year and down 0.4% sequentially. The small sequential decline was a result of the 1.9 million reduction in the domain name base during the quarter that Jim discussed earlier. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from international customers. 
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter totaled $169 million, up 6.6% from $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 59% compared to 58.1% in the same quarter a year ago.
GAAP net income totaled $106 million compared to $102 million a year, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.84 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.76 for the fourth quarter last year.
As of December 31, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $368 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $14 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $103 million as compared to $100 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was primarily a result of increased marketing expenses deployed in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 63.9% compared to 62.4% in the same quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $115 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 125.5 million shares. This compares to $0.79 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $0.93 last quarter based on 133.4 million and 127.8 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 20.6 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 21.4 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 20.8 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 2 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow was $195 million and free cash flow was $198 million for the fourth quarter compared with $189 million and $176 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year.
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, the financial guidance that I will provide reflects the expected completion of the iDefense asset sale within the next few months. Revenue for 2017 is expected to be in the range of $1,138,000,000 to $1,158,000,000. Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 64% and 65%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $93 million and $100 million. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. And finally, cash taxes for the year are expected to be between $15 million and $25 million. 
Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2017 are international, primarily because of domestic tax attributes including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. These convertible debentures continue to generate cash tax benefits while they remain outstanding, and they are an important part of our capital structure. Although we will have the right to redeem these debentures under the terms of the indentures starting in August of 2017, our intention, based on current conditions, is not to redeem these debentures, which will allow the cash tax benefits to continue to accrue.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2016.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

And as we've talked about, a lot of that revenue growth was from a unique event, which was attributed to the strong China investor community. And as we've mentioned, about 1/3 of those names renewed in the fourth quarter. So we do have some names, as I just mentioned, coming up in the first quarter that should -- if they had the same renewal rate, will delete out of the zone sometime in the late first quarter, early second quarter. And so that's part of what's influencing it. Also, to a lesser extent, you're correct; the iDefense business, we expect that revenue to get out of the business as we close this transaction. And so without disclosing any details on the iDefense business, which we're not, I would say it's really those 2 factors that are giving our view of revenue today. And as always, we'll update our guidance each quarter as we get more visibility into the year."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which capped another solid year for VeriSign.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which capped another solid year for VeriSign. The year marks some significant milestones for the Internet community and for VeriSign with the completion of the IANA transition, our signing of the Root Zone Maintainer service agreement with ICANN and the .com registry agreement extension amendment, which extends the .com registry agreement until the end of November 2024.
Our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.
During 2016, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1,142,000,000 in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $666 million and producing full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margins of 64.5%. Operationally, 2016 was a solid year for the company. VeriSign processed 35.8 million new .com and .net domain name registrations and finished the year with 142.2 million .com and .net names in the domain name base.
During the year, we marked more than 19 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net.
As part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2 million shares for $160 million. During the full year 2016, we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $637 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $641 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.
Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the year. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net was 142.2 million, consisting of 126.9 million names for .com and 15.3 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 1.7% year-over-year. As noted in prior conference calls, the fourth quarter of 2016 was somewhat unique as the volume of domain name registrations up for renewal in the quarter had a larger-than-normal percentage of first-time renewing registrations due to the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 2015 coming from China investors.
As first-time renewing names have a lower renewal rate than previously renewed names, fourth quarter 2016 deletes were elevated and resulted in the domain name base decrease of 1.9 million net names after processing 8.8 million new gross registrations during the quarter. This larger percentage of first-time renewing names also leading to an overall -- is also leading to an overall preliminary fourth quarter 2016 renewal rate of 67.5%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2015.
In the third quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 73% compared with 71.9% for the same quarter of 2015. While activity from China has normalized over the last few quarters, the China names surge of late 2015 declined but did carry over into the first quarter of 2016. As a result, we expect the small group of names to contribute to a slight increase in deletes towards the end of the current Q1 and the beginning of Q2.
Based on these and other factors, we expect full year 2017 domain name base growth of between 0.5% and 2.5%, with an increase to the domain name base of between 0.7 million and 1.2 million registrations in the first quarter.
Now I'd like to provide 2 updates before handing the call over to George. First, as it relates to our becoming a registry operator for .web, on January 18, 2017, the company received a civil investigative demand from the Antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice requesting certain information related to VeriSign's potential operation of the .web TLD. The CID is not directed at VeriSign's existing registry agreements. As we said at the time of the auction last July, we strongly believe VeriSign is well positioned to grow and widely distribute .web to provide an additional option to the marketplace given our proven track record of reliability and stability, and we look forward to explaining our views as we respond to the CID and continue to cooperate with the DOJ.
Second, we continually evaluate the strategic opportunities for our business. And as you may have seen earlier today, we have decided it is in the best interest to sell our iDefense business to Accenture. As part of this sale, VeriSign will continue as an iDefense customer to benefit from the threat intelligence information provided by iDefense. The announcement of the iDefense sale only relates to iDefense and is not a sale of our other VeriSign security services offerings, including DDoS Protection and Managed DNS. The terms of this transaction are not being disclosed, and the financials associated with this business are not material to our overall business. We anticipate closing in the next few months, subject to customary closing conditions.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."
36216,414981540,1130026,"VeriSign, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2017",2017-02-09,"Earnings Calls","VeriSign, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the company generated revenue of $1,142,000,000, up 7.8% from fiscal 2015 and delivered GAAP operating income of $687 million, up 13% from $606 million for the full year 2015",710,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the company generated revenue of $1,142,000,000, up 7.8% from fiscal 2015 and delivered GAAP operating income of $687 million, up 13% from $606 million for the full year 2015.
Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $286 million, up 5% year-over-year and down 0.4% sequentially. The small sequential decline was a result of the 1.9 million reduction in the domain name base during the quarter that Jim discussed earlier. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from international customers. 
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter totaled $169 million, up 6.6% from $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 59% compared to 58.1% in the same quarter a year ago.
GAAP net income totaled $106 million compared to $102 million a year, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.84 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.76 for the fourth quarter last year.
As of December 31, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $368 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.
I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $14 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $103 million as compared to $100 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was primarily a result of increased marketing expenses deployed in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 63.9% compared to 62.4% in the same quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $115 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 125.5 million shares. This compares to $0.79 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $0.93 last quarter based on 133.4 million and 127.8 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 20.6 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 21.4 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 20.8 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 2 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow was $195 million and free cash flow was $198 million for the fourth quarter compared with $189 million and $176 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year.
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, the financial guidance that I will provide reflects the expected completion of the iDefense asset sale within the next few months. Revenue for 2017 is expected to be in the range of $1,138,000,000 to $1,158,000,000. Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 64% and 65%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $93 million and $100 million. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. And finally, cash taxes for the year are expected to be between $15 million and $25 million. 
Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2017 are international, primarily because of domestic tax attributes including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. These convertible debentures continue to generate cash tax benefits while they remain outstanding, and they are an important part of our capital structure. Although we will have the right to redeem these debentures under the terms of the indentures starting in August of 2017, our intention, based on current conditions, is not to redeem these debentures, which will allow the cash tax benefits to continue to accrue.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2016.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

We were up 7.8% -- I'm sorry, '16, we were up 7.8% in 2016 versus 4.9% in 2015. And as we've talked about, a lot of that revenue growth was from a unique event, which was attributed to the strong China investor community. And as we've mentioned, about 1/3 of those names renewed in the fourth quarter. So we do have some names, as I just mentioned, coming up in the first quarter that should -- if they had the same renewal rate, will delete out of the zone sometime in the late first quarter, early second quarter. And so that's part of what's influencing it. Also, to a lesser extent, you're correct; the iDefense business, we expect that revenue to get out of the business as we close this transaction. And so without disclosing any details on the iDefense business, which we're not, I would say it's really those 2 factors that are giving our view of revenue today. And as always, we'll update our guidance each quarter as we get more visibility into the year."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We reported revenue of $289 million, up 2.4% year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $0.96, up 12% year-over-year and $139 million in free cash flow. As part of managing our business during the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of March, the domain name base of .com and .net was $143.6 million, consisting of 128.4 million names for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 1.4 million net names during the first quarter after processing 9.5 million new gross registrations. The U.S. market contributed to the better-than-expected performance. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days effort than of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2017 will be approximately 72.2%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2016. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the final renewal rate was 67.6% compared with 73.3% for the same quarter of 2015. As noted in our prior conference calls, the portion of registration is associated with the China name surge that occurred in the first quarter of 2016 continued to renewed at lower than historic first time renewal rates in the first and second quarter of 2017 and are contributing to slightly higher deletions in the first half of 2017. 
In addition, Q2 tends to have slightly lower seasonal new gross registrations than Q1. Based on these and other factors, we now expect full year 2017 domain name base growth of between 1% and 2.5% with a change of the domain name base for the second quarter of 2017 of flat to an increase of 0.4 million net registrations. As many of you are aware, we are in the process of reviewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN as the current terms ends on June 30. On April 20, ICANN posted the new .com registry agreement for public comment, which is open until May 30th. 
From our perspective, the posted agreement does not contain changes to the material terms such as the fees paid to ICANN, the renewal rights or the six-year term. We believe we're on track for renewal prior to the expiration of the current term agreement. 
Finally, as discussed during our prior earnings call, we decided it was in the best interest of the company to sell our iDefense business. The iDefense sale was completed at the start of the second quarter and VeriSign continues as a customer to benefit from the threat intelligence information by iDefense. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the first quarter totals to $289 million, up 2.4% year-over-year and up 0.8% sequentially. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the United States and 40% was from foreign customers. As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the first quarter totaled $175 million, up 5.1% from $167 million in the first quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 60.7% compared to 59.2% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $116 million compared to $107 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.94 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.82 for the first quarter last year. As of March 31, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $316 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance. 
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million as compared to $103 million in both the fourth quarter of 2016 and in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily a result of lower marketing spend in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 65.1% compared to 63.3% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.5 million shares. This compares to $0.85 in the first quarter of 2016 and $0.92 last quarter based on 131.6 million and 125.5 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
For the past 2 years, we have used a tax rate of 26% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.25 -- 25%. As a result, we will begin to use a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting second quarter 2017 non-GAAP results. 
Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $148 million and free cash flow was $139 million compared with $150 million and $143 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.3 million shares based on the average share price during the first quarter compared with 21.1 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 20.6 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect on fourth quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter. 
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1,145,000,000 to $1,116,ooo,000, increase and narrowed from the $1,138,000,000 range provided on our prior earnings call. Full-year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 64.5% and 65.25%, increased and narrowed from the 64% to 65% range as provided on our last call. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $93 million and $100 million. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. And cash taxes for the year are now expected to be between $20 million to $30 million, change from the $15 million to $25 million range provided on our last call. 
As previously mentioned, the majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. As we said last quarter, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure and our intention based on current conditions is to not redeem these debentures as they become renewable in August of this year, which will allow these cash tax benefits to continue to accrue.  The financial guidance provided reflects the completion of our iDefense asset sales on April 1, 2017. 
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2017. 
Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We reported revenue of $289 million, up 2.4% year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $0.96, up 12% year-over-year and $139 million in free cash flow. As part of managing our business during the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net was 143.6 million, consisting of 128.4 million names for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 1.4 million net names during the first quarter after processing 9.5 million new gross registrations. The U.S. market contributed to the better-than-expected performance. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2017 will be approximately 72.2%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2016. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the final renewal rate was 67.6% compared with 73.3% for the same quarter of 2015. As noted in our prior conference calls, the portion of registration is associated with the China names surge that occurred in the first quarter of 2016 continued to renew at lower than historic first-time renewal rates in the first and second quarter of 2017 and are contributing to slightly higher deletions in the first half of 2017. 
In addition, Q2 tends to have slightly lower seasonal new gross registrations than Q1. Based on these and other factors, we now expect full year 2017 domain name base growth of between 1% and 2.5% with a change of the domain name base for the second quarter of 2017 of flat to an increase of 0.4 million net registrations. As many of you are aware, we are in the process of reviewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN as the current term expands on -- sorry, ends on June 30. On April 20, ICANN posted the new .net registry agreement for public comment, which is open until May 30th. 
From our perspective, the posted agreement does not contain changes to the material terms, such as the fees paid to ICANN, the renewal rights or the six-year term. We believe we're on track for renewal prior to the expiration of the current term agreement. 
Finally, as discussed during our prior earnings call, we decided it was in the best interest of the company to sell our iDefense business. The iDefense sale was completed at the start of the second quarter and VeriSign continues as a customer to benefit from the threat intelligence information provided by iDefense. 
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the first quarter totaled $289 million, up 2.4% year-over-year and up 0.8% sequentially. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the United States and 40% was from foreign customers. 
As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the first quarter totaled $175 million, up 5.1% from $167 million in the first quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 60.7% compared to 59.2% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $116 million compared to $107 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.94 in the first quarter of this year compared to $0.82 for the first quarter last year. 
As of March 31, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $316 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance. 
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million as compared to $103 million in both the fourth quarter of 2016 and in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily a result of lower marketing spend in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 65.1% compared to 63.3% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.5 million shares. This compares to $0.85 in the first quarter of 2016 and $0.92 last quarter based on 131.6 million and 125.5 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
For the past 2 years, we have used a tax rate of 26% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.25 -- 25%. As a result, we will begin to use a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting second quarter 2017 non-GAAP results. 
Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $148 million and free cash flow was $139 million compared with $150 million and $143 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.3 million shares based on the average share price during the first quarter compared with 21.1 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 20.6 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter. 
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1,145,000,000 to $1,160,000,000, increased and narrowed from the $1,138,000,000 to $1,158,000,000 range provided on our prior earnings call. Full-year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 64.5% and 65.25%, increased and narrowed from the 64% to 65% range as provided on our last call. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $93 million and $100 million. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. And cash taxes for the year are now expected to be between $20 million to $30 million, changed from the $15 million to $25 million range provided on our last call. 
As previously mentioned, the majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. As we said last quarter, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure and our intention based on current conditions is to not redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow these cash tax benefits to continue to accrue. The financial guidance provided reflects the completion of our iDefense asset sale on April 1, 2017. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2017. 
Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We reported revenue of $289 million, up 2.4% year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $0.96, up 12% year-over-year, and $139 million in free cash flow. As part of managing our business during the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net was 143.6 million, consisting of 128.4 million names for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 1.4 million net names during the first quarter after processing 9.5 million new gross registrations. The U.S. market contributed to the better-than-expected performance. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2017 will be approximately 72.2%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2016. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the final renewal rate was 67.6% compared with 73.3% for the same quarter of 2015. As noted in our prior conference calls, the portion of registrations associated with the China names surge that occurred in the first quarter of 2016 continued to renew at lower-than-historic first-time renewal rates in the first and second quarter of 2017 and are contributing to slightly higher deletions in the first half of 2017. 
In addition, Q2 tends to have slightly lower seasonal new gross registrations than Q1. Based on these and other factors, we now expect full year 2017 domain name base growth of between 1% and 2.5%, with a change of the domain name base for the second quarter of 2017 of flat to an increase of 0.4 million net registrations. As many of you are aware, we are in the process of reviewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN as the current term expands on -- sorry, ends on June 30. On April 20, ICANN posted the new .net registry agreement for public comment, which is open until May 30th. 
From our perspective, the posted agreement does not contain changes to the material terms, such as the fees paid to ICANN, the renewal rights or the 6-year term. We believe we're on track for renewal prior to the expiration of the current term agreement. 
Finally, as discussed during our prior earnings call, we decided it was in the best interest of the company to sell our iDefense business. The iDefense sale was completed at the start of the second quarter and VeriSign continues as a customer to benefit from the threat intelligence information provided by iDefense. 
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the first quarter totaled $289 million, up 2.4% year-over-year and up 0.8% sequentially. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the United States and 40% was from foreign customers. 
As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the first quarter totaled $175 million, up 5.1% from $167 million in the first quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 60.7% compared to 59.2% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $116 million compared to $107 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.94 in the first quarter of this year compared to $0.82 for the first quarter last year. 
As of March 31, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $316 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance. 
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million as compared to $103 million in both the fourth quarter of 2016 and in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily a result of lower marketing spend in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 65.1% compared to 63.3% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.5 million shares. This compares to $0.85 in the first quarter of 2016 and $0.92 last quarter based on 131.6 million and 125.5 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
For the past 2 years, we have used a tax rate of 26% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.25 -- 25%. As a result, we will begin to use a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting second quarter 2017 non-GAAP results. 
Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $148 million and free cash flow was $139 million compared with $150 million and $143 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.3 million shares based on the average share price during the first quarter compared with 21.1 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 20.6 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter. 
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1,145,000,000 to $1,160,000,000, increased and narrowed from the $1,138,000,000 to $1,158,000,000 range provided on our prior earnings call. Full-year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 64.5% and 65.25%, increased and narrowed from the 64% to 65% range as provided on our last call. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $93 million and $100 million. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. And cash taxes for the year are now expected to be between $20 million to $30 million, changed from the $15 million to $25 million range provided on our last call. 
As previously mentioned, the majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. As we said last quarter, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure and our intention based on current conditions is to not redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow these cash tax benefits to continue to accrue. The financial guidance provided reflects the completion of our iDefense asset sale on April 1, 2017. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2017. 
Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We reported revenue of $289 million, up 2.4% year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $0.96, up 12% year-over-year, and $139 million in free cash flow. As part of managing our business during the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net was 143.6 million, consisting of 128.4 million names for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 1.4 million net names during the first quarter after processing 9.5 million new gross registrations. The U.S. market contributed to the better-than-expected performance. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2017 will be approximately 72.2%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2016. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the final renewal rate was 67.6% compared with 73.3% for the same quarter of 2015. As noted in our prior conference calls, the portion of registrations associated with the China names surge that occurred in the first quarter of 2016 continued to renew at lower-than-historic first-time renewal rates in the first and second quarter of 2017 and are contributing to slightly higher deletions in the first half of 2017. 
In addition, Q2 tends to have slightly lower seasonal new gross registrations than Q1. Based on these and other factors, we now expect full year 2017 domain name base growth of between 1% and 2.5%, with a change of the domain name base for the second quarter of 2017 of flat to an increase of 0.4 million net registrations. As many of you are aware, we are in the process of reviewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN as the current term expands on -- sorry, ends on June 30. On April 20, ICANN posted the new .net registry agreement for public comment, which is open until May 30th. 
From our perspective, the posted agreement does not contain changes to the material terms, such as the fees paid to ICANN, the renewal rights or the 6-year term. We believe we're on track for renewal prior to the expiration of the current term agreement. 
Finally, as discussed during our prior earnings call, we decided it was in the best interest of the company to sell our iDefense business. The iDefense sale was completed at the start of the second quarter and VeriSign continues as a customer to benefit from the threat intelligence information provided by iDefense. 
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the first quarter totaled $289 million, up 2.4% year-over-year and up 0.8% sequentially. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the United States and 40% was from foreign customers. 
As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the first quarter totaled $175 million, up 5.1% from $167 million in the first quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 60.7% compared to 59.2% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $116 million compared to $107 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.94 in the first quarter of this year compared to $0.82 for the first quarter last year. 
As of March 31, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $316 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance. 
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million as compared to $103 million in both the fourth quarter of 2016 and in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily a result of lower marketing spend in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 65.1% compared to 63.3% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.5 million shares. This compares to $0.85 in the first quarter of 2016 and $0.92 last quarter based on 131.6 million and 125.5 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
For the past 2 years, we have used a tax rate of 26% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.25 -- 25%. As a result, we will begin to use a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting second quarter 2017 non-GAAP results. 
Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $148 million and free cash flow was $139 million compared with $150 million and $143 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.3 million shares based on the average share price during the first quarter compared with 21.1 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 20.6 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter. 
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1,145,000,000 to $1,160,000,000, increased and narrowed from the $1,138,000,000 to $1,158,000,000 range provided on our prior earnings call. Full-year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 64.5% and 65.25%, increased and narrowed from the 64% to 65% range as provided on our last call. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $93 million and $100 million. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. And cash taxes for the year are now expected to be between $20 million to $30 million, changed from the $15 million to $25 million range provided on our last call. 
As previously mentioned, the majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. As we said last quarter, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure and our intention based on current conditions is to not redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow these cash tax benefits to continue to accrue. The financial guidance provided reflects the completion of our iDefense asset sale on April 1, 2017. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2017. 
Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We reported revenue of $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.05 and $171 million in free cash flow. During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $150.5 million. Our financial position is strong, with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was $144.3 million, consisting of 129.2 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 0.68 million net names during the second quarter after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2017 will be 73.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2016. 
We are updating the full year 2017 domain name base growth guidance to be between 2% and 2.75%. Also, we expect the domain name base to increase during the third quarter between 0.8 million to 1.3 million registrations. 
I'll comment now on a few recent events. In June, the .net registry agreement between VeriSign and ICANN was successfully renewed. The new agreement does not contain changes to the material terms such as pricing terms, renewal rights, the 6-year term or fees paid to ICANN. Also in June, we issued $550 million of senior unsecured notes with a 4.75% coupon maturing in 10 years. This offering closed in early July and we're pleased with the result of this issuance. Lastly, today, we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for the .net domain name registration as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2018, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $8.20 to $9.02. We believe this positions .net competitively in the marketplace while keeping .net price lower than other popular legacy TLDs. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the second quarter totaled $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers.

During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers. As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the second quarter totaled $175 million compared with $176 million in the second quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 60.6% compared to 61.5% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $123 million compared to $113 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.99 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.87 for the second quarter last year. The second quarter include a pretax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.09. As Jim mentioned earlier, the company continues to manage its capital structure. Earlier this month, we took advantage of what we felt were favorable market conditions and added another long-term fixed rate piece of debt into our capital structure. The 10-year note issuance, which totaled $550 million, is scheduled to mature on July 15, 2027, and carried an interest rate of 4.75%. As this offering close in early July, our second quarter ending balance sheet does not reflect the net proceeds from this issuance. As of June 30, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $269 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance. 
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million as compared to $99 million in the same quarter a year ago and $101 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.3% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was [ $130 ] million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.05 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124 million shares. This compares to $0.91 in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.96 last quarter based on 130.6 million and 124.5 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Results for the second quarter included pretax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.06. As noted in our last earnings call, beginning with the second quarter financials, we are now using a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting non-GAAP results. 
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $181 million and free cash flow was $171 million compared with 161 -- $167 million and $161 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 22.5 million shares based on average share price during the second quarter compared with 21.9 million for the same quarter of 2016 and 21.3 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter. 
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1,155,000,000 to $1,165,000,000 increased and narrowed from the $1,145,000,000 to $1,160,000,000 range provided on our prior earnings call. Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 64.5% to 65.25%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $103 million and $110 million as compared with the $93 million to $100 million range provided on our last call, reflecting the additional senior note interest expense from the recent issuance. 
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, changed from the $35 million to $45 million range provided on our last call. And cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $20 million and $30 million. The majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. As we said in prior calls, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure and our intention based on current conditions is not to redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow the tax benefits to continue to accrue. 
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2017. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

In closing, during the second quarter, we continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus providing long-term value to our shareholders.

In addition to renewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN for another 6 years, earlier this month, the company surpassed 20 continuous years of 100% availability in the .com and .net DNS. This record is the result of the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure.

Certainly, some activity I would point to in terms of international market. There is general strong growth in the international market. But as George pointed out, some growth in the U.S. market in the first quarter continued into the second market as well.

We continue to manage all the lines of expenses throughout the business pretty much on a quarterly and monthly basis.

But I think if you continue to call those out, any expense you could almost view is nonrecurring. As I said, in the quarter, we did purchase some additional software licenses in the quarter and we did have some higher legal costs in the quarter. But we will have, from time to time, the need to purchase additional software licenses in the business and we'll have the need to spend additional money from a legal perspective for the company. And so again, I'd look back at the big picture on a non-GAAP basis, total expense was a little over $100 million, $100.7 million. And compared to last quarter, which was a similar amount and year-over-year, I believe, it was $99 million a year ago quarter versus $100 million there. We did have a little bit higher stock-based compensation in the quarter on a GAAP basis and that's really a function of 2 areas. One, since last year, we have put on some additional senior management to the company, in particular, [indiscernible] SVP of Product. And then we also, as a senior management team, do have some longer term incentive programs and as we continue to execute on our plan and deliver on the results over and above some of the goals that were set, we do have some accelerated accrue there as we continue to execute. So we'll continue to try to do that. But again, from a GAAP perspective, we have a little bit more stock-based compensation. And as I said, we had a few other [indiscernible] in the quarter.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We reported revenue of $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.05 and $171 million in free cash flow. During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $150.5 million. Our financial position is strong, with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was $144.3 million, consisting of 129.2 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 0.68 million net names during the second quarter after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2017 will be 73.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2016. 
We are updating the full year 2017 domain name base growth guidance to be between 2% and 2.75%. Also, we expect the domain name base to increase during the third quarter between 0.8 million to 1.3 million registrations. 
I'll comment now on a few recent events. In June, the .net registry agreement between VeriSign and ICANN was successfully renewed. The new agreement does not contain changes to the material terms such as pricing terms, renewal rights, the 6-year term or fees paid to ICANN. 
Also in June, we issued $550 million of senior unsecured notes with a 4.75% coupon maturing in 10 years. This offering closed in early July, and we're pleased with the result of this issuance. 
Lastly, today, we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2018, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $8.20 to $9.02. We believe this positions .net competitively in the marketplace while keeping .net price lower than other popular legacy TLDs. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the second quarter totaled $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers. As it relates to our GAAP res",820,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers. As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the second quarter totaled $175 million compared with $176 million in the second quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 60.6% compared to 61.5% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $123 million compared to $113 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.99 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.87 for the second quarter last year. The second quarter include a pretax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.09. 
As Jim mentioned earlier, the company continues to manage its capital structure. Earlier this month, we took advantage of what we felt were favorable market conditions and added another long-term fixed rate piece of debt into our capital structure. The 10-year note issuance, which totaled $550 million, is scheduled to mature on July 15, 2027, and carried an interest rate of 4.75%. As this offering closed in early July, our second quarter ending balance sheet does not reflect the net proceeds from this issuance. 
As of June 30, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $269 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance. 
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million as compared to $99 million in the same quarter a year ago and $101 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.3% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $130 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.05 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124 million shares. This compares to $0.91 in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.96 last quarter based on 130.6 million and 124.5 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Results for the second quarter included pretax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.06. As noted in our last earnings call, beginning with the second quarter financials, we are now using a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting non-GAAP results. 
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $181 million and free cash flow was $171 million compared with 161 -- $167 million and $161 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 22.5 million shares based on average share price during the second quarter compared with 21.9 million for the same quarter of 2016 and 21.3 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter. 
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1,155,000,000 to $1,165,000,000 increased and narrowed from the $1,145,000,000 to $1,160,000,000 range provided on our prior earnings call. Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 64.5% to 65.25%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $103 million and $110 million as compared with the $93 million to $100 million range provided on our last call, reflecting the additional senior note interest expense from the recent issuance. 
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, changed from the $35 million to $45 million range provided on our last call. And cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $20 million and $30 million. The majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. 
As we said in prior calls, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure and our intention, based on current conditions, is not to redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow the tax benefits to continue to accrue. 
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2017. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

In closing, during the second quarter, we continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We have marked some significant milestones since our last call. In addition to renewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN for another 6 years, earlier this month, the company surpassed 20 continuous years of 100% availability in the .com and .net DNS. This record is the result of the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. 
We believe our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long-term trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner.

We continue to manage all the lines of expenses throughout the business, pretty much on a quarterly and monthly basis.

But I think if you continue to call those out, any expense you could almost view is nonrecurring. As I said, in the quarter, we did purchase some additional software licenses in the quarter, and we did have some higher legal costs in the quarter. But we will have, from time to time, the need to purchase additional software licenses in the business, and we'll have the need to spend additional money from a legal perspective for the company. And so again, I'd look back at the big picture, on a non-GAAP basis, total expense was a little over $100 million, $100.7 million. And compared to last quarter, which was a similar amount and year-over-year, I believe, it was $99 million a year ago quarter versus $100 million there. We did have a little bit higher stock-based compensation in the quarter on a GAAP basis and that's really a function of 2 areas. One, since last year, we have brought on some additional senior management to the company, in particular, [indiscernible], an SVP of Product. And then we also, as a senior management team, do have some longer term incentive programs and as we continue to execute on our plan and deliver on results over and above some of the goals that were set, we do have some accelerated that are going to accrue there as we continue to execute. So we'll continue to try to do that. But again, from a GAAP perspective, we had a little bit more stock-based compensation. And as I said, we had a few other nits and nat in the quarter.

We reported revenue of $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.05 and $171 million in free cash flow. During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $150.5 million. Our financial position is strong, with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was $144.3 million, consisting of 129.2 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 0.68 million net names during the second quarter after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2017 will be 73.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2016. 
We are updating the full year 2017 domain name base growth guidance to be between 2% and 2.75%. Also, we expect the domain name base to increase during the third quarter between 0.8 million to 1.3 million registrations. 
I'll comment now on a few recent events. In June, the .net registry agreement between VeriSign and ICANN was successfully renewed. The new agreement does not contain changes to the material terms such as pricing terms, renewal rights, the 6-year term or fees paid to ICANN. 
Also in June, we issued $550 million of senior unsecured notes with a 4.75% coupon maturing in 10 years. This offering closed in early July, and we're pleased with the result of this issuance. 
Lastly, today, we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2018, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $8.20 to $9.02. We believe this positions .net competitively in the marketplace while keeping .net price lower than other popular legacy TLDs. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the second quarter totaled $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers. As it relates to our GAAP res",820,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers. As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the second quarter totaled $175 million compared with $176 million in the second quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 60.6% compared to 61.5% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $123 million compared to $113 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.99 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.87 for the second quarter last year. The second quarter include a pretax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.09. 
As Jim mentioned earlier, the company continues to manage its capital structure. Earlier this month, we took advantage of what we felt were favorable market conditions and added another long-term fixed rate piece of debt into our capital structure. The 10-year note issuance, which totaled $550 million, is scheduled to mature on July 15, 2027, and carried an interest rate of 4.75%. As this offering closed in early July, our second quarter ending balance sheet does not reflect the net proceeds from this issuance. 
As of June 30, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $269 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance. 
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million as compared to $99 million in the same quarter a year ago and $101 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.3% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $130 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.05 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124 million shares. This compares to $0.91 in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.96 last quarter based on 130.6 million and 124.5 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Results for the second quarter included pretax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.06. As noted in our last earnings call, beginning with the second quarter financials, we are now using a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting non-GAAP results. 
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $181 million and free cash flow was $171 million compared with 161 -- $167 million and $161 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 22.5 million shares based on average share price during the second quarter compared with 21.9 million for the same quarter of 2016 and 21.3 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter. 
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1,155,000,000 to $1,165,000,000 increased and narrowed from the $1,145,000,000 to $1,160,000,000 range provided on our prior earnings call. Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 64.5% to 65.25%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $103 million and $110 million as compared with the $93 million to $100 million range provided on our last call, reflecting the additional senior note interest expense from the recent issuance. 
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, changed from the $35 million to $45 million range provided on our last call. And cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $20 million and $30 million. The majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. 
As we said in prior calls, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure and our intention, based on current conditions, is not to redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow the tax benefits to continue to accrue. 
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2017. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

In closing, during the second quarter, we continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We have marked some significant milestones since our last call. In addition to renewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN for another 6 years, earlier this month, the company surpassed 20 continuous years of 100% availability in the .com and .net DNS. This record is the result of the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure.

As I said, in the quarter, we did purchase some additional software licenses in the quarter, and we did have some higher legal costs in the quarter. But we will have, from time to time, the need to purchase additional software licenses in the business, and we'll have the need to spend additional money from a legal perspective for the company. And so again, I'd look back at the big picture, on a non-GAAP basis, total expense was a little over $100 million, $100.7 million. And compared to last quarter, which was a similar amount and year-over-year, I believe, it was $99 million a year ago quarter versus $100 million there. We did have a little bit higher stock-based compensation in the quarter on a GAAP basis and that's really a function of 2 areas. One, since last year, we have brought on some additional senior management to the company, in particular, [indiscernible], an SVP of Product. And then we also, as a senior management team, do have some longer-term incentive programs and as we continue to execute on our plan and deliver on results over and above some of the goals that were set, we do have some accelerated that are going to accrue there as we continue to execute. So we'll continue to try to do that. But again, from a GAAP perspective, we had a little bit more stock-based compensation. And as I said, we had a few other nits and nat in the quarter.

Our financial position is strong, with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was $144.3 million, consisting of 129.2 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 0.68 million net names during the second quarter after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2017 will be 73.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2016. 
We are updating the full year 2017 domain name base growth guidance to be between 2% and 2.75%. Also, we expect the domain name base to increase during the third quarter between 0.8 million to 1.3 million registrations. 
I'll comment now on a few recent events. In June, the .net registry agreement between VeriSign and ICANN was successfully renewed. The new agreement does not contain changes to the material terms such as pricing terms, renewal rights, the 6-year term or fees paid to ICANN. 
Also in June, we issued $550 million of senior unsecured notes with a 4.75% coupon maturing in 10 years. This offering closed in early July, and we're pleased with the result of this issuance. 
Lastly, today, we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2018, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $8.20 to $9.02. We believe this positions .net competitively in the marketplace while keeping .net price lower than other popular legacy TLDs. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the second quarter totaled $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers. As it relates to our GAAP res",820,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers. As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the second quarter totaled $175 million compared with $176 million in the second quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 60.6% compared to 61.5% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $123 million compared to $113 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.99 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.87 for the second quarter last year. The second quarter include a pretax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.09. 
As Jim mentioned earlier, the company continues to manage its capital structure. Earlier this month, we took advantage of what we felt were favorable market conditions and added another long-term fixed rate piece of debt into our capital structure. The 10-year note issuance, which totaled $550 million, is scheduled to mature on July 15, 2027, and carried an interest rate of 4.75%. As this offering closed in early July, our second quarter ending balance sheet does not reflect the net proceeds from this issuance. 
As of June 30, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $269 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance. 
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million as compared to $99 million in the same quarter a year ago and $101 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.3% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $130 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.05 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124 million shares. This compares to $0.91 in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.96 last quarter based on 130.6 million and 124.5 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Results for the second quarter included pretax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.06. As noted in our last earnings call, beginning with the second quarter financials, we are now using a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting non-GAAP results. 
Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $181 million and free cash flow was $171 million compared with 161 -- $167 million and $161 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 22.5 million shares based on average share price during the second quarter compared with 21.9 million for the same quarter of 2016 and 21.3 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter. 
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1,155,000,000 to $1,165,000,000 increased and narrowed from the $1,145,000,000 to $1,160,000,000 range provided on our prior earnings call. Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 64.5% to 65.25%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $103 million and $110 million as compared with the $93 million to $100 million range provided on our last call, reflecting the additional senior note interest expense from the recent issuance. 
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, changed from the $35 million to $45 million range provided on our last call. And cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $20 million and $30 million. The majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. 
As we said in prior calls, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure and our intention, based on current conditions, is not to redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow the tax benefits to continue to accrue. 
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2017. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

In closing, during the second quarter, we continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We have marked some significant milestones since our last call. In addition to renewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN for another 6 years, earlier this month, the company surpassed 20 continuous years of 100% availability in the .com and .net DNS. This record is the result of the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure.

As I said, in the quarter, we did purchase some additional software licenses in the quarter, and we did have some higher legal costs in the quarter. But we will have, from time to time, the need to purchase additional software licenses in the business, and we'll have the need to spend additional money from a legal perspective for the company. And so again, I'd look back at the big picture, on a non-GAAP basis, total expense was a little over $100 million, $100.7 million. And compared to last quarter, which was a similar amount and year-over-year, I believe, it was $99 million a year ago quarter versus $100 million there. We did have a little bit higher stock-based compensation in the quarter on a GAAP basis and that's really a function of 2 areas. One, since last year, we have brought on some additional senior management to the company, in particular, [indiscernible], an SVP of Product. And then we also, as a senior management team, do have some longer-term incentive programs and as we continue to execute on our plan and deliver on results over and above some of the goals that were set, we do have some accelerated that are going to accrue there as we continue to execute. So we'll continue to try to do that. But again, from a GAAP perspective, we had a little bit more stock-based compensation. And as I said, we had a few other nits and nat in the quarter.

At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 145.8 million, consisting of 130.8 million names for .com and 15 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 1.47 million net names during the third quarter after processing 8.9 million new gross registrations. 
Gross additions during the quarter benefited from continued strength from U.S.-based registrars. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2017 will be 74.3%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.0% achieved in the third quarter of 2016. We expect an increase to the domain name base during the fourth quarter of between 0.4 million to 0.9 million registrations, which is consistent with the full year 2017 domain name base growth rate of 2.8% to 3.1%. 
And now I would like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the third quarter totaled $292 million, up 1.7% year-over-year and up by 1.3% sequentially. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the United States and 41% was from foreign customers. 
As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the third quarter totaled $181 million compared with $175 million in the third quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 61.9% compared to 60.8% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $115 million compared to $114 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.93 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.90 for the third quarter last year. As of September 30, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which, $757 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full-year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter operating expense, which excludes $14 million in stock-based compensation, totaled $97 million compared to $100 million both last quarter and the same quarter a year ago. While non-GAAP operating expenses were lower in the third quarter, we do expect an increase in sales and marketing spending in the fourth quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 66.7% compared to 65.3% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $124 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.1 million shares. This compares to $0.93 in the third quarter of 2016 and $1.05 last quarter based on 127.7 million and 124.0 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $175 million and free cash flow was $153 million compared with $171 million and $165 million, respectively for the third quarter last year. 
Free cash flow in the third quarter was lower, partially due to the timing of some capital expenditures. Dilution related to convertible debentures was 24 million shares based on the average share price during the third quarter compared with 20.8 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 22.5 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of second quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of a 1.5 million shares repurchased during the third quarter. 
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1,161,000,000 to $1,166,000,000 increased and narrowed from the $1,155,000,000 to $1,165,000,000 range provided on our prior earnings call. 
Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 65% and 65.5% increased and narrowed from the 64.5% to 65.25% range provided on our prior earnings call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be in expense of between $103 million and $110 million. 
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $45 million and $55 million, changed from the $40 million to $50 million range provided on the last call. And cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $20 million and $30 million. 
The majority of the expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. As we said in prior calls, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure and our intention, based on current conditions, is not to redeem these debentures, which will allow the cash tax benefits to continue to accrue. 
In summary, the company continues to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2017. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

We reported revenue of $292 million, up 1.7% year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1 and $153 million in free cash flow. 
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.5 million shares for $147 million.

I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We reported revenue of $292 million, up 1.7% year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1 and $153 million in free cash flow. 
During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.5 million shares for $147 million. Our financial position is strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 145.8 million, consisting of 130.8 million names for .com and 15 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 1.47 million net names during the third quarter after processing 8.9 million new gross registrations. Gross additions during the quarter benefited from continued strength from U.S.-based registrars. 
Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2017 will be 74.3%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.0% achieved in the third quarter of 2016. We expect an increase to the domain name base during the fourth quarter of between 0.4 million to 0.9 million registrations, which is consistent with the full year 2017 domain name base growth rate of 2.8% to 3.1%. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the third quarter totaled $292 million, up 1.7% year-over-year and up by 1.3% sequentially. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the United States and 41% was from foreign customers. 
As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the third quarter totaled $181 million compared with $175 million in the third quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 61.9% compared to 60.8% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Net income totaled $115 million compared to $114 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.93 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.90 for the third quarter last year. 
As of September 30, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which, $757 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance. 
As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter operating expense, which excludes $14 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $97 million compared to $100 million, both last quarter and the same quarter a year ago. While non-GAAP operating expenses were lower in the third quarter, we do expect an increase in sales and marketing spending in the fourth quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 66.7% compared to 65.3% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $124 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.1 million shares. This compares to $0.93 in the third quarter of 2016 and $1.05 last quarter based on 127.7 million and 124.0 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $175 million and free cash flow was $153 million compared with $171 million and $165 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year. Free cash flow in the third quarter was lower, partially due to the timing of some capital expenditures. 
Dilution related to convertible debentures was 24 million shares based on the average share price during the third quarter compared with 20.8 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 22.5 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of second quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.5 million shares repurchased during the third quarter. 
With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1,161,000,000 to $1,166,000,000 increased and narrowed from the $1,155,000,000 to $1,165,000,000 range provided on our prior earnings call. 
Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 65% and 65.5% increased and narrowed from the 64.5% to 65.25% range provided on our prior earnings call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $103 million and $110 million. 
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $45 million and $55 million, changed from the $40 million to $50 million range provided on the last call. And cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $20 million and $30 million. 
The majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. As we said in prior calls, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure and our intention, based on current conditions, is not to redeem these debentures, which will allow the cash tax benefits to continue to accrue. 
In summary, the company continues to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2017. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."
