Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones for the period on Slide #4.We have again posted solid set of results based on 4 pillars. Number 1, our recurrent leverage",965,"Well, Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones for the period on Slide #4.
We have again posted solid set of results based on 4 pillars. Number 1, our recurrent leverage free cash flow has increased by more than 60% since our IPO, May 2015. Second, we have generated organic growth ahead of our guidance. Third, our business profile has dramatically improved as a result of the development of our European platform. And last, we continue to have a robust balance sheet with flexibility to continue capturing new growth opportunities.
On Slide #5, you can see the stronger performance of our key volumetrics. We have adjusted EBITDA growing at 33% per year and a record and leverage free cash flow per share growing at around 30% per year during the last couple of years.
Moving to Slide #6. Here is important to highlight that in the beginning of 2016, we guided to 3% to 4% organic growth and we came in ahead of that guidance, which show of our current operations. Including the change of during 2016, total PoPs have increased by 19% and our consolidated customer ratio by 6%. Additionally, have increased 13% and we expect this new activity to become a meaningful contributor to Cellnex Telecom infrastructure service going forward. In terms of our organic growth drivers, you can see on the Slide #7, our view for new organic PoPs as well as the progress of our commissioning and Build to Suit program. New PoPs from multi-tenancy are expected to be generated at a similar rate as the guidance provided last year. Our decommissioning program shows 25% progress, including agreements or redesign and a 73% progress for our Build to Suit program, including our last transaction with Telecom in January 2017.
And additionally, our efficiency program, I can say you that it is on track and we have recently signed a commercial balance sheet agreement with JC to strengthen our position in the Small Cell business. And the CFO will later provide you more details on both
Moving to Slide #8, I would like to emphasize that as a result of our recent bills, we have dramatically improved our business risk profile by diversifying both in term of geographies and exposure to new high quality customers. It is also worth mentioning that pro forma basis, it means including the full year affect of our bills announced in 2016 and 2017, France, 62% of our revenues will be generated by Telecom infrastructure services and that our current backlog represents today 14 years of revenues or 8x our net debt.
On Slide #9, you can see the result of our geographical diversification efforts. With around half of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside of Spain, again on a pro forma basis. While Cellnex have become a key player in terms of number of towers worldwide. Our efforts to create a European platform translate into demand on the right-hand side with the last example being the agreement with recently reached with telecom. Let me please take the opportunity of summarize on Slide #10, the key characteristics of our last project in France. First of all, let me highlight the high quality of the assets; second one, the high visibility of the revenues; third, the new paradigm created in the tower industry by shifting from the classic Master Lease Agreement to an innovative master service agreement; fourth, our tax-efficient structure; fifth, efficient cash flow -- outflows  sorry, providing financial flexibility; and sixth, the validation of our discipline international expansion strategy. On a run-rate basis, with all sites have been transferred and build by 2022, we are expecting an EBITDA contribution of EUR 61 million per year.
I will not go through the details on Slide #11. But I would highlight at least 4 key ideas. First, thanks to this deal, we are beginning the second largest in the tower operator in France, gaining a scale from our first investment in September 2016. Second, increasing our presence in a highly dynamic market as it is France. The third, the effectiveness of our portfolio offers high quality organic growth potential. And forth, we're acquiring assets in areas with very high barriers to entry around 34 services models to build new site in the main cities of France.
Moving to Slide #12, just a few words from our strong balance sheet with headroom to continue pursuing accretive M&A. We have close to EUR 2 billion in cash and available debt. Our long-term and fixed capital structure in place at attractive terms. And for flexibility that will allow us to optimize available funding alternatives. We will remain disciplined and stick to our criteria. There are ample opportunities available and we have demonstrate with recent opportunities, we will not overpay. Before moving to José Manuel's section let me please highlight in the Slide #13, that today we're presenting again a solid set of results. We are posting strong organic growth and progress on our additional value enhancing initiatives. We are taking the first step to be common European leader in the and small sector. We are creating a European platform, executing value accretive acquisitions that improve our business profile. We have a robust capital structure in place, enough firepower is still available to continue growing while optimizing funding alternatives. We continue to pursue growth opportunities with discipline and with selective M&A approach, we are successfully integrating our recent portfolios into Cellnex and Cellnex is today recognized as the player best positioning to consolidate the European tower landscape.
Now, please allow me to hand over to José Manuel Aisa, our CFO and M&A Director, who will go through our 2016 business and financial performance. So, please José Manuel."

Good afternoon. As a reminder, please note that additional information can be obtained on the Investor Relations sections of our website, where there is a detailed file and should we also accounts of the company.
So if now we go to slide 15, you can see here the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of parametric. We have managed to add more than 900 dynamic PoPs in the period, reaching alternative ratio of 1.62, including M&A. Additionally, we are pursuing new organic growth opportunities in all business areas with a special mention to framework agreements with mobile operators entering new markets, the commissioning and Build to Suit projects and other recent agreements with JCDecaux to strengthen our position in this more sense market. This balance sheet applies one opportunity arise in Spain and Italy for initial period of 18 months. with current all or when a new tender process is launched manage advertising sites and on our preferred partner approach on cost exiting capabilities and adding on top of that our own capabilities to increase the value position.
Moving to slide 15, you can see here the progress of our efficiency plan. As anticipated last year, the main contributor to this program is our site management project, with around 30% of the targeted savings annually achieved. We have CapEx of EUR 31 million between and land acquisition with paybacks of 5 years and average saving around of about 20%, with a resulting contract land begin 15 years. We're also making good progress on our additional initiatives with around 50% of the targeted savings annually achieved. Our ultimate objective for the efficiency plan will be for savings to offset higher future cost due to a pricing and increased operating activity, so we can show a flat performance on a like-for-like basis going forward.
On the next slide, benefit explanation of our adjusted EBITDA evolution. You can see how the negative impact of the DTT single in 2015 is more than offset by the of the new TV channels. Together, with organic growth contribution and change of parametric, explaining the strong adjusted EBITDA increase in the year of 23%, in other words, EUR 290 million of adjusted EBITDA.
If we now focus on the adjusted EBITDA margin evolution on the next slide, operating leverage coming from organic growth increases our margin by 1% by additional 2% and if we adjust for pass-through constant revenues, we end up with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 43%.
Slide 19. We will now focus on our capital allocation for the year. We have devoted 90% of our total investment to M&A with 80% allocated to expansion CapEx. We deploy organic growth CapEx with a strict and levered IRR. And you can see the majority have been dedicated in 2015 to our efficiency plan.
Slide 20, regarding capital structure. Our debt maturities profile as of February 2015 present the first maturity or an average maturity of around 7 years with no material refinancing required before 2022, protection against potential interest rates hikes due to the fixed cost nature of our 
Slide 21. There, we provide an updated snapshot of our capital structure after our last bond issued in January. We have long-term capital structure in place as attractive terms with EUR 1.8 billion of liquidity between cash and available credit lines.
Let me now explain on the slide 22, our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow in the period has been strong 87%. With the total figure increasing 30%, when compared to the recurring levered free cash flow of 2015.
Looking now to revenues, the contribution from all the different businesses line increase with our very will contain cost base, leading to an adjusted EBITDA growth of 23% when compared to last year. Maintenance CapEx, if we now see our guidance of 3% of revenues and our change in working capital is positive due to our one-off revenue collection measures, but expected to be going forward in line with our guidance.
Interest rates reflects our capital structure as of December with coupons in Q3 reflecting the implementation of tax management measures. All-in-all, we are posting a 15% revenue growth, which implies almost our recurring levered free cash flow growth when compared to last year.
Moving now to our balance sheet on slide 23. Cellnex leverage for the period has been 4.6x net EBITDA after investing more than EUR 700 million in the year. Our balance sheet reflects the increase in fixed asset due to our recent acquisitions, recurring net profit, adjusted for one-off noncash task tax effect last year increases 38% and net interest increase mainly due to cost in the year.
On the remuneration, we will pay EUR 22 million in 2017, 10% increase over the dividend paid in 2016.
Moving to M&A activity in 2015 -- '16, sorry. On slide 24, what we believe is our new in the tower industry. Our ability to create master service agreement with our clients from the scratch, making sure these services were not be accounted for debt, as if we were accounted for IFRS '16. We offer a wide of services include in order to strengthen our long-term relationships with our clients.
Slide 25, you can see here how we think about cash generation from recent acquisitions. The cash flow ratio from EBITDA recurring free cash flow is about 60%, and are expected to generate EUR 103 million on a pro forma 2-year basis around 26% of the recurring levered free cash flow generated in 2016.
Please note that all these estimations, especially the recurring free cash flow is after considering financial expenses or This has been achieved with an efficiency ---efficient capital structure by applying our strict investment criteria.
Moving to slide 26 in terms of financial outlook for 2017. We believe we can provide a recurring levered free cash flow at least 10% higher than in 2016, in line with consensus. Looking at the different contribution lines, it is important to highlight that our EBITDA is expected to reach between EUR 330 million and EUR 340 million, our CapEx guidance both maintenance and expansion remains unchanged and dividend payable in will increased 10% compared to 2016. recurring levered free cash flow, adjust working capital that should also the interest expense paid that should follow on what coupons. And finally, the tax payment, that should be slightly below -- slightly above our payments in 2016.
Finally, I think that is what next. We're focusing on several opportunities in Europe, both and options, while maintaining our strict investment disciplined. The next session topics that are very well covered in the slides. This is a new section that we frequently ask questions. that these questions will come across in the Q&A session.

To have the cabinets is yes, another possibility, and I think is one of the new areas as well as using advertising panels, and this is, let's say, how we see our agreement with JCDecaux with this another potential real estate. Technically, there are certain characteristics that this real estate must have is that it has to have some height and cannot be just close to the floor, so you need a really 3 meters, 4 meters height in order to do the small coverage that the small cell is supposed to do.

The reality is and this is also true that it has taken a little bit more time on the preparation for the par of decommissioning with the quite detailed analysis of their towers, the operators towers, our tower, our tower survival tower, how to move the fiber in the fiber so it is very detailed technical analysis that has to be performed before moving ahead with the decision of the commissioning
And second part of this question was whether if the remaining 75% we intend to shift with only one operator?  Yes is it is going to be spread among different M&A and different countries."

So regarding your second question, which is our expansion CapEx, you're right. We have, I think we have been quite happy with this program. On most -- most of program, cash from renegotiation and cash advances, ground-lease acquisitions. This is what is something and that is important to say. And very specially, when to say was going on in the years, you can see that this EUR 57 million represents 7.5% of total revenues, which is within our guidance between 5% and 10% of revenues related to expansion CapEx. And I will think we will follow this guidance.  So step-by-step, I think we will -- we will be able to increase our ground renegotiation program, which is very interesting. And finally, regarding your dividend statement, we -- let me say to you that this dividend -- this dividend payment in 2017, '18, '19 gives equates our digitalization of our dividend policy. You know that a 20% correlates free cash flow that had to be conventionally to also the growth to develop the company, then the net income of the company. So we do think that this is the digitalization for 3 years that in the quantity of money that makes sense with all the patterns that we commensurate this 20% that correlate free cash flow.

And our competitor is not only debt from payment is actually we said before in other question and answer is to be able to sit down with our client to build that a new MSA contract to understand their needs. That's really important. And when your second question was about Bouygues -- Bouygues competitive platforms. Of course, it was competitive platforms. Maybe it was not being in their press everyday, but it was competitive. And we were able to win is because we were able to do as unique offering. And unique offer from many angles, not only their from payment, but also our capacity to understand their needs today and tomorrow. I know that unique, unique industrial angle, unique partnership in the long term and this make us unique in comparison with others. And finally, you're talking about, I think it was fourth  MNO.

Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones for the period on Slide #4.We have again posted a solid set of results based on 4 pillars. Number one, our recurrent lever",975,"Well, Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones for the period on Slide #4.
We have again posted a solid set of results based on 4 pillars. Number one, our recurrent leverage free cash flow has increased by more than 60% since our IPO, May 2015. Second, we have generated organic growth ahead of our guidance. Third, our business profile has dramatically improved as a result of the development of our European platform. And last, we continue to have a robust balance sheet with flexibility to continue capturing new growth opportunities.
On Slide #5, you can see the stronger performance of our key value metrics, with an adjusted EBITDA growing at 23% per year and a recurrent leverage free cash flow per share growing at around 30% per year during the last couple of years.
Moving to Slide #6. Here, it's important to highlight that at the beginning of 2016, we guided to 3% to 4% organic growth and we came in ahead of that guidance, which show this -- of our current operations. Including the change of perimeter during 2016, total PoPs have increased by 19% and our consolidated customer ratio by 6%. Additionally, DAS nodes have increased 13%, and we expect this new activity to become a meaningful contributor to Cellnex Telecom infrastructure service going forward. 
In terms of organic growth drivers, you can see on the Slide #7, our view for new organic PoPs as well as the progress of our decommissioning and build-to-suit program. New PoPs from multi-tenancy are expected to be generated at a similar rate as the guidance provided last year. Our decommissioning program shows 25% progress, including agreements or redesign, and a 73% progress for our build-to-suit program, including our last transaction with Bouygues Telecom in January 2017.
And additionally, our efficiency program, I can say you that it is on track. We have recently signed a commercial partnership sheet agreement with JCDecaux to strengthen our position in the DAS small cell business. And the CFO will later provide you more details on both work streams.
Moving to Slide #8, I would like to emphasize that as a result of our recent deals, we have dramatically improved our business risk profile by diversifying both in terms of geographies and exposure to new, high-quality customers. It is also worth mentioning that pro forma basis, it means including the full year affect of our deals announced in 2016 and 2017 in France, 62% of our revenues will be generated by Telecom Infrastructure Services and that our current backlog represents today 14 years of revenues or 8x our net debt.
On Slide #9, you can see the result of our geographical diversification efforts, with around half of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside of Spain, again, on a pro forma basis. While Cellnex has become a key player in terms of number of towers worldwide, our efforts to create a European platform translate into the map on the right-hand side, with the last example being the agreement we've recently reached with Bouygues Telecom. 
Let me please take the opportunity of summarize on Slide #10, the key characteristics of our last project in France. First of all, let me highlight the high quality of the assets; second one, the high visibility of the revenues; third, the new -- a new paradigm created in the tower industry by shifting from the classic master lease agreement to an innovative master service agreement; fourth, our tax-efficient structure; the fifth, efficient cash flows -- outflows  sorry, providing financial flexibility; and sixth, the validation of our disciplined international expansion strategy. On a run-rate basis, when all sites have been transferred and build by 2022, we are expecting an EBITDA contribution of EUR 61 million per year.
I will not go through the details on Slide #11, but I would highlight at least 4 key ideas. First, thanks to this deal, we are becoming the second-largest independent tower operator in France, gaining a scale from our first investment in September 2016. Second, increasing our presence in a highly dynamic market, as it is France. The third, the effectiveness of our portfolio offers high-quality organic growth potential. And forth, we're acquiring assets in areas with very high barriers to entry, around 24, 36 month to build new site in the main cities of France.
Moving to Slide #12, just a few words on our strong balance sheet with headroom to continue pursuing accretive M&A. We have close to EUR 2 billion in cash and available debt, our long-term and fixed capital structure in place at attractive terms and full flexibility that will allow us to optimize available funding alternatives. We will remain disciplined and stick to our criteria. There are ample opportunities available. And as we have demonstrate with recent opportunities, we will not overpay. 
Before moving to José Manuel's section, let me please highlight in Slide #13 that today, we are presenting again a solid set of results. We are posting strong organic growth and progress on our additional value-enhancing initiatives. We are taking the first step to be come a European leader in the DAS and small cells sector. We are creating a European platform, executing value-accretive acquisitions that improve our business profile. We have a robust capital structure in place. Enough firepower is still available to continue growing while optimizing funding alternatives. We continue to pursue growth opportunities with discipline and with a selective M&A approach. We are successfully integrating our recent portfolios into Cellnex. And Cellnex is today recognized as the player best positioned to consolidate the European tower landscape.
Now please allow me to hand over to José Manuel Aisa, our CFO and M&A Director, who will go through our 2016 business and financial performance. So please, José Manuel."

Good afternoon. As a reminder, please note that additional information can be obtained on the Investor Relations sections of our website, where there is a detailed express [ph] file and should we also the annuals accounts of the company.
So if now we go to slide 15, you can see here the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have managed to add more than 900 dynamic [ph] PoPs in the period, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.62, including M&A. 
Additionally, we are pursuing new organic growth opportunities in all business areas with a special mention to framework agreements with mobile operators, entering new markets, decommissioning and build-to-suit projects and other recent agreements with JCDecaux to strengthen our position in the small cells market. 
This balance sheet applies when opportunity arise in Spain and Italy for initial period of 18 months in venue current JCDecaux presence or when a new tender process is launched to manage advertising sites, and is based on a preferred partner, relying on JCDecaux's exiting capabilities and adding on top of that our own capabilities to increase the value position.
Moving to slide 16, you can see here the progress of our efficiency plan. As anticipated last year, the main contributor to this program is our site management project, with around 30% of the targeted savings already achieved. We have devoted CapEx of EUR 31 million between cash advance and land acquisition with paybacks of 5 years and average saving around lease, about 20%, with a resulting contract length beyond 15 years. We're also making good progress on our additional initiatives with around 50% of the targeted savings already achieved. Our ultimate objective for the efficiency plan will be for savings to offset higher future cost due to a pricing and increased operating activity so we can show a flat OpEx performance on a like-for-like basis going forward.
On the next slide, you can find a [indiscernible] explanation of our adjusted EBITDA evolution. You can see how the negative impact of the DTT simulcast in 2015 is more than offset by the switch on of the new TV channels, together with organic growth contribution and change of perimeter, explaining the strong adjusted EBITDA increase in the year of 23%, in other words, EUR 290 million of adjusted EBITDA.
If we now focus on the adjusted EBITDA margin evolution on the next slide, operating leverage coming from organic growth increases our margin by 1%, broadcasting by additional 2%. And if we adjust for pass-through cost and revenues, we end up with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 43%.
Slide 19. We will now focus on our capital allocation for the year. We have devoted 90% of our total investment to M&A with 8% allocated to expansion CapEx. We deploy organic growth CapEx with a strict return criteria of low teens unlevered IRR. And as you can see, the majority has been dedicated in 2016 to our efficiency plan.
Slide 20, regarding capital structure. Our debt maturities profile as of February 2016 presents the first maturity -- or an average maturity of around 7 years, with no material refinancing required before 2022, and protection against potential interest rates hikes due to the fixed cost nature of our debt.
Slide 21. There, we provide an updated snapshot of our capital structure after our last bond issue in January. We have a long-term capital structure in place at attractive terms, with EUR 1.8 billion of liquidity between cash and available credit lines.
Let me now explain on slide 22, our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow in the period has been a strong 87%, with the total figure increasing 30% when compared to the recurrent levered free cash flow of 2015.
Looking now to revenues. The contribution from all the different businesses line increase with our very well-contained cost base, leading to an adjusted EBITDA growth of 23% when compared to last year. Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance of 3% of revenues. And our change in working capital is positive due to a one-off revenue collection measures, but expected to be neutral going forward, in line with our guidance. Interest rates reflects our capital structure as of December, with coupons already paid in Q3 and taxes reflecting the implementation of tax management measures. 
All-in-all, we are posting a 15% revenue growth, which implies almost doubling our recurrent levered free cash flow growth when compared to last year.
Moving now to our balance sheet on slide 23. Cellnex leverage for the period has reached 4.6x net debt annualized EBITDA after investing more than EUR 700 million in the year. Our balance sheet reflects the increase in fixed assets due to our recent acquisitions. Recurrent net profit, adjusted for one-off noncash task tax effect last year, increases to 38%. And net interest increased mainly due to accrued cost in the year.
On shareholder remuneration, we will pay EUR 22 million in 2017, a 10% increase over the dividend paid in 2016.
Moving to M&A activity in 2015 -- '16, sorry. On slide 24, we explain what we believe is a new paradigm in the tower industry: Our ability to create master service agreement with our clients from scratch, making sure these services were not be accounted for debt, as -- if it were accounted following IFRS 16. We offer a wide array of services beyond pure real estate in order to strengthen our long-term relationships with our clients.
Slide 25, you can see here how we think about cash flow generation from recent acquisitions. The cash conversion ratio from EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is above 60%, and the new deals are expected to generate EUR 103 million on a pro forma full year basis, around 26% of the recurrent levered free cash flow generated in 2016. Please note that all these estimations, especially the recurrent levered free cash flow, is after considering financial expenses borne by Cellnex. 
And all this has been achieved with an efficiency -- efficient and flexible capital structure and by applying our strict investment criteria.
Moving to slide 26 in terms of financial outlook for 2017. We believe we can provide a recurrent levered free cash flow at least 10% higher than in 2016, in line with consensus. Looking at the different contribution lines, it is important to highlight that our adjusted EBITDA is expected to reach between EUR 330 million and EUR 340 million. Our CapEx guidance, both maintenance and expansion, remains unchanged. And dividend payable in 2017 will increased 10% compared to 2016. 
There are other things that belong to recurrent levered free cash flow, such as the working capital. That should tend to be neutral; also the interest expense paid, that should follow our coupons; and finally, the tax payment, that should be slightly below -- slightly above our payment in 2016.
Finally, knowing -- I think that is, what's next? We are focusing on several opportunities in Europe, both proprietary and auctions, while maintaining our strict investment discipline. 
The next section addresses several key topics that are very well covered in the slides. This is a new section that we have called frequently asked questions. But I think that these questions, we'll come across in the -- in your Q&A session. 
So please follow -- please -- with this, we can start the Q&A session."

And both together, we believe we can add jointly a set of tools together that can speed up a little bit the deployment of this market. Our budget is not being influenced by this agreement so far, and we need to see yet the go-to-market on the 2 countries where we are initially having these commercial agreement in both sides. And we intend to at least continue with the growth on DAS and the small cells. We categorize both product lines into a single one, which is what we call densification of macro sides into smaller sites. And here, we can attack the market with 2 products: DAS, which is distributed antenna systems; or small cells. We've reached 13% growth during 2016 and we expect that we should be able, of course, to follow the same growth we've been achieving so far. And taking into account, there is on page 31, an assumption on how we understand the market will grow from 2018 onwards up to 2025, where the analysts are projecting a CAGR of roughly 20% per year.

This is Giles Thorne here from Jefferies.

And now they've spoken about actually using their proprietary cabinet footprint in Italy for the small cell deployment. But it would be interesting to know if there will be any opportunity for Cellnex to support that. Or do you think Fastweb will rely solely on their own infrastructure? And the second question that kind of leads on from that. And that the -- and it's also another question about the JCDecaux commercial alliance. Now small cell deployments comes with many challenges and not least is getting access to the ground level street furniture. We've seen with Fastweb, they'll try and use their own cabinets. So when it comes to the JCDecaux commercial alliance, it seems like you've got a fantastic opportunity to get access to And that ground infrastructure.

It's amongst a very few MNO sale and leaseback deals that haven't been driven by leverage pressures at the MNO. It'd be interesting to know how you found working with the Bouygues management team and compare that to other management teams at other MNOs. And also, any sense that there are discussions for expanding that agreement? Are you doing more sale and leasebacks in France?"

There are several, let's call it, urban real estate that can be used. We have already today in our existing contract with Barcelona City Hall, we have experience on running out through traffic lights and pole lamps. Also in Milano, we are using light poles to deploy small cells. To have the cabinets is, yes, another possibility, and I think is one of the new areas, as well as using advertising panels. And this is, let's say, how we see our agreement with JCDecaux, which is another potential real estate. Technically, there are certain characteristics that this [indiscernible] real estate must have, is that it has to have some height, cannot be just close to the floor. So you need ideally 3 meters, 4 meters height in order to do the small coverage that the small cell is supposed to do. The agreement on -- moving to the second question, I understand if you were wondering whether the agreement we are having today with JCDecaux could be exported to other regions other than the first 2. Absolutely yes.

Now it's no secret anymore WIND and Hutchinson are basically merging. WIND is basically honoring the contract. And therefore, it's very likely that the Hutchinson tender will be moving at some stage. So I was wondering, if anything -- any movements on that side, I've seen that the growth in Italy is relatively robust, especially when compared to Spain. And I was wondering who are the PoPs that are actually moving towards your towers? The third, it's a followup from previous answer to JCDecaux again. I was talking about the fact that the budget for the JCDecaux has not been formulated or places have not been finalized.

So regarding your second question, which is about the expansion of CapEx. You're right. We have, I think we have been quite happy with this program. Most of the program, cash from renegotiation and cash advances done ground-lease acquisitions, okay. So this is something that is important to say. And very specially, when to say it was going on in the next years, you can see that this EUR 57 million represents 7.5% of the total revenues, which is within our guidance between 5% and 10% of revenues diverted to expansion CapEx. I do think we will follow this guidance. So step-by-step, I think that we will be able to increase further the ground lease renegotiation program, which is very interesting. And finally, regarding your dividend statement, we -- let me say to you that this dividend -- this dividend suggestion, this dividend payment in 2017, '18, '19, it's a crystallization of our dividend policy. If you know that at 20% recurrent levered free cash flow had to be commensurate with also the growth of the company, the net income of the company. So we do think that this is crystallization for 3 years that in quantity of money that makes sense with all the patterns that we commensurate this 20% recurrent levered free cash flow.

I've got 3 questions. The first one is, so in the U.K., I guess, there is enough available that are of significant scale, but it would also mean dialing back the progress you've been making in reducing the broadcast exposure in your portfolio. So would you tolerate, I guess, bidding for this asset and would cement great scale on a big 5 European market or it is something you wouldn't really consider because of the progress you made on broadcast in reducing that exposure? Question two, so the Bouygues tower deal, I think that's a bit appreciated, it's quite an interesting deal. I was just wondering whether you could confirm the sale process was conducted on an exclusive basis with Cellnex being the only bidder. And I was wondering whether you are confident that you can carry on doing this in future negotiations, essentially wondering why wouldn't operator not choose to conduct discussions with multiple parties, including American Tower. And just on that, did that provide support for you pulling out of an FPS deal where otherwise you would be bidding at quite an elevated multiple. And question 3, on your growth guidance. I guess, there could be a material step change in growth in some of your geographies, particularly in Italy, if -- and depending on when the 4th operator choose to build. Would you consider such growth to be incremental to your 3% to 4% guidance? And those are the questions."

Otherwise, you help me to remind because there has been quite a set of questions. Well, your first question was talking about [indiscernible] and any other investment in the last case for Cellnex has to comply our strict M&A criteria. And this is very important. I mean, it's not -- I'm very sorry, we'll not be [indiscernible] or nothing else. Just to remind very quickly, our M&A criteria is low double-digit in terms of equity IRR. Second, improvement of our cash flow visibility of business risk profile. And finally, the accretive impact on our recurrent free cash flow per share from year 2 onwards. So it's quite strict and this criteria and just to answer another question you were saying, regarding FPS, was your fourth question, I think. You said to ask that obviously, this opportunity did not meet our criteria. So I'm very sorry. All that will come. It could not happen our criteria. So when talking about American Tower, which is your third question, I think, American Tower has always been there. It's not the first time it has been in Europe, back in 2011, it was competing with us with all their towers, with our first tower in Spain. So it has always been there. And our competitor advantage is not only debt from payment, it is as we said before in other question -- the answer is to be able to sit down with a client to build up a new MSA contract to understand their needs. That's really important. And your second question was about Bouygues -- Bouygues? The process was a competitive process. Of course, it was a competitive process. Maybe it was not in the press everyday, but it was competitive. And if we were able to win, it's because we were able to do a unique offer. An unique offer from many angles, not only the upfront payment, but also our capacity to understand their needs today and tomorrow. And in order to do so, you need credentials. You need industrial angle, you need partnership in the long term and this make us unique in comparison with others. And finally, you're talking about, I think it was growth and MNO [indiscernible] should have an impact in 2018, not before. We've been consistent with this message. So what the guidance we have represented to you is consistent."

And I was wondering if you can -- if you are able to may be to share some color of -- about the deal maybe from the mobile network operators perspective, and particularly with regards to the treatment in the IFRS '16 empowerment. So the service agreement that you have, will Bouygues have to basically reported as part of long-term lease in their net debt definition? Or does it stay out of the net debt with IFRS '16 new rules? The second question is on cross-border synergies. I mean, traditionally other tower companies have always stated there are no synergies. I see you have a slide in your presentation making the case for it. If you can probably a bit elaborate on your views on that, I think you are in better position than others in Europe to comment on that? And thirdly, just to go back on the dividend guidance and dividend outlook. So if I understand well, your numbers, effectively, we are talking about EUR 0.091 of DPS in 2016, which can become EUR 0.10 in 2017. Now consensus on Bloomberg for '17 is about EUR 0.21.

We -- I don't know how different our [indiscernible] it is from country's perspective. What I can tell you is that we are working on MSAs, not longer in MLAs, which means that IFRS '16 defines very well what is a lease and what is not a lease. And therefore, if anyone understands the criteria and takes our contract, will categorize this contract as an MSA and therefore -- under IFRS '15. But this is the treatment -- the accountancy treatment depends on the different parties. Regarding the cross-border synergies on page 34, the only intention of Page 34 is to tell you that when talking about cross borders, you have to look at the countries, yes, so the clients. At the end of the day, if our great advantage is to sit down and develop a new contract with our client and therefore, if you have already a common way of communication with this client, this can be somehow repetitive knowledge.

Please allow me not be very explicit, but in the case of France, I think there are 2 elements: one, is the initial tenant surety for all those towers is quite low. On the towers where there are 2 MNOs already having -- sharing agreements like Bouygues [indiscernible] this is fully taken into consideration on the transactions. And this is the first transaction in Bouygues for the typology of the towers. And also in this, as a second, I think very important point in this transactions, we always kept all or not in renewal clause, which is something that makes quite, let's say, strong -- any risk of losing any sites at any moment because there is a redundancy of sites and I think the proven part of that is what is weighing on in Italy that we have not been effected by payment."

Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones for the period on Slide #4.We have again posted a solid set of results based on 4 pillars. Number one, our recurrent lever",976,"Well, Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones for the period on Slide #4.
We have again posted a solid set of results based on 4 pillars. Number one, our recurrent leverage free cash flow has increased by more than 60% since our IPO, May 2015. Second, we have generated organic growth ahead of our guidance. Third, our business profile has dramatically improved as a result of the development of our European platform. And last, we continued to have a robust balance sheet with flexibility to continue capturing new growth opportunities.
On Slide #5, you can see the stronger performance of our key value metrics, with an adjusted EBITDA growing at 23% per year and a recurrent leverage free cash flow per share growing at around 30% per year during the last couple of years.
Moving to Slide #6. Here, it's important to highlight that at the beginning of 2016, we guided to 3% to 4% organic growth and we came in ahead of that guidance, which show this -- of our current operations. Including the change of perimeter during 2016, total PoPs have increased by 19% and our consolidated customer ratio by 6%. Additionally, DAS nodes have increased 13%, and we expect this new activity to become a meaningful contributor to Cellnex Telecom infrastructure service going forward. 
In terms of organic growth drivers, you can see on the Slide #7, our view for new organic PoPs as well as the progress of our decommissioning and build-to-suit program. New PoPs from multi-tenancy are expected to be generated at a similar rate as the guidance provided last year. Our decommissioning program shows 25% progress, including agreements or redesign, and a 73% progress for our build-to-suit program, including our last transaction with Bouygues Telecom in January 2017.
And additionally, our efficiency program, I can say you that it is on track and we have recently signed a commercial partnership sheet agreement with JCDecaux to strengthen our position in the DAS small cell business. And the CFO will later provide you more details on both work streams.
Moving to Slide #8, I would like to emphasize that as a result of our recent deals, we have dramatically improved our business risk profile by diversifying both in terms of geographies and exposure to new, high-quality customers. It is also worth mentioning that pro forma basis, it means including the full year effect of our deals announced in 2016 and 2017 in France 62% of our revenues will be generated by Telecom Infrastructure Services and that our current backlog represents today 14 years of revenues or 8x our net debt.
On Slide #9, you can see the result of our geographical diversification efforts, with around 1/2 of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside of Spain, again, on a pro forma basis. While Cellnex has become a key player in terms of number of towers worldwide, our efforts to create a European platform translate into the map on the right-hand side, with the last example being the agreement we've recently reached with Bouygues Telecom. 
Let me please take the opportunity of summarize on Slide #10, the key characteristics of our last project in France. First of all, let me highlight the high quality of the assets; second one, the high visibility of the revenues; third, the new -- a new paradigm created in the tower industry by shifting from the classic master lease agreement to an innovative master service agreement; fourth, our tax-efficient structure; the fifth, efficient cash flows -- outflows  sorry, providing financial flexibility; and sixth, the validation of our disciplined international expansion strategy. On a run-rate basis, when all sites have been transferred and built by 2022, we are expecting an EBITDA contribution of EUR 61 million per year.
I will not go through the details on Slide #11, but I would highlight at least 4 key ideas. First, thanks to this deal, we are becoming the second-largest independent tower operator in France, gaining a scale from our first investment in September 2016. Second, increasing our presence in a highly dynamic market, as it is France. The third, the effectiveness of our portfolio offers high-quality organic growth potential. And forth, we're acquiring assets in areas with very high barriers to entry, around 24, 36 month to build new site in the main cities of France.
Moving to Slide #12, just a few words on our strong balance sheet with headroom to continue pursuing accretive M&A. We have close to EUR 2 billion in cash and available debt, our long-term and fixed capital structure in place at attractive terms and full flexibility that will allow us to optimize available funding alternatives. We will remain disciplined and stick to our criteria. There are ample opportunities available. And as we have demonstrate with recent opportunities, we will not overpay. 
Before moving to José Manuel's section, let me please highlight in Slide #13 that today, we are presenting again a solid set of results. We are posting strong organic growth and progress on our additional value-enhancing initiatives. We are taking the first step to be come a European leader in the DAS and small cells sector. We are creating a European platform, executing value-accretive acquisitions that improve our business profile. We have a robust capital structure in place. Enough firepower is still available to continue growing while optimizing funding alternatives. We continue to pursue growth opportunities with discipline and with a selective M&A approach. We are successfully integrating our recent portfolios into Cellnex. And Cellnex is today recognized as the player best positioned to consolidate the European tower landscape.
Now please allow me to hand over to José Manuel Aisa, our CFO and M&A Director, who will go through our 2016 business and financial performance. So please, José Manuel."

Good afternoon. As a reminder, please note that additional information can be obtained on the Investor Relations sections of our website, where there is a detailed expense [ph] file and should be also the annuals accounts of the company.
So if now we go to slide 15, you can see here the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have managed to add more than 900 dynamic [ph] PoPs in the period, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.62, including M&A. 
Additionally, we are pursuing new organic growth opportunities in all business areas with a special mention to framework agreements with mobile operators, entering new markets, decommissioning and build-to-suit projects and other recent agreements with JCDecaux to strengthen our position in the small cells market. 
This balance sheet applies when opportunity arise in Spain and Italy for initial period of 18 months. In venue [ph] with current JCDecaux presence or when a new tender process is launched to manage advertising sites, and is based on a preferred partner approach, relying on JCDecaux's exiting capabilities and adding on top of that our own capabilities to increase the value position.
Moving to slide 16, you can see here the progress of our efficiency plan. As anticipated last year, the main contributor to this program is our site management project, with around 30% of the targeted savings already achieved. We have devoted CapEx of EUR 31 million between cash advance and land acquisition with paybacks of 5 years and average saving around lease, about 20%, with a resulting contract length beyond 15 years. We're also making good progress on our additional initiatives with around 50% of the targeted savings already achieved. Our ultimate objective for the efficiency plan will be for savings to offset higher future costs due to the pricing and increased operating activity so we can show a flat OpEx performance on a like-for-like basis going forward.
On the next slide, you can find a comprehensive explanation of our adjusted EBITDA evolution. You can see how the negative impact of the DTT simulcast in 2015 is more than offset by the switch-on of the new TV channels, together with organic growth contribution and change of perimeter, explaining the strong adjusted EBITDA increase in the year of 23%, in other words, EUR 290 million of adjusted EBITDA.
If we now focus on the adjusted EBITDA margin evolution on the next slide, operating leverage coming from organic growth increases our margin by 1%, broadcasting by an additional 2%. And if we adjust for pass-through costs and revenues, we end up with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 43%.
Slide 19. We will now focus on our capital allocation for the year. We have devoted 90% of our total investment to M&A with 8% allocated to expansion CapEx. We deploy organic growth CapEx with a strict return criteria of low teens unlevered IRR. And as you can see, the majority has been dedicated in 2016 to our efficiency plan.
Slide 20, regarding capital structure. Our debt maturities' profile as of February 2016 presents the first maturity -- or an average maturity of around 7 years, with no material refinancing required before 2022, and protection against potential interest rates hikes due to the fixed cost nature of our debt.
Slide 21. There, we provide an updated snapshot of our capital structure after our last bond issue in January. We have a long-term capital structure in place at attractive terms, with EUR 1.8 billion of liquidity between cash and available credit lines.
Let me now explain on slide 22, our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow in the period has been a strong 87%, with the total figure increasing 30% when compared to the recurrent levered free cash flow of 2015.
Looking now to revenues. The contribution from all the different businesses line increase with our very well-contained cost base, leading to an adjusted EBITDA growth of 23% when compared to last year. Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance of 3% of revenues. And our change in working capital is positive due to a one-off revenue collection measures, but expected to be neutral going forward, in line with our guidance. Interest rates reflects our capital structure as of December, with coupons already paid in Q3 and taxes reflecting the implementation of tax management measures. 
All-in-all, we are posting a 15% revenue growth, which implies almost doubling our recurrent levered free cash flow growth when compared to last year.
Moving now to our balance sheet on slide 23. Cellnex leverage for the period has reached 4.6x net debt annualized EBITDA after investing more than EUR 700 million in the year. Our balance sheet reflects the increase in fixed assets due to our recent acquisitions. Recurrent net profit, adjusted for one-off noncash task tax effect last year, increases 38%. And net interest increased mainly due to accrued cost in the year.
On shareholder remuneration, we will pay EUR 22 million in 2017, a 10% increase over the dividend paid in 2016.
Moving to M&A activity in 2015 -- '16, sorry. On slide 24, we explain what we believe is a new paradigm in the tower industry: our ability to create master service agreement with our clients from scratch, making sure these services will not be accounted for debt, as -- if it were accounted following IFRS 16. We offer a wide array of services beyond pure real estate in order to strengthen our long-term relationships with our clients.
Slide 25, you can see here how we think about cash flow generation from recent acquisitions. The cash conversion ratio from EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is above 60%, and the new deals are expected to generate EUR 103 million on a pro forma full year basis, around 26% of the recurrent levered free cash flow generated in 2016. Please note that all these estimations, especially the recurrent levered free cash flow, is after considering financial expenses borne by Cellnex. 
And all this has been achieved with an efficiency -- efficient and flexible capital structure and by applying our strict investment criteria.
Moving to slide 26 in terms of financial outlook for 2017. We believe we can provide a recurrent levered free cash flow at least 10% higher than in 2016, in line with consensus. Looking at the different contribution lines, it is important to highlight that our adjusted EBITDA is expected to reach between EUR 330 million and EUR 340 million. Our CapEx guidance, both maintenance and expansion, remains unchanged. And dividend payable in 2017 will increase 10% compared to 2016. 
There are other things that belong to recurrent levered free cash flow, such as the working capital. That should tend to be neutral; also the interest expense paid. That should follow our coupons; and finally, the tax payment. That should be slightly below -- slightly above our payment in 2016.
Finally, knowing -- I think that is, what's next? We are focusing on several opportunities in Europe, both proprietary and auctions, while maintaining our strict investment discipline. 
The next section addresses several key topics that are very well covered in the slides. This is a new section that we have called ""Frequently Asked Questions."" But I think that these questions will come across in the -- in your Q&A session. 
So please allow [ph] -- please -- with this, we can start the Q&A session."

It is sort of an agreement that we are both parties trying to have a common approach to the market. We've been trying to deal with the small cells as a initial deployment for this new market. And both together, we believe we can add jointly a set of tools together that can speed up a little bit the deployment of this market. Our budget is not being influenced by this agreement so far. We need to see yet the go-to-market on the 2 countries where we are initially having these commercial agreement in both sides. And we intend to at least continue with the growth on DAS and the small cells. We categorize both product lines into a single one, which is what we call ""densification of macro sides into smaller sites."" And here, we can attack the market with 2 products: DAS, which is distributed antenna systems; or small cells. We've reached 13% growth during 2016 and we expect that we should be able, of course, to follow the same growth we've been achieving so far. And taking into account, there is on page 31, an assumption on how we understand the market will grow from 2018 onwards up to 2025, where the analysts are projecting a CAGR of roughly 20% per year. So that's the intended approach onto that market, both parties together. There are 3 slides devoted on the appendix -- 4 slides actually, from slide 30 to slide 33, which are focusing all the different topologies of deployment for densification.

First of all, it's a deal that is coming from an MNO, so directly from the client, this is really important, in which we can develop our competitive advantage. And if you ask me, which is the competitive advantage of Cellnex compared to the other players, I would say it's to be able to sit down with a client and to draft from scratch a new MSA. And a new MSA, which is no longer an MLA. We have evolved here in towering in Europe, allow us to step-by-step be in the front door and to develop new concepts to understand the needs of our clients to meet these needs and to create value in the long term for both. No, these are win-win agreements. So yes, this is a new paradigm that meets not only the requirements in terms of technical aspects, but also from accountancy aspects, as this is no longer IFRS 16 lease, but it is a pure service, as pure infrastructure to service as you can find in other sectors."

This is Giles Thorne here from Jefferies. The first one was on Italy, and specifically, Fastweb has spoken about a small cell deployment in that country in the 3.5 gigahertz spectrum range that it had acquired with Tiscali last year. And now they've spoken about actually using a proprietary cabinet footprint in Italy for the small cell deployment. But it would be interesting to know if there will be any opportunity for Cellnex to support that. Or do you think Fastweb will rely solely on their own infrastructure? And the second question that kind of leads on from that. And the -- and it's also another question about the JCDecaux commercial alliance. Now small cell deployments comes with many challenges and not the least, getting access to the ground level street furniture. We've seen with Fastweb, they'll try and use their own cabinets. So when it comes to the JCDecaux commercial alliance, it seems like you've got a fantastic opportunity to get access to that ground infrastructure. Now it's just Spain, initially, at the moment, but should we expect to see the geographic scope of that commercial alliance expanded? And also, will that commercial alliance sit with the Commscon management team? And so a question there on JCDecaux. And then lastly, on the Bouygues deal, and you've touched on this already, but it does feel like a bellwether for European outsourcing. It's amongst a very few MNO sale and leaseback deals that haven't been driven by leverage pressures at the MNO. It'd be interesting to know how you found working with the Bouygues management team and compare that to other management teams at other MNOs. And also, any sense that there are discussions for expanding that agreement? Are you doing more sale and leasebacks in France?"

We have already today in our existing contract with Barcelona City Hall, we have experience on running out through traffic lights and pole lamps. Also in Milano, we are using light poles to deploy small cells. To have the cabinets is, yes, another possibility, and I think is one of the new areas, as well as using advertising panels. And this is, let's say, how we see our agreement with JCDecaux, which is another potential real estate. Technically, there are certain characteristics that this Euro real estate must have, is that it has to have some height, cannot be just close to the floor. So you need ideally 3 meters, 4 meters height in order to do the small coverage that the small cell is supposed to do. The agreement on -- moving to the second question, I understand if you were wondering whether the agreement we are having today with JCDecaux could be exported to other regions other than the first 2. Absolutely yes.

It is true that we have been ahead of our guidance in terms of organic growth for this year. Mostly you go to Q3, there was quite a high activity. In any case, even the landing [ph] profile of how we attract new PoPs every quarter, I think it's important for us to provide exactly the same view for the medium term. So that is why we are keeping this 3%, 4% guidance in the medium term. With any more information we get from our customers, we might be adjusting that. But this is the result of our information we have today and that I will feel comfortable with. In terms of organic growth being generated by different countries, exactly the same as you have seen in 2016. The profile will be consistent. Countries are providing similar levels of organic growth, so, obviously with slight differences. For example, in Netherlands, you know that, that tenancy rate is already quite high. But on the previous markets, we are expecting a stabilizing, as seen in 2016."

And you're going to have an overlapping of different sites, and so on and so forth? The second one is on Italy. I've seen that you're recording actually good growth on the PoPs. Now it's no secret anymore that WIND and Hutchison are basically merging. WIND is basically honoring the contract. And therefore, it's very likely that the Hutchinson tender will be moving at some stage. So I was wondering, if have you seen any movements on that side. I've seen that the growth in Italy is relatively robust, especially when compared to Spain. And I was wondering who are the PoPs that actually are moving towards your towers? The third, it's a followup from a previous answer to JCDecaux again. I was talking about the fact that the budget for the JCDecaux has not been formulated or places have not been finalized. So I was wondering is that -- means that the free cash flow guidance you provide today, it's gross of any investments you have to make on that particular agreement? Or it's basically already been accounted on your free cash flow guidance?"

So regarding your second question, which is about the expansion of CapEx. You are right. We have, I think we have been quite happy with this program. Most of the program, cash from renegotiation and cash advances done ground-lease acquisitions, okay. So this is something that is important to say. And very specially, when you say what's going on in those years, you can see that this EUR 57 million represents 7.5% of the total revenues, which is within our guidance between 5% and 10% of revenues diverted to expansion CapEx. I do think we will follow this guidance. So step-by-step, I think that we will be able to increase further the ground lease renegotiation program, which is very interesting. And finally, regarding your dividend statement, we -- let me say to you that this dividend -- this dividend suggestion, this dividend payment in 2017, '18, '19, it's a crystallization of our dividend policy. If you know that the 20% recurrent levered free cash flow had to be commensurate with also the growth of the company, the net income of the company. So we do think that this is a crystallization for 3 years that in quantity of money that makes sense with all the patterns that we commensurate this 20% recurrent levered [ph] free cash flow.

So would you tolerate, I guess, bidding for this asset and would cement create scale on a Big 5 European market or it is something you wouldn't really consider because of the progress you made on broadcast in reducing that exposure? Question two, so the Bouygues tower deal, I think that's a bit appreciated. It's quite an interesting deal. I was just wondering whether you could confirm the sale process was conducted on an exclusive basis with Cellnex being the only bidder. And I was wondering whether you are confident that you can carry on doing this in future negotiations, essentially wondering why wouldn't an operator not choose to conduct discussions with multiple parties, including American Tower. And just on that, did that provide support for you pulling out of an FPS deal where otherwise you'd be bidding at quite an elevated multiple. And question 3, on your growth guidance. I guess there could be a material step change in growth in some of your geographies, particularly in Italy, if -- and depending on when the 4th operator chooses to build. Would you consider such growth to be incremental to your 3% to 4% guidance? And those are the questions."

So when talking about American Tower, which is your third question, I think, American Tower has always been there. It's not the first time it has been in Europe. Back in 2011, it was competing with us with all those towers in -- with our first towers in Spain. So it has always been there. And our competitor advantage is not only debt from payment, it's as we said before in another question, another answer, is to be able to sit down with a client to build up a new MSA contract to understand their needs. That's really important. And your second question was about Bouygues -- Bouygues? The process was a competitive process. Of course, it was a competitive process. Maybe it was not in the press everyday, but it was competitive. And if we were able to win, it's because we were able to do a unique offer. And unique offer from many angles, not only the upfront payment, but also our capacity to understand their needs today and tomorrow. And in order to do so, you need credentials. You need industrial angle, you need partnership in the long term and this make us unique in comparison with others. And finally, you are talking about, I think it was growth and MNO.

If you can probably a bit elaborate on your views on that, I think you are in better position than others in Europe to comment on that?

Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones for the period on Slide #4.We have again posted a solid set of results based on 4 pillars. Number one, our recurrent lever",976,"Well, Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you so much for your time today. Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones for the period on Slide #4.
We have again posted a solid set of results based on 4 pillars. Number one, our recurrent leverage free cash flow has increased by more than 60% since our IPO, May 2015. Second, we have generated organic growth ahead of our guidance. Third, our business profile has dramatically improved as a result of the development of our European platform. And last, we continued to have a robust balance sheet with flexibility to continue capturing new growth opportunities.
On Slide #5, you can see the stronger performance of our key value metrics, with an adjusted EBITDA growing at 23% per year and a recurrent leverage free cash flow per share growing at around 30% per year during the last couple of years.
Moving to Slide #6. Here, it's important to highlight that at the beginning of 2016, we guided to 3% to 4% organic growth and we came in ahead of that guidance, which show this -- of our current operations. Including the change of perimeter during 2016, total PoPs have increased by 19% and our consolidated customer ratio by 6%. Additionally, DAS nodes have increased 13%, and we expect this new activity to become a meaningful contributor to Cellnex Telecom infrastructure service going forward. 
In terms of organic growth drivers, you can see on the Slide #7, our view for new organic PoPs as well as the progress of our decommissioning and build-to-suit program. New PoPs from multi-tenancy are expected to be generated at a similar rate as the guidance provided last year. Our decommissioning program shows 25% progress, including agreements or redesign, and a 73% progress for our build-to-suit program, including our last transaction with Bouygues Telecom in January 2017.
And additionally, our efficiency program, I can say you that it is on track and we have recently signed a commercial partnership sheet agreement with JCDecaux to strengthen our position in the DAS small cell business. And the CFO will later provide you more details on both work streams.
Moving to Slide #8, I would like to emphasize that as a result of our recent deals, we have dramatically improved our business risk profile by diversifying both in terms of geographies and exposure to new, high-quality customers. It is also worth mentioning that pro forma basis, it means including the full year effect of our deals announced in 2016 and 2017 in France 62% of our revenues will be generated by Telecom Infrastructure Services and that our current backlog represents today 14 years of revenues or 8x our net debt.
On Slide #9, you can see the result of our geographical diversification efforts, with around half of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside of Spain, again, on a pro forma basis. While Cellnex has become a key player in terms of number of towers worldwide, our efforts to create a European platform translate into the map on the right-hand side, with the last example being the agreement we've recently reached with Bouygues Telecom. 
Let me please take the opportunity of summarize on Slide #10, the key characteristics of our last project in France. First of all, let me highlight the high quality of the assets; second one, the high visibility of the revenues; third, the new -- a new paradigm created in the tower industry by shifting from the classic master lease agreement to an innovative master service agreement; fourth, our tax-efficient structure; the fifth, efficient cash flows -- outflows  sorry, providing financial flexibility; and sixth, the validation of our disciplined international expansion strategy. On a run-rate basis, when all sites have been transferred and built by 2022, we are expecting an EBITDA contribution of EUR 61 million per year.
I will not go through the details on Slide #11, but I would highlight at least 4 key ideas. First, thanks to this deal, we are becoming the second-largest independent tower operator in France, gaining a scale from our first investment in September 2016. Second, increasing our presence in a highly dynamic market, as it is France. The third, the effectiveness of our portfolio offers high-quality organic growth potential. And forth, we're acquiring assets in areas with very high barriers to entry, around 24, 36 month to build new site in the main cities of France.
Moving to Slide #12, just a few words on our strong balance sheet with headroom to continue pursuing accretive M&A. We have close to EUR 2 billion in cash and available debt, our long-term and fixed capital structure in place at attractive terms and full flexibility that will allow us to optimize available funding alternatives. We will remain disciplined and stick to our criteria. There are ample opportunities available. And as we have demonstrate with recent opportunities, we will not overpay. 
Before moving to José Manuel's section, let me please highlight in Slide #13 that today, we are presenting again a solid set of results. We are posting strong organic growth and progress on our additional value-enhancing initiatives. We are taking the first step to be come a European leader in the DAS and small cells sector. We are creating a European platform, executing value-accretive acquisitions that improve our business profile. We have a robust capital structure in place. Enough firepower is still available to continue growing while optimizing funding alternatives. We continue to pursue growth opportunities with discipline and with a selective M&A approach. We are successfully integrating our recent portfolios into Cellnex. And Cellnex is today recognized as the player best positioned to consolidate the European tower landscape.
Now please allow me to hand over to José Manuel Aisa, our CFO and M&A Director, who will go through our 2016 business and financial performance. So please, José Manuel."

As a reminder, please note that additional information can be obtained on the Investor Relations sections of our website, where there is a detailed expense [ph] file and should be also the annuals accounts of the compan",1269,"Thank you, Tobías. Good afternoon. As a reminder, please note that additional information can be obtained on the Investor Relations sections of our website, where there is a detailed expense [ph] file and should be also the annuals accounts of the company.
So if now we go to slide 15, you can see here the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated tenancy ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have managed to add more than 900 dynamic [ph] PoPs in the period, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.62, including M&A. 
Additionally, we are pursuing new organic growth opportunities in all business areas with a special mention to framework agreements with mobile operators, entering new markets, decommissioning and build-to-suit projects and other recent agreements with JCDecaux to strengthen our position in the small cells market. 
This balance sheet applies when opportunity arise in Spain and Italy for initial period of 18 months. In venue [ph] with current JCDecaux presence or when a new tender process is launched to manage advertising sites, and is based on a preferred partner approach, relying on JCDecaux's exiting capabilities and adding on top of that our own capabilities to increase the value position.
Moving to slide 16, you can see here the progress of our efficiency plan. As anticipated last year, the main contributor to this program is our site management project, with around 30% of the targeted savings already achieved. We have devoted CapEx of EUR 31 million between cash advance and land acquisition with paybacks of 5 years and average saving around lease, about 20%, with a resulting contract length beyond 15 years. We're also making good progress on our additional initiatives with around 50% of the targeted savings already achieved. Our ultimate objective for the efficiency plan will be for savings to offset higher future costs due to the pricing and increased operating activity so we can show a flat OpEx performance on a like-for-like basis going forward.
On the next slide, you can find a comprehensive explanation of our adjusted EBITDA evolution. You can see how the negative impact of the DTT simulcast in 2015 is more than offset by the switch-on of the new TV channels, together with organic growth contribution and change of perimeter, explaining the strong adjusted EBITDA increase in the year of 23%, in other words, EUR 290 million of adjusted EBITDA.
If we now focus on the adjusted EBITDA margin evolution on the next slide, operating leverage coming from organic growth increases our margin by 1%, broadcasting by an additional 2%. And if we adjust for pass-through costs and revenues, we end up with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 43%.
Slide 19. We will now focus on our capital allocation for the year. We have devoted 90% of our total investment to M&A with 8% allocated to expansion CapEx. We deploy organic growth CapEx with a strict return criteria of low teens unlevered IRR. And as you can see, the majority has been dedicated in 2016 to our efficiency plan.
Slide 20, regarding capital structure. Our debt maturities' profile as of February 2016 presents the first maturity -- or an average maturity of around 7 years, with no material refinancing required before 2022, and protection against potential interest rates hikes due to the fixed cost nature of our debt.
Slide 21. There, we provide an updated snapshot of our capital structure after our last bond issue in January. We have a long-term capital structure in place at attractive terms, with EUR 1.8 billion of liquidity between cash and available credit lines.
Let me now explain on slide 22, our recurring levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow in the period has been a strong 87%, with the total figure increasing 30% when compared to the recurrent levered free cash flow of 2015.
Looking now to revenues. The contribution from all the different businesses line increase with our very well-contained cost base, leading to an adjusted EBITDA growth of 23% when compared to last year. Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance of 3% of revenues. And our change in working capital is positive due to a one-off revenue collection measures, but expected to be neutral going forward, in line with our guidance. Interest rates reflects our capital structure as of December, with coupons already paid in Q3 and taxes reflecting the implementation of tax management measures. 
All-in-all, we are posting a 15% revenue growth, which implies almost doubling our recurrent levered free cash flow growth when compared to last year.
Moving now to our balance sheet on slide 23. Cellnex leverage for the period has reached 4.6x net debt annualized EBITDA after investing more than EUR 700 million in the year. Our balance sheet reflects the increase in fixed assets due to our recent acquisitions. Recurrent net profit, adjusted for one-off noncash task tax effect last year, increases 38%. And net interest increased mainly due to accrued cost in the year.
On shareholder remuneration, we will pay EUR 22 million in 2017, a 10% increase over the dividend paid in 2016.
Moving to M&A activity in 2015 -- '16, sorry. On slide 24, we explain what we believe is a new paradigm in the tower industry: our ability to create master service agreement with our clients from scratch, making sure these services will not be accounted for debt, as -- if it were accounted following IFRS 16. We offer a wide array of services beyond pure real estate in order to strengthen our long-term relationships with our clients.
Slide 25, you can see here how we think about cash flow generation from recent acquisitions. The cash conversion ratio from EBITDA into recurrent levered free cash flow is above 60%, and the new deals are expected to generate EUR 103 million on a pro forma full year basis, around 26% of the recurrent levered free cash flow generated in 2016. Please note that all these estimations, especially the recurrent levered free cash flow, is after considering financial expenses borne by Cellnex. 
And all this has been achieved with an efficiency -- efficient and flexible capital structure and by applying our strict investment criteria.
Moving to slide 26 in terms of financial outlook for 2017. We believe we can provide a recurrent levered free cash flow at least 10% higher than in 2016, in line with consensus. Looking at the different contribution lines, it is important to highlight that our adjusted EBITDA is expected to reach between EUR 330 million and EUR 340 million. Our CapEx guidance, both maintenance and expansion, remains unchanged. And dividend payable in 2017 will increase 10% compared to 2016. 
There are other things that belong to recurrent levered free cash flow, such as the working capital. That should tend to be neutral; also the interest expense paid. That should follow our coupons; and finally, the tax payment. That should be slightly below -- slightly above our payment in 2016.
Finally, knowing -- I think that is, what's next? We are focusing on several opportunities in Europe, both proprietary and auctions, while maintaining our strict investment discipline. 
The next section addresses several key topics that are very well covered in the slides. This is a new section that we have called ""Frequently Asked Questions."" But I think that these questions will come across in the -- in your Q&A session. 
So please allow [ph] -- please -- with this, we can start the Q&A session."

And both together, we believe we can add jointly a set of tools together that can speed up a little bit the deployment of this market. Our budget is not being influenced by this agreement so far. We need to see yet the go-to-market on the 2 countries where we are initially having these commercial agreement in both sides. And we intend to at least continue with the growth on DAS and the small cells. We categorize both product lines into a single one, which is what we call ""densification of macro sides into smaller sites."" And here, we can attack the market with 2 products: DAS, which is distributed antenna systems; or small cells. We've reached 13% growth during 2016 and we expect that we should be able, of course, to follow the same growth we've been achieving so far. And taking into account, there is on page 31, an assumption on how we understand the market will grow from 2018 onwards up to 2025, where the analysts are projecting a CAGR of roughly 20% per year.

This is Giles Thorne here from Jefferies. The first one was on Italy, and specifically, Fastweb has spoken about a small cell deployment in that country in the 3.5 gigahertz spectrum range that it had acquired with Tiscali last year. And now they've spoken about actually using a proprietary cabinet footprint in Italy for the small cell deployment. But it would be interesting to know if there will be any opportunity for Cellnex to support that. Or do you think Fastweb will rely solely on their own infrastructure? And the second question that kind of leads on from that. And the -- and it's also another question about the JCDecaux commercial alliance. Now small cell deployments comes with many challenges and not the least, getting access to the ground level street furniture. We've seen with Fastweb, they'll try and use their own cabinets. So when it comes to the JCDecaux commercial alliance, it seems like you've got a fantastic opportunity to get access to that ground infrastructure. Now it's just Spain, initially, at the moment, but should we expect to see the geographic scope of that commercial alliance expanded? And also, will that commercial alliance sit with the Commscon management team? And so a question there on JCDecaux. And then lastly, on the Bouygues deal, and you've touched on this already, but it does feel like a bellwether for European outsourcing. It's amongst a very few MNO sale and leaseback deals that haven't been driven by leverage pressures at the MNO. It'd be interesting to know how you found working with the Bouygues management team and compare that to other management teams at other MNOs. And also, any sense that there are discussions for expanding that agreement? Are you doing more sale and leasebacks in France?"

Also in Milano, we are using light poles to deploy small cells. To have the cabinets is, yes, another possibility, and I think is one of the new areas, as well as using advertising panels. And this is, let's say, how we see our agreement with JCDecaux, which is another potential real estate. Technically, there are certain characteristics that this Euro real estate must have, is that it has to have some height, cannot be just close to the floor. So you need ideally 3 meters, 4 meters height in order to do the small coverage that the small cell is supposed to do.

And therefore, it's very likely that the Hutchinson tender will be moving at some stage. So I was wondering, if have you seen any movements on that side. I've seen that the growth in Italy is relatively robust, especially when compared to Spain. And I was wondering who are the PoPs that actually are moving towards your towers? The third, it's a followup from a previous answer to JCDecaux again. I was talking about the fact that the budget for the JCDecaux has not been formulated or places have not been finalized.

So regarding your second question, which is about the expansion of CapEx. You are right. We have, I think we have been quite happy with this program. Most of the program, cash from renegotiation and cash advances done ground-lease acquisitions, okay. So this is something that is important to say. And very specially, when you say what's going on in those years, you can see that this EUR 57 million represents 7.5% of the total revenues, which is within our guidance between 5% and 10% of revenues diverted to expansion CapEx. I do think we will follow this guidance. So step-by-step, I think that we will be able to increase further the ground lease renegotiation program, which is very interesting. And finally, regarding your dividend statement, we -- let me say to you that this dividend -- this dividend suggestion, this dividend payment in 2017, '18, '19, it's a crystallization of our dividend policy. If you know that the 20% recurrent levered free cash flow had to be commensurate with also the growth of the company, the net income of the company.

I was just wondering whether you could confirm the sale process was conducted on an exclusive basis with Cellnex being the only bidder. And I was wondering whether you are confident that you can carry on doing this in future negotiations, essentially wondering why wouldn't an operator not choose to conduct discussions with multiple parties, including American Tower. And just on that, did that provide support for you pulling out of an FPS deal where otherwise you'd be bidding at quite an elevated multiple. And question 3, on your growth guidance. I guess there could be a material step change in growth in some of your geographies, particularly in Italy, if -- and depending on when the 4th operator chooses to build. Would you consider such growth to be incremental to your 3% to 4% guidance? And those are the questions."

Otherwise, you help me to remind because there has been quite a set of questions. Well, your first question was talking about Activa, [ph]no? And Activa [ph] since [ph] any other investment in the last case for Cellnex has to comply our strict M&A criteria. And this is very important. I mean, if not, I'm very sorry, we'll not be Activa or nothing else. Just to remind very quickly, our M&A criteria is low, double-digit in terms of equity IRR. Second, improvement of our cash flow visibility of business risk profile. And finally, the accretive impact on our recurrent free cash flow per share from year 2 onwards. So it's quite strict and this criteria and just to answer another question you were saying, regarding FPS, was your fourth question, I think. You said to ask that obviously, this opportunity did not meet our criteria. So I'm very sorry. All that will come could [ph] not [ph] happen [ph] our criteria. So when talking about American Tower, which is your third question, I think, American Tower has always been there. It's not the first time it has been in Europe. Back in 2011, it was competing with us with all those towers in -- with our first towers in Spain. So it has always been there. And our competitor advantage is not only debt from payment, it's as we said before in another question, another answer, is to be able to sit down with a client to build up a new MSA contract to understand their needs. That's really important. And your second question was about Bouygues -- Bouygues? The process was a competitive process. Of course, it was a competitive process. Maybe it was not in the press everyday, but it was competitive. And if we were able to win, it's because we were able to do a unique offer. And unique offer from many angles, not only the upfront payment, but also our capacity to understand their needs today and tomorrow. And in order to do so, you need credentials. You need industrial angle, you need partnership in the long term and this make us unique in comparison with others. And finally, you are talking about, I think it was growth and MNO. Unfortunately, [indiscernible] vocal. Should have an impact in 2018, not before. We have been consistent with this message. So -- and what the guidance represented to you is consistent."

So the service agreement that you have. Will Bouygues have to basically report it as part of a long-term lease in their net debt definition? Or does it stay out of the net debt with IFRS '16 new rules? The second question is on the cross-border synergies. I mean, traditionally other tower companies have always stated there are no synergies. I see you have a slide in your presentation making the case for it. If you can probably a bit elaborate on your views on that, I think you are in better position than others in Europe to comment on that? And thirdly, just to go back on the dividend guidance and the dividend outlook. So if I understand well, your numbers, effectively, we are talking about EUR 0.091 of DPS in 2016, which can become EUR 0.10 in 2017. Now consensus on Bloomberg for '17 is about EUR 0.21.

But this is the treatment -- the accountancy treatment depends on the different parties. Regarding the cross-border synergies on page 34, the only intention of Page 34 is to tell you that when talking about cross borders, you have to look at the countries, yes, so the clients.

Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones of the period on Slide 4. We have again posted a solid set of results based on the following pillars: We continued to generate a strong organic growth, in line with our guidance; we are improving the visibility on our future organic growth by reaching 2 strategic agreements. First of all, we have signed our frame goal agreement with the fourth mobile operator in Italy, allowing them for fully flexibility on their future network deployment. And second, we have reached a new agreement for the commission of further 400 sites. 
We are reaffirming our 2017 guidance, and I would like to highlight our very high conversion ratio even without great status. That is the highest in the sector. 
We continue to successful -- to successfully tap the credit markets by issuing long terms instruments and very attractive terms. And last but not least, we continue to lead a unique value proposition in the European tower sector based on tailored MSAs, neutrality, long-term approach and a strong relationship with our customers.
On Slide 5, you can see the strong performance of our key value metrics, with adjusted EBITDA growing annually at around 30% and recurring lever free cash flow per share growing at around 10% over the last 2 years.
Moving to Slide 6. Total PoPs have increased by 20%, and our consolidated cash [indiscernible] ratio by 6%. This includes both the contribution of organic growth and the change of perimeter in the period. If we look at organic growth only, new PoPs have increased by 5%, so we are in line with our medium-term organic growth guidance, showing the strength of our current operations. Additionally, DAS nodes have increased 6% in the quarter, and we are working hard to make this new activity a significant contributor to Cellnex revenues going forward.
In terms of organic growth drivers, you can see on Slide 7 our view for our new organic PoPs as well as the progress of our decommissioning and build-to-suit program. New PoPs for multi-tenancy are expected to be generated at a rate in line with our guidance. And these quarterly results confirm this trend.
Our decommissioning program now shows a 45% progress. Thanks to the recent agreement reached to dismantle 400 additional sites. Thus, providing us with even more visibility on our future organic growth.
Progress on our B2C program includes our recent agreement with Bouygues Telecom in France, and we are really taking the first steps in close coordination with our customer.
Before moving to Slide 9 and as a reminder, please note that additional financial information can be obtained from the Investor Relations section of our website where a detailed Excel file is available.
You can see on this slide the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated tenancy ratio, which increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of [ pay meta ]. As you can see, we have managed to add 1,000 organic PoPs [ year ] on a year-by-year basis, with 289 being generated this quarter only. Reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.63, a change of perimeter included.
Also, we are pushing new organic growth opportunities in all businesses. With a special mention to the framework agreement we have recently signed with the fourth mobile operator in Italy, which will provide them with full flexibility for their network employment in the country.
We are so proud to announce a new project for decommissioning of 400 third-party towers. We continue to foresee commercial opportunities in the DAS small cell [indiscernible] and sign a new contract with these systems for the provision of plant support for Inmarsat on board communications solution. 
Last but not least, I would like to remind you that Cellnex expects no impact from the second digital dividend. That DTT spectrum is secured and list until 2030, and that we also expect to benefit from new mobile communication services deployed as a result of more spectrum available to operators.
On the next slide, you can find a comprehensive explanation of our adjusted EBITDA evolution.
You can see how the positive impact of the sweet charm of the new TV channel last year is reinforced by organic growth contribution and change of perimeter, explaining the strong adjusted EBITDA increase in the period of 33%.
Moving to our capital structure, on Slide 11, you can see our debt maturities profile as of April with an average maturity of around 6.5 years. No material for financial required prior to 2022 and a strong protection against potential interest rate increase as a result of the fixed cost nature of our debt.
All in all, we have a long-term capital structure in place at attractive terms with 2 billion of liquidity between cash and available credit lines, providing us with full flexibility to optimize available funding alternatives.
Let me please now explain on Slide 12 our recent lever free cash flow generation in the period.
I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring lever free cash flow in the period has been a strong 84%. 
Looking out to revenues. The contribution from Telecom Infrastructure Services and broadcasting increased. We have very well contained cost base, leading to an adjusted EBITDA growth of 33% when compared to last year.
Maintenance CapEx, this is slightly below our guidance due to the facing. Our change in working capital is turning to neutral. Interest paid reflect our capital structure as of March and its associated coupons. Why will stacks are view later in the year. All in all, we are sowing today a 15% revenue growth, which implies more than doubling our adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to last year.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 23. Cellnex leverage for the period has reached 4.3x net debt annualized EBITDA after investing more than EUR 700 million in the previous months. Compared to December 2016, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and its associated cash inflow in the period.
Moving to Slide 14 and as a summary, let me please highlight that. Today, we are presenting again a solid set of results. We are posting a strong and consistent organic growth coupled with our progress on our additional value-creation initiatives such as the framework agreement with the fourth mobile operator in Italy and a new decommissioning project. And finally, we are reiterating our guidance for the full year 2017.
The next section address several key topics that I believe are self explanatory, but I am more than happy to answer any questions you may have. So let's please start the Q&A session."

And on top of that, 2 private placements and I think that also 10 and 9 years. So the thing is that the market, the debt market is giving us without the door open. Our backlog is huge. We're talking about more than EUR 12 billion of backlog. This is recognized by both investors, and I think that the reason why caused the flexibility to fund acquisitions with debt. Also bear in mind something when you have EUR 2 billion of available debt, it's because the perception of the debt community [indiscernible] and bankholders is positive, otherwise, we wouldn't have this money. And so this is not only my perception of flexibility. It's also the perception of the market regarding the next.

On top of the time frame, if you can just elaborate a bit of economics of decommission and contract. Basically, the cost of the commissions, I believe, is on your side rather than the client side. And if that's the case, what's the breakeven on this contract given the contracts? I don't know if you already signed the full contract or you're just the framework agreement. Just understand when you're going to break even and the sort of return investments you have on this contract you signed in. The second one is on the [indiscernible] side. You signed the contract for in February for delivery -- over delivery -- for basically 1,800 towers that will be only gradually given to you. So just want to -- you said at that time, I remember you mentioned around 2 years. So given now that you've got a bit months, if you have a bit more kind of clarity on when these towers will come, will about will be this year, will be next year? And if the payments are done, [indiscernible] towers comes in or are pain advance. And the third is on tax. You basically mentioned in the presentations and in doing the call about the high conversion rates and then you compare yourself to a number of towers -- tower close in Europe. Most of them are in Italy. Now given your significant exposure to the market and given the fact that the table you show in your presentations so the tenant TowerCo's pay in excess of 10% of the EBITDA while yours at the group level is around only 2%. So my question is how long your 2% is specifically going to stay at this level? And what sort of framework you believe that now that you expand into new markets with that 2% remain as such. Would you basically believe that the tax rate could increase or decrease from here?"

This is the very last one, and I will the other ones. So the tax, and I remember, Octavio, this question from you at the moment of the IPO.

So the tax, and I remember, Octavio, this question from you at the moment of the IPO. And we have been working on stand as you can see being very consistent with this trend. So we are working on that. We have several things, several measures that have been implemented which are very basic one. I don't think this is elaborating these change things. [indiscernible] what's like the amortization depreciation policy. So assessing detail every single CapEx we invest how can we depreciate it according to the law and to make sense. Second, our structure you know that we place our debt in the most, I will say to you, in the most advantaged place so that we make sense when doing old investments would carry out. Third, we'll have also comment that we have a pat and box mechanism. Cellnex is a company that generates no help and is know how we set of contracts, which are fully compliant with the Europenan directories and allow us to show how to take advantage of the regulation in European countries for companies that foster research and development. Also you know that in some specific countries, we are taking into account the national interest reduction and also it's helping us. So it's not only 1 measure. It's several things that, put it together, allow us to take advantage, allow us to comply with the law and to pay what we have to pay. Nothing there, nothing more, nothing less. How long, what -- how long is the same for everything? How long interest rates are going to be like that? How long the organic growth is going to be there? How long our base case scenario is that this policies, this different measure were implemented are long-term issues. I think that this is not something that we take very seriously and always compliance. So and therefore, when you are compliance, you don't have to be worried about how long. There is another angle you were seeing in your second question was about [indiscernible]. You are right then. We communicate to the market I believe this was going to be executed throughout the next quarters. It's not going to be executed in 1 day. And why? Because this is the acquisition of assets. It's not the acquisition of shares. If we were talking about acquisition of shares, we would have [indiscernible] the money and may be we would be having the EBITDA coming into the company but also maybe we were begging more taxes, no? And but to the previous question, the previous answer. So eventually, what we have done is an asset deal. This takes time because we have -- we need a waiver of the landlord. We need to call [indiscernible] with a client. It is my feeling that we will obtain the results that we gave you at the full year 2016 presentation when we gave you the outlook, so limited impact in 2017. We will communicate you quarter by quarter how much we pay and how many towers we receive. Finally, regarding the economics. Again, the same economics we talk in the IPO. So at the moment, we were saying that roughly speaking in general. And when we signed that contract like this contract has been signed is we invest, let's say EUR 24,000, EUR 25,000, EUR 30,000 per the commission side and then we have a payback that is fully compliant with our golden rules for unlevered projects that you know perfectly how these -- the rules are. So we feel comfortable the breakeven, and I think that it takes in terms of payback, I cannot be very explicit but this playback is a good payback, yes."

The first question, yes, this is for operator release. We have signed our framework agreement. This framework agree give us the flexibility end of it gives and the flexibility to choose our sites with that parameters fully defined and that are coherent with both sites. This is a very important framework agreement for us that situates position Cellnex as a key player in the Italian market; as an independent coworker, which in our view is essential; and also give us further opportunities. And this is that first movement in what we can see more movements in the organic growth and the subsequent organic growth. It is not only about it's also about engineering services, it's about this -- you cannot see this like framework agreement for PoPs, a framework agreement for service for entrance in a new country. That is the case. We are quite prudent in terms what you're asking when, and we are back to the same answer we gave to you before. We do not see this having an impact in 2017. We are thinking that we will have some impact in [ 2019 ]. And I'm pretty sure that later in the year, we will update with our views on the outlook of 2019. At that time, we will be more, I'd say, more open. So far, I think it's a fairly good step. And I would say extremely good step and a very good erection and position Cellnex where we want to be as a key independent power co, delivering value for our shareholders and also respecting the path of our client. [indiscernible] M&A deals. Well, we have said before we are quite active looking for opportunities that are compliant with our M&A golden rules. This M&A golden rules are quite clear and are quite demanding. So we guess we're involved in different opportunities, and we are making progress. If finally, we are successful or not is something that takes time to know. However, I just think that in all the place that we are right now projects in which Cellnex can implement its know-how, in which Cellnex shows the competitive advantage faced in our master service agreement, the competitive advantage in the level of service that we provide our clients in -- in their very full term and also the creative solutions that we can bring into the table.

So here, we have said are things we have M&A, some M&A costs that we have include because of the weak deal. So when we execute an M&A deal, there are some costs that should be when you project, yes, we have some costs but at the same time, we should have some EBITDA. You shouldn't forget this because if you forget these costs, you [indiscernible] more M&A in your projections. Then you have some non-cash items that are the rest of them. And these non-cash items are provisions that we execute in order to renegotiate some contracts in the future. So according to IFRS when we negotiate some contracts we have to recognize a provision and in the future, you will see the cash flows and the adjustments in the VTA. So these are one-offs that are not the current and we don't see the makes sense.

We have again posted a solid set of results based on the following pillars. We'll continue to generate a strong organic growth in line with our guidance. We are improving the visibility on our future organic growth by reaching 2 strategic agreements. First of all, we have signed a framework agreement with the fourth mobile operator in Italy, allowing them for fully flexibility on their future network deployment. And second, we have reached a new agreement for the commission of further 400 sites. 
We are reaffirming our 2017 guidance, and I would like to highlight our very high conversion ratio even without great status that is the highest in the sector. We continue to successful -- to successfully tap the credit markets by issuing long-terms instruments at very attractive terms. And last but not least, we continue to lead a unique value proposition in the European tower sector based on tailored MSAs, neutrality, long-term approach and a strong relationship with our customers.
On Slide 5, you can see the strong performance of our key value metrics, with adjusted EBITDA growing annually at around 30% and recurring levered free cash flow per share growing at around 10% over the last 2 years.
Moving to Slide 6. Total PoPs have increased by 20%, and our consolidated customer ratio by 6%. This includes both the contribution of organic growth and the change of perimeter in the period. If we look at organic growth only, new PoPs have increased by 5%, so we're in line with our medium-term organic growth guidance, showing the strength of our current operations. Additionally, DAS nodes have increased 6% in the quarter, and we are working hard to make this new activity a significant contributor to Cellnex revenues going forward.
In terms of organic growth drivers, you can see on Slide 7 our view for our new organic PoPs as well as the progress of our decommissioning and build-to-suit program. New PoPs from multi-tenancy are expected to be generated at a rate in line with our guidance, and these quarterly results confirm this trend.
Our decommissioning program now shows a 45% progress thanks to the recent agreement reached to dismantle 400 additional sites, thus providing us with even more visibility on our future organic growth. Progress on our build-to-suit program includes our recent agreement with Bouygues Telecom in France, and we are already taking the first steps in close coordination with our customer.
Before moving to Slide 9 and as a reminder, please note that additional financial information can be obtained from the Investor Relations section of our website, where a detailed Excel file is available.
You can see on this slide the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated tenancy ratio, which increase is mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. As you can see, we have managed to add 1,000 organic PoPs here on a year-by-year basis, with 289 being generated this quarter only, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.63 if change of perimeter is included.
Also, we are pursuing new organic growth opportunities in all businesses areas, with a special mention to the framework agreement we have recently signed with the fourth mobile operator in Italy which will provide them with full flexibility for their network deployment in the country.
We are also proud to announce a new project for decommissioning of 400 third-party towers. We continue to pursue commercial opportunities in the DAS small cells area, and signed a new contract with T-systems for the provision of land support for Inmarsat on-board communications solution. 
Last but not least, I would like to remind you that Cellnex expects no impact from the second digital dividend, that DTT spectrum is secured and list until 2030, and that we also expect to benefit from new mobile communication services deployed as a result of more spectrum available to operators on 5G.
On the next slide, you can find a comprehensive explanation of our adjusted EBITDA evolution. You can see how the positive impact of the switch on of the new TV channel last year is reinforced by organic growth contribution and change of perimeter, explaining the strong adjusted EBITDA increase in the period of 33%.
Moving to our capital structure on Slide 11. You can see our debt maturities profile as of April with an average maturity of around 6.5 years, no material refinancing required prior to 2022 and a strong protection against potential interest rate increase as a result of the fixed cost nature of our debt. All in all, we have a long-term capital structure in place at attractive terms with EUR 2 billion of liquidity between cash and available credit lines, providing us with full flexibility to optimize available funding alternatives.
Let me please now explain on Slide 12 our recent levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow in the period has been a strong 84%. 
Looking now to revenues. The contribution from Telecom Infrastructure Services and broadcasting increased, with a very well contained cost base, leading to an adjusted EBITDA growth of 33% when compared to last year.
Maintenance CapEx is slightly below our guidance due to the phasing. Our change in working capital is trending to neutral. Interest rate reflect our capital structure as of March and its associated coupons, why -- which tax are due later in the year. All in all, we are showing today a 15% revenue growth, which implies more than doubling our adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to last year.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 23. Cellnex leverage for the period has reached 4.3x net debt/annualized EBITDA after investing more than EUR 700 million in the previous months. Compared to December 2016, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and its associated cash inflow in the period.
Moving to Slide 14 and as a summary, let me please highlight that. Today, we are presenting again a solid set of results. We are posting a strong and consistent organic growth coupled with our progress on our additional value-creation initiatives, such as the framework agreement with the fourth mobile operator in Italy and a new decommissioning project. And finally, we are reiterating our guidance for the full year 2017.
The next section address several key topics that I believe are self explanatory, but I am more than happy to answer any questions you may have. So let's please start the Q&A session."

So regarding the financial flexibility, as you can see, we do have right now EUR 2 billion in cash and available credit lines. These credit lines are long term, so between 3 and 5 years. And also, you know that we have tapped the debt market, the bond market, with bond market issuance of 10 years. And on top of that, 2 private placements at -- I think at also 10 and 9 years. So the thing is that the market, the debt market, is giving us -- we have the door open. Our backlog is huge. We're talking about more than EUR 12 billion of backlog. This is recognized by bond investors, and I think that the reason why Cellnex has the flexibility to fund acquisitions with debt. Also bear in mind something, when you have EUR 2 billion of available debt, it's because the perception of the debt community, banks and bankholders, is positive. Otherwise, we wouldn't have this money. And so is it not only my perception of flexibility, it's also the perception of the market regarding Cellnex. Also, as we were seeing in the last -- in the full year results, Cellnex delevered very quickly. And we estimate that at least 0.6x in terms of net debt/EBITDA should decrease Cellnex in 1 year. So this will give us headroom to grow, headroom to fund our debts. You have -- You're second question was CommsCon. And as you know, CommsCon, we -- it's a great opportunity for us. It's opening -- we are opening up the -- not only land market in which CommsCon was already, but also the Spanish market. We have been building up alliance, as you were suggesting before. And you have here the results, I mean, with a strong growth that we hope in the future can go on. We are very active in our core markets, very active with CommsCom, and the results is step-by-step and recognized by clients not only because of the economics of the transaction that we do think makes sense for both sides, but also for the very good quality that we are delivering to clients.

On top of the time frame, if you can just elaborate a bit of the economics of this decommission contract. Basically, the cost of decommissions, I believe, is on your side rather than the client side. And if that's the case, what's the breakeven on this contract, given the contracts? I don't know if you already signed the full contract or just the framework agreement. Just understand when you're going to break even and what sort of return on investments you have on this contract you signing. The second one, it's on the Bouygues side. You signed a contract for -- in February for delivery -- or, delivery, sorry -- for basically 1,800 towers that will be only gradually given to you. So just want to -- you said at that time, I remember you mentioned around 2 years. So given now that you've got a bit more months, if you have a bit more kind of clarity on when these towers will come in. Will the bulk, will be this year? Will be next year? And if the payments are done, that simultaneous when the towers comes in? Or they're paid in advance. And the third, it's on tax. You basically mentioned in the presentations and during the call about the high conversion rates, and then you compare yourself to a number of towers -- TowerCos in Europe, most of them are in Italy. Now given your significant exposure to the market and given the fact that, at least the table you show in your presentations, saying that most of the Italian TowerCos pay in excess of 10% of the EBITDA while yours at the group level is around only 2%. So my question is how long your 2%, it's specifically going to stay at this level? And what sort of framework you believe -- now that you expand into new markets, will that 2% remain as such? So you basically believe that the tax rate could increase or decrease from here?"

And we have been working on tax since then, and as you can see,",647,"Thank you, Ottavio, for the question. Let's just start by the last one, and I will go to the other ones. So the tax, and I remember, Ottavio, this question from you at the moment of the IPO. And we have been working on tax since then, and as you can see, being very consistent with this trend. So we are working on that. We have several things that are being -- several measures that are being implemented which are very basic ones. I don't think this is elaborating strange things, it's just very basic, almost like the amortization, depreciation policy. So assessing in detail every single CapEx we invest, how can be depreciated according to the law and to make sense. Second, our structure, you know that we place our debt in the most -- I will say to you, in the most advantaged place so that we make sense when doing all the investments we carry out. Third, we'll have also comment that we have a patent box mechanism. Cellnex is a company that generates know how. And this know how, we set up contracts which are fully compliant with the European directives and allow us to somehow take advantage of the regulation in European countries for companies that foster research and development. Also you know that in some specific countries, we are taking into account the national interest reduction, and also, it's helping us. So it's not only one measure, it's several things that, put it together, allow us to take advantage, allow us to comply with the law and to pay what we have to pay. Nothing more, nothing less. How long? Well, if -- how long? Is the same for everything. It's how long interest rates are going to be like that? How long the organic growth is going to be there? How long -- our base case scenario is that these policies, these different measure we're implementing are long-term measures. I think that this is not something that we take very seriously and always compliance. So -- and therefore, when you are compliance, you don't have to be worried about how long. There is another angle you were saying. Your second question was about Bouygues deal. You are right, we communicate to the market the Bouygues deal was going to be executed throughout the next quarters. It's not going to be executed in 1 day. And why? Because this is the acquisition of assets, it's not the acquisition of shares. If we were talking about acquisition of shares, we would have half pay up on all the money and maybe we would be having EBITDA coming into the company. But also, maybe we were paying more taxes, no? Back to the previous question, the previous answer. So eventually, what we have done is an asset deal. This takes time because we have -- we need a waiver of the landlord, we need to coordinate with a client. It is my feeling that we will obtain the results that we gave you at the full year 2016 presentation, when we gave you the outlook. So limited impact in 2017. We will communicate you up quarter-by-quarter how much we pay, how many towers we receive. Finally, regarding the economics. Again, are the same economics we talk in the IPO. So at the moment, we were saying that roughly speaking in general. And when we sign a contract like this contract that has been signed, is we invest, let's say, EUR 24,000, EUR 25,000, EUR 30,000 per decommission side, and then we have a payback that is fully compliant with our M&A golden rules for unlevered projects, that you know perfectly how these rules are. So we feel comfortable, the breakeven. I think that it takes -- in terms of payback, I cannot be very specific, but this playback is a good payback, yes."

The first question, yes, well, this is for operator release. We have signed a framework agreement. This framework agreement give us the flexibility, given the flexibility to choose our sites with parameters that are fully defined and that are coherent with both sides. This is a very important framework agreement for us that situates, positions Cellnex as a key player in the Italian market, as an independent TowerCo, which in our view, is essential; and also give us further opportunities. And this is a first movement in -- what we can see more movements in the organic growth, in the subsequent organic growth. It is not only about PoPs, it's also about engineering services, it's about this -- you cannot see this, like, framework agreement for a PoP, it's a framework agreement for general service for entrance in a new country. That is the case. We are quite prudent in terms you're asking when, and we are back to the same answer we gave to you before. We do not see this having an impact in 2019. We are thinking that we will have some impact in 2018. And I'm pretty sure that later into the year, we will update with our views on the outlook of 2018. And at that time, we will be more -- let's say, more open. So far, I think it's a fairly good step. I would say extremely good step in the very good direction and position Cellnex where we want to be as a key independent TowerCo, delivering value for our shareholders and also respecting the path of our clients. You were just -- M&A deals. Well, we have said before we are quite active looking for opportunities that are compliant with our M&A golden rules. This M&A golden rules are quite clear and are quite demanding. So yes, we are involved in different opportunities and we are making progress. If finally, we are successful or not is something that takes time to know. However, I do think that in all the projects that we are right now involved are projects in which Cellnex can implement its know how, in which Cellnex shows the competitive advantage base in a master service agreement, the competitive advantage in the level of service that we provide our clients in our -- in the very full term, and also -- term, and also the creative solutions that we can bring into the table.

But you can say it is already contractualized, fully contractualized everything. This is another step in the good direction, okay? So step-by-step, you will see how this evolves. Regarding network service and others, and I think that this is the -- this is the communication we have, we're obviously being very clear. Network services and others is, again, one business line that should grow following inflation. Maybe if you compare quarter-by-quarter, you can see, it goes down a little bit, it goes up a little bit. So if you do not look at the quarter but you look at the [indiscernible] trends and your projections, inflation is a good driver. It's pacing up to broadcasting. So stable and have the same path. And finally, the non-recurrent. Non-recurrent -- and we have been, also here, it seems that some items that we seen are not going to be repeated. For instance -- or maybe are non-cash items that do not add anything to the recurrent EBIT -- free cash flow. So here, we have several things. We have M&A, some M&A costs that we have include because of the Bouygues deal. So when we execute M&A deal, there are some costs. That should be when you project, yes, we have some cost. But at the same time, we should have some EBITDA. You shouldn't project these because if you forget these costs, you project more M&A in your projections. Then you have some non-cash items that are the rest of them. And these non-cash items are provisions that we execute in order to renegotiate some contracts in the future. So according to IFRS, when we renegotiate some contracts, we have to recognize a provision. And in the future, you will see the cash flows and the adjustments in the VTA. So this is -- these are one-offs that are not recurrent and we don't think makes sense. In any case, Pedro, and also for the rest of the audience, on the Excel sheet provided, you can find a full breakdown of these elements, of both the M&A expenses which are cash; and then the EUR 6 million, the balance, EUR 6 million, which is our non-cash items.

So as you can see here in the slide, what we implement is a project financing at local level, it is nonrecourse. So we'll go to banks.

So how much debt a bank or a pool of banks can give to that project, taking into account the MSA, the OpEx and CapEx, and, taking into account some rational organic growth that we think we can consider. We do not take into account [ signal years ]. And also taking into account the tax that have to be paid in the country and also the working capital, and that this MSA and OpEx suppliers require. So the thing is that the banks taking into account on these give us a quantum of debt; give us the maturity of this debt; the spread of this debt; covenants, if any; and a full look. So essentially, this is how we estimate -- how we estimate the IRRs. So it's fully compliant with any single project in the different countries as any infrastructure player will do."

We'll continue to generate a strong or",1116,"Good morning, and thank you so much for your time today. Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones of the period on Slide 4. 
We have again posted a solid set of results based on the following pillars. We'll continue to generate a strong organic growth in line with our guidance. We are improving the visibility on our future organic growth by reaching 2 strategic agreements. First of all, we have signed a framework agreement with the fourth mobile operator in Italy, allowing them for fully flexibility on their future network deployment. And second, we have reached a new agreement for the commission of further 400 sites. 
We are reaffirming our 2017 guidance, and I would like to highlight our very high conversion ratio even without great status that is the highest in the sector. We continue to successful -- to successfully tap the credit markets by issuing long-terms instruments at very attractive terms. And last but not least, we continue to lead a unique value proposition in the European tower sector based on tailored MSAs, neutrality, long-term approach and a strong relationship with our customers.
On Slide 5, you can see the strong performance of our key value metrics, with adjusted EBITDA growing annually at around 30% and recurring levered free cash flow per share growing at around 10% over the last 2 years.
Moving to Slide 6. Total PoPs have increased by 20%, and our consolidated customer ratio by 6%. This includes both the contribution of organic growth and the change of perimeter in the period. If we look at organic growth only, new PoPs have increased by 5%, so we're in line with our medium-term organic growth guidance, showing the strength of our current operations. Additionally, DAS nodes have increased 6% in the quarter, and we are working hard to make this new activity a significant contributor to Cellnex revenues going forward.
In terms of organic growth drivers, you can see on Slide 7 our view for our new organic PoPs as well as the progress of our decommissioning and build-to-suit program. New PoPs from multi-tenancy are expected to be generated at a rate in line with our guidance, and these quarterly results confirm this trend.
Our decommissioning program now shows a 45% progress thanks to the recent agreement reached to dismantle 400 additional sites, thus providing us with even more visibility on our future organic growth. Progress on our build-to-suit program includes our recent agreement with Bouygues Telecom in France, and we are already taking the first steps in close coordination with our customer.
Before moving to Slide 9 and as a reminder, please note that additional financial information can be obtained from the Investor Relations section of our website, where a detailed Excel file is available.
You can see on this slide the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated tenancy ratio, which increase is mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. As you can see, we have managed to add 1,000 organic PoPs here on a year-by-year basis, with 289 being generated this quarter only, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.63 if change of perimeter is included.
Also, we are pursuing new organic growth opportunities in all businesses areas, with a special mention to the framework agreement we have recently signed with the fourth mobile operator in Italy which will provide them with full flexibility for their network deployment in the country.
We are also proud to announce a new project for decommissioning of 400 third-party towers. We continue to pursue commercial opportunities in the DAS small cells area, and signed a new contract with T-systems for the provision of land support for Inmarsat on-board communications solution. 
Last but not least, I would like to remind you that Cellnex expects no impact from the second digital dividend, that DTT spectrum is secured and list until 2030, and that we also expect to benefit from new mobile communication services deployed as a result of more spectrum available to operators on 5G.
On the next slide, you can find a comprehensive explanation of our adjusted EBITDA evolution. You can see how the positive impact of the switch on of the new TV channel last year is reinforced by organic growth contribution and change of perimeter, explaining the strong adjusted EBITDA increase in the period of 33%.
Moving to our capital structure on Slide 11. You can see our debt maturities profile as of April with an average maturity of around 6.5 years, no material refinancing required prior to 2022 and a strong protection against potential interest rate increase as a result of the fixed cost nature of our debt. All in all, we have a long-term capital structure in place at attractive terms with EUR 2 billion of liquidity between cash and available credit lines, providing us with full flexibility to optimize available funding alternatives.
Let me please now explain on Slide 12 our recent levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow in the period has been a strong 84%. 
Looking now to revenues. The contribution from Telecom Infrastructure Services and broadcasting increased, with a very well contained cost base, leading to an adjusted EBITDA growth of 33% when compared to last year.
Maintenance CapEx is slightly below our guidance due to the phasing. Our change in working capital is trending to neutral. Interest rate reflect our capital structure as of March and its associated coupons, why -- which tax are due later in the year. All in all, we are showing today a 15% revenue growth, which implies more than doubling our adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to last year.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 23. Cellnex leverage for the period has reached 4.3x net debt/annualized EBITDA after investing more than EUR 700 million in the previous months. Compared to December 2016, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and its associated cash inflow in the period.
Moving to Slide 14 and as a summary, let me please highlight that. Today, we are presenting again a solid set of results. We are posting a strong and consistent organic growth coupled with our progress on our additional value-creation initiatives, such as the framework agreement with the fourth mobile operator in Italy and a new decommissioning project. And finally, we are reiterating our guidance for the full year 2017.
The next section address several key topics that I believe are self explanatory, but I am more than happy to answer any questions you may have. So let's please start the Q&A session."

So regarding the financial flexibility, as you can see, we do have right now EUR 2 billion in cash and available credit lines. These credit lines are long term, so between 3 and 5 years. And also, you know that we have tapped the debt market, the bond market, with bond market issuance of 10 years. And on top of that, 2 private placements at -- I think at also 10 and 9 years. So the thing is that the market, the debt market, is giving us -- we have the door open. Our backlog is huge. We're talking about more than EUR 12 billion of backlog. This is recognized by bond investors, and I think that the reason why Cellnex has the flexibility to fund acquisitions with debt. Also bear in mind something, when you have EUR 2 billion of available debt, it's because the perception of the debt community, banks and bankholders, is positive. Otherwise, we wouldn't have this money. And so is it not only my perception of flexibility, it's also the perception of the market regarding Cellnex. Also, as we were seeing in the last -- in the full year results, Cellnex delevered very quickly. And we estimate that at least 0.6x in terms of net debt/EBITDA should decrease Cellnex in 1 year. So this will give us headroom to grow, headroom to fund our debts. You have -- You're second question was CommsCon. And as you know, CommsCon, we -- it's a great opportunity for us. It's opening -- we are opening up the -- not only land market in which CommsCon was already, but also the Spanish market. We have been building up alliance, as you were suggesting before. And you have here the results, I mean, with a strong growth that we hope in the future can go on. We are very active in our core markets, very active with CommsCom, and the results is step-by-step and recognized by clients not only because of the economics of the transaction that we do think makes sense for both sides, but also for the very good quality that we are delivering to clients. It's not only a question of economics, it's also a question of credibility of credentials. And I think CommsCom is building up these credentials and this is being recognized. And I think, Juan Jose, you can explain better than me the second -- the third question."

On top of the time frame, if you can just elaborate a bit of the economics of this decommission contract. Basically, the cost of decommissions, I believe, is on your side rather than the client side. And if that's the case, what's the breakeven on this contract, given the contracts? I don't know if you already signed the full contract or just the framework agreement. Just understand when you're going to break even and what sort of return on investments you have on this contract you signing. The second one, it's on the Bouygues side. You signed a contract for -- in February for delivery -- or, delivery, sorry -- for basically 1,800 towers that will be only gradually given to you. So just want to -- you said at that time, I remember you mentioned around 2 years. So given now that you've got a bit more months, if you have a bit more kind of clarity on when these towers will come in. Will the bulk, will be this year? Will be next year? And if the payments are done, that simultaneous when the towers comes in? Or they're paid in advance. And the third, it's on tax. You basically mentioned in the presentations and during the call about the high conversion rates, and then you compare yourself to a number of towers -- TowerCos in Europe, most of them are in Italy. Now given your significant exposure to the market and given the fact that, at least the table you show in your presentations, saying that most of the Italian TowerCos pay in excess of 10% of the EBITDA while yours at the group level is around only 2%. So my question is how long your 2%, it's specifically going to stay at this level? And what sort of framework you believe -- now that you expand into new markets, will that 2% remain as such? So you basically believe that the tax rate could increase or decrease from here?"

Let's just start by the last one, and I will go to the other ones. So the tax, and I remember, Ottavio, this question from you at the moment of the IPO. And we have been working on tax since then, and as you can see,",647,"Thank you, Ottavio, for the question. Let's just start by the last one, and I will go to the other ones. So the tax, and I remember, Ottavio, this question from you at the moment of the IPO. And we have been working on tax since then, and as you can see, being very consistent with this trend. So we are working on that. We have several things that are being -- several measures that are being implemented which are very basic ones. I don't think this is elaborating strange things, it's just very basic, almost like the amortization, depreciation policy. So assessing in detail every single CapEx we invest, how can be depreciated according to the law and to make sense. Second, our structure, you know that we place our debt in the most -- I will say to you, in the most advantaged place so that we make sense when doing all the investments we carry out. Third, we'll have also comment that we have a patent box mechanism. Cellnex is a company that generates know how. And this know how, we set up contracts which are fully compliant with the European directives and allow us to somehow take advantage of the regulation in European countries for companies that foster research and development. Also you know that in some specific countries, we are taking into account the national interest reduction, and also, it's helping us. So it's not only one measure, it's several things that, put it together, allow us to take advantage, allow us to comply with the law and to pay what we have to pay. Nothing more, nothing less. How long? Well, if -- how long? Is the same for everything. It's how long interest rates are going to be like that? How long the organic growth is going to be there? How long -- our base case scenario is that these policies, these different measure we're implementing are long-term measures. I think that this is not something that we take very seriously and always compliance. So -- and therefore, when you are compliance, you don't have to be worried about how long. There is another angle you were saying. Your second question was about Bouygues deal. You are right, we communicate to the market the Bouygues deal was going to be executed throughout the next quarters. It's not going to be executed in 1 day. And why? Because this is the acquisition of assets, it's not the acquisition of shares. If we were talking about acquisition of shares, we would have half pay up on all the money and maybe we would be having EBITDA coming into the company. But also, maybe we were paying more taxes, no? Back to the previous question, the previous answer. So eventually, what we have done is an asset deal. This takes time because we have -- we need a waiver of the landlord, we need to coordinate with a client. It is my feeling that we will obtain the results that we gave you at the full year 2016 presentation, when we gave you the outlook. So limited impact in 2017. We will communicate you up quarter-by-quarter how much we pay, how many towers we receive. Finally, regarding the economics. Again, are the same economics we talk in the IPO. So at the moment, we were saying that roughly speaking in general. And when we sign a contract like this contract that has been signed, is we invest, let's say, EUR 24,000, EUR 25,000, EUR 30,000 per decommission side, and then we have a payback that is fully compliant with our M&A golden rules for unlevered projects, that you know perfectly how these rules are. So we feel comfortable, the breakeven. I think that it takes -- in terms of payback, I cannot be very specific, but this playback is a good payback, yes."

The first question, yes, well, this is for operator release. We have signed a framework agreement. This framework agreement give us the flexibility, given the flexibility to choose our sites with parameters that are fully defined and that are coherent with both sides. This is a very important framework agreement for us that situates, positions Cellnex as a key player in the Italian market, as an independent TowerCo, which in our view, is essential; and also give us further opportunities. And this is a first movement in -- what we can see more movements in the organic growth, in the subsequent organic growth. It is not only about PoPs, it's also about engineering services, it's about this -- you cannot see this, like, framework agreement for a PoP, it's a framework agreement for general service for entrance in a new country. That is the case. We are quite prudent in terms -- you're asking when, and we are back to the same answer we gave to you before. We do not see this having an impact in 2019. We are thinking that we will have some impact in 2018. And I'm pretty sure that later in the year, we will update with our views on the outlook of 2018. And at that time, we will be more -- let's say, more open. So far, I think it's a fairly good step. I would say extremely good step in a very good direction and position Cellnex where we want to be as a key independent TowerCo, delivering value for our shareholders and also respecting the path of our clients. You were just -- M&A deals. Well, we have said before we are quite active looking for opportunities that are compliant with our M&A golden rules. These M&A golden rules are quite clear and are quite demanding. So yes, we are involved in different opportunities and we are making progress. If finally, we are successful or not is something that takes time to know. However, I do think that in all the projects that we are right now involved are projects in which Cellnex can implement its knowhow, in which Cellnex shows the competitive advantage based in our master service agreement, the competitive advantage in the level of service that we provide our clients in our -- in the very full term, and also -- term, and also the creative solutions that we can bring into the table.

But you can say it is already contractualized, fully contractualized everything. This is another step in the good direction, okay? So step-by-step, you will see how this evolves. Regarding network service and others, and I think that this is the -- this is the communication we have, we're obviously being very clear. Network services and others is, again, one business line that should grow following inflation. Maybe if you compare quarter-by-quarter, you can see, it goes down a little bit, it goes up a little bit. So if you do not look at the quarter but you look at the [indiscernible] trends and your projections, inflation is a good driver. It's very similar to broadcasting. So -- stable and have the same path. And finally, the non-recurrent. Non-recurrent -- and we have been, also here, it seems that some items that we seen are not going to be repeated. For instance -- or maybe are non-cash items that do not add anything to the recurrent EBIT -- free cash flow. So here, we have several things. We have M&A, some M&A costs that we have include because of the Bouygues deal. So when we execute M&A deal, there are some costs. That should be when you project, yes, we have some cost. But at the same time, we should have some EBITDA. You shouldn't project these because if you project these costs, you should project more M&A in your projections. Then you have some non-cash items that are the rest of them. And these non-cash items are provisions that we execute in order to renegotiate some contracts in the future. So according to IFRS, when we renegotiate some contracts, we have to recognize a provision. And in the future, you will see the cash flows and the adjustments in the EBIDTA. So this is -- these are one-offs that are not recurrent and we don't think makes sense. In any case, Pedro, and also for the rest of the audience, on the Excel sheet provided, you can find a full breakdown of these elements, of both the M&A expenses which are cash; and then the EUR 6 million, the balance, EUR 6 million, which is our non-cash items.

This process is already in place, but given the nature, which is we'll start our engineering, we'll start asking for the permits. So its a process that takes longer than, obviously, the acquisition, that which is a mistake.

So we invest in the active equipment, we manage the whole network, so we do have the experience. We combine different contents in just one signal.

First of all, we have signed a framework agreement with the fourth mobile operator in Italy, allowing them for fully flexibility on their future network deployment. And second, we have reached a new agreement for the commission of further 400 sites.

On Slide 5, you can see the strong performance of our key value metrics, with adjusted EBITDA growing annually at around 30% and recurring levered free cash flow per share growing at around 10% over the last 2 years.
Moving to Slide 6. Total PoPs have increased by 20%, and our consolidated customer ratio by 6%. This includes both the contribution of organic growth and the change of perimeter in the period. If we look at organic growth only, new PoPs have increased by 5%, so we're in line with our medium-term organic growth guidance, showing the strength of our current operations. Additionally, DAS nodes have increased 6% in the quarter, and we are working hard to make this new activity a significant contributor to Cellnex revenues going forward.
In terms of organic growth drivers, you can see on Slide 7 our view for our new organic PoPs as well as the progress of our decommissioning and build-to-suit program. New PoPs from multi-tenancy are expected to be generated at a rate in line with our guidance, and these quarterly results confirm this trend.
Our decommissioning program now shows a 45% progress thanks to the recent agreement reached to dismantle 400 additional sites, thus providing us with even more visibility on our future organic growth. Progress on our build-to-suit program includes our recent agreement with Bouygues Telecom in France, and we are already taking the first steps in close coordination with our customer.
Before moving to Slide 9 and as a reminder, please note that additional financial information can be obtained from the Investor Relations section of our website, where a detailed Excel file is available.
You can see on this slide the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated tenancy ratio, which increase is mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. As you can see, we have managed to add 1,000 organic PoPs here on a year-by-year basis, with 289 being generated this quarter only, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.63 if change of perimeter is included.
Also, we are pursuing new organic growth opportunities in all businesses areas, with a special mention to the framework agreement we have recently signed with the fourth mobile operator in Italy which will provide them with full flexibility for their network deployment in the country.
We are also proud to announce a new project for decommissioning of 400 third-party towers. We continue to pursue commercial opportunities in the DAS small cells area, and signed a new contract with T-systems for the provision of land support for Inmarsat on-board communications solution. 
Last but not least, I would like to remind you that Cellnex expects no impact from the second digital dividend, that DTT spectrum is secured and list until 2030, and that we also expect to benefit from new mobile communication services deployed as a result of more spectrum available to operators on 5G.
On the next slide, you can find a comprehensive explanation of our adjusted EBITDA evolution. You can see how the positive impact of the switch on of the new TV channel last year is reinforced by organic growth contribution and change of perimeter, explaining the strong adjusted EBITDA increase in the period of 33%.
Moving to our capital structure on Slide 11. You can see our debt maturities profile as of April with an average maturity of around 6.5 years, no material refinancing required prior to 2022 and a strong protection against potential interest rate increase as a result of the fixed cost nature of our debt. All in all, we have a long-term capital structure in place at attractive terms with EUR 2 billion of liquidity between cash and available credit lines, providing us with full flexibility to optimize available funding alternatives.
Let me please now explain on Slide 12 our recent levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow in the period has been a strong 84%. 
Looking now to revenues. The contribution from Telecom Infrastructure Services and broadcasting increased, with a very well contained cost base, leading to an adjusted EBITDA growth of 33% when compared to last year.
Maintenance CapEx is slightly below our guidance due to the phasing. Our change in working capital is trending to neutral. Interest rate reflect our capital structure as of March and its associated coupons, why -- which tax are due later in the year. All in all, we are showing today a 15% revenue growth, which implies more than doubling our adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to last year.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 23. Cellnex leverage for the period has reached 4.3x net debt/annualized EBITDA after investing more than EUR 700 million in the previous months. Compared to December 2016, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and its associated cash inflow in the period.
Moving to Slide 14 and as a summary, let me please highlight that. Today, we are presenting again a solid set of results. We are posting a strong and consistent organic growth coupled with our progress on our additional value-creation initiatives, such as the framework agreement with the fourth mobile operator in Italy and a new decommissioning project. And finally, we are reiterating our guidance for the full year 2017.
The next section address several key topics that I believe are self explanatory, but I am more than happy to answer any questions you may have. So let's please start the Q&A session."

So regarding the financial flexibility, as you can see, we do have right now EUR 2 billion in cash and available credit lines. These credit lines are long term, so between 3 and 5 years. And also, you know that we have tapped the debt market, the bond market, with bond market issuance of 10 years. And on top of that, 2 private placements at -- I think at also 10 and 9 years. So the thing is that the market, the debt market, is giving us -- we have the door open. Our backlog is huge. We're talking about more than EUR 12 billion of backlog. This is recognized by bond investors, and I think that the reason why Cellnex has the flexibility to fund acquisitions with debt. Also bear in mind something, when you have EUR 2 billion of available debt, it's because the perception of the debt community, banks and bankholders, is positive. Otherwise, we wouldn't have this money. And so is it not only my perception of flexibility, it's also the perception of the market regarding Cellnex. Also, as we were seeing in the last -- in the full year results, Cellnex delevered very quickly. And we estimate that at least 0.6x in terms of net debt/EBITDA should decrease Cellnex in 1 year. So this will give us headroom to grow, headroom to fund our debts. You have -- You're second question was CommsCon. And as you know, CommsCon, we -- it's a great opportunity for us. It's opening -- we are opening up the -- not only land market in which CommsCon was already, but also the Spanish market. We have been building up alliance, as you were suggesting before. And you have here the results, I mean, with a strong growth that we hope in the future can go on. We are very active in our core markets, very active with CommsCom, and the results is step-by-step and recognized by clients not only because of the economics of the transaction that we do think makes sense for both sides, but also for the very good quality that we are delivering to clients. It's not only a question of economics, it's also a question of credibility of credentials. And I think CommsCom is building up these credentials and this is being recognized. And I think, Juan Jose, you can explain better than me the second -- the third question."

On top of the time frame, if you can just elaborate a bit of the economics of this decommission contract. Basically, the cost of decommissions, I believe, is on your side rather than the client side. And if that's the case, what's the breakeven on this contract, given the contracts? I don't know if you already signed the full contract or just the framework agreement. Just understand when you're going to break even and what sort of return on investments you have on this contract you signing. The second one, it's on the Bouygues side. You signed a contract for -- in February for delivery -- or, delivery, sorry -- for basically 1,800 towers that will be only gradually given to you. So just want to -- you said at that time, I remember you mentioned around 2 years. So given now that you've got a bit more months, if you have a bit more kind of clarity on when these towers will come in. Will the bulk, will be this year? Will be next year? And if the payments are done, that simultaneous when the towers comes in? Or they're paid in advance. And the third, it's on tax. You basically mentioned in the presentations and during the call about the high conversion rates, and then you compare yourself to a number of towers -- TowerCos in Europe, most of them are in Italy. Now given your significant exposure to the market and given the fact that, at least the table you show in your presentations, saying that most of the Italian TowerCos pay in excess of 10% of the EBITDA while yours at the group level is around only 2%. So my question is how long your 2%, it's specifically going to stay at this level? And what sort of framework you believe -- now that you expand into new markets, will that 2% remain as such? So you basically believe that the tax rate could increase or decrease from here?"
275401287,429082103,1183700,"Cellnex Telecom, S.A., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2017",2017-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Cellnex Telecom, S.A.","Executives","Thank you, Ottavio, for the question. Let's just start by the last one, and I will go to the other ones. So the tax, and I remember, Ottavio, this question from you at the moment of the IPO. And we have been working on tax since then, and as you can see,",647,"Thank you, Ottavio, for the question. Let's just start by the last one, and I will go to the other ones. So the tax, and I remember, Ottavio, this question from you at the moment of the IPO. And we have been working on tax since then, and as you can see, being very consistent with this trend. So we are working on that. We have several things that are being -- several measures that are being implemented which are very basic ones. I don't think this is elaborating strange things, it's just very basic, almost like the amortization, depreciation policy. So assessing in detail every single CapEx we invest, how can be depreciated according to the law and to make sense. Second, our structure, you know that we place our debt in the most -- I will say to you, in the most advantaged place so that we make sense when doing all the investments we carry out. Third, we'll have also comment that we have a patent box mechanism. Cellnex is a company that generates know how. And this know how, we set up contracts which are fully compliant with the European directives and allow us to somehow take advantage of the regulation in European countries for companies that foster research and development. Also you know that in some specific countries, we are taking into account the national interest reduction, and also, it's helping us. So it's not only one measure, it's several things that, put it together, allow us to take advantage, allow us to comply with the law and to pay what we have to pay. Nothing more, nothing less. How long? Well, if -- how long? Is the same for everything. It's how long interest rates are going to be like that? How long the organic growth is going to be there? How long -- our base case scenario is that these policies, these different measure we're implementing are long-term measures. I think that this is not something that we take very seriously and always compliance. So -- and therefore, when you are compliance, you don't have to be worried about how long. There is another angle you were saying. Your second question was about Bouygues deal. You are right, we communicate to the market the Bouygues deal was going to be executed throughout the next quarters. It's not going to be executed in 1 day. And why? Because this is the acquisition of assets, it's not the acquisition of shares. If we were talking about acquisition of shares, we would have half pay up on all the money and maybe we would be having EBITDA coming into the company. But also, maybe we were paying more taxes, no? Back to the previous question, the previous answer. So eventually, what we have done is an asset deal. This takes time because we have -- we need a waiver of the landlord, we need to coordinate with a client. It is my feeling that we will obtain the results that we gave you at the full year 2016 presentation, when we gave you the outlook. So limited impact in 2017. We will communicate you up quarter-by-quarter how much we pay, how many towers we receive. Finally, regarding the economics. Again, are the same economics we talk in the IPO. So at the moment, we were saying that roughly speaking in general. And when we sign a contract like this contract that has been signed, is we invest, let's say, EUR 24,000, EUR 25,000, EUR 30,000 per decommission side, and then we have a payback that is fully compliant with our M&A golden rules for unlevered projects, that you know perfectly how these rules are. So we feel comfortable, the breakeven. I think that it takes -- in terms of payback, I cannot be very specific, but this playback is a good payback, yes."

The first question, yes, well, this is for operator release. We have signed a framework agreement. This framework agreement give us the flexibility, given the flexibility to choose our sites with parameters that are fully defined and that are coherent with both sides. This is a very important framework agreement for us that situates, positions Cellnex as a key player in the Italian market, as an independent TowerCo, which in our view, is essential; and also give us further opportunities. And this is a first movement in -- what we can see more movements in the organic growth, in the subsequent organic growth. It is not only about PoPs, it's also about engineering services, it's about this -- you cannot see this, like, framework agreement for a PoP, it's a framework agreement for general service for entrance in a new country. That is the case. We are quite prudent in terms -- you're asking when, and we are back to the same answer we gave to you before. We do not see this having an impact in 2019. We are thinking that we will have some impact in 2018. And I'm pretty sure that later in the year, we will update with our views on the outlook of 2018. And at that time, we will be more -- let's say, more open. So far, I think it's a fairly good step. I would say extremely good step in a very good direction and position Cellnex where we want to be as a key independent TowerCo, delivering value for our shareholders and also respecting the path of our clients. You were just -- M&A deals. Well, we have said before we are quite active looking for opportunities that are compliant with our M&A golden rules. These M&A golden rules are quite clear and are quite demanding. So yes, we are involved in different opportunities and we are making progress. If finally, we are successful or not is something that takes time to know. However, I do think that in all the projects that we are right now involved are projects in which Cellnex can implement its knowhow, in which Cellnex shows the competitive advantage based in our master service agreement, the competitive advantage in the level of service that we provide our clients in our -- in the very full term, and also -- term, and also the creative solutions that we can bring into the table.

So it is -- therefore, it's the foundation for potentially contract. And it is very developed. And part, obviously, there is not -- as for -- as of today, there is not exclusivity. But you can say it is already contractualized, fully contractualized everything. This is another step in the good direction, okay? So step-by-step, you will see how this evolves. Regarding network service and others, and I think that this is the -- this is the communication we have, we're obviously being very clear. Network services and others is, again, one business line that should grow following inflation. Maybe if you compare quarter-by-quarter, you can see, it goes down a little bit, it goes up a little bit. So if you do not look at the quarter but you look at the [indiscernible] trends and your projections, inflation is a good driver. It's very similar to broadcasting. So -- stable and have the same path. And finally, the non-recurrent. Non-recurrent -- and we have been, also here, it seems that some items that we seen are not going to be repeated. For instance -- or maybe are non-cash items that do not add anything to the recurrent EBIT -- free cash flow. So here, we have several things. We have M&A, some M&A costs that we have include because of the Bouygues deal. So when we execute M&A deal, there are some costs. That should be when you project, yes, we have some cost. But at the same time, we should have some EBITDA. You shouldn't project these because if you project these costs, you should project more M&A in your projections. Then you have some non-cash items that are the rest of them. And these non-cash items are provisions that we execute in order to renegotiate some contracts in the future. So according to IFRS, when we renegotiate some contracts, we have to recognize a provision. And in the future, you will see the cash flows and the adjustments in the EBIDTA. So this is -- these are one-offs that are not recurrent and we don't think makes sense. In any case, Pedro, and also for the rest of the audience, on the Excel sheet provided, you can find a full breakdown of these elements, of both the M&A expenses which are cash; and then the EUR 6 million, the balance, EUR 6 million, which is our non-cash items.

Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones of the period on Slide 4. We have again posted a solid set of results based on the following pillars. We'll continue to generate a strong or",1115,"Good morning, and thank you so much for your time today. Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones of the period on Slide 4. 
We have again posted a solid set of results based on the following pillars. We'll continue to generate a strong organic growth in line with our guidance. We are improving the visibility on our future organic growth by reaching 2 strategic agreements. First of all, we have signed a framework agreement with the fourth mobile operator in Italy, allowing them for fully flexibility on their future network deployment. And second, we have reached a new agreement for the commission of further 400 sites. 
We are reaffirming our 2017 guidance, and I would like to highlight our very high conversion ratio even without great status that is the highest in the sector. We continue to successful -- to successfully tap the credit markets by issuing long-terms instruments at very attractive terms. And last but not least, we continue to lead a unique value proposition in the European tower sector based on tailored MSAs, neutrality, long-term approach and a strong relationship with our customers.
On Slide 5, you can see the strong performance of our key value metrics, with adjusted EBITDA growing annually at around 30% and recurring levered free cash flow per share growing at around 10% over the last 2 years.
Moving to Slide 6. Total PoPs have increased by 20%, and our consolidated customer ratio by 6%. This includes both the contribution of organic growth and the change of perimeter in the period. If we look at organic growth only, new PoPs have increased by 5%, so we're in line with our medium-term organic growth guidance, showing the strength of our current operations. Additionally, DAS nodes have increased 6% in the quarter, and we are working hard to make this new activity a significant contributor to Cellnex revenues going forward.
In terms of organic growth drivers, you can see on Slide 7 our view for our new organic PoPs as well as the progress of our decommissioning and build-to-suit program. New PoPs from multi-tenancy are expected to be generated at a rate in line with our guidance, and these quarterly results confirm this trend.
Our decommissioning program now shows a 45% progress thanks to the recent agreement reached to dismantle 400 additional sites, thus providing us with even more visibility on our future organic growth. Progress on our build-to-suit program includes our recent agreement with Bouygues Telecom in France, and we are already taking the first steps in close coordination with our customer.
Before moving to Slide 9 and as a reminder, please note that additional financial information can be obtained from the Investor Relations section of our website, where a detailed Excel file is available.
You can see on this slide the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated tenancy ratio, which increase is mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. As you can see, we have managed to add 1,000 organic PoPs here on a year-by-year basis, with 289 being generated this quarter only, reaching a tenancy ratio of 1.63 if change of perimeter is included.
Also, we are pursuing new organic growth opportunities in all businesses areas, with a special mention to the framework agreement we have recently signed with the fourth mobile operator in Italy which will provide them with full flexibility for their network deployment in the country.
We are also proud to announce a new project for decommissioning of 400 third-party towers. We continue to pursue commercial opportunities in the DAS small cells area, and signed a new contract with T-systems for the provision of land support for Inmarsat on-board communications solution. 
Last but not least, I would like to remind you that Cellnex expects no impact from the second digital dividend, that DTT spectrum is secured and list until 2030, and that we also expect to benefit from new mobile communication services deployed as a result of more spectrum available to operators on 5G.
On the next slide, you can find a comprehensive explanation of our adjusted EBITDA evolution. You can see how the positive impact of the switch on of the new TV channel last year is reinforced by organic growth contribution and change of perimeter, explaining the strong adjusted EBITDA increase in the period of 33%.
Moving to our capital structure on Slide 11. You can see our debt maturities profile as of April with an average maturity of around 6.5 years, no material refinancing required prior to 2022 and a strong protection against potential interest rate increase as a result of the fixed cost nature of our debt. All in all, we have a long-term capital structure in place at attractive terms with EUR 2 billion of liquidity between cash and available credit lines, providing us with full flexibility to optimize available funding alternatives.
Let me please now explain on Slide 12 our recent levered free cash flow generation in the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow in the period has been a strong 84%. 
Looking now to revenues. The contribution from Telecom Infrastructure Services and broadcasting increased, with a very well contained cost base, leading to an adjusted EBITDA growth of 33% when compared to last year.
Maintenance CapEx is slightly below our guidance due to the phasing. Our change in working capital is trending to neutral. Interest rate reflect our capital structure as of March and its associated coupons, why -- which tax are due later in the year. All in all, we are showing today a 15% revenue growth, which implies more than doubling our adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to last year.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 23. Cellnex leverage for the period has reached 4.3x net debt/annualized EBITDA after investing more than EUR 700 million in the previous months. Compared to December 2016, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and its associated cash inflow in the period.
Moving to Slide 14 and as a summary, let me please highlight that. Today, we are presenting again a solid set of results. We are posting a strong and consistent organic growth coupled with our progress on our additional value-creation initiatives, such as the framework agreement with the fourth mobile operator in Italy and a new decommissioning project. And finally, we are reiterating our guidance for the full year 2017.
The next section address several key topics that I believe are self-explanatory, but I am more than happy to answer any questions you may have. So let's please start the Q&A session."

So regarding the financial flexibility, as you can see, we do have right now EUR 2 billion in cash and available credit lines. These credit lines are long term, so between 3 and 5 years. And also, you know that we have tapped the debt market, the bond market, with bond market issuance of 10 years. And on top of that, 2 private placements at -- I think at also 10 and 9 years. So the thing is that the market, the debt market, is giving us -- we have the door open. Our backlog is huge. We're talking about more than EUR 12 billion of backlog. This is recognized by bond investors, and I think that the reason why Cellnex has the flexibility to fund acquisitions with debt. Also bear in mind something, when you have EUR 2 billion of available debt, it's because the perception of the debt community, banks and bankholders, is positive. Otherwise, we wouldn't have this money. And so is it not only my perception of flexibility, it's also the perception of the market regarding Cellnex. Also, as we were seeing in the last -- in the full year results, Cellnex delevered very quickly. And we estimate that at least 0.6x in terms of net debt/EBITDA should decrease Cellnex in 1 year. So this will give us headroom to grow, headroom to fund our debts. You have -- You're second question was CommsCon. And as you know, CommsCon, we -- it's a great opportunity for us. It's opening -- we are opening up the -- not only land market in which CommsCon was already, but also the Spanish market. We have been building up alliance, as you were suggesting before. And you have here the results, I mean, with a strong growth that we hope in the future can go on. We are very active in our core markets, very active with CommsCon, and the results is step-by-step and recognized by clients not only because of the economics of the transaction that we do think makes sense for both sides, but also for the very good quality that we are delivering to clients. It's not only a question of economics, it's also a question of credibility of credentials. And I think CommsCon is building up these credentials and this is being recognized. And I think, Juan Jose, you can explain better than me the second -- the third question."

On top of the time frame, if you can just elaborate a bit of the economics of this decommission contract. Basically, the cost of decommissions, I believe, is on your side rather than the client side. And if that's the case, what's the breakeven on this contract, given the contracts? I don't know if you already signed the full contract or just the framework agreement. Just understand when you're going to break even and what sort of return on investments you have on this contract you signing. The second one, it's on the Bouygues side. You signed a contract for -- in February for delivery -- or, delivery, sorry -- for basically 1,800 towers that will be only gradually given to you. So just want to -- you said at that time, I remember you mentioned around 2 years. So given now that you've got a bit more months, if you have a bit more kind of clarity on when these towers will come in. Will the bulk, will be this year? Will be next year? And if the payments are done, that simultaneous when the towers comes in? Or they're paid in advance. And the third, it's on tax. You basically mentioned in the presentations and during the call about the high conversion rates, and then you compare yourself to a number of towers -- TowerCos in Europe, most of them are in Italy. Now given your significant exposure to the market and given the fact that, at least the table you show in your presentations, saying that most of the Italian TowerCos pay in excess of 10% of the EBITDA while yours at the group level is around only 2%. So my question is how long your 2%, it's specifically going to stay at this level? And what sort of framework you believe -- now that you expand into new markets, will that 2% remain as such? So you basically believe that the tax rate could increase or decrease from here?"

Let's just start by the last one, and I will go to the other ones. So the tax, and I remember, Ottavio, this question from you at the moment of the IPO. And we have been working on tax since then, and as you can see,",646,"Thank you, Ottavio, for the question. Let's just start by the last one, and I will go to the other ones. So the tax, and I remember, Ottavio, this question from you at the moment of the IPO. And we have been working on tax since then, and as you can see, being very consistent with this trend. So we are working on that. We have several things that are being -- several measures that are being implemented which are very basic ones. I don't think this is elaborating strange things, it's just very basic, almost like the amortization, depreciation policy. So assessing in detail every single CapEx we invest, how can be depreciated according to the law and to make sense. Second, our structure, you know that we place our debt in the most -- I will say to you, in the most advantaged place so that we make sense when doing all the investments we carry out. Third, we'll have also comment that we have a patent box mechanism. Cellnex is a company that generates know how. And this knowhow, we set up contracts which are fully compliant with the European directives and allow us to somehow take advantage of the regulation in European countries for companies that foster research and development. Also you know that in some specific countries, we are taking into account the national interest reduction, and also, it's helping us. So it's not only one measure, it's several things that, put it together, allow us to take advantage, allow us to comply with the law and to pay what we have to pay. Nothing more, nothing less. How long? Well, if -- how long? Is the same for everything. It's how long interest rates are going to be like that? How long the organic growth is going to be there? How long -- our base case scenario is that these policies, these different measure we're implementing are long-term measures. I think that this is not something that we take very seriously and always compliance. So -- and therefore, when you are compliance, you don't have to be worried about how long. There is another angle you were saying. Your second question was about Bouygues deal. You are right, we communicate to the market the Bouygues deal was going to be executed throughout the next quarters. It's not going to be executed in 1 day. And why? Because this is the acquisition of assets, it's not the acquisition of shares. If we were talking about acquisition of shares, we would have half pay up on all the money and maybe we would be having EBITDA coming into the company. But also, maybe we were paying more taxes, no? Back to the previous question, the previous answer. So eventually, what we have done is an asset deal. This takes time because we have -- we need a waiver of the landlord, we need to coordinate with a client. It is my feeling that we will obtain the results that we gave you at the full year 2016 presentation, when we gave you the outlook. So limited impact in 2017. We will communicate you up quarter-by-quarter how much we pay, how many towers we receive. Finally, regarding the economics. Again, are the same economics we talk in the IPO. So at the moment, we were saying that roughly speaking in general. And when we sign a contract like this contract that has been signed, is we invest, let's say, EUR 24,000, EUR 25,000, EUR 30,000 per decommission side, and then we have a payback that is fully compliant with our M&A golden rules for unlevered projects, that you know perfectly how these rules are. So we feel comfortable, the breakeven. I think that it takes -- in terms of payback, I cannot be very specific, but this playback is a good payback, yes."

It is not only about PoPs, it's also about engineering services, it's about this -- you cannot see this, like, framework agreement for a PoP, it's a framework agreement for general service for entrance in a new country. That is the case. We are quite prudent in terms -- you're asking when, and we are back to the same answer we gave to you before. We do not see this having an impact in 2019.

I would say extremely good step in a very good direction and position Cellnex where we want to be as a key independent TowerCo, delivering value for our shareholders and also respecting the path of our clients. You were just -- M&A deals. Well, we have said before we are quite active looking for opportunities that are compliant with our M&A golden rules. These M&A golden rules are quite clear and are quite demanding. So yes, we are involved in different opportunities and we are making progress. If finally, we are successful or not is something that takes time to know. However, I do think that in all the projects that we are right now involved are projects in which Cellnex can implement its knowhow, in which Cellnex shows the competitive advantage based in our master service agreement, the competitive advantage in the level of service that we provide our clients in our -- in the very full term, and also -- term, and also the creative solutions that we can bring into the table. Towering in Europe is starting and we are the first mover here. I think that the other question, [ Paco ], you are better positioned than me to answer."

But you can say it is already contractualized, fully contractualized everything. This is another step in the good direction, okay? So step-by-step, you will see how this evolves. Regarding network service and others, and I think that this is the -- this is the communication we have, we're obviously being very clear. Network services and others is, again, one business line that should grow following inflation. Maybe if you compare quarter-by-quarter, you can see, it goes down a little bit, it goes up a little bit. So if you do not look at the quarter but you look at the [indiscernible] trends and your projections, inflation is a good driver. It's very similar to broadcasting. So -- stable and have the same path. And finally, the non-recurrent. Non-recurrent -- and we have been, also here, it seems that some items that we seen are not going to be repeated. For instance -- or maybe are non-cash items that do not add anything to the recurrent EBIT -- free cash flow. So here, we have several things. We have M&A, some M&A costs that we have include because of the Bouygues deal. So when we execute M&A deal, there are some costs. That should be when you project, yes, we have some cost. But at the same time, we should have some EBITDA. You shouldn't project these because if you project these costs, you should project more M&A in your projections. Then you have some non-cash items that are the rest of them. And these non-cash items are provisions that we execute in order to renegotiate some contracts in the future. So according to IFRS, when we renegotiate some contracts, we have to recognize a provision. And in the future, you will see the cash flows and the adjustments in the EBIDTA. So this is -- these are one-offs that are not recurrent and we don't think makes sense. In any case, Pedro, and also for the rest of the audience, on the Excel sheet provided, you can find a full breakdown of these elements, of both the M&A expenses which are cash; and then the EUR 6 million, the balance, EUR 6 million, which is our non-cash items.

You might have the impression that we are still far from making operators comfortable in terms of sharing active equipment, but the rationale is sadly the same. So we fully agree. And when the opportunity arises, we will be there. Remember that our legacy business in Spain has been for many, many years the broadcasting business, but we do everything. So we invest in the active equipment, we manage the whole network, so we do have the experience. We combine different contents in just one signal. So this is something that's also feasible from a technical perspective and translate in this approach for the mobile communications world. So we are going to do so. It's a matter of operators being softer to this idea in the future. So happy to work in that direction?"

Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones of the period on Slide 4.
We have again posted a solid set of results in line with consensus, and we continue to reach a strategic partnership with key European players. We continue to generate a strong organic growth, in line with our guidance. We see the European tower outsourcing process accelerating and we are glad to announce a new agreement, the extension of our cooperation with Bouygues Telecom in France by acquiring 600 additional sites. Two months ago, we entered into strategic partnership with Sunrise. Based on our unique Master Service Agreement, which we are expecting to close in the coming weeks. And we have also strengthened our position in Italy by acquiring the remaining 10% stake in Galata, previously owned by Wintry. We are improving the visibility of our future organic growth in the context of our strategic agreement with Sunrise through a build to suit program for 400 sites, 200 DAS nodes contracted and a right to match under full support. Sunrise on its future small cells and DAS needs in Switzerland.
We continue to lead a unique value proposition in the European tower landscape based on tailored MSAs, a Full Network Service approach, neutrality and a very strong relationship with our customers with a long-term view.
We are also reaffirming our 2017 guidance. We should have seen good Cellnex future launch contribution upon closing.
On Slide 5, you can see the strong performance of our key value metrics, with adjusted EBITDA growing annually more than 20% and recurring level free cash flow per share growing 17% annually over the last couple of years.
Moving to Slide 6. Total PoPs have increased 22%, and our consolidated customer ratio by 5%. These metrics include the contribution of both organic growth and the change of perimeter in the period. If we focus on organic growth only, PoPs have increased by 5%, therefore about our medium-term guidance, showing the strength of our current operations.
DAS nodes have also increased by 10% in the semester, and we are working hard to make these new sector a significant contributor to Cellnex' future revenues.
In this context, we are happy to announce that we have signed our first small cells project in Spain. By reaching an agreement with Atlético Madrid football club for the rollout of an exclusive DAS network at their new stadium.
If we move now to Slide 7, you can see a summary and the main characteristics of our more recent growth activity. As a summary, we have managed to increase our footprint by close to 6,500 towers in 6 months only, when all the different stages are completed. As mentioned earlier, we have reached an agreement with Bouygues Telecom to acquire up to 600 additional top sites. This is an extension of the agreement signed earlier this year. The 4 under the same terms, and these additional sites will be transferred into Cellnex brands no later than 2020. This new agreement represents an extension of our partnership with Bouygues Telecom only 6 months after our initial agreement for the 3,500 sites.
In the Netherlands, we have executed a small transaction at an attractive valuation to continue growing in the country, and we have strengthened our position in Italy by acquiring the remaining 10% stake in Galata.
Finally, we are expected to close the acquisition of Swiss Towers in Q3 2017. This agreement is based on a unique Master Service Agreement and sets the condition of a strategic partnership with Sunrise. We're also securing organic growth through the 400 sites build to suit program and our right to match and the -- to support Sunrise small cells and DAS rollout in the country.
All of these deals, together, allow us to further expand into attractive markets, extend our relationship with key partners and strengthen our value proposition based on our -- on the Master Service Agreement.
On Slide 8, you can see that the result of the geographical diversification strategy with more than half of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside Spain. We are always talking on a pro forma basis. Cellnex has just begun the key player in the European tower landscape.
Moving to Slide 10. I'm talking now about the business performance of the company. You can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter.
We have managed to have more than 1,000 organic PoP on a year-by-year basis, with 557 PoPs being generated this last semester, and reaching a customer ratio of 1.64, including change of perimeter. Additionally, we are looking for new organic growth opportunities in all areas of activity. Our organic growth is above our guidance. Our decommissioning process stands at 45%, and we have reached 91% of our build to suit target.
We continue to assess opportunities based on a Full Network Service approach so that we can crystallize our competitive advantage, our Master Service Agreement. We are implementing our framework agreement with the fourth mobile network operator in Italy, and closely interacting in order to meet their needs. Please note that a similar approach is being assessed in France with our clients. We have kicked off the 5G city project, which aims at designing and demonstrating in operational conditions a 5G network in several European cities.
And finally, we have recently signed our first small cells project in Spain by reaching an agreement with Atlético Madrid football club for their rollout of an exclusive DAS network at their new stadium. Our contract has a duration of 10 years, and it will be the first stadium in Spain capable of offering a real mobile broadband experience to all the spectators.
Moving to Slide 11, here you can find a detailed explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance. You can see how the positive impact of the new TV channel last year is reinforced by the contribution of organic growth and efficiencies as well as by change of perimeter. This explains the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 25%, which is even superior to our growth of revenues by 12%.
Moving to our capital structure on Slide 12. You can see our debt maturities profile as of today. Our structure has an average maturity of around 6.5 years. There is no material refinancing required before 2022, and we have a strong protection against a changing interest rate environment as a result of the combination of fixed rates and very long-term maturities.
In summary, we have a long-term capital structure in place at a very attractive terms. With available liquidity between cash at hand and available credit lines accounting for more than EUR 1.5 billion and providing us with plenty of flexibility to optimize available funding alternatives.
Let me please now move on Slide 13, where you can see our recurring levered free cash flow for the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow in the period has been a very strong 83%. Regarding revenues, the contribution from Telecom Infrastructure Services and broadcasting increased, with a very well-contained cost base is leading to an adjusted EBITDA growth of 25%, when compared to the same period of last year. Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital trends to neutral. Interest base reflect our capital structure as of June, and taxes reflect the payments scheduled in the year as well as our management measures in place.
All in all, we are showing today a 12% revenue growth, which implies more than doubling our adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to the last year performance.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 14. Cellnex leverage for the period reaches 4.6x net debt annualized adjusted EBITDA, including the contribution from all closed transactions, both in debt and adjusted EBITDA. Compared to December 2016, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and its associated cash inflow, with proceeds to be used for the acquisition of the remaining stake in Galata, the closing of Swiss Towers deal and the transfer of sites from Bouygues Telecom.
Moving to Slide 15 and as a summary, let me please highlight that we are presenting again a very solid set of results. We are posting a strong and consistent organic growth capital, with progress on our additional value creation alternatives -- initiatives. We are seeing an increased momentum in the European tower outsourcing process, as proved by we have been able to extend our relationship with key European players. And finally, we are reiterating our guidance for the year, which will need to be adjusted upwards with Swiss Towers contribution when this deal is finally closed.

But anyway, I am more than happy -- we are more than happy to answer any questions you may have, so let's please open the line for any questions you may have."

Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones of the period on Slide 4.
We have again posted a solid set of results in line with consensus, and we continue to reach a strategic partnership with key European players. We continue to generate a strong organic growth in line with our guidance. We see the European tower outsourcing process accelerating. And we are glad to announce a new agreement, the extension of our cooperation with Bouygues Telecom in France by acquiring 600 additional sites. 
Two months ago, we entered into strategic partnership with Sunrise based on our unique Master Service Agreement, which we are expecting to close in the coming weeks. And we have also strengthened our position in Italy by acquiring the remaining 10% stake in Galata previously owned by Wind Tre. We are improving the visibility of our future organic growth in the context of our strategic agreement with Sunrise through a build to suit program for 400 sites, 200 DAS nodes contracted and a right to match under full support Sunrise on its future small cells and DAS needs in Switzerland.
We continue to lead a unique value proposition in the European tower landscape based on tailored MSAs, a Full Network Service approach, neutrality and a very strong relationship with our customers with a long-term view. We are also reaffirming our 2017 guidance. We should also include Cellnex future launch contribution upon closing.
On Slide 5, you can see the strong performance of our key value metrics, with adjusted EBITDA growing annually more than 20% and recurring levered free cash flow per share growing 17% annually over the last couple of years.
Moving to Slide 6. Total PoPs have increased 22%, and our consolidated customer ratio by 5%. These metrics include the contribution of both organic growth and the change of perimeter in the period. If we focus on organic growth only, PoPs have increased by 5%, therefore, above our medium-term guidance, showing the strength of our current operations. DAS nodes have also increased by 10% in the semester, and we are working hard to make this new sector a significant contributor to Cellnex' future revenues. In this context, we are happy to announce that we have signed our first small cells project in Spain by reaching an agreement with Atlético de Madrid football club for the rollout of an exclusive DAS network at their new stadium.
If we move now to Slide 7, you can see a summary and the main characteristics of our most recent growth activity. As a summary, we have managed to increase our footprint by close to 6,500 towers in 6 months only, when all the different stages are completed. As mentioned earlier, we have reached an agreement with Bouygues Telecom to acquire up to 600 additional top sites. This is an extension of the agreement signed earlier this year, therefore, under the same terms. And these additional sites will be transferred into Cellnex brands no later than 2020. This new agreement represents an extension of our partnership with Bouygues Telecom only 6 months after our initial agreement for 3,500 sites. In the Netherlands, we have executed small transactions at an attractive valuation to continue growing in the country. And we have strengthened our position in Italy by acquiring the remaining 10% stake in Galata.
Finally, we are expecting to close the acquisition of Swiss Towers in Q3 2017. This agreement is based on a unique Master Service Agreement and sets the foundation of a strategic partnership with Sunrise. We are also securing organic growth through the 400 sites build to suit program and a right to match and therefore, to support Sunrise small cells and DAS rollout in the country. All these deals together allow us to further expand into attractive markets, extend our relationship with key partners and strengthen our value proposition based on the Master Service Agreement.
On Slide 8, you can see that the result of the geographical diversification strategy with more than half of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside Spain. We are always talking on a pro forma basis. Cellnex has fast become the key player in the European tower landscape.
Moving to Slide 10. I'm talking now about the business performance of the company. You can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have managed to have more than 1,000 organic PoP on a year-by-year basis, with 557 PoPs being generated this last semester and reaching a customer ratio of 1.64, including change of perimeter. Additionally, we are looking for new organic growth opportunities in all areas of activity. Our organic growth is above our guidance. Our decommissioning process stands at 45%, and we have reached 91% of our build to suit target.
We continue to assess opportunities based on a Full Network Service approach so that we can crystallize our competitive advantage, our Master Service Agreement. We are implementing our framework agreement with the fourth mobile network operator in Italy, and closely interacting in order to meet their needs. Please note that a similar approach is being assessed in France with our clients. We have kicked off the 5G City project, which aims at designing and demonstrating in operational conditions a 5G network in several European cities.
And finally, we have recently signed our first small cells project in Spain by reaching an agreement with Atlético de Madrid football club for the rollout of an exclusive DAS network at their new stadium. Our contract has a duration of 10 years, and it will be the first stadium in Spain capable of offering a real mobile broadband experience to all the spectators.
Moving to Slide 11. Here you can find a detailed explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance. You can see how the positive impact of the new TV channel last year is reinforced by the contribution of organic growth and efficiencies as well as by change of perimeter. This explains the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 25%, which is even superior to our growth of revenues by 12%.
Moving to our capital structure on Slide 12. You can see our debt maturities profile as of today. Our structure has an average maturity of around 6.5 years. There is no material refinancing required before 2022, and we have a strong protection against a changing interest rate environment as a result of the combination of fixed rates and very long-term maturities.
In summary, we have a long-term capital structure in place at very attractive terms with available liquidity between cash at hand and available credit lines accounting for more than EUR 1.5 billion and providing us with plenty of flexibility to optimize available funding alternatives.
Let me please now move on Slide 13, where you can see our recurring levered free cash flow for the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow in the period has been a very strong 83%. Regarding revenues, the contribution from Telecom Infrastructure Services and broadcasting increase with a very well-contained cost base is leading to an adjusted EBITDA growth of 25% when compared to the same period of last year. Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital trends to neutral. Interest paid reflect our capital structure as of June, and taxes reflect the payments scheduled in the year as well as our management measures in place. All in all, we are showing today a 12% revenue growth, which implies more than doubling our adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to the last year performance.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 14. Cellnex leverage for the period reaches 4.6x net debt/annualized adjusted EBITDA, including the contribution from all closed transactions, both in debt and adjusted EBITDA. Compared to December 2016, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and its associated cash inflow, with proceeds to be used for the acquisition of the remaining stake in Galata, the closing of Swiss Towers deal and the transfer of sites from Bouygues Telecom.
Moving to Slide 15. And as a summary, let me please highlight that we are presenting again a very solid set of results. We are posting a strong and consistent organic growth capital with progress on our additional value creation alternatives -- initiatives. We are seeing an increased momentum in the European tower outsourcing process as proved by have -- being able to extend our relationship with key European players. And finally, we are reiterating our guidance for the year, which will need to be adjusted upwards with Swiss Towers contribution when this deal is finally closed.
The following section, the Frequently Asked Questions section, addresses several high-level topics that I believe you are raising very often to us. But anyway, I am more than happy -- we are more than happy to answer any questions you may have. So let's please open the line for any questions you may have."

On top of that, you were talking about the 1,200 towers that -- which was build to suit. And in order to execute these towers, we've had longer. We've had up to 5 years. So far, we have not executed that -- not that very large number. We are starting, okay? And -- but on track, as we have longer, we'll have more time, 5 years, compared to the first 1,800.

Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones of the period on Slide 4.We have again posted a solid set of results in line with consensus, and we continue to reach a strategic partnershi",1526,"Good morning, and thank you so much for your time today. Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones of the period on Slide 4.
We have again posted a solid set of results in line with consensus, and we continue to reach a strategic partnership with key European players. We continue to generate a strong organic growth in line with our guidance. We see the European tower outsourcing process accelerating. And we are glad to announce a new agreement, the extension of our cooperation with Bouygues Telecom in France by acquiring 600 additional sites. 
Two months ago, we entered into strategic partnership with Sunrise based on our unique Master Service Agreement, which we are expecting to close in the coming weeks. And we have also strengthened our position in Italy by acquiring the remaining 10% stake in Galata previously owned by Wind Tre. We are improving the visibility of our future organic growth in the context of our strategic agreement with Sunrise through a build to suit program for 400 sites, 200 DAS nodes contracted and a right to match under full support Sunrise on its future small cells and DAS needs in Switzerland.
We continue to lead a unique value proposition in the European tower landscape based on tailored MSAs, a Full Network Service approach, neutrality and a very strong relationship with our customers with a long-term view. We are also reaffirming our 2017 guidance, which should also include Cellnex future launch contribution upon closing.
On Slide 5, you can see the strong performance of our key value metrics, with adjusted EBITDA growing annually more than 20% and recurring levered free cash flow per share growing 17% annually over the last couple of years.
Moving to Slide 6. Total PoPs have increased 22%, and our consolidated customer ratio by 5%. These metrics include the contribution of both organic growth and the change of perimeter in the period. If we focus on organic growth only, PoPs have increased by 5%, therefore, above our medium-term guidance, showing the strength of our current operations. DAS nodes have also increased by 10% in the semester, and we are working hard to make this new sector a significant contributor to Cellnex' future revenues. In this context, we are happy to announce that we have signed our first small cells project in Spain by reaching an agreement with Atlético de Madrid football club for the rollout of an exclusive DAS network at their new stadium.
If we move now to Slide 7, you can see a summary and the main characteristics of our most recent growth activity. As a summary, we have managed to increase our footprint by close to 6,500 towers in 6 months only, when all the different stages are completed. As mentioned earlier, we have reached an agreement with Bouygues Telecom to acquire up to 600 additional top sites. This is an extension of the agreement signed earlier this year, therefore, under the same terms. And these additional sites will be transferred into Cellnex hands no later than 2020. This new agreement represents an extension of our partnership with Bouygues Telecom only 6 months after our initial agreement for 3,500 sites. In the Netherlands, we have executed small transactions at an attractive valuation to continue growing in the country. And we have strengthened our position in Italy by acquiring the remaining 10% stake in Galata.
Finally, we are expecting to close the acquisition of Swiss Towers in Q3 2017. This agreement is based on a unique Master Service Agreement and sets the foundation of a strategic partnership with Sunrise. We are also securing organic growth through the 400 sites build to suit program and a right to match and therefore, to support Sunrise small cells and DAS rollout in the country. All these deals together allow us to further expand into attractive markets, extend our relationship with key partners and strengthen our value proposition based on the Master Service Agreement.
On Slide 8, you can see that the result of the geographical diversification strategy with more than half of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside Spain. We are always talking on a pro forma basis. Cellnex has fast become the key player in the European tower landscape.
Moving to Slide 10. I'm talking now about the business performance of the company. You can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have managed to add more than 1,000 organic PoP on a year-by-year basis, with 557 PoPs being generated this last semester and reaching a customer ratio of 1.64, including change of perimeter. Additionally, we are looking for new organic growth opportunities in all areas of activity. Our organic growth is above our guidance. Our decommissioning process stands at 45%, and we have reached 91% of our build to suit target.
We continue to assess opportunities based on a Full Network Service approach so that we can crystallize our competitive advantage, our Master Service Agreement. We are implementing our framework agreement with the fourth mobile network operator in Italy, and closely interacting in order to meet their needs. Please note that a similar approach is being assessed in France with our clients. We have kicked off the 5G City project, which aims at designing and demonstrating in operational conditions a 5G network in several European cities.
And finally, we have recently signed our first small cells project in Spain by reaching an agreement with Atlético de Madrid football club for the rollout of an exclusive DAS network at their new stadium. Our contract has a duration of 10 years, and it will be the first stadium in Spain capable of offering a real mobile broadband experience to all the spectators.
Moving to Slide 11. Here you can find a detailed explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance. You can see how the positive impact of the new TV channel last year is reinforced by the contribution of organic growth and efficiencies as well as by change of perimeter. This explains the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 25%, which is even superior to our growth of revenues by 12%.
Moving to our capital structure on Slide 12. You can see our debt maturities profile as of today. Our structure has an average maturity of around 6.5 years. There is no material refinancing required before 2022, and we have a strong protection against a changing interest rate environment as a result of the combination of fixed rates and very long-term maturities.
In summary, we have a long-term capital structure in place at very attractive terms with available liquidity between cash at hand and available credit lines accounting for more than EUR 1.5 billion and providing us with plenty of flexibility to optimize available funding alternatives.
Let me please now move on Slide 13, where you can see our recurring levered free cash flow for the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow in the period has been a very strong 83%. Regarding revenues, the contribution from Telecom Infrastructure Services and broadcasting increase with a very well-contained cost base is leading to an adjusted EBITDA growth of 25% when compared to the same period of last year. Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital trends to neutral. Interest paid reflect our capital structure as of June, and taxes reflect the payments scheduled in the year as well as our management measures in place. All in all, we are showing today a 12% revenue growth, which implies more than doubling our adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to the last year performance.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 14. Cellnex leverage for the period reaches 4.6x net debt/annualized adjusted EBITDA, including the contribution from all closed transactions, both in debt and adjusted EBITDA. Compared to December 2016, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and its associated cash inflow, with proceeds to be used for the acquisition of the remaining stake in Galata, the closing of Swiss Towers deal and the transfer of sites from Bouygues Telecom.
Moving to Slide 15. And as a summary, let me please highlight that we are presenting again a very solid set of results. We are posting a strong and consistent organic growth capital with progress on our additional value creation alternatives -- initiatives. We are seeing an increased momentum in the European tower outsourcing process as proved by have -- being able to extend our relationship with key European players. And finally, we are reiterating our guidance for the year, which will need to be adjusted upwards with Swiss Towers contribution when this deal is finally closed.

But anyway, I am more than happy -- we are more than happy to answer any questions you may have. So let's please open the line for any questions you may have."

On top of that, you were talking about the 1,200 towers that -- which was build to suit. And in order to execute these towers, we've had longer. We've had up to 5 years. So far, we have not executed that -- not that very large number. We are starting, okay? And -- but on track, as we have longer, we'll have more time, 5 years, compared to the first 1,800. And these 600 towers should be executed once the 1,800 towers from Bouygues this 2-year period it's about to end. So in the last period of these 2 years, so we were talking at the end of 2019 and no later than 2020, we should execute these new agreement of up to 600 towers.

Let me please start by highlighting the main milestones of the period on Slide 4.
We have again posted a solid set of results in line with consensus, and we continue to reach a strategic partnership with key European players. We continue to generate a strong organic growth in line with our guidance. We see the European tower outsourcing process accelerating. And we are glad to announce a new agreement, the extension of our cooperation with Bouygues Telecom in France by acquiring 600 additional sites. 
Two months ago, we entered into strategic partnership with Sunrise based on our unique Master Service Agreement, which we are expecting to close in the coming weeks. And we have also strengthened our position in Italy by acquiring the remaining 10% stake in Galata previously owned by Wind Tre. We are improving the visibility of our future organic growth in the context of our strategic agreement with Sunrise through a build to suit program for 400 sites, 200 DAS nodes contracted and a right to match under full support Sunrise on its future small cells and DAS needs in Switzerland.
We continue to lead a unique value proposition in the European tower landscape based on tailored MSAs, a Full Network Service approach, neutrality and a very strong relationship with our customers with a long-term view. We are also reaffirming our 2017 guidance, which should also include Cellnex future launch contribution upon closing.
On Slide 5, you can see the strong performance of our key value metrics, with adjusted EBITDA growing annually more than 20% and recurring levered free cash flow per share growing 17% annually over the last couple of years.
Moving to Slide 6. Total PoPs have increased 22%, and our consolidated customer ratio by 5%. These metrics include the contribution of both organic growth and the change of perimeter in the period. If we focus on organic growth only, PoPs have increased by 5%, therefore, above our medium-term guidance, showing the strength of our current operations. DAS nodes have also increased by 10% in the semester, and we are working hard to make this new sector a significant contributor to Cellnex' future revenues. In this context, we are happy to announce that we have signed our first small cells project in Spain by reaching an agreement with Atlético de Madrid football club for the rollout of an exclusive DAS network at their new stadium.
If we move now to Slide 7, you can see a summary and the main characteristics of our most recent growth activity. As a summary, we have managed to increase our footprint by close to 6,500 towers in 6 months only, when all the different stages are completed. As mentioned earlier, we have reached an agreement with Bouygues Telecom to acquire up to 600 additional top sites. This is an extension of the agreement signed earlier this year, therefore, under the same terms. And these additional sites will be transferred into Cellnex hands no later than 2020. This new agreement represents an extension of our partnership with Bouygues Telecom only 6 months after our initial agreement for 3,500 sites. In the Netherlands, we have executed small transactions at an attractive valuation to continue growing in the country. And we have strengthened our position in Italy by acquiring the remaining 10% stake in Galata.
Finally, we are expecting to close the acquisition of Swiss Towers in Q3 2017. This agreement is based on a unique Master Service Agreement and sets the foundation of a strategic partnership with Sunrise. We are also securing organic growth through the 400 sites build to suit program and a right to match and therefore, to support Sunrise small cells and DAS rollout in the country. All these deals together allow us to further expand into attractive markets, extend our relationship with key partners and strengthen our value proposition based on the Master Service Agreement.
On Slide 8, you can see that the result of the geographical diversification strategy with more than half of our adjusted EBITDA to be generated outside Spain. We are always talking on a pro forma basis. Cellnex has fast become the key player in the European tower landscape.
Moving to Slide 10. I'm talking now about the business performance of the company. You can see the evolution of PoPs and our consolidated customer ratio, with increases mainly explained by consistent organic growth and change of perimeter. We have managed to add more than 1,000 organic PoP on a year-by-year basis, with 557 PoPs being generated this last semester and reaching a customer ratio of 1.64, including change of perimeter. Additionally, we are looking for new organic growth opportunities in all areas of activity. Our organic growth is above our guidance. Our decommissioning process stands at 45%, and we have reached 91% of our build to suit target.
We continue to assess opportunities based on a Full Network Service approach so that we can crystallize our competitive advantage, our Master Service Agreement. We are implementing our framework agreement with the fourth mobile network operator in Italy, and closely interacting in order to meet their needs. Please note that a similar approach is being assessed in France with our clients. We have kicked off the 5G City project, which aims at designing and demonstrating in operational conditions a 5G network in several European cities.
And finally, we have recently signed our first small cells project in Spain by reaching an agreement with Atlético de Madrid football club for the rollout of an exclusive DAS network at their new stadium. Our contract has a duration of 10 years, and it will be the first stadium in Spain capable of offering a real mobile broadband experience to all the spectators.
Moving to Slide 11. Here you can find a detailed explanation of our adjusted EBITDA performance. You can see how the positive impact of the new TV channel last year is reinforced by the contribution of organic growth and efficiencies as well as by change of perimeter. This explains the strong adjusted EBITDA growth in the period of 25%, which is even superior to our growth of revenues by 12%.
Moving to our capital structure on Slide 12. You can see our debt maturities profile as of today. Our structure has an average maturity of around 6.5 years. There is no material refinancing required before 2022, and we have a strong protection against a changing interest rate environment as a result of the combination of fixed rates and very long-term maturities.
In summary, we have a long-term capital structure in place at very attractive terms with available liquidity between cash at hand and available credit lines accounting for more than EUR 1.5 billion and providing us with plenty of flexibility to optimize available funding alternatives.
Let me please now move on Slide 13, where you can see our recurring levered free cash flow for the period. I would like to start by highlighting that the cash conversion ratio of EBITDA into recurring levered free cash flow in the period has been a very strong 83%. Regarding revenues, the contribution from Telecom Infrastructure Services and broadcasting increase with a very well-contained cost base is leading to an adjusted EBITDA growth of 25% when compared to the same period of last year. Maintenance CapEx is in line with our guidance. Our change in working capital trends to neutral. Interest paid reflect our capital structure as of June, and taxes reflect the payments scheduled in the year as well as our management measures in place. All in all, we are showing today a 12% revenue growth, which implies more than doubling our adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to the last year performance.
Moving now to our balance sheet on Slide 14. Cellnex leverage for the period reaches 4.6x net debt/annualized adjusted EBITDA, including the contribution from all closed transactions, both in debt and adjusted EBITDA. Compared to December 2016, our balance sheet mostly reflects the increase in debt instruments and its associated cash inflow, with proceeds to be used for the acquisition of the remaining stake in Galata, the closing of Swiss Towers deal and the transfer of sites from Bouygues Telecom.
Moving to Slide 15. And as a summary, let me please highlight that we are presenting again a very solid set of results. We are posting a strong and consistent organic growth capital with progress on our additional value creation alternatives -- initiatives. We are seeing an increased momentum in the European tower outsourcing process as proved by have -- being able to extend our relationship with key European players. And finally, we are reiterating our guidance for the year, which will need to be adjusted upwards with Swiss Towers contribution when this deal is finally closed.

But anyway, I am more than happy -- we are more than happy to answer any questions you may have. So let's please open the line for any questions you may have."

And then just on the phasing of the Bouygues tower, just from memory, I think you've got several phases on acquiring towers. I think from memory, the first agreement was 500 towers.

On top of that, you were talking about the 1,200 towers that -- which was build to suit. And in order to execute these towers, we've had longer. We've had up to 5 years.

I know EI Towers a few days ago updated that they have been seeing these discounts in tenants for volume essentially leaving revenues flat. Have you been seeing this kind of trend?"

I mean, if you, for example, follow the quarterly revenues in Italy, there is a slight decline mostly coming from the contribution of CommsCon. CommsCon signed the -- a new project in Italy related to a DAS project on the Olimpico di Roma stadium. Those revenues were booked in Q1 2017. This contract has a significant component of nonrecurrent revenues. So also if you compare Q4 2016 with Q1 2017, Italy's revenues are extremely -- increased dramatically. Now in Q2, we are coming back to more normalized levels because we no longer have this nonrecurrent component of this contract. But in terms of relationship with customers, we have not seen any price pressure. We are -- continue generating organic PoPs from traditional MNOs. It's interesting to see that all mobile Italian operators are pragmatic in terms of using our portfolio to densify the network. So other than this, I would say, one-off effect of the CommsCon contract, everything is in line and we are not seeing any pricing pressure."

You can find us in the communication of Sunrise at the moment of the Swiss project being communicated. You can see there perfectly well the initial EBITDA of the Swiss deal. This EUR 12 million is calculated as if we were going to do the closing by mid-August broadly speaking. So if you do your math, you will see that you can improve that figure up to more than EUR 30 million for the full year -- and well for the full year for 2017.
