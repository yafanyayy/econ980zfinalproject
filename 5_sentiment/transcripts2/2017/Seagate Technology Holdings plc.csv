Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business, Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights and I will close the call with our outlook for the March quarter as well as for the calendar year 2017.
Over the course of calendar 2016, Seagate exhibited discipline and focus and delivered 4 consecutive quarters of gross margin, operating margin and EPS improvements. The drivers of our improving performance, particularly in the December quarter, are a combination of market demand trends across our high-capacity storage solution portfolio, component cost optimization within our storage products and the structural cost improvements we are driving throughout our company, particularly within our manufacturing operations.
For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, GAAP gross margins of 31%, net income of $297 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32%, up over 600 basis points year-over-year, net income of $412 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.38, up 68% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $656 million, up 72% year-over-year. HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were 68.2 exabytes, representing the third consecutive quarter of record exabyte shipments and up approximately 13% year-over-year. HDD unit shipments were 39.9 million units. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was 1.7 terabytes per drive, up 30% year-over-year. ASPs of $66 were sequentially flat for the December quarter and up 12% year-over-year.
We believe Seagate's December quarter demand environment reflects a generally stable but mixed macroeconomic environment as well as the continued acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. In addition, we saw a strong sequential demand for higher-capacity products in the consumer, surveillance and mass markets. Our Cloud Systems and silicon group demonstrated sequential growth in the December quarter with particular strength through our Flash-based solutions. We are pleased with Seagate's execution in the December quarter and throughout calendar 2016, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution of our cost reductions. I'd like to thank Seagate's employees for their tremendous effort and contributions towards our business objectives.
I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on our operational activities."

For the December quarter, Se",797,"Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the December quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion. For the December quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was aligned with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product set sales towards our higher-capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results for the quarter. 
HDD enterprise revenue was up 5% year-over-year and represented 37% of our total consolidated revenue. Nearline product revenues were up 15% year-over-year, and our ATB nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU. Mission-critical product sales remained stable and were up slightly sequentially. HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DVR and mass markets and represent approximately 30% of total consolidated revenue. In the December quarter, revenue from these markets grew 19% year-over-year, and average capacity per drive across these markets was approximately 1.9 terabyte per drive, up 20% year-over-year. And PC client shipments continue to represent 24% of consolidated HDD revenue.
Operating expenses for the December quarter were $521 million on a GAAP basis and $458 million on a non-GAAP basis. During the December quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognize approximately $33 million in pretax restructuring charges. The magnitude of these cost efficiencies we implemented across our company in calendar 2016 to ensure the resiliency of our business has been upwards of $500 million over calendar 2015. In a short period of time, we have improved our factory utilization, reducing our manufacturing cost by approximately $200 million year-over-year. Operating expenses, excluding variable compensation, have been reduced by approximately $300 million year-over-year. We will continue to drive cost out of our manufacturing operations and operating expenses as we move through the fiscal year.
Capital expenditures were $95 million for the December quarter for maintenance capital supporting acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the manufacturing footprint reductions that are in progress across many sites. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at or very near full capacity.
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $656 million, and free cash flow was $561 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the December quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 295 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered [ph] maturities and low interest expense. Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, payable on April 5. Our December quarter dividend payout of $188 million is at the low end of our long-term target range of returning 30% to 50% of free cash flow. In addition, we deployed $147 million for the redemption of 4.1 million shares for the December quarter. Our ability to return to our long-term financial model in the December quarter is a reflection of our portfolio optimization as well as Seagate's operational cost reductions. From a market demand perspective, we continue to believe that optimizing our full HDD portfolio to the structural shifts and [ph] the application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. Combined with our Cloud Systems and silicon group, we view that approximately 80% of our storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 have growth potential. At the same time, we have structured our refresh portfolio to optimize the gains in [ph] aerial density improvements increasing storage capacity per drive and, in turn, this enabled us to lower our build [ph] material per drive and redeploy the internal head and media components towards our highest-margin products across the portfolio.
While we are still in the process of executing many actions, we believe the overall cost alignment activities and the new high-capacity and cost-advantaged products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year 2017. Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around the higher end of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32% and within our operating income margin targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY '17.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Over the course of 2016, Seagate demonstrated execution and focus towards structural improvements to our company's global operations. The ongoing shift from client/server to mobile cloud architectures continues to create significant opportunities for core technology providers, such as Seagate, with an expanding customer base in high value-add opportunities associated with data retention and data analytics. As Dave mentioned, we have a refreshed cost-optimized high-capacity portfolio that is well positioned in the consumer, CE [ph] surveillance and mass markets. Where we choose to participate in the PC market, we will lead with our 1-terabyte and higher products, and our desktop products remain highly competitive. We will continue to be extremely competitive in the enterprise market with our business-critical product portfolio. Our 8-terabyte product leads the market in cost and performance, and we are pleased with the ramp of our 10-terabyte product in terms of quality, performance and customer qualifications. For the last few quarters, our 12-terabyte product has been with customers for evaluation, and the feedback has been positive. 
During the next 12 to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads, with use cases from 2- to 4-terabyte products for certain applications up to 16-terabyte for other use cases. 
From a macro perspective, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. We expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016. For the March quarter, we anticipate the unit and exabyte demand environment to decline relatively seasonally. Our outlook for enterprise demand is stable, and we will continue to drive the high-capacity products in our portfolio and minimize exposure to the low-capacity HDD market. We are expecting to achieve revenues of approximately $2.7 billion, representing a slightly less seasonal decline in revenue than in the last 2 years. We expect to maintain margins at the mid to higher end of our long-term range at approximately 30%. The sequential decline is primarily due to seasonality and some factory underabsorption as we transition our facility and other activities through the end of June. Operating expenses will trend down sequentially to approximately $440 million, reflecting further cost measures. In addition, assuming market conditions remain intact, we believe Seagate will achieve revenue growth in calendar 2017 with earnings per share of at least $4.50. These are significantly improved expectations from where we were last June and position the company well for operating and financial performance in calendar 2018. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we will now open the call up for questions and answers."

With that said, we have not seen all the savings come through, and those are just on the activities that we've announced thus far.

Some of that has been masked a little bit by some of the variable compensation that's gone in to the first half, but we believe we're on a trajectory for that to continue to take steps down, exiting not only the March but continued into the back half of the year.

On the tax regulations side, Dave Morton spent a lot of work there, so I'll let him answer the question."

I think how do we think about it, first and foremost, whether or not it's dividends or buybacks. Number one thing we think about is maintaining enough investment in our core business to maintain the technology platforms that we have and the leadership positions we have. The technology, as we mentioned in the response to Sherri's question, is it's getting more difficult to deliver devices at 12, 14, 16, 20 terabyte takes a lot of investment a lot of technology. So first and foremost, we make sure that we're covered on that front. And then we obviously protect ourselves in terms of downsize or anything like that. And then if there's excess cash flow, we think about M&A opportunities or returns to shareholders. And I think the board has been fairly consistent when I expect that we remain being consistent of 30% to 50% of free cash flow being returned to the shareholders. That leaves us, given the cash flow generation capabilities of the company, that leaves us a lot of cash flow to do things like M&A. So it's not -- we don't think it constrains us in any way if we saw an opportunity that we felt was important to any sort of strategic direction we wanted to go in, and then it's just the issue between dividends and buybacks. And again, I think if you look at our history, we try and maintain a dividend base that is kind of at the low end of that range, and then what we do above that is probably buybacks, opportunistically when we see discrepancies in the valuation versus what we think the long-term value the company has."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business, Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights and I will close the call with our outlook for the March quarter as well as for the calendar year 2017.
Over the course of calendar 2016, Seagate exhibited discipline and focus and delivered 4 consecutive quarters of gross margin, operating margin and EPS improvements. The drivers of our improving performance, particularly in the December quarter, are a combination of market demand trends across our high-capacity storage solution portfolio, component cost optimization within our storage products and the structural cost improvements we are driving throughout our company, particularly within our manufacturing operations.
For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, GAAP gross margins of 31%, net income of $297 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32%, up over 600 basis points year-over-year, net income of $412 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.38, up 68% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $656 million, up 72% year-over-year. HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were 68.2 exabytes, representing the third consecutive quarter of record exabyte shipments and up approximately 13% year-over-year. HDD unit shipments were 39.9 million units. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was 1.7 terabytes per drive, up 30% year-over-year. ASPs of $66 were sequentially flat for the December quarter and up 12% year-over-year.
We believe Seagate's December quarter demand environment reflects a generally stable but mixed macroeconomic environment as well as the continued acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. In addition, we saw a strong sequential demand for higher-capacity products in the consumer, surveillance and NAS markets. Our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group demonstrated sequential growth in the December quarter with particular strength through our Flash-based solutions. We are pleased with Seagate's execution in the December quarter and throughout calendar 2016, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution of our cost reductions. I'd like to thank Seagate's employees for their tremendous effort and contributions towards our business objectives.
I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on our operational activities."

For the December quarter, Se",793,"Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the December quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion. For the December quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was aligned with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product set sales towards our higher-capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results for the quarter. 
HDD enterprise revenue was up 5% year-over-year and represented 37% of our total consolidated revenue. Nearline product revenues were up 15% year-over-year, and our ATB nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU. Mission-critical product sales remained stable and were up slightly sequentially. HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DVR and NAS markets and represent approximately 30% of total consolidated revenue. In the December quarter, revenue from these markets grew 19% year-over-year, and average capacity per drive across these markets was approximately 1.9 terabyte per drive, up 20% year-over-year. And PC client shipments continue to represent 24% of consolidated HDD revenue.
Operating expenses for the December quarter were $521 million on a GAAP basis and $458 million on a non-GAAP basis. During the December quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognize approximately $33 million in pretax restructuring charges. The magnitude of these cost efficiencies we implemented across our company in calendar 2016 to ensure the resiliency of our business has been upwards of $500 million over calendar 2015. In a short period of time, we have improved our factory utilization, reducing our manufacturing cost by approximately $200 million year-over-year. Operating expenses, excluding variable compensation, have been reduced by approximately $300 million year-over-year. We will continue to drive cost out of our manufacturing operations and operating expenses as we move through the fiscal year.
Capital expenditures were $95 million for the December quarter for maintenance capital supporting acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the manufacturing footprint reductions that are in progress across many sites. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at or very near full capacity.
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $656 million, and free cash flow was $561 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the December quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 295 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense. Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, payable on April 5. Our December quarter dividend payout of $188 million is at the low end of our long-term target range of returning 30% to 50% of free cash flow. In addition, we deployed $147 million for the redemption of 4.1 million shares for the December quarter. Our ability to return to our long-term financial model in the December quarter is a reflection of our portfolio optimization as well as Seagate's operational cost reductions. From a market demand perspective, we continue to believe that optimizing our full HDD portfolio to the structural shifts and the application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we view that approximately 80% of our storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 have growth potential. At the same time, we have structured our refresh portfolio to optimize the gains in aerial density improvements increasing storage capacity per drive and, in turn, this enables us to lower our build material per drive and redeploy the internal head and media components towards our highest-margin products across the portfolio.
While we are still in the process of executing many actions, we believe the overall cost alignment activities and the new high-capacity and cost-advantaged products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year 2017. Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around the higher end of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32% and within our operating income margin targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY '17.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Over the course of 2016, Seagate demonstrated execution and focus towards structural improvements to our company's global operations. The ongoing shift from client/server to mobile cloud architectures continues to create significant opportunities for core technology providers, such as Seagate, with an expanding customer base in high value-add opportunities associated with data retention and data analytics. As Dave mentioned, we have a refreshed cost-optimized high-capacity portfolio that is well positioned in the consumer, CE, surveillance and NAS markets. Where we choose to participate in the PC market, we will lead with our 1-terabyte and higher products, and our desktop products remain highly competitive. We will continue to be extremely competitive in the enterprise market with our business-critical product portfolio. Our 8-terabyte product leads the market in cost and performance, and we are pleased with the ramp of our 10-terabyte product in terms of quality, performance and customer qualifications. For the last few quarters, our 12-terabyte product has been with customers for evaluation, and the feedback has been positive. 
During the next 12 to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads, with use cases from 2- to 4-terabyte products for certain applications up to 16-terabyte for other use cases. 
From a macro perspective, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. We expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016. For the March quarter, we anticipate the unit and exabyte demand environment to decline relatively seasonally. Our outlook for enterprise demand is stable, and we will continue to drive the high-capacity products in our portfolio and minimize exposure to the low-capacity HDD market. We are expecting to achieve revenues of approximately $2.7 billion, representing a slightly less seasonal decline in revenue than in the last 2 years. We expect to maintain margins at the mid to higher end of our long-term range at approximately 30%. The sequential decline is primarily due to seasonality and some factory underabsorption as we transition our Suzhou facility and other activities through the end of June. Operating expenses will trend down sequentially to approximately $440 million, reflecting further cost measures. In addition, assuming market conditions remain intact, we believe Seagate will achieve revenue growth in calendar 2017, with earnings per share of at least $4.50. These are significantly improved expectations from where we were last June and positions the company well for operating and financial performance in calendar 2018. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we will now open the call up for questions and answers."

So for the market that we're in, we actually would say that it's probably going to be a growing market because we see growth in all those applications that require high capacity. And then within that, obviously, because it's the highest capacity technology that we're using then it's lots of heads and disk absorption, which goes along with units. And as you know, growing from 8 to 10 to 12 to 16, you're going from 6- to 8-disk at least on the nearline products, and we do think there's opportunities for more heads and disk on desktop and notebook as people need higher capacity as well. So I think, from an absorption perspective, we feel pretty good, better than pretty good about calendar 2017 in terms of what it means in terms of our factory absorption, which is really what you're asking. And no, we don't need disk drive unit growth to drive factory absorption like we used to because the demand profile now is all about high-capacity drives, not about lots of little drives that aren't connected that go into PCs."

I think how do we think about it, first and foremost, whether or not it's dividends or buybacks. Number one thing we think about is maintaining enough investment in our core business to maintain the technology platforms that we have and the leadership positions we have. The technology, as we mentioned in the response to Sherri's question, is it's getting more difficult to deliver devices at 12, 14, 16, 20 terabytes. It takes a lot of investment, a lot of technology. So first and foremost, we make sure that we're covered on that front. And then we obviously protect ourselves in terms of downsides or anything like that. And then if there's excess cash flow, we think about M&A opportunities or returns to shareholders. And I think the board has been fairly consistent and expect to remain being consistent of 30% to 50% of free cash flow being returned to the shareholders. That leaves us, given the cash flow generation capabilities of the company, that leaves us a lot of cash flow to do things like M&A. So it's not -- we don't think it constrains us in any way if we saw an opportunity that we felt was important to any sort of strategic direction we wanted to go in. And then it's just the issue between dividends and buybacks. And again, I think if you look at our history, we try and maintain a dividend base that is kind of at the low end of that range. And then what we do above that is probably buybacks opportunistically when we see discrepancies in the valuation versus what we think the long-term value of the company is."

For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business, Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights and I will close the call with our outlook for the March quarter as well as for the calendar year 2017.
Over the course of calendar 2016, Seagate exhibited discipline and focus and delivered 4 consecutive quarters of gross margin, operating margin and EPS improvements. The drivers of our improving performance, particularly in the December quarter, are a combination of market demand trends across our high-capacity storage solution portfolio, component cost optimization within our storage products and the structural cost improvements we are driving throughout our company, particularly within our manufacturing operations.
For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, GAAP gross margins of 31%, net income of $297 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32%, up over 600 basis points year-over-year, net income of $412 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.38, up 68% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $656 million, up 72% year-over-year. HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were 68.2 exabytes, representing the third consecutive quarter of record exabyte shipments and up approximately 13% year-over-year. HDD unit shipments were 39.9 million units. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was 1.7 terabytes per drive, up 30% year-over-year. ASPs of $66 were sequentially flat for the December quarter and up 12% year-over-year.
We believe Seagate's December quarter demand environment reflects a generally stable but mixed macroeconomic environment as well as the continued acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. In addition, we saw a strong sequential demand for higher-capacity products in the consumer, surveillance and NAS markets. Our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group demonstrated sequential growth in the December quarter with particular strength through our Flash-based solutions. We are pleased with Seagate's execution in the December quarter and throughout calendar 2016, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution of our cost reductions. I'd like to thank Seagate's employees for their tremendous effort and contributions towards our business objectives.
I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on our operational activities."

For the December quarter, Se",794,"Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the December quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion. For the December quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was in line with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product set sales towards our higher-capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results for the quarter. 
HDD enterprise revenue was up 5% year-over-year and represented 37% of our total consolidated revenue. Nearline product revenues were up 15% year-over-year, and our ATB nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU. Mission-critical product sales remained stable and were up slightly sequentially. HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DVR and NAS markets and represent approximately 30% of total consolidated revenue. In the December quarter, revenue from these markets grew 19% year-over-year, and average capacity per drive across these markets was approximately 1.9 terabyte per drive, up 20% year-over-year. And PC client shipments continue to represent 24% of consolidated HDD revenue.
Operating expenses for the December quarter were $521 million on a GAAP basis and $458 million on a non-GAAP basis. During the December quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $33 million in pretax restructuring charges. The magnitude of these cost efficiencies we implemented across our company in calendar 2016 to ensure the resiliency of our business has been upwards of $500 million over calendar 2015. In a short period of time, we have improved our factory utilization, reducing our manufacturing cost by approximately $200 million year-over-year. Operating expenses, excluding variable compensation, have been reduced by approximately $300 million year-over-year. We will continue to drive cost out of our manufacturing operations and operating expenses as we move through the fiscal year.
Capital expenditures were $95 million for the December quarter for maintenance capital supporting acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the manufacturing footprint reductions that are in progress across many sites. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at or very near full capacity.
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $656 million, and free cash flow was $561 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the December quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 295 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense. 
Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, payable on April 5. Our December quarter dividend payout of $188 million is at the low end of our long-term target range of returning 30% to 50% of free cash flow. In addition, we deployed $147 million for the redemption of 4.1 million shares for the December quarter. Our ability to return to our long-term financial model in the December quarter is a reflection of our portfolio optimization as well as Seagate's operational cost reductions. 
From a market demand perspective, we continue to believe that optimizing our full HDD portfolio to the structural shifts in the application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we view that approximately 80% of our storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 have growth potential. At the same time, we have structured our refresh portfolio to optimize the gains in aerial density improvements increasing storage capacity per drive and, in turn, this enables us to lower our build material per drive and redeploy the internal head and media components towards our highest-margin products across the portfolio.
While we are still in the process of executing many actions, we believe the overall cost alignment activities and the new high-capacity and cost-advantaged products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year 2017. Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around the higher end of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32% and within our operating income margin targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY '17.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Over the course of 2016, Seagate demonstrated execution and focus towards structural improvements to our company's global operations. The ongoing shift from client/server to mobile cloud architectures continues to create significant opportunities for core technology providers, such as Seagate, with an expanding customer base in high value-add opportunities associated with data retention and data analytics. 
As Dave mentioned, we have a refreshed cost-optimized high-capacity portfolio that is well positioned in the consumer, CE, surveillance and NAS markets. Where we choose to participate in the PC market, we will lead with our 1-terabyte and higher products, and our desktop products remain highly competitive. We will continue to be extremely competitive in the enterprise market with our business-critical product portfolio. Our 8-terabyte product leads the market in cost and performance, and we are pleased with the ramp of our 10-terabyte product in terms of quality, performance and customer qualifications. For the last few quarters, our 12-terabyte product has been with customers for evaluation, and the feedback has been positive. 
During the next 12 to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads, with use cases from 2- to 4-terabyte products for certain applications up to 16-terabyte for other use cases. 
From a macro perspective, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. We expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016. For the March quarter, we anticipate the unit and exabyte demand environment to decline relatively seasonally. Our outlook for enterprise demand is stable, and we will continue to drive the high-capacity products in our portfolio and minimize exposure to the low-capacity HDD market. We are expecting to achieve revenues of approximately $2.7 billion, representing a slightly less seasonal decline in revenue than in the last 2 years. We expect to maintain margins at the mid to higher end of our long-term range at approximately 30%. The sequential decline is primarily due to seasonality and some factory underabsorption as we transition our Suzhou facility and other activities through the end of June. 
Operating expenses will trend down sequentially to approximately $440 million, reflecting further cost measures. In addition, assuming market conditions remain intact, we believe Seagate will achieve revenue growth in calendar 2017, with earnings per share of at least $4.50. These are significantly improved expectations from where we were last June and positions the company well for operating and financial performance in calendar 2018. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we will now open the call up for questions and answers."

Is this the right level what we're seeing here for the March quarter exiting the year? How is the progress?"

I'll tackle some of the OpEx ones and then turn it over to Dave Mosley to address some of the COGS and the improved efficiency there. I would take you back to middle of last year where we had approximately 2 8-Ks that we signaled upwards of $225 million of restructuring. We've had a significant amount of that get recognized in the P&L as we've noticed on -- in the 8-K. With that said, we haven't necessarily seen all the savings come through, and those are just on the activities that we've announced thus far. And so as you think about the OpEx, that's going to continue to trend down. Now some of that's been masked a little bit by some of the variable compensation that's gone in to the first half, but we believe we're on a trajectory for that to continue to take steps down, exiting not only the March but continued into the back half of the year. So that's our alignment right now. And then, Dave, in regards to..."

I think for us, though, Sherri, remember you always have to think about the market that we're focused on, which is what we're trying to get people understand that the Seagate addressable market is probably going to be diverging from what the other competitors think of as the market. So for the market that we're in, we actually would say that it's probably going to be a growing market because we see growth in all those applications that require high capacity. And then within that, obviously, because it's the highest capacity technology that we're using then it's lots of heads and disk absorption, which goes along with units. And as you know, growing from 8 to 10 to 12 to 16, you're going from 6- to 8-disk at least on the nearline products, and we do think there's opportunities for more heads and disk on desktop and notebook as people need higher capacity as well. So I think, from an absorption perspective, we feel pretty good, better than pretty good about calendar 2017 in terms of what it means in terms of our factory absorption, which is really what you're asking. And no, we don't need disk drive unit growth to drive factory absorption like we used to because the demand profile now is all about high-capacity drives, not about lots of little drives that aren't connected that go into PCs."

The technology, as we mentioned in the response to Sherri's question, is it's getting more difficult to deliver devices at 12, 14, 16, 20 terabytes. It takes a lot of investment, a lot of technology. So first and foremost, we make sure that we're covered on that front. And then we obviously protect ourselves in terms of downsides or anything like that. And then if there's excess cash flow, we think about M&A opportunities or returns to shareholders. And I think the board has been fairly consistent and I expect they'll remain consistent of 30% to 50% of free cash flow being returned to the shareholders. That leaves us, given the cash flow generation capabilities of the company, that leaves us a lot of cash flow to do things like M&A. So it's not -- we don't think it constrains us in any way if we saw an opportunity that we felt was important to any sort of strategic direction we wanted to go in. And then it's just the issue between dividends and buybacks. And again, I think if you look at our history, we try and maintain a dividend base that is kind of at the low end of that range.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business, Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights and I will close the call with our outlook for the March quarter as well as for the calendar year 2017.
Over the course of calendar 2016, Seagate exhibited discipline and focus and delivered 4 consecutive quarters of gross margin, operating margin and EPS improvements. The drivers of our improving performance, particularly in the December quarter, are a combination of market demand trends across our high-capacity storage solution portfolio, component cost optimization within our storage products and the structural cost improvements we are driving throughout our company, particularly within our manufacturing operations.
For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, GAAP gross margins of 31%, net income of $297 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32%, up over 600 basis points year-over-year, net income of $412 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.38, up 68% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $656 million, up 72% year-over-year. HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were 68.2 exabytes, representing the third consecutive quarter of record exabyte shipments and up approximately 13% year-over-year. HDD unit shipments were 39.9 million units. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was 1.7 terabytes per drive, up 30% year-over-year. ASPs of $66 were sequentially flat for the December quarter and up 12% year-over-year.
We believe Seagate's December quarter demand environment reflects a generally stable but mixed macroeconomic environment as well as the continued acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. In addition, we saw a strong sequential demand for higher-capacity products in the consumer, surveillance and NAS markets. Our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group demonstrated sequential growth in the December quarter with particular strength through our Flash-based solutions. We are pleased with Seagate's execution in the December quarter and throughout calendar 2016, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution of our cost reductions. I'd like to thank Seagate's employees for their tremendous effort and contributions towards our business objectives.
I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on our operational activities."

With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the December quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion. For the December quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was in line with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product set sales towards our higher-capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results for the quarter. 
HDD enterprise revenue was up 5% year-over-year and represented 37% of our total consolidated revenue. Nearline product revenues were up 15% year-over-year, and our ATB nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU. Mission-critical product sales remained stable and were up slightly sequentially. HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DVR and NAS markets and represent approximately 30% of total consolidated revenue. In the December quarter, revenue from these markets grew 19% year-over-year, and average capacity per drive across these markets was approximately 1.9 terabyte per drive, up 20% year-over-year. And PC client shipments continue to represent 24% of consolidated HDD revenue.
Operating expenses for the December quarter were $521 million on a GAAP basis and $458 million on a non-GAAP basis. During the December quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $33 million in pretax restructuring charges. The magnitude of these cost efficiencies we implemented across our company in calendar 2016 to ensure the resiliency of our business has been upwards of $500 million over calendar 2015. In a short period of time, we have improved our factory utilization, reducing our manufacturing cost by approximately $200 million year-over-year. Operating expenses, excluding variable compensation, have been reduced by approximately $300 million year-over-year. We will continue to drive cost out of our manufacturing operations and operating expenses as we move through the fiscal year.
Capital expenditures were $95 million for the December quarter for maintenance capital supporting acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the manufacturing footprint reductions that are in progress across many sites. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at or very near full capacity.
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $656 million, and free cash flow was $561 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the December quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 295 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense. 
Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, payable on April 5. Our December quarter dividend payout of $188 million is at the low end of our long-term target range of returning 30% to 50% of free cash flow. In addition, we deployed $147 million for the redemption of 4.1 million shares for the December quarter. Our ability to return to our long-term financial model in the December quarter is a reflection of our portfolio optimization as well as Seagate's operational cost reductions. 
From a market demand perspective, we continue to believe that optimizing our full HDD portfolio to the structural shifts in the application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we view that approximately 80% of our storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 have growth potential. At the same time, we have structured our refresh portfolio to optimize the gains in aerial density improvements increasing storage capacity per drive and, in turn, this enables us to lower our build material per drive and redeploy the internal head and media components towards our highest-margin products across the portfolio.
While we are still in the process of executing many actions, we believe the overall cost alignment activities and the new high-capacity and cost-advantaged products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year 2017. Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around the higher end of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32% and within our operating income margin targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY '17.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Over the course of 2016, Seagate demonstrated execution and focus towards structural improvements to our company's global operations. The ongoing shift from client/server to mobile cloud architectures continues to create significant opportunities for core technology providers, such as Seagate, with an expanding customer base in high value-add opportunities associated with data retention and data analytics. 
As Dave mentioned, we have a refreshed cost-optimized high-capacity portfolio that is well positioned in the consumer, CE, surveillance and NAS markets. Where we choose to participate in the PC market, we will lead with our 1-terabyte and higher products, and our desktop products remain highly competitive. We will continue to be extremely competitive in the enterprise market with our business-critical product portfolio. Our 8-terabyte product leads the market in cost and performance, and we are pleased with the ramp of our 10-terabyte product in terms of quality, performance and customer qualifications. For the last few quarters, our 12-terabyte product has been with customers for evaluation, and the feedback has been positive. 
During the next 12 to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads, with use cases from 2- to 4-terabyte products for certain applications up to 16-terabyte for other use cases. 
From a macro perspective, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. We expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016. For the March quarter, we anticipate the unit and exabyte demand environment to decline relatively seasonally. Our outlook for enterprise demand is stable, and we will continue to drive the high-capacity products in our portfolio and minimize exposure to the low-capacity HDD market. We are expecting to achieve revenues of approximately $2.7 billion, representing a slightly less seasonal decline in revenue than in the last 2 years. We expect to maintain margins at the mid to higher end of our long-term range at approximately 30%. The sequential decline is primarily due to seasonality and some factory underabsorption as we transition our Suzhou facility and other activities through the end of June. 
Operating expenses will trend down sequentially to approximately $440 million, reflecting further cost measures. In addition, assuming market conditions remain intact, we believe Seagate will achieve revenue growth in calendar 2017, with earnings per share of at least $4.50. These are significantly improved expectations from where we were last June and positions the company well for operating and financial performance in calendar 2018. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we will now open the call up for questions and answers."

With that said, we haven't necessarily seen all the savings come through, and those are just on the activities that we've announced thus far. And so as you think about the OpEx, that's going to continue to trend down.

So for the market that we're in, we actually would say that it's probably going to be a growing market because we see growth in all those applications that require high capacity. And then within that, obviously, because it's the highest capacity technology that we're using then it's lots of heads and disk absorption, which goes along with units. And as you know, growing from 8 to 10 to 12 to 16, you're going from 6- to 8-disk at least on the nearline products, and we do think there's opportunities for more heads and disk on desktop and notebook as people need higher capacity as well. So I think, from an absorption perspective, we feel pretty good, better than pretty good about calendar 2017 in terms of what it means in terms of our factory absorption, which is really what you're asking.

The technology, as we mentioned in the response to Sherri's question, is it's getting more difficult to deliver devices at 12, 14, 16, 20 terabytes. It takes a lot of investment, a lot of technology. So first and foremost, we make sure that we're covered on that front. And then we obviously protect ourselves in terms of downsides or anything like that. And then if there's excess cash flow, we think about M&A opportunities or returns to shareholders. And I think the board has been fairly consistent and I expect they'll remain consistent of 30% to 50% of free cash flow being returned to the shareholders. That leaves us, given the cash flow generation capabilities of the company, that leaves us a lot of cash flow to do things like M&A. So it's not -- we don't think it constrains us in any way if we saw an opportunity that we felt was important to any sort of strategic direction we wanted to go in. And then it's just the issue between dividends and buybacks. And again, I think if you look at our history, we try and maintain a dividend base that is kind of at the low end of that range. And then what we do above that is probably buybacks opportunistically when we see discrepancies in the valuation versus what we think the long-term value of the company is."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business, Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights and I will close the call with our outlook for the March quarter as well as for the calendar year 2017.
Over the course of calendar 2016, Seagate exhibited discipline and focus and delivered 4 consecutive quarters of gross margin, operating margin and EPS improvements. The drivers of our improving performance, particularly in the December quarter, are a combination of market demand trends across our high-capacity storage solution portfolio, component cost optimization within our storage products and the structural cost improvements we are driving throughout our company, particularly within our manufacturing operations.
For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, GAAP gross margins of 31%, net income of $297 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32%, up over 600 basis points year-over-year, net income of $412 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.38, up 68% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $656 million, up 72% year-over-year. HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were 68.2 exabytes, representing the third consecutive quarter of record exabyte shipments and up approximately 13% year-over-year. HDD unit shipments were 39.9 million units. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was 1.7 terabytes per drive, up 30% year-over-year. ASPs of $66 were sequentially flat for the December quarter and up 12% year-over-year.
We believe Seagate's December quarter demand environment reflects a generally stable but mixed macroeconomic environment as well as the continued acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. In addition, we saw a strong sequential demand for higher-capacity products in the consumer, surveillance and NAS markets. Our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group demonstrated sequential growth in the December quarter with particular strength through our Flash-based solutions. We are pleased with Seagate's execution in the December quarter and throughout calendar 2016, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution of our cost reductions. I'd like to thank Seagate's employees for their tremendous effort and contributions towards our business objectives.
I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on our operational activities."

For the December quarter, Se",794,"Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the December quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion. For the December quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was in line with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product set sales towards our higher-capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results for the quarter. 
HDD enterprise revenue was up 5% year-over-year and represented 37% of our total consolidated revenue. Nearline product revenues were up 15% year-over-year, and our ATB nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU. Mission-critical product sales remained stable and were up slightly sequentially. HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DVR and NAS markets and represent approximately 30% of total consolidated revenue. In the December quarter, revenue from these markets grew 19% year-over-year, and average capacity per drive across these markets was approximately 1.9 terabyte per drive, up 20% year-over-year. And PC client shipments continue to represent 24% of consolidated HDD revenue.
Operating expenses for the December quarter were $521 million on a GAAP basis and $458 million on a non-GAAP basis. During the December quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $33 million in pretax restructuring charges. The magnitude of these cost efficiencies we implemented across our company in calendar 2016 to ensure the resiliency of our business has been upwards of $500 million over calendar 2015. In a short period of time, we have improved our factory utilization, reducing our manufacturing cost by approximately $200 million year-over-year. Operating expenses, excluding variable compensation, have been reduced by approximately $300 million year-over-year. We will continue to drive cost out of our manufacturing operations and operating expenses as we move through the fiscal year.
Capital expenditures were $95 million for the December quarter for maintenance capital supporting acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the manufacturing footprint reductions that are in progress across many sites. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at or very near full capacity.
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $656 million, and free cash flow was $561 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the December quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 295 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense. 
Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, payable on April 5. Our December quarter dividend payout of $188 million is at the low end of our long-term target range of returning 30% to 50% of free cash flow. In addition, we deployed $147 million for the redemption of 4.1 million shares for the December quarter. Our ability to return to our long-term financial model in the December quarter is a reflection of our portfolio optimization as well as Seagate's operational cost reductions. 
From a market demand perspective, we continue to believe that optimizing our full HDD portfolio to the structural shifts in the application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we view that approximately 80% of our storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 have growth potential. At the same time, we have structured our refresh portfolio to optimize the gains in aerial density improvements increasing storage capacity per drive and, in turn, this enables us to lower our build material per drive and redeploy the internal head and media components towards our highest-margin products across the portfolio.
While we are still in the process of executing many actions, we believe the overall cost alignment activities and the new high-capacity and cost-advantaged products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year 2017. Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around the higher end of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32% and within our operating income margin targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY '17.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Over the course of 2016, Seagate demonstrated execution and focus towards structural improvements to our company's global operations. The ongoing shift from client/server to mobile cloud architectures continues to create significant opportunities for core technology providers, such as Seagate, with an expanding customer base in high value-add opportunities associated with data retention and data analytics. 
As Dave mentioned, we have a refreshed cost-optimized high-capacity portfolio that is well positioned in the consumer, CE, surveillance and NAS markets. Where we choose to participate in the PC market, we will lead with our 1-terabyte and higher products, and our desktop products remain highly competitive. We will continue to be extremely competitive in the enterprise market with our business-critical product portfolio. Our 8-terabyte product leads the market in cost and performance, and we are pleased with the ramp of our 10-terabyte product in terms of quality, performance and customer qualifications. For the last few quarters, our 12-terabyte product has been with customers for evaluation, and the feedback has been positive. 
During the next 12 to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads, with use cases from 2- to 4-terabyte products for certain applications up to 16-terabyte for other use cases. 
From a macro perspective, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. We expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016. For the March quarter, we anticipate the unit and exabyte demand environment to decline relatively seasonally. Our outlook for enterprise demand is stable, and we will continue to drive the high-capacity products in our portfolio and minimize exposure to the low-capacity HDD market. We are expecting to achieve revenues of approximately $2.7 billion, representing a slightly less seasonal decline in revenue than in the last 2 years. We expect to maintain margins at the mid to higher end of our long-term range at approximately 30%. The sequential decline is primarily due to seasonality and some factory underabsorption as we transition our Suzhou facility and other activities through the end of June. 
Operating expenses will trend down sequentially to approximately $440 million, reflecting further cost measures. In addition, assuming market conditions remain intact, we believe Seagate will achieve revenue growth in calendar 2017, with earnings per share of at least $4.50. These are significantly improved expectations from where we were last June and positions the company well for operating and financial performance in calendar 2018. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we will now open the call up for questions and answers."

So for the market that we're in, we actually would say that it's probably going to be a growing market because we see growth in all those applications that require high capacity. And then within that, obviously, because it's the highest capacity technology that we're using then it's lots of heads and disk absorption, which goes along with units. And as you know, growing from 8 to 10 to 12 to 16, you're going from 6- to 8-disk at least on the nearline products, and we do think there's opportunities for more heads and disk on desktop and notebook as people need higher capacity as well. So I think, from an absorption perspective, we feel pretty good, better than pretty good about calendar 2017 in terms of what it means in terms of our factory absorption, which is really what you're asking. And no, we don't need disk drive unit growth to drive factory absorption like we used to because the demand profile now is all about high-capacity drives, not about lots of little drives that aren't connected that go into PCs."

I think how do we think about it, first and foremost, whether or not it's dividends or buybacks. #1 thing we think about is maintaining enough investment in our core business to maintain the technology platforms that we have and the leadership positions we have. The technology, as we mentioned in the response to Sherri's question, is it's getting more difficult to deliver devices at 12, 14, 16, 20 terabytes. It takes a lot of investment, a lot of technology. So first and foremost, we make sure that we're covered on that front. And then we obviously protect ourselves in terms of downsides or anything like that. And then if there's excess cash flow, we think about M&A opportunities or returns to shareholders. And I think the board has been fairly consistent and I expect they'll remain consistent of 30% to 50% of free cash flow being returned to the shareholders. That leaves us, given the cash flow generation capabilities of the company, that leaves us a lot of cash flow to do things like M&A. So it's not -- we don't think it constrains us in any way if we saw an opportunity that we felt was important to any sort of strategic direction we wanted to go in. And then it's just the issue between dividends and buybacks. And again, I think if you look at our history, we try and maintain a dividend base that is kind of at the low end of that range. And then what we do above that is probably buybacks opportunistically when we see discrepancies in the valuation versus what we think the long-term value of the company is."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business, Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights and I will close the call with our outlook for the March quarter as well as for the calendar year 2017.
Over the course of calendar 2016, Seagate exhibited discipline and focus and delivered 4 consecutive quarters of gross margin, operating margin and EPS improvements. The drivers of our improving performance, particularly in the December quarter, are a combination of market demand trends across our high-capacity storage solution portfolio, component cost optimization within our storage products and the structural cost improvements we are driving throughout our company, particularly within our manufacturing operations.
For the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, GAAP gross margins of 31%, net income of $297 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32%, up over 600 basis points year-over-year, net income of $412 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.38, up 68% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $656 million, up 72% year-over-year. HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were 68.2 exabytes, representing the third consecutive quarter of record exabyte shipments and up approximately 13% year-over-year. HDD unit shipments were 39.9 million units. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was 1.7 terabytes per drive, up 30% year-over-year. ASPs of $66 were sequentially flat for the December quarter and up 12% year-over-year.
We believe Seagate's December quarter demand environment reflects a generally stable but mixed macroeconomic environment as well as the continued acceleration in the deployment of cloud-based storage associated with usage shifts of technologies and architectures by end users. In addition, we saw a strong sequential demand for higher-capacity products in the consumer, surveillance and NAS markets. Our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group demonstrated sequential growth in the December quarter with particular strength through our Flash-based solutions. We are pleased with Seagate's execution in the December quarter and throughout calendar 2016, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our technology portfolio and our continued execution of our cost reductions. I'd like to thank Seagate's employees for their tremendous effort and contributions towards our business objectives.
I will turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on our operational activities."

For the December quarter, Se",794,"Thanks, Steve. With the shifts taking place in Seagate's business, there are a few specific areas of our financial performance in the December quarter that I would like to provide further context to Steve's earlier discussion. For the December quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was in line with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product set sales towards our higher-capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results for the quarter. 
HDD enterprise revenue was up 5% year-over-year and represented 37% of our total consolidated revenue. Nearline product revenues were up 15% year-over-year, and our ATB nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU. Mission-critical product sales remained stable and were up slightly sequentially. HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DVR and NAS markets and represent approximately 30% of total consolidated revenue. In the December quarter, revenue from these markets grew 19% year-over-year, and average capacity per drive across these markets was approximately 1.9 terabyte per drive, up 20% year-over-year. And PC client shipments continue to represent 24% of consolidated HDD revenue.
Operating expenses for the December quarter were $521 million on a GAAP basis and $458 million on a non-GAAP basis. During the December quarter, we implemented certain cost reduction activities and recognized approximately $33 million in pretax restructuring charges. The magnitude of these cost efficiencies we implemented across our company in calendar 2016 to ensure the resiliency of our business has been upwards of $500 million over calendar 2015. In a short period of time, we have improved our factory utilization, reducing our manufacturing cost by approximately $200 million year-over-year. Operating expenses, excluding variable compensation, have been reduced by approximately $300 million year-over-year. We will continue to drive cost out of our manufacturing operations and operating expenses as we move through the fiscal year.
Capital expenditures were $95 million for the December quarter for maintenance capital supporting acceleration of the ramp of new products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment and the accelerated expansion of our Korat facility to expedite the manufacturing footprint reductions that are in progress across many sites. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at or very near full capacity.
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $656 million, and free cash flow was $561 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the December quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 295 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our debt structure and level of interest expense is well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest expense. 
Due to the confidence in our cash flow generation, our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, payable on April 5. Our December quarter dividend payout of $188 million is at the low end of our long-term target range of returning 30% to 50% of free cash flow. In addition, we deployed $147 million for the redemption of 4.1 million shares for the December quarter. Our ability to return to our long-term financial model in the December quarter is a reflection of our portfolio optimization as well as Seagate's operational cost reductions. 
From a market demand perspective, we continue to believe that optimizing our full HDD portfolio to the structural shifts in the application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we view that approximately 80% of our storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 have growth potential. At the same time, we have structured our refresh portfolio to optimize the gains in areal density improvements increasing storage capacity per drive and, in turn, this enables us to lower our build material per drive and redeploy the internal head and media components towards our highest-margin products across the portfolio.
While we are still in the process of executing many actions, we believe the overall cost alignment activities and the new high-capacity and cost-advantaged products within our HDD product portfolio refresh will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of the fiscal and calendar year 2017. Given the current demand outlook and assuming a stable macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to remain around the higher end of our long-term targeted margin range of 27% to 32% and within our operating income margin targeted range of 13% to 15% for FY '17.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Over the course of 2016, Seagate demonstrated execution and focus towards structural improvements to our company's global operations. The ongoing shift from client/server to mobile cloud architectures continues to create significant opportunities for core technology providers, such as Seagate, with an expanding customer base in high value-add opportunities associated with data retention and data analytics. 
As Dave mentioned, we have a refreshed cost-optimized high-capacity portfolio that is well positioned in the consumer, CE, surveillance and NAS markets. Where we choose to participate in the PC market, we will lead with our 1-terabyte and higher products, and our desktop products remain highly competitive. We will continue to be extremely competitive in the enterprise market with our business-critical product portfolio. Our 8-terabyte product leads the market in cost and performance, and we are pleased with the ramp of our 10-terabyte product in terms of quality, performance and customer qualifications. For the last few quarters, our 12-terabyte product has been with customers for evaluation, and the feedback has been positive. 
During the next 12 to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads, with use cases from 2- to 4-terabyte products for certain applications up to 16-terabyte for other use cases. 
From a macro perspective, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. We expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016. For the March quarter, we anticipate the unit and exabyte demand environment to decline relatively seasonally. Our outlook for enterprise demand is stable, and we will continue to drive the high-capacity products in our portfolio and minimize exposure to the low-capacity HDD market. We are expecting to achieve revenues of approximately $2.7 billion, representing a slightly less seasonal decline in revenue than in the last 2 years. We expect to maintain margins at the mid to higher end of our long-term range at approximately 30%. The sequential decline is primarily due to seasonality and some factory underabsorption as we transition our Suzhou facility and other activities through the end of June. 
Operating expenses will trend down sequentially to approximately $440 million, reflecting further cost measures. In addition, assuming market conditions remain intact, we believe Seagate will achieve revenue growth in calendar 2017, with earnings per share of at least $4.50. These are significantly improved expectations from where we were last June and positions the company well for operating and financial performance in calendar 2018. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we will now open the call up for questions and answers."

I think for us, though, Sherri, remember you always have to think about the market that we're focused on, which is what we're trying to get people understand that the Seagate addressable market is probably going to be diverging from what the other competitors think of as the market. So for the market that we're in, we actually would say that it's probably going to be a growing market because we see growth in all those applications that require high capacity. And then within that, obviously, because it's the highest capacity technology that we're using then it's lots of heads and disk absorption, which goes along with units. And as you know, growing from 8 to 10 to 12 to 16, you're going from 6- to 8-disk at least on the nearline products, and we do think there's opportunities for more heads and disk on desktop and notebook as people need higher capacity as well. So I think, from an absorption perspective, we feel pretty good, better than pretty good about calendar 2017 in terms of what it means in terms of our factory absorption, which is really what you're asking. And no, we don't need disk drive unit growth to drive factory absorption like we used to because the demand profile now is all about high-capacity drives, not about lots of little drives that aren't connected that go into PCs."

I think how do we think about it, first and foremost, whether or not it's dividends or buybacks. #1 thing we think about is maintaining enough investment in our core business to maintain the technology platforms that we have and the leadership positions we have. The technology, as we mentioned in the response to Sherri's question, is it's getting more difficult to deliver devices at 12, 14, 16, 20 terabytes. It takes a lot of investment, a lot of technology. So first and foremost, we make sure that we're covered on that front. And then we obviously protect ourselves in terms of downsides or anything like that. And then if there's excess cash flow, we think about M&A opportunities or returns to shareholders. And I think the board has been fairly consistent and I expect they'll remain consistent of 30% to 50% of free cash flow being returned to the shareholders. That leaves us, given the cash flow generation capabilities of the company, that leaves us a lot of cash flow to do things like M&A. So it's not -- we don't think it constrains us in any way if we saw an opportunity that we felt was important to any sort of strategic direction we wanted to go in. And then it's just the issue between dividends and buybacks. And again, I think if you look at our history, we try and maintain a dividend base that is kind of at the low end of that range. And then what we do above that is probably buybacks opportunistically when we see discrepancies in the valuation versus what we think the long-term value of the company is."

We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information for our March quarter fiscal '17 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. For the last few years, we have communicated the belief that data growth trends will continue to drive storage exabyte demand and the related measurement of capacity per drive and that units are less relevant to mobile cloud environments and future client addressable markets. In today's newly deployed architectures and applications, high-capacity mass storage is critical. Importantly for Seagate, it is the Advanced Technology media as well as manufacturing absorption of these technologies and test capacity absorption that will most significantly impact our financial performance.
Going forward, we will continue orienting our conference call remarks and supplemental data to key market exabyte results and other business metrics and discontinue providing unit detail. We recognize this represents a change with the investment community in the short term but believe it better reflects how we are managing and measuring our business performance internally and will help our industry to be evaluated more effectively in a forward-looking manner.
During today's call, we will review the highlights for the March quarter and provide the company outlook for the June quarter and then open the call for questions. We are planning for the call today to go approximately 0.5 hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits.
We will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures on this call. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investors section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.
As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand, technology and product development advancements and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning our risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the Investors section of the company's website.

For the March quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was relatively in line with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product sales towards our higher-capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results year-over-year. 
HDD enterprise revenues were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 20% year-over-year and representing 36% of our total consolidated revenue. Within this, nearline revenues were up 9% year-over-year and represented 24% of our total consolidated revenue. Hyperscale nearline revenues were up strong double digits, and our 8 terabyte nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU. Our HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DDR and mass markets. Revenues from these markets were up 25% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 41% year-over-year and representing approximately 28% of the total consolidated revenue. Average capacity per drive across these markets was over 2 terabyte per drive, up 22% year-over-year. 
In our mature mission-critical and key C client markets, revenues declined year-over-year as expected, and exabytes declined slightly. PC client revenues continue to represent approximately 25% of the total consolidated revenue.
Operating expenses for the March quarter were $550 million on a GAAP basis and $443 million on a non-GAAP basis. Total consolidated expenses were slightly higher than forecast, primarily due to nonexecutive variable compensation. Capital expenditures were $95 million for the March quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at or very near full capacity. 
Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $426 million, and free cash flow was $331 million. These results include approximately $150 million in cash payments related to restructuring charges and biannual nonexecutive variable compensation. Excluding these items, cash flow from operations would have been approximately $576 million.
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the March quarter with $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 297 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the March quarter, which will be payable on July 5.
In January, we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment grade financing with weighted average interest rate of less than 5%. This funding will serve us a prefinancing of our 2018 and our 2021 notes and other corporate purposes. We have called our 2021 7% senior notes with a payment of $158 million scheduled for May 1. Interest expense for the March quarter was $60 million and will be similar in the June quarter. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest rate.
Our March quarter results continue to reflect strong execution of our business model objectives and our ability to generate strong cash flow from our storage portfolio. Combined with our cloud systems and silicon group, we view that approximately 80% of our storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 and beyond have growth potential. While we are still in a process of executing a number of our cost actions in our manufacturing sites and at the corporate level, we believe the combination of these cost alignment activities and the competitiveness of our HDD product portfolio will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of calendar year 2017 and beyond.

A few weeks ago, we launched our Data Age 2025 study with IDC that addresses data growth, location and new business protocols over the next several years. With a forecast of 163 zettabytes of information being created over the next few years, HDD mass storage technology will continue to be a vital player in maximizing the value of data across many new verticals.
We believe continuing to optimize our full HDD product portfolio to the structural shifts and application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. By this time next year, we anticipate less than 10% of our HDD technology portfolio will be exposed to competing Flash devices.
The competitiveness of our HDD portfolio is the result of our long-term investment in delivering world-class technology and our dedication to product innovation. A few recent portfolio highlights include: In the nearline market, our 10 terabyte helium HDD is continuing to ramp with large hyperscale cloud service provider customers. Customer evaluation feedback on our 12 terabyte helium HDDs has been positive, and we plan to start volume shipments in the June quarter. We believe our opportunities in the nearline market will continue to span across multiple capacity points as our customers evolve their capacity infrastructure for a growing multiple of enterprise workload applications.
We are successfully refreshing a number of products in our portfolio utilizing our fourth generation SMR technology and to date, we have sold over 35 million HDDs into the nearline, client and consumer markets with this technology. We believe our technical leadership in aerial density will continue through calendar 2017. Our planned 1 terabyte and 2 terabyte product refreshes for the PC compute markets are on schedule. And this week at NAB, we announced new consumer products, including our first offering for the drone marketplace, a fly drive, which includes enough space for 60 hours of 4K video footage and developed in partnership with top drone manufacturer DJI. 
From an R&D technology perspective, we continue to invest in our next-generation aerial density hammer technology. With products on the road map for the late 2018 calendar year, we believe we are leading the market in developing and bringing to market this important cost-benefit solution for mass storage capacity needs.
Turning to the market outlook. We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. For the June quarter, we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. Our expectations reflect the seasonal decline in revenue, our desire to maintain lower inventories going into the summer months and some conservatism due to the potential impact of component shortages in DRAM and NAND on various aspects of our customers' businesses in the server, CSP and client space.
We are raising our gross margin expectations for the June quarter to 31%. And we are targeting a new range for calendar 2017 of 29% to 33%. As Dave indicated, operating expenses will trend sequentially down to expect approximately $430 million in the June quarter. We anticipate operating expenses will continue to decline through the rest of the calendar year and exit the December quarter at or below $400 million. Cash flow from operations will be down slightly sequentially, reflecting lower seasonal revenue and cash payout related to our elimination of U.S. vacation accrual. We continue to expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016, representing modest revenue growth opportunities for Seagate. Assuming market conditions remain intact, we continue to believe Seagate will achieve earnings per share of at least $4.50 in calendar 2017, and we will provide a fiscal '18 outlook on our July call.
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open the call up for questions and answers."

On the one hand, the customer demand is certainly there for those higher-capacity drives, but the industry's capability is coming through solutions that effectively cost more, either you're adding more heads and disks technology to handle that kind of workload and especially when you're adding more heads and disks, you have to obviously be very careful about the aggressive because somehow you have to absorb the extra parts. So I think you're going to see some resolution where those price declines are going to continue to stabilize just because we have to afford the new technology. And of course, we're not going to get to 16 and then 20 and 32, and that's all going to take a lot of technology, so we definitely believe we're going to see stabilization on that pricing."

I mean, the reality i",558,"Well, I think the NAND shortages are interesting because at the end of the day, I think it's more challenging for the technology industry to deal with the shortages than it is beneficial to HDDs because of some comparison of 500 gig. I mean, the reality is even the 500 gig NAND drive at today's prices or even 6 months ago prices aren't remotely competitive to an HDD price. I do think that the lack of availability of NAND in certain market segments results in people then shifting their strategies around to use HDDs or not. So I think, for example, the NAND companies are constantly optimizing where they ship their NAND. Does it go into phones, does it go into data centers, does it go into the servers or does it go into PCs? And depending on the grade of Flash you're building, the capacity plans you put in 6 months ago and then what customers are asking for versus the reoptimization where the NAND is flying. I think in the short term probably and I think HP indicated this on their call 2 quarters ago that they felt that the PC industry was being constrained a bit on NAND. I think that probably has shifted some longer-term strategy around product portfolios that breathes some more life into the HDD space in that people don't want to be caught short with storage technology of any type and of course, there again, we're talking about 1 [ 28 ] or 2 56. For us, it's really an issue of getting the volumes ramped on the 1 TB where we have a substantial lead and then offering that product to the PC companies that maybe today are taking a lot of good product because that volume, obviously, is a single head, a single drive and products we can be quite competitive. I think from a Seagate perspective, we feel that the shortage overall might marginally help us on the client space as we move through the calendar year and maybe even the beginning of next year. I think where it's more problematic for the industry, in general and I mean everyone is if it's constraining buildouts with all the CSB space that with the DRAM shortages, and we have seen indications of certain deployments being -- being delayed because they basically can't get all the component technology that they need across the board. We experienced that a little bit in our own CSSG business where we obviously need to get Flash to sell our Flash drives. We have a big demand profile for our current generation products, which are quite competitive, but we're constrained by as much as $40 million or $50 million in revenue in terms of can we get the Flash or not. So that's been we have issues that we're going to be working hard in one of the reasons there's some opportunity of the revenue side if we can secure that NAND. So it's a pretty dynamic situation that you're on top off. I don't know that it's easy to say good or bad. There's some good to it, and there's some pressures from it. We've always said it's a better world of this a lot of NAND because of that means people more devices and are creating more data, and that's still our thesis."

The storage system business certainly in the current quarter had a good performance as well year-over-year growth, and we expect to see year-over-year growth going forward. Customer activity in that space continues to be really high, particularly in the OEM space. I mean, what we see is that as OEMs look to figure out where they spend their R&D dollars, they certainly are making opportunities available for Seagate for us to come and work with them at higher levels of integration, and that's particularly true as we start to have higher levels of integration between our component-related products like SSDs and kind of system-level products.

We've always felt there's an opportunity in the systems business in the higher value-add categories because our systems business, at least a good hunk of it, has software competency to it as well. And so we serve OEMs in that space and more and more so, we're getting traction with the cloud service providers that are looking at solutions beyond the device levels. So I think from our perspective, we've always viewed this business as attractive in terms of its core business of selling into OEMs as well as servicing cloud service providers at one level but really the opportunity to, I think, is architectures evolve in different customer needs evolve have the capability of to optimize the devices either at the device level the subsystem level or the systems level, and if you don't have a software capability to do that you really can take advantage of what we think will be potentially significant long-term trend. I think the issue is one is that how does that evolve over what period of time and what does it cost you in the meantime. And so I think for us, we continue to work in the financial models so the systems business is profitable to the overall business gets is the option to grow in some of these markets if we see either OEMs or CSPs decide that they want to see solutions at the systems level versus the device level, and we still believe that's the opportunity in front of us. I would say, if anything, over the last 6 to 12 months, we've seen and have dialogue with customers that have us more encouraged about that opportunity versus less encouraged, so we are as committed as we have been to growing that business to what we think will be a meaningful business in the overall portfolio.

Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO; Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO; Dave Mosley, President and COO; and Phil Brace, President of Cloud Systems and Silicon Group.
We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information for our March quarter of fiscal '17 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. For the last few years, we have communicated our belief that data growth trends will continue to drive storage exabyte demand and the related measurement of capacity per drive and that units are less relevant to mobile cloud environments and future client addressable markets. In today's newly deployed architectures and applications, high-capacity mass storage is critical. Importantly for Seagate, it is the advanced technology in the heads of media as well as manufacturing absorption of these technologies and test capacity absorption that will most significantly impact our financial performance.
Going forward, we will continue orienting our conference call remarks and supplemental data to key market exabyte results and other business metrics and discontinue providing unit detail. We recognize this represents a change for the investment community in the short term, but believe it better reflects how we are managing and measuring our business performance internally and will help our industry to be evaluated more effectively in a forward-looking manner.
During today's call, we will review the highlights for the March quarter and provide the company outlook for the June quarter and then open the call for questions. We are planning for the call today to go approximately 0.5 hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits.
We will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures on this call. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investors section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.
As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand, technology and product development advancements and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements.
Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the Investors section of the company's website.

For the March quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was relatively in line with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product sales towards our higher-capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results year-over-year.
HDD enterprise revenues were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 20% year-over-year and representing 36% of our total consolidated revenue. Within this, nearline revenues were up 9% year-over-year and represented 24% of our total consolidated revenue. Hyperscale nearline revenues were up strong double digits, and our 8 terabyte nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU. Our HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DVR and NAS markets. Revenues from these markets were up 25% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 41% year-over-year and representing approximately 28% of the total consolidated revenue. Average capacity per drive across these markets was over 2 terabyte per drive, up 22% year-over-year.
In our mature mission-critical and PC client markets, revenues declined year-over-year as expected, and exabytes declined slightly. PC client revenues continue to represent approximately 25% of the total consolidated revenue.
Operating expenses for the March quarter were $550 million on a GAAP basis and $443 million on a non-GAAP basis. Total consolidated expenses were slightly higher than forecast, primarily due to nonexecutive variable compensation. Capital expenditures were $95 million for the March quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment, supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at or very near full capacity.
Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $426 million, and free cash flow was $331 million. These results include approximately $150 million in cash payments related to restructuring charges and biannual nonexecutive variable compensation. Excluding these items, cash flow from operations would have been approximately $576 million.
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the March quarter with $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 297 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the March quarter, which will be payable on July 5.
In January, we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment grade financing with weighted average interest rate of less than 5%. This funding will serve as a prefinancing of our 2018 and our 2021 notes and other corporate purposes. We have called our 2021 7% senior notes with a payment of $158 million scheduled for May 1. Interest expense for the March quarter was $60 million and will be similar in the June quarter. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest rate.
Our March quarter results continue to reflect strong execution of our business model objectives and our ability to generate strong cash flow from our storage portfolio. Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we view that approximately 80% of our storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 and beyond have growth potential. While we are still in the process of executing a number of our cost actions in our manufacturing sites and at the corporate level, we believe the combination of these cost alignment activities and the competitiveness of our HDD product portfolio will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of calendar year 2017 and beyond.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

A few weeks ago, we launched our Data Age 2025 study with IDC that addresses data growth, location and new business verticals over the next several years. With a forecast of 163 zettabytes of information being created over the next few years",633,"Thanks, Dave. A few weeks ago, we launched our Data Age 2025 study with IDC that addresses data growth, location and new business verticals over the next several years. With a forecast of 163 zettabytes of information being created over the next few years, HDD mass storage technology will continue to be a vital player in maximizing the value of data across many new verticals.
We believe continuing to optimize our full HDD product portfolio to the structural shifts and application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. By this time next year, we anticipate less than 10% of our HDD technology portfolio will be exposed to competing Flash devices.
The competitiveness of our HDD portfolio is a result of our long-term investment in delivering world-class storage technology and our dedication to product innovation. A few recent portfolio highlights include: In the nearline market, our 10 terabyte helium HDD is continuing to ramp with large hyperscale cloud service provider customers. Customer evaluation feedback on our 12 terabyte helium HDDs has been positive, and we plan to start volume shipments in the June quarter. We believe our opportunities in the nearline market will continue to span across multiple capacity points as our customers evolve their capacity infrastructure for a growing multiple of enterprise workload applications.
We are successfully refreshing a number of products in our portfolio utilizing our fourth generation SMR technology and to date, we have sold over 35 million HDDs into the nearline, client and consumer markets with this technology. We believe our technical leadership in aerial density will continue through calendar 2017. Our planned 1 terabyte and 2 terabyte product refreshes for the PC compute markets are on schedule. And this week at NAB, we announced new consumer products, including our first offering for the drone marketplace, a fly drive, which includes enough space for 60 hours of 4K video footage and developed in partnership with top drone manufacturer, DJI.
From an R&D technology perspective, we continue to invest in our next-generation aerial density hammer technology. With products on the road map for the late 2018 calendar year, we believe we are leading the market in developing and bringing to market this important cost-benefit solution for mass storage capacity needs.
Turning to the market outlook. We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. For the June quarter, we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. Our expectations reflect the seasonal decline in revenue, our desire to maintain lower inventories going into the summer months and some conservatism due to the potential impact of component shortages in DRAM and NAND on various aspects of our customers' businesses in the server, CSP and client space.
We are raising our gross margin expectations for the June quarter to 31%. And we are targeting a new range for calendar 2017 of 29% to 33%. As Dave indicated, operating expenses will trend sequentially down to expect approximately $430 million in the June quarter. We anticipate operating expenses will continue to decline through the rest of the calendar year and exit the December quarter at or below $400 million. Cash flow from operations will be down slightly sequentially, reflecting lower seasonal revenue and cash payout related to our elimination of U.S. vacation accrual. We continue to expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016, representing modest revenue growth opportunities for Seagate. Assuming market conditions remain intact, we continue to believe Seagate will achieve earnings per share of at least $4.50 in calendar 2017, and we will provide a fiscal '18 outlook on our July call.
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open the call up for questions and answers."

So I think you're going to see some resolution where those price declines are going to continue to stabilize just because we have to afford the new technology. And of course, you're not going to end at 12s, you're going to have to get to 16 and then 20 and 32, and that's all going to take a lot of technology, so we definitely believe you're going to see stabilization on that pricing."

I mean, the r",580,"Well, I think the NAND shortages are interesting because at the end of the day, I think it's more challenging for the technology industry to deal with the shortages than it is maybe beneficial to HDDs because of some comparison on a 500 gig. I mean, the reality is, even a 500 gig NAND drive at today's prices or even at 6 months ago prices aren't remotely competitive to an HDD price. I do think that the lack of availability of NAND in certain market segments results in people then shifting their strategies around that, that use HDDs or not. So I think, for example, the NAND companies are constantly optimizing where do they ship their NAND. Does it go into phones, does it go into the data centers, does it go into the servers or does it go into the PCs? And depending on the grade of Flash you're building, the capacity plans you put in 6 months ago and then what customers are asking for versus constant reoptimization of where the NAND is flowing. I think in the short term probably and I think HP indicated this on their call 2 quarters ago that they felt that the PC industry was being constrained a bit on NAND. I think that probably has shifted some longer-term strategy around product portfolios that breathe some more life into the HDD space and that people don't want to be caught short with storage technology of any type and of course, there again, we're talking about 128 or 256. For us, it's really an issue of getting the volumes ramped on the 1 TB where we have a substantial lead and then offering that product to the PC companies that maybe today are taking a lot of 500 gig product because that volume, obviously, it's a single head, it's a single disk and 2-headed product, so we can be quite competitive. So I think from a Seagate perspective, we feel that the shortage overall might marginally help us on the client space as we move through the calendar year and maybe even at the beginning of next year. I think where it's more problematic for the industry, in general, and I mean everyone is, if it's constraining build-outs at all at the CSP space, that with the DRAM shortages, and we have seen indications of certain deployments being -- being delayed because they basically can't get all the component technology that they need across the board. We experienced that a little bit in our own CSSG business where we obviously needed to get Flash to sell our Flash drives. We have a big demand profile for our current generation products, which are quite competitive, but we're constrained by as much as $40 million or $50 million in revenue in terms of, can we get the Flash or not. So that's one of the issues that we're going to be working hard and one of the reasons that I think there's some opportunity on the revenue side if we can secure that NAND. So it's a pretty dynamic situation that you're on top of. I don't know that this is easy to say it's good or bad. I think, there's some good to it and there's some pressures from it. We've always said it's a better world if there's a lot of NAND because that means people will have more devices in their hand and they're creating more data, and that's still our thesis."

The storage system business certainly in the current quarter had a good performance as well year-over-year growth, and we expect to see year-over-year growth going forward. Customer activity in that space continues to be really high, particularly in the OEM space. I mean, what we see is that as OEMs look to figure out where they spend their R&D dollars, they certainly are making opportunities available for Seagate for us to come in and work with them at higher levels of integration, and that's particularly true as we start to have higher levels of integration between our, or I'll say, our component-related products like SSDs and HDDs and system-level products.

We've always felt there's an opportunity in the systems business in the higher value-add categories because our systems business, at least a good hunk of it, has a fair amount of software competency to it as well. And so we serve OEMs in that space and more and more so we're getting traction with the cloud service providers that are looking at solutions beyond the device levels. So I think from our perspective, we've always viewed this business as attractive in terms of its core business of selling into OEMs as well as servicing cloud service providers at one level but really the opportunity to, I think, as architectures evolve and different customer needs evolve, they have the capability to optimize the devices either at the device level, at the subsystem level or the systems level, and if you don't have the software capability to do that, you really can't take advantage of what we think would be a potentially significant long-term trend. I think the issue is, one is that, how does that evolve over what period of time and what does it cost you in the meantime. And so I think for us, we continue to work on the financial models so the systems business is profitable to the overall business when it gives us the option to grow in some of these markets if we see either OEMs or CSPs decide that they want to see solutions at the systems level versus the device level, and we still believe that's the opportunity in front of us. I would say, if anything, over the last 6 to 12 months we've seen and had dialogues with customers that have us more encouraged about that opportunity versus less encouraged, so we are as committed as we have been to growing that business to what we think will be a meaningful business in the overall portfolio.

We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information for our March quarter of fiscal '17 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. For the last few years, we have communicated our belief that data growth trends will continue to drive storage exabyte demand and the related measurement of capacity per drive, and that units are less relevant to mobile cloud environments and future client addressable markets. In today's newly deployed architectures and applications, high-capacity mass storage is critical. Importantly for Seagate, it is the advanced technology in heads of media, as well as manufacturing absorption of these technologies and test capacity absorption, that will most significantly impact our financial performance.
Going forward, we will continue orienting our conference call remarks and supplemental data to key market exabyte results and other business metrics, and discontinue providing unit detail. We recognize this represents a change for the investment community in the short term, but believe it better reflects how we are managing and measuring our business performance internally, and will help our industry to be evaluated more effectively in a forward-looking manner.
During today's call, we will review the highlights for the March quarter and provide the company outlook for the June quarter, and then open the call for questions. We are planning for the call today to go approximately 0.5 hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits.
We will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures on this call. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investors section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.
As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand, technology and product development advancements, and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date.

For today's call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business. Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the June quarter, as well as an update for the calendar year. For the March quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.5%; net income of $194 million; and diluted earnings per share of $0.65. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 31.4%, up 870 basis points year-over-year; net income of $329 million; and diluted earnings per share of $1.10.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $426 million, up 108% year-over-year. Our March quarter reflects -- results reflect a relatively stable demand environment and improved profitability year-over-year. HDD exabyte shipments for the March quarter were 65.5 exabytes, up approximately 18% year-over-year. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was approximately 1.8 terabytes per drive, up 27% year-over-year. ASPs of $67 were sequentially flat for the March quarter, and up 10% year-over-year.
Our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group demonstrated 19% year-over-year growth in the March quarter, with particular strength in our Flash-based solutions. We are pleased with Seagate's execution in the March quarter, both in terms of our ability to maximize the profitability of our storage technology portfolio and our continued execution on operational efficiencies.
And I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more detail on our operational activities."

For the March quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was relatively in line with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product sales towards our higher-capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results year-over-year.
HDD enterprise revenues were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 20% year-over-year, and representing 36% of our total consolidated revenue. Within this, nearline revenues were up 9% year-over-year and represented 24% of our total consolidated revenue. Hyperscale nearline revenues were up strong double digits, and our 8 terabyte nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU. Our HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DVR, and NAS markets. Revenues from these markets were up 25% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 41% year-over-year, and representing approximately 28% of the total consolidated revenue. Average capacity per drive across these markets was over 2 terabyte per drive, up 22% year-over-year.
In our mature mission-critical and PC client markets, revenues declined year-over-year as expected, and exabytes declined slightly. PC client revenues continue to represent approximately 25% of the total consolidated revenue.
Operating expenses for the March quarter were $550 million on a GAAP basis, and $443 million on a non-GAAP basis. Total consolidated expenses were slightly higher than forecast, primarily due to nonexecutive variable compensation. Capital expenditures were $95 million for the March quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment, supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is, and will continue to operate at or very near full capacity.
Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $426 million, and free cash flow was $331 million. These results include approximately $150 million in cash payments related to restructuring charges and biannual nonexecutive variable compensation. Excluding these items, cash flow from operations would have been approximately $576 million.
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the March quarter with $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and 297 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the March quarter, which will be payable on July 5.
In January, we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment grade financing with weighted average interest rate of less than 5%. This funding will serve as a prefinancing of our 2018 and our 2021 notes and other corporate purposes. We have called our 2021 7% senior notes with a payment of $158 million scheduled for May 1. Interest expense for the March quarter was $60 million, and will be similar in the June quarter. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest rate.
Our March quarter results continue to reflect strong execution of our business model objectives and our ability to generate strong cash flow from our storage portfolio. Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we view that approximately 80% of our storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 and beyond have growth potential. While we are still in the process of executing a number of our cost actions in our manufacturing sites and at the corporate level, we believe the combination of these cost alignment activities and the competitiveness of our HDD product portfolio will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of calendar year 2017 and beyond.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

A few weeks ago, we launched our Data Age 2025 study with IDC that addresses data growth, location, and new business verticals over the next several years. With a forecast of 163 zettabytes of information being created over the next few year",633,"Thanks, Dave. A few weeks ago, we launched our Data Age 2025 study with IDC that addresses data growth, location, and new business verticals over the next several years. With a forecast of 163 zettabytes of information being created over the next few years, HDD mass storage technology will continue to be a vital player in maximizing the value of data across many new verticals.
We believe continuing to optimize our full HDD product portfolio to the structural shifts and application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. By this time next year, we anticipate less than 10% of our HDD technology portfolio will be exposed to competing Flash devices.
The competitiveness of our HDD portfolio is a result of our long-term investment in delivering world-class storage technology and our dedication to product innovation. A few recent portfolio highlights include: In the nearline market, our 10 terabyte helium HDD is continuing to ramp with large hyperscale cloud service provider customers. Customer evaluation feedback on our 12 terabyte helium HDDs has been positive, and we plan to start volume shipments in the June quarter. We believe our opportunities in the nearline market will continue to span across multiple capacity points as our customers evolve their capacity infrastructure for a growing multiple of enterprise workload applications.
We are successfully refreshing a number of products in our portfolio, utilizing our fourth generation SMR technology and, to date, we have sold over 35 million HDDs into the nearline, client and consumer markets with this technology. We believe our technical leadership in areal density will continue through calendar 2017. Our planned 1 terabyte and 2 terabyte product refreshes for the PC compute markets are on schedule. And this week at NAB, we announced new consumer products, including our first offering for the drone marketplace, a Fly Drive, which includes enough space for 60 hours of 4K video footage, and developed in partnership with top drone manufacturer, DJI.
From an R&D technology perspective, we continue to invest in our next-generation areal density hammer technology. With products on the road map for the late 2018 calendar year, we believe we are leading the market in developing and bringing to market this important cost-benefit solution for mass storage capacity needs.
Turning to the market outlook. We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. For the June quarter, we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. Our expectations reflect the seasonal decline in revenue, our desire to maintain lower inventories going into the summer months, and some conservatism due to the potential impact of component shortages in DRAM and NAND on various aspects of our customers' businesses in the server, CSP, and client space.
We are raising our gross margin expectations for the June quarter to 31%. And we are targeting a new range for calendar 2017 of 29% to 33%. As Dave indicated, operating expenses will trend sequentially down, to expect approximately $430 million in the June quarter. We anticipate operating expenses will continue to decline through the rest of the calendar year and exit the December quarter at or below $400 million. Cash flow from operations will be down slightly sequentially, reflecting lower seasonal revenue and cash payout related to our elimination of U.S. vacation accrual. We continue to expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016, representing modest revenue growth opportunities for Seagate. Assuming market conditions remain intact, we continue to believe Seagate will achieve earnings per share of at least $4.50 in calendar 2017, and we will provide a fiscal '18 outlook on our July call.
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open the call up for questions and answers."

So I think the combination of stronger demand signals for the second half plus the rotation of the portfolio that's going to have 8s, 10s, and 12s, and not just pretty much 8s, you're going to see exabyte growth there that's going to continue."

On the one hand, the customer demand is certainly there for those higher-capacity drives, but the industry's capability to live with that technology is coming through solutions that effectively cost more, either you're adding more heads and disks or other technology to handle that kind of workload, and especially when you're adding more heads and disks, you have to obviously be very careful about the aggressive price takedowns that have occurred, because somehow you have to absorb the extra parts. So I think you're going to see some resolution where those price declines are going to continue to stabilize, just because we have to afford the new technology. And of course, you're not going to end at 12s, you're going to have to get to 16 and then 20 and 32, and that's all going to take a lot of technology, so we definitely believe you're going to see stabilization on that pricing."

I mean, the",579,"Well, I think the NAND shortages are interesting because, at the end of the day, I think it's more challenging for the technology industry to deal with the shortages than it is maybe beneficial to HDDs because of some comparison on a 500 gig. I mean, the reality is, even a 500 gig NAND drive at today's prices, or even at 6 months ago prices, aren't remotely competitive to an HDD price. I do think that the lack of availability of NAND in certain market segments results in people then shifting their strategies around whether to use HDDs or not. So I think, for example, the NAND companies are constantly optimizing where do they ship their NAND. Does it go into phones, does it go into the data centers, does it go into the servers, or does it go into the PCs? And depending on the grade of Flash you're building, the capacity plans you put in 6 months ago, and then what customers are asking for versus constant reoptimization of where the NAND is flowing. I think in the short term probably, and I think HP indicated this on their call 2 quarters ago, that they felt that the PC industry was being constrained a bit on NAND. I think that probably has shifted some longer-term strategy around product portfolios that breathe some more life into the HDD space, in that people don't want to be caught short with storage technology of any type, and of course, there again, we're talking about 128 or 256. For us, it's really an issue of getting the volumes ramped on the 1 TB where we have a substantial lead, and then offering that product to the PC companies that maybe today are taking a lot of 500 gig product because that volume, obviously, it's a single head, it's a single disk and 2-headed product, so we can be quite competitive. So I think from a Seagate perspective, we feel that the shortage overall might marginally help us on the client space as we move through the calendar year, and maybe even at the beginning of next year. I think where it's more problematic for the industry, in general, and I mean everyone is, if it's constraining build-outs at all at the CSP space, that with the DRAM shortages, and we have seen indications of certain deployments being -- being delayed because they basically can't get all the component technology that they need across the board. We experienced that a little bit in our own CSSG business where we obviously needed to get Flash to sell our Flash drives. We have a big demand profile for our current generation products, which are quite competitive, but we're constrained by as much as $40 million or $50 million in revenue in terms of, can we get the Flash or not. So that's one of the issues that we're going to be working hard, and one of the reasons that I think there's some opportunity on the revenue side if we can secure that NAND. So it's a pretty dynamic situation that you're on top of. I don't know that this is easy to say it's good or bad. I think, there's some good to it and there's some pressures from it. We've always said it's a better world if there's a lot of NAND because that means people have more devices in their hand, and they're creating more data, and that's still our thesis."

We've always felt there's an opportunity in the systems business in the higher value-add categories because our systems business, at least a good hunk of it, has a fair amount of software competency to it as well. And so we serve OEMs in that space, and more and more so we're getting traction with the cloud service providers that are looking at solutions beyond the device levels. So I think from our perspective, we've always viewed this business as attractive in terms of its core business of selling into OEMs, as well as servicing cloud service providers at one level, but really the opportunity to, I think, as architectures evolve and different customer needs evolve, to have the capability to optimize the devices either at the device level, at the subsystem level or the systems level, and if you don't have the software capability to do that, you really can't take advantage of what we think would be a potentially significant long-term trend. I think the issue is, one is that, how does that evolve over what period of time and what does it cost you in the meantime? And so I think for us, we continue to work the financial models so the systems business is profitable to the overall business, and then gives us the option to grow into some of these markets if we see either OEMs or CSPs decide that they want to see solutions at the systems level versus the device level, and we still believe that's the opportunity in front of us. I would say, if anything, over the last 6 to 12 months, we've seen and had dialogues with customers that have us more encouraged about that opportunity versus less encouraged, so we are as committed as we have been to growing that business to what we think will be a meaningful business in the overall portfolio.
Thanks, everyone. We appreciate the time you've taken this morning. And I want to again thank our employees, our customers, our suppliers and our shareholders, and we look forward to speaking with you again in July. Great. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO; Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO; Dave Mosley, President and COO; and Phil Brace, President of Cloud Systems and Silicon Group.
We've posted our press release and detailed supplemental information for our March quarter of fiscal '17 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. For the last few years, we have communicated our belief that data growth trends will continue to drive storage exabyte demand and the related measurement of capacity per drive and that units are less relevant to mobile cloud environments and future client addressable markets. In today's newly deployed architectures and applications, high-capacity mass storage is critical. Importantly for Seagate, it is the advanced technology in heads of media as well as manufacturing absorption of these technologies and test capacity absorption that will most significantly impact our financial performance.
Going forward, we will continue orienting our conference call remarks and supplemental data to key market exabyte results and other business metrics and discontinue providing unit detail. We recognize this represents a change for the investment community in the short term, but believe it better reflects how we are managing and measuring our business performance internally and will help our industry to be evaluated more effectively in a forward-looking manner.
During today's call, we will review the highlights for the March quarter and provide the company outlook for the June quarter, and then open the call for questions. We are planning for the call today to go approximately 0.5 hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits.
We will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures on this call. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investors section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.
As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand, technology and product development advancements and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements.
Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the Investors section of the company's website.

For the March quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was relatively in line with our forecast. We continue to drive our HDD product sales towards our higher-capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results year-over-year.
HDD enterprise revenues were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 20% year-over-year and representing 36% of our total consolidated revenue. Within this, nearline revenues were up 9% year-over-year and represented 24% of our total consolidated revenue. Hyperscale nearline revenues were up strong double digits, and our 8 terabyte nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU. Our HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DVR and NAS markets. Revenues from these markets were up 25% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 41% year-over-year and representing approximately 28% of the total consolidated revenue. Average capacity per drive across these markets was over 2 terabyte per drive, up 22% year-over-year.
In our mature mission-critical and PC client markets, revenues declined year-over-year as expected, and exabytes declined slightly. PC client revenues continue to represent approximately 25% of the total consolidated revenue.
Operating expenses for the March quarter were $550 million on a GAAP basis and $443 million on a non-GAAP basis. Total consolidated expenses were slightly higher than forecast, primarily due to nonexecutive variable compensation. Capital expenditures were $95 million for the March quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment, supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at or very near full capacity.
Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $426 million, and free cash flow was $331 million. These results include approximately $150 million in cash payments related to restructuring charges and biannual nonexecutive variable compensation. Excluding these items, cash flow from operations would have been approximately $576 million.
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the March quarter with $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 297 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the March quarter, which will be payable on July 5.
In January, we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment grade financing with weighted average interest rate of less than 5%. This funding will serve as a prefinancing of our 2018 and our 2021 notes and other corporate purposes. We have called our 2021 7% senior notes with a payment of $158 million scheduled for May 1. Interest expense for the March quarter was $60 million and will be similar in the June quarter. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest rate.
Our March quarter results continue to reflect strong execution of our business model objectives and our ability to generate strong cash flow from our storage portfolio. Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we view that approximately 80% of our storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 and beyond have growth potential. While we are still in the process of executing a number of our cost actions in our manufacturing sites and at the corporate level, we believe the combination of these cost alignment activities and the competitiveness of our HDD product portfolio will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of calendar year 2017 and beyond.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

A few weeks ago, we launched our Data Age 2025 study with IDC that addresses data growth, location and new business verticals over the next several years. With a forecast of 163 zettabytes of information being created over the next few years",633,"Thanks, Dave. A few weeks ago, we launched our Data Age 2025 study with IDC that addresses data growth, location and new business verticals over the next several years. With a forecast of 163 zettabytes of information being created over the next few years, HDD mass storage technology will continue to be a vital player in maximizing the value of data across many new verticals.
We believe continuing to optimize our full HDD product portfolio to the structural shifts and application workloads towards higher capacity will prove to be a resilient and competitive marketplace strategy. By this time next year, we anticipate less than 10% of our HDD technology portfolio will be exposed to competing Flash devices.
The competitiveness of our HDD portfolio is a result of our long-term investment in delivering world-class storage technology and our dedication to product innovation. A few recent portfolio highlights include: In the nearline market, our 10 terabyte helium HDD is continuing to ramp with large hyperscale cloud service provider customers. Customer evaluation feedback on our 12 terabyte helium HDDs has been positive, and we plan to start volume shipments in the June quarter. We believe our opportunities in the nearline market will continue to span across multiple capacity points as our customers evolve their capacity infrastructure for a growing multiple of enterprise workload applications.
We are successfully refreshing a number of products in our portfolio, utilizing our fourth generation SMR technology and, to date, we have sold over 35 million HDDs into the nearline, client and consumer markets with this technology. We believe our technical leadership in areal density will continue through calendar 2017. Our planned 1 terabyte and 2 terabyte product refreshes for the PC compute markets are on schedule. And this week at NAB, we announced new consumer products, including our first offering for the drone marketplace, a Fly Drive, which includes enough space for 60 hours of 4K video footage, and developed in partnership with top drone manufacturer, DJI.
From an R&D technology perspective, we continue to invest in our next-generation areal density hammer technology. With products on the road map for the late 2018 calendar year, we believe we are leading the market in developing and bringing to market this important cost-benefit solution for mass storage capacity needs.
Turning to the market outlook. We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends. For the June quarter, we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. Our expectations reflect the seasonal decline in revenue, our desire to maintain lower inventories going into the summer months and some conservatism due to the potential impact of component shortages in DRAM and NAND on various aspects of our customers' businesses in the server, CSP and client space.
We are raising our gross margin expectations for the June quarter to 31%. And we are targeting a new range for calendar 2017 of 29% to 33%. As Dave indicated, operating expenses will trend sequentially down, to expect approximately $430 million in the June quarter. We anticipate operating expenses will continue to decline through the rest of the calendar year and exit the December quarter at or below $400 million. Cash flow from operations will be down slightly sequentially, reflecting lower seasonal revenue and cash payout related to our elimination of U.S. vacation accrual. We continue to expect overall exabyte demand to grow double digits in calendar 2017 over 2016, representing modest revenue growth opportunities for Seagate. Assuming market conditions remain intact, we continue to believe Seagate will achieve earnings per share of at least $4.50 in calendar 2017, and we will provide a fiscal '18 outlook on our July call.
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open the call up for questions and answers."

So I think you're going to see some resolution where those price declines are going to continue to stabilize just because we have to afford the new technology. And of course, you're not going to end at 12s, you're going to have to get to 16 and then 20 and 32, and that's all going to take a lot of technology, so we definitely believe you're going to see stabilization on that pricing."

I mean, the",579,"Well, I think the NAND shortages are interesting because, at the end of the day, I think it's more challenging for the technology industry to deal with the shortages than it is maybe beneficial to HDDs because of some comparison on a 500 gig. I mean, the reality is, even a 500 gig NAND drive at today's prices or even at 6 months ago prices aren't remotely competitive to an HDD price. I do think that the lack of availability of NAND in certain market segments results in people then shifting their strategies around whether to use HDDs or not. So I think, for example, the NAND companies are constantly optimizing where do they ship their NAND. Does it go into phones, does it go into the data centers, does it go into the servers or does it go into the PCs? And depending on the grade of Flash you're building, the capacity plans you put in 6 months ago, and then what customers are asking for versus constant reoptimization of where the NAND is flowing. I think in the short term probably and I think HP indicated this on their call 2 quarters ago that they felt that the PC industry was being constrained a bit on NAND. I think that probably has shifted some longer-term strategy around product portfolios that breathe some more life into the HDD space, in that people don't want to be caught short with storage technology of any type, and of course, there again, we're talking about 128 or 256. For us, it's really an issue of getting the volumes ramped on the 1 TB where we have a substantial lead, and then offering that product to the PC companies that maybe today are taking a lot of 500 gig product because that volume, obviously, it's a single head, it's a single disk and 2-headed product, so we can be quite competitive. So I think from a Seagate perspective, we feel that the shortage overall might marginally help us on the client space as we move through the calendar year, and maybe even at the beginning of next year. I think where it's more problematic for the industry, in general, and I mean everyone is, if it's constraining build-outs at all at the CSP space, that with the DRAM shortages, and we have seen indications of certain deployments being -- being delayed because they basically can't get all the component technology that they need across the board. We experienced that a little bit in our own CSSG business where we obviously needed to get Flash to sell our Flash drives. We have a big demand profile for our current generation products, which are quite competitive, but we're constrained by as much as $40 million or $50 million in revenue in terms of, can we get the Flash or not. So that's one of the issues that we're going to be working hard, and one of the reasons that I think there's some opportunity on the revenue side if we can secure that NAND. So it's a pretty dynamic situation that you're on top of. I don't know that this is easy to say it's good or bad. I think, there's some good to it and there's some pressures from it. We've always said it's a better world if there's a lot of NAND because that means people have more devices in their hand, and they're creating more data, and that's still our thesis."

The storage system business certainly in the current quarter had a good performance as well year-over-year growth, and we expect to see year-over-year growth going forward. Customer activity in that space continues to be really high, particularly in the OEM space. I mean, what we see is that as OEMs look to figure out where they spend their R&D dollars, they certainly are making opportunities available for Seagate for us to come in and work with them at higher levels of integration, and that's particularly true as we start to have higher levels of integration between our, our, I'll say, our component-related products like SSDs and HDDs, and our system-level products. So overall, that business continues to grow nicely."

We've always felt there's an opportunity in the systems business in the higher value-add categories because our systems business, at least a good hunk of it, has a fair amount of software competency to it as well. And so we serve OEMs in that space and more and more so we're getting traction with the cloud service providers that are looking at solutions beyond the device levels. So I think from our perspective, we've always viewed this business as attractive in terms of its core business of selling into OEMs as well as servicing cloud service providers at one level, but really the opportunity to, I think, as architectures evolve and different customer needs evolve, to have the capability to optimize the devices either at the device level, at the subsystem level or the systems level, and if you don't have the software capability to do that, you really can't take advantage of what we think would be a potentially significant long-term trend. I think the issue is, one is that, how does that evolve over what period of time and what does it cost you in the meantime? And so I think for us, we continue to work the financial models so the systems business is profitable to the overall business, and then gives us the option to grow into some of these markets if we see either OEMs or CSPs decide that they want to see solutions at the systems level versus the device level, and we still believe that's the opportunity in front of us. I would say, if anything, over the last 6 to 12 months, we've seen and had dialogues with customers that have us more encouraged about that opportunity versus less encouraged, so we are as committed as we have been to growing that business to what we think will be a meaningful business in the overall portfolio.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business, and Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter. 
Before I begin my operational comments, I would like to discuss our announcement today of Seagate's CEO succession plan. Today, Seagate's Board of Directors voted unanimously in favor of my transition to Executive Chairman of Seagate and appointed Dave Mosley as Chief Executive Officer. Dave and I will assume our new roles effective October 1, at which time I will shift my focus primarily to strategic growth initiatives and other opportunities designed to enhance shareholder value for the company. Dave has also been appointed to the Seagate's Board of Directors effective immediately. 
Over the last 2 years, the board and I have been focused on executive management succession. In addition to Dave's appointment, Dave Morton transitioned to CFO 18 months ago. And recently, we have appointed Jim Murphy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Marketing; Kate as Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary; and Robbie Knight as our Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer. In addition, as part of the restructuring actions taken over the last 12 months to optimize our global manufacturing and development center investments, we have also aligned all of our manufacturing operations under Senior Vice President of Operations, Jeff Nygard, and we have reorganized our R&D functions to meet the evolving storage marketplace requirements. 
The board and I believe we have the right management team and organizational structure in place to execute Seagate's business strategy, capitalize on opportunities in the storage marketplace and continue to create long-term shareholder value. It's been an honor and a privilege for me to serve as Seagate's CEO in 16 of the last 20 years. I am grateful to our amazing employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders, and I look forward to working closely with the management team and our future opportunities in my new role as Executive Chairman at Seagate.
Turning to our operational results. The overall macro environment continues to exhibit stability, and we believe this will continue through the rest of the calendar year and well into 2018. We remain cautiously optimistic that this should translate to moderate IT spending growth. In the context of the storage marketplace, the major transformative shifts from a client/server to mobile cloud high-capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate. The long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending for the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies remains intact as they continue to increase their service offerings and demonstrate significant business momentum. At the same time, the more mature and the storage technologies remain a large percentage of the overall IT storage market and can exhibit variance beyond seasonal patterns as the structure shift to a wide variety of IT and cloud service providers accelerates.
In addition, the end-to-end storage supply chain is continuing to experience price increases by as much as 2 to 3x in the memory markets. The effect of this significant price increase is evidenced by some near-time enterprise customer demand softness, which we believe will be resolved over the next several quarters. 
For the June quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.4 billion, GAAP gross margins of 27.7%, net income of $114 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.38. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 28.9%, up 310 basis points year-over-year, net income of $192 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.65. HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 62 exabytes. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was approximately 1.8 terabytes per drive, and ASPs per unit were $64. 
We saw a strength in the quarter from our largest nearline U.S.-based CSP customers and relative seasonal demand in the compute and branded markets. Offsetting this was weakness in our enterprise storage customers, including traditional OEM nearline and mission-critical demand, China CSP nearline demand and our own cloud storage systems business. In addition, there was weakness in the surveillance and mass markets due to some interquarter channel inventory management. As a result, our overall revenue results were approximately 5% below plan with approximately half of that shortfall from our cloud storage systems and half from HDD enterprise weakness and channel inventory management. We believe some of these factors, particularly China CSP demand and mass and surveillance market demand are temporal and supply chain-related while some of the OEM revenue declines are more structural. 
Our non-GAAP margin results of 28.9% were approximately 210 basis points below our guidance. Within this, approximately 2/3 of the impact was due to operational issues in our CSSG business, and approximately 1/3 was due to lower-than-expected enterprise and surveillance HDD portfolio mix. GAAP operating expenses were $470 million, down 16% year-over-year. And non-GAAP operating expenses were $422 million, down 5% year-over-year.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $243 million, and free cash flow was $139 million, up 13% year-over-year.
While we were disappointed to not meet our top line targets in the June quarter, Seagate effectively achieved our operating margin and gross margin profitability targets for fiscal year '17. For the year, diluted earnings per share grew 215% on a GAAP basis and 82% on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, for fiscal year '17, we generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations and returned 53% of that to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. 
In summary, I'm pleased with the operational improvements we made in fiscal year '17, and we are well positioned for the markets that are being served by our products and systems. I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more details on our operational activities."

For the June quarter, we achieved $2.4 billion in revenue and shipped 62 exabytes of storage with average capacity per drive of 1.8 terabytes. For the enterprise market, we shipped 23.5 exabytes with the average capacity per drive of 3.4 terabytes. Our average capacity per drive for our nearline products has reached over 4.8 terabytes per drive, up 8% over last year's strong 8 terabyte sales quarter and up 60% from the June quarter 2 years ago.
We continue to ramp our 10 TB nearline product and shipped approximately 300,000 units in the June quarter. Our sales for this capacity point have almost doubled over the last 2 quarters, and we expect to ship approximately 1 million 10 TB units in the September quarter. In addition, our 12 TB products shipped per revenue in the June quarter with excellent customer feedback, and we are confident our qualification process is competitive.
We expect to achieve approximately 50% of the exabyte share within the 10 TB and 12 TB markets by the end of the calendar year. The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continue to represent a significant opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these storage environments. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads with use cases from 2 to 4 TB product for certain applications and up to 16 terabyte for other use cases. In the client and retail markets, our 1 TB per platter, 2.5-inch platform continues to perform well. And to date, we have shipped over 45 million drives, substantially ahead of the competition. Using similar technology, our 2 TB per platter, 3.5-inch platform began ramping last quarter for desktop markets, providing great value for customers needing 2, 4 and 8 TB client capacity points. Customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition. Operating expenses for the June quarter were $400 million on a GAAP basis and $422 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 5% year-over-year. Total consolidated expenses were slightly lower than forecast, primarily due to lower variable compensation. We continue to identify areas for cost improvements. And this morning, we filed a restructuring plan that will provide savings of approximately $90 million annually. These cost actions provide support of our objective to exit the calendar year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $400 million per quarter. In addition to these actions, we will continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of FY '18. 
Capital expenditures were $104 million for the June quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $243 million, and free cash flow was $139 million. These results include approximately $50 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the June quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 292 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the June quarter, which will be payable on October 4.
Interest expense for the June quarter was $62 million and will be lower in the September quarter due to the lower debt balance. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our study of maturities and low interest rate. In FY '17, we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment grade financing with weighted average interest rate of less than 5% and paid $316 million to repurchase and redeem outstanding debt, including our 2021 7% senior notes. 
Overall, our operational and financial performance in FY '17 reflect execution of our business model profitability improvement objectives and our ability to generate cash flow from our storage portfolio. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business model and focus on our go-to-market portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Turning to the market outlook, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT and enterprise spending trends. We believe the end-to-end supply chain issues we identified last quarter will persist at least through the end of the year and therefore, we want to exercise more caution than seasonally normal for traditional enterprise spending and other markets affected by higher-than-normal supply chain pricing. At the same time, we are continuing to anticipate a stronger back half of the calendar year for exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem and seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs and the branded market. 
For the September quarter, we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. Our gross margin expectations for the September quarter are relatively flat and within our 29% to 33% targeted range. Cash flow from operations will be up sequentially. As Dave indicated, non-GAAP operating expenses will trend sequentially down to approximately $415 million in the September quarter, and we expect to exit the December quarter at or below $400 million. While we are not on a trajectory to meet our previous guide of non-GAAP EPS of $4.50 for calendar year '17, we do anticipate revenue and profit growth sequentially for the December quarter.

So on the nearline side, some customers your heavy with and other customers are not as heavy with. So there are some fundamental shifts going on depending on capacity points. I think at the highest capacity points, there's some things about our ramp that we're not happy with. The product is really good, and we're ramping it hard right now. The lower capacity points, the 4s and 8s and things like that, quite happy with our products. That's where the -- some of the China CSP behavior and the smaller customers and their issues that they had across their supply chain were affected. So there's slight share shifts going on but really only the highest capacity point is super relevant. We think that's temporal. Like I said, the 2 questions that you asked are related somewhat. The systems business that we have is -- there's a few different kinds of business in there. There's some specialty products buildout that we do, and then there's some things where we were really acting more like an ODM I'll say, and that stuff is not very good business. And obviously a lot of ODMs get themselves in situations where the supply chain issues where either they were underwater. They couldn't procure points at the right point. They had supply that was older supply, so to speak. So it was -- it was really tough road for the last 2 quarters, and we're going to have to really take a look at how much of that business we continue to support going forward."

But I did I suppose retire from the CEO job but -- so I'm super happy about where I'm headed and what my engagement will be with the company. Also super happy that Mosley is CEO. As I said to someone the other day, this company is a little bit like driving and stopping build traffic. Sometimes you're going 15 miles an hour, and sometimes you're going 85 miles an hour. But you usually get to your destination on time and no one is hurt, but it's stressful for the driver and oftentimes for the passengers to use. I think we have a younger driver with better reaction times now. I think your point is right where we're headed on margins. The way we see the math, to your point clearly, ramps are always challenging whether or not it's a 2.5-inch notebook product or 3.5-inch surveillance product or a high-end nearline product. And whenever you're ramping, the products, the yields come up the ramp to get better and also redesign and bring costs down, and you also start to understand customer needs, which allow you to optimize the firmware, et cetera, et cetera. So we would expect that with the the ramp on those products and the overall mix that occurs as customers move from 10s to 12s, to 14s to 16s that we have opportunity to move up in that margin range. I think the good news on the quarter, frankly, is even with the weakness that we had on nearline and mission-critical and certain customer bases and even within the services group, the margins that they did contribute were not what they should've been. Even with that, the overall margin structure was pretty solid, which I think should give you a good sense of the underlying core HDD businesses is operating pretty nicely right now. And yes, it should improve as we execute here in the second half of the year."

Some of that is penetration from Flash. Some of that's architectural issues that are going on in the enterprise. And we may see some rebound to that of the new chipsets that are coming off from Intel, for example. But it's kind of interesting because the last few quarters we saw a strong back half the last calendar year, but the last few quarters have been weaker, and it's counterintuitive with the Flash prices going up the way they did. So that's the stuff that we're referring to us structural though. The temporal stuff is very different. If you look at the building materials whether you're a cloud service provider around the world or whether you're an enterprise builder, the building materials was dramatically offset because of some component price increases. And trade-ups had to be made inside of that. In some cases, the trade-ups cant be made because your supply chain can't do the build at the right economics. In some cases, you make the trade up by saying I'll prioritize this memory architecture right now or this amount of DRAM, for example, right now and then I'll hold. The good news on that front for us is  first, the bad news. The bad news is exabytes have been rather flat all the way through last year, and that doesn't make sense from where the cloud is going. The good news is from the efficiency related our customers worldwide, growth of bits inside of the dissenters is still on a pretty healthy pace. And so this will come back. We've seen this a number of different times in our industry, and that's why we call it temporal."

If you go back a year ago, we kind of -- I think we did at the June call of last year indicate that we're going to take a variety of actions and the manufacturing side to address that capacity issues and where that would have a significant cognizant path, which is obviously reflected and secondly, that we were going to work on OpEx on 2 different vectors. One was absolute OpEx dollars and the other was to maintain our margin model that we've committed to and we're staying committed to. That one, as you may remember, wasn't kind of on the steady ramp down because the first -- the last 6 months of last year were quite strong, and we needed to keep a fair amount of people in place to actually meet the upside demand. And there was also some critical product transitioning going on that we felt it made sense to keep the resources in place to make sure those transitions went well, and that benefited us extremely through fiscal year '17 where we obviously fairly overachieved fairly dramatically relative to where we were a year ago. So I think we're back on how to get to 400. I would probably say though as we think about going from $400 million to $375 million that, that is not a reflection of so much as much is a reflection of what happens when you start making adjustments through OpEx. You've obviously see other opportunities where you can take some additional actions and some of it is also related to  things that Dave Mosley mentioned about what's the quality of business that we're doing in the system side and what's the underlying OpEx support for that and does that math really make sense. So I'll little bit of that in terms of how we get to $400 million to $375 million but not market related to the sale of this drives as more related to what we think we can do within the context we've always described as when it's positive."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business, and Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter. 
Before I begin my operational comments, I would like to discuss our announcement today of Seagate's CEO succession plan. Today, Seagate's Board of Directors voted unanimously in favor of my transition to Executive Chairman of Seagate and appointed Dave Mosley as Chief Executive Officer. Dave and I will assume our new roles effective October 1, at which time I will shift my focus primarily to strategic growth initiatives and other opportunities designed to enhance shareholder value for the company. Dave has also been appointed to the Seagate's Board of Directors effective immediately. 
Over the last 2 years, the board and I have been focused on executive management succession. In addition to Dave's appointment, Dave Morton transitioned to CFO 18 months ago. And recently, we have appointed Jim Murphy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Marketing; Kate Schuelke as Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary; and Ravi Naik as our Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer. In addition, as part of the restructuring actions taken over the last 12 months to optimize our global manufacturing and development center investments, we have also aligned all of our manufacturing operations under Senior Vice President of Operations, Jeff Nygaard, and we have reorganized our R&D functions to meet the evolving storage marketplace requirements. 
The board and I believe we have the right management team and organizational structure in place to execute Seagate's business strategy, capitalize on opportunities in the storage marketplace and continue to create long-term shareholder value. It's been an honor and a privilege for me to serve as Seagate's CEO in 16 of the last 20 years. I'm grateful to our amazing employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders, and I look forward to working closely with the management team on our future opportunities in my new role as Executive Chairman at Seagate.
Turning to our operational results. The overall macro environment continues to exhibit stability, and we believe this will continue through the rest of the calendar year and well into 2018. We remain cautiously optimistic that this should translate to moderate IT spending growth. 
In the context of the storage marketplace, the major transformative shifts from a client/server to mobile cloud, high-capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate. The long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending for the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies remains intact as they continue to increase their service offerings and demonstrate significant business momentum. At the same time, the more mature enterprise storage technologies remain a large percentage of the overall IT storage market and can exhibit variance beyond seasonal patterns as the structural shift to a wide variety of IT and cloud service providers accelerates.
In addition, the end-to-end storage supply chain is continuing to experience price increases by as much as 2 to 3x in the memory markets. The effect of this significant price increase is evidenced by some near-time enterprise customer demand softness, which we believe will be resolved over the next several quarters. 
For the June quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.4 billion, GAAP gross margins of 27.7%, net income of $114 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.38. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 28.9%, up 310 basis points year-over-year; net income of $192 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.65. HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 62 exabytes. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was approximately 1.8 terabytes per drive, and ASPs per unit were $64. 
We saw strength in the quarter from our largest nearline U.S.-based CSP customers and relative seasonal demand in the compute and branded markets. Offsetting this was weakness in our enterprise storage customers, including traditional OEM nearline and mission-critical demand; China CSP nearline demand and our own cloud storage systems business. In addition, there was weakness in the surveillance and NAS markets due to some inter-quarter channel inventory management. 
As a result, our overall revenue results were approximately 5% below plan with approximately half of that shortfall from our cloud storage systems and half from HDD enterprise weakness and channel inventory management. We believe some of these factors, particularly China CSP demand and NAS and surveillance market demand, are temporal and supply chain-related while some of the OEM revenue declines are more structural. 
Our non-GAAP margin results of 28.9% were approximately 210 basis points below our guidance. Within this, approximately 2/3 of the impact was due to operational issues in our CSSG business, and approximately 1/3 was due to lower-than-expected enterprise and surveillance HDD portfolio mix. GAAP operating expenses were $470 million, down 16% year-over-year; and non-GAAP operating expenses were $422 million, down 5% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $243 million, and free cash flow was $139 million, up 13% year-over-year.
While we were disappointed to not meet our top line targets in the June quarter, Seagate effectively achieved our operating margin and gross margin profitability targets for fiscal year '17. For the year, diluted earnings per share grew 215% on a GAAP basis and 82% on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, for fiscal year '17, we generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations and returned 53% of that to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. 
In summary, I'm pleased with the operational improvements we made in fiscal year '17. And we're well positioned for the markets that are being served by our products and systems. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more details on our operational activities."

For the June quarter, we achieved $2.4 billion in revenue and shipped 62 exabytes of storage with average capacity per drive of 1.8 terabytes. For the enterprise market, we shipped 23.5 exabytes with the average capacity per drive of 3.4 terabytes. Our average capacity per drive for our nearline products has reached over 4.8 terabytes per drive, up 8% over last year's strong 8 terabyte sales quarter and up 60% from the June quarter 2 years ago.
We continue to ramp our 10TB nearline product and shipped approximately 300,000 units in the June quarter. Our sales for this capacity point have almost doubled over the last 2 quarters, and we expect to ship approximately 1 million 10TB units in the September quarter. In addition, our 12TB product shipped per revenue in the June quarter with excellent customer feedback, and we are confident our qualification process is competitive. We expect to achieve approximately 50% of the exabyte share within the 10TB and 12TB markets by the end of the calendar year. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continue to represent a significant opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio design to serve these storage environments. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads with use cases from 2 to 4TB products for certain applications and up to 16 terabyte for other use cases. 
In the client and retail markets, our 1TB per platter, 2.5-inch platform continues to perform well. And to date, we have shipped over 45 million drives, substantially ahead of the competition. Using similar technology, our 2TB per platter, 3.5-inch platform began ramping last quarter for desktop markets, providing great value for customers needing 2, 4 and 8TB client capacity points. Customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition. 
Operating expenses for the June quarter were [indiscernible] (sic) [ $470 million ] GAAP basis and $422 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 5% year-over-year. Total consolidated expenses were slightly lower than forecast, primarily due to lower variable compensation. 
We continued to identify areas for cost improvements. And this morning, we filed a restructuring plan that will provide savings of approximately $90 million annually. These cost actions provide support of our objective to exit the calendar year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $400 million per quarter. In addition to these actions, we will continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of FY '18. 
Capital expenditures were $104 million for the June quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $243 million, and free cash flow was $139 million. These results include approximately $50 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the June quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 292 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the June quarter, which will be payable on October 4.
Interest expense for the June quarter was $62 million and will be lower in the September quarter due to the lower debt balance. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rate. In FY '17, we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment-grade financing with weighted average interest rate of less than 5% and paid $316 million to repurchase and redeem outstanding debt, including our 2021 7% senior notes. 
Overall, our operational and financial performance in FY '17 reflect execution of our business model profitability improvement objectives and our ability to generate cash flow from our storage portfolio. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business model and focus on our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Turning to the market outlook, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT and enterprise spending trends. We believe the end-to-end supply chain issues we identified last quarter will persist at least through the end of the year and, therefore, we want to exercise more caution than seasonally normal for traditional enterprise spending and other markets affected by higher-than-normal supply-chain pricing. At the same time, we are continuing to anticipate a stronger back half of the calendar year for exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem and seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs and the branded market. 
For the September quarter, we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. Our gross margin expectations for the September quarter are relatively flat and within our 29% to 33% targeted range. Cash flow from operations will be up sequentially. As Dave indicated, non-GAAP operating expenses will trend sequentially down to approximately $415 million in the September quarter, and we expect to exit the December quarter at or below $400 million. While we are not on a trajectory to meet our previous guide of non-GAAP EPS of $4.50 for calendar year '17, we do anticipate revenue and profit growth sequentially for the December quarter.

So there's slight share shifts going on, but really only the highest capacity point is super relevant. We think that's temporal. Like I said, the 2 questions that you asked are interrelated somewhat. The systems business that we have is -- there's a few different kinds of business in there. There's some specialty products buildout that we do, and then there's some things where we were really acting more like an ODM, I'll say. And that stuff is not very good business. And obviously a lot of ODMs get themselves into situations with the supply chain issues, where either they were underwater. They couldn't procure parts at the right point. They had supply that was older supply, so to speak. So it was -- it was a really tough road for the last 2 quarters in that, and we're going to have to really take a look at how much of that business we continue to support going forward."

But I did, I suppose,",375,"So Katy, let me first say, while I appreciate your congratulations on retirement, much to my children's chagrin, I have not retired. In fact, this is probably the best way for me to stay engaged with the company for a few more years. But I did, I suppose, retire from the CEO job. But -- so I'm super happy about where I'm headed, and what my engagement will be with the company. Also super happy that Mosley's CEO. As I said to someone the other day, that running a disk drive company is a little bit like driving in stop-and-go traffic. Sometimes you're going 15 miles an hour, and sometimes you're going 85 miles an hour. But you usually get to your destination on time, and no one's hurt. But it's stressful as s*** for the driver and, oftentimes, for the passengers, too. So I think we have a younger driver with better reaction times now. The -- I think your point is right on where we're headed on margins. The way we see the math, to your point, clearly, ramps are always challenging whether or not it's a 2.5-inch notebook product or a 3.5-inch surveillance product or a high-end nearline product. And whenever you're ramping, the products, the yields come up the ramp. You get better and you also do redesigns and bring costs down. And you also start to understand customer needs, which allow you to optimize the firmware, et cetera, et cetera. So we would expect that with the ramp on those products and the overall mix that occurs as customers move from 10s to 12s, to 14s to 16s, that we have opportunity to move up in that margin range. I think the good news on the quarter, frankly, is even with the weakness that we had on nearline and mission-critical and certain customer bases -- and even within the services group, the margins that they did contribute were not what they should've been. Even with that, the overall margin structure was pretty solid, which I think should give you a good sense of the underlying core HDD businesses is operating pretty nicely right now. And yes, it should improve as we execute here in second half of the year, yes."

We've never talked about where our gross margins are by products, and it's a really dangerous game to get in because we're so leveraged in our manufacturing and our R&D systems that to try and actually splice margins by segments, while it may be a fun accounting practice, it's really deceiving from an overall business practice. I will tell you, though, that our client portfolio has definitely greened up in terms of the technologies we're deploying. And again, we have an areal-density lead there that's now going on almost 2 years. So that means fewer heads and disks. So to reach the same capacity points, those clearly have better margins than they did historically for us competitively. So -- but I think the real message here is that it's -- you have to view it as the manufacturing company as a whole. And we strive to get as much leverage as we can across the components into the products as possible."

Some of that is penetration from flash. Some of that's architectural issues that are going on in the enterprise, and we may see some rebound to that with new chipsets that are coming our from Intel, for example. But it's kind of interesting because the last few quarters, we saw a strong back half to last calendar year. But the last few quarters have been weaker, and that's counterintuitive with flash prices going up the way they did. So that's the stuff that we's referring to as structural, though. The temporal stuff's very different. If you look at the building materials, whether you're a cloud service provider year -- around the world or whether you're an enterprise builder, the building materials was dramatically upset because of some component price increases. And trade-offs had to be made inside of that. In some cases, the trade-off can't be made because your supply chain can't do the build at the right economics. In some cases, you'll make the trade-off by saying, ""I'll prioritize this memory architecture right now or this amount of DRAM, for example, right now and then I'll hold."" The good news on that front for us is -- well, first, the bad news. The bad news is exabytes have been rather flat all the way through last year, and that doesn't make sense for where the cloud's going. The good news is, from the discussions that we have with our customers worldwide, growth of bits inside of data centers is still on a pretty healthy pace. And so this will come back. We've seen this a number of different times in our industry, and that's why we call it temporal."

And secondly, that we were going to work OpEx on 2 different vectors: One was absolute OpEx dollars, and the other was to maintain our margin model that we've committed to and we're staying committed to. That one, as you may remember, wasn't kind of on the steady ramp down because the first -- the last 6 months of last year were quite strong, and we needed to keep a fair amount of people in place to actually meet the upside demand. And there was also some critical product transitioning going on that we felt it made sense to keep the resources in place to make sure those transitions went well. And that benefited us extremely through fiscal year '17, where we obviously overachieved fairly dramatically relative to where we were a year ago. So I think we're back on how do we get to $400 million. I would probably say, though, as we think about going from $400 million to $375 million that, that is not a reflection so much of something going in the market, as much as a reflection of what happens when you start making adjustments to your OpEx. You obviously, then, see other opportunities where you can take some additional actions. And some of it is also related to things that Dave Mosley mentioned about, what's the quality of business that we're doing in the systems side? And what's the underlying OpEx support for that? And does that math really make sense? So a little bit of that, I'd say, in terms of how we're going to get from $400 million to $375 million, but not like market related to the sale of disk drives. It's more, I think, related to what we think we can do within the context we've always described as one that's positive."

We're going to shoot as high as we can, and we may even get above that versus based on what we're seeing in the lab right now.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business, and Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter. 
Before I begin my operational comments, I would like to discuss our announcement today of Seagate's CEO succession plan. Today, Seagate's Board of Directors voted unanimously in favor of my transition to Executive Chairman of Seagate and appointed Dave Mosley as Chief Executive Officer. Dave and I will assume our new roles effective October 1, at which time I will shift my focus primarily to strategic growth initiatives and other opportunities designed to enhance shareholder value for the company. Dave has also been appointed to the Seagate's Board of Directors effective immediately. 
Over the last 2 years, the board and I have been focused on executive management succession. In addition to Dave's appointment, Dave Morton transitioned to CFO 18 months ago. And recently, we have appointed Jim Murphy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Marketing; Kate Schuelke as Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary; and Ravi Naik as our Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer. In addition, as part of the restructuring actions taken over the last 12 months to optimize our global manufacturing and development center investments, we have also aligned all of our manufacturing operations under Senior Vice President of Operations, Jeff Nygaard, and we have reorganized our R&D functions to meet the evolving storage marketplace requirements. 
The board and I believe we have the right management team and organizational structure in place to execute Seagate's business strategy, capitalize on opportunities in the storage marketplace and continue to create long-term shareholder value. It's been an honor and a privilege for me to serve as Seagate's CEO in 16 of the last 20 years. I'm grateful to our amazing employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders, and I look forward to working closely with the management team on our future opportunities in my new role as Executive Chairman at Seagate.
Turning to our operational results. The overall macro environment continues to exhibit stability, and we believe this will continue through the rest of the calendar year and well into 2018. We remain cautiously optimistic that this should translate to moderate IT spending growth. 
In the context of the storage marketplace, the major transformative shifts from a client server to mobile cloud, high-capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate. The long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending for the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies remains intact as they continue to increase their service offerings and demonstrate significant business momentum. At the same time, the more mature enterprise storage technologies remain a large percentage of the overall IT storage market and can exhibit variance beyond seasonal patterns as the structural shift to a wide variety of IT and cloud service providers accelerates.
In addition, the end-to-end storage supply chain is continuing to experience price increases by as much as 2x to 3x in the memory markets. The effect of this significant price increase is evidenced by some near-time enterprise customer demand softness, which we believe will be resolved over the next several quarters. 
For the June quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.4 billion, GAAP gross margins of 27.7%, net income of $114 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.38. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 28.9%, up 310 basis points year-over-year; net income of $192 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.65. HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 62 exabytes. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was approximately 1.8 terabytes per drive, and ASPs per unit were $64. 
We saw strength in the quarter from our largest nearline U.S.-based CSP customers and relative seasonal demand in the compute and branded markets. Offsetting this was weakness in our enterprise storage customers, including traditional OEM nearline and mission-critical demand; China CSP nearline demand and our own cloud storage systems business. In addition, there was weakness in the surveillance and NAS markets due to some inter-quarter channel inventory management. 
As a result, our overall revenue results were approximately 5% below plan with approximately half of that shortfall from our cloud storage systems and half from HDD enterprise weakness and channel inventory management. We believe some of these factors, particularly China CSP demand and NAS and surveillance market demand, are temporal and supply chain-related while some of the OEM revenue declines are more structural. 
Our non-GAAP margin results of 28.9% were approximately 210 basis points below our guidance. Within this, approximately 2/3 of the impact was due to operational [ trans ] issues in our CSSG business, and approximately 1/3 was due to lower-than-expected enterprise and surveillance HDD portfolio mix. GAAP operating expenses were $470 million, down 16% year-over-year; and non-GAAP operating expenses were $422 million, down 5% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $243 million, and free cash flow was $139 million, up 13% year-over-year.
While we were disappointed to not meet our top line targets in the June quarter, Seagate effectively achieved our operating margin and gross margin profitability targets for fiscal year '17. For the year, diluted earnings per share grew 215% on a GAAP basis and 82% on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, for fiscal year '17, we generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations and returned 53% of that to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. 
In summary, I'm pleased with the operational improvements we made in fiscal year '17. And we're well positioned for the markets that are being served by our products and systems. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more details on our operational activities."

For the June quarter, we achieved $2.4 billion in revenue and shipped 62 exabytes of storage with an average capacity per drive of 1.8 terabytes. For the enterprise market, we shipped 23.5 exabytes with the average capacity per drive of 3.4 terabytes. Our average capacity per drive for our nearline products has reached over 4.8 terabytes per drive, up 8% over last year's strong 8 terabyte sales quarter and up 60% from the June quarter 2 years ago.
We continue to ramp our 10TB nearline product and shipped approximately 300,000 units in the June quarter. Our sales for this capacity point have almost doubled over the last 2 quarters, and we expect to ship approximately 1 million 10TB units in the September quarter. In addition, our 12TB product shipped with revenue in the June quarter with excellent customer feedback, and we are confident our qualification process is competitive. We expect to achieve approximately 50% of the exabyte share within the 10TB and 12TB markets by the end of the calendar year. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continue to represent a significant opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these storage environments. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads with use cases from 2 to 4TB products for certain applications and up to 16 terabyte for other use cases. 
In the client and retail markets, our 1TB per platter, 2.5-inch platform continues to perform well. And to date, we have shipped over 45 million drives, substantially ahead of the competition. Using similar technology, our 2TB per platter, 3.5-inch platform began ramping last quarter for desktop markets, providing great value for customers needing 2, 4 and 8TB client capacity points. Customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition. 
Operating expenses for the June quarter were [indiscernible] (sic) [ $470 million ] GAAP basis and $422 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 5% year-over-year. Total consolidated expenses were slightly lower than forecast, primarily due to lower variable compensation. 
We continue to identify areas for cost improvements and this morning, we filed a restructuring plan that will provide savings of approximately $90 million annually. These cost actions provide support of our objective to exit the calendar year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $400 million per quarter. In addition to these actions, we will continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of FY '18. 
Capital expenditures were $104 million for the June quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $243 million, and free cash flow was $139 million. These results include approximately $50 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the June quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 292 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the June quarter, which will be payable on October 4.
Interest expense for the June quarter was $62 million and will be lower in the September quarter due to the lower debt balance. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In FY '17, we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment-grade financing with weighted average interest rate of less than 5% and paid $316 million to repurchase and redeem outstanding debt, including our 2021 7% senior notes. 
Overall, our operational and financial performance in FY '17 reflect execution of our business model profitability improvement objectives and our ability to generate cash flow from our storage portfolio. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business model and focus on our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Turning to the market outlook, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT and enterprise spending trends. We believe the end-to-end supply chain issues we identified last quarter will persist at least through the end of the year and, therefore, we want to exercise more caution than seasonally normal for traditional enterprise spending and other markets affected by higher-than-normal supply-chain pricing. At the same time, we are continuing to anticipate a stronger back half of the calendar year for exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem and seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs and the branded market. 
For the September quarter, we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. Our gross margin expectations for the September quarter are relatively flat and within our 29% to 33% targeted range. Cash flow from operations will be up sequentially. As Dave indicated, non-GAAP operating expenses will trend sequentially down to approximately $415 million in the September quarter, and we expect to exit the December quarter at or below $400 million. While we are not on a trajectory to meet our previous guide of non-GAAP EPS of $4.50 for calendar year '17, we do anticipate revenue and profit growth sequentially for the December quarter. 
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open the call up for questions and answers."

So on the nearline side, some customers, you're heavy with; and other customers, you're not as heavy with. So there are some fundamental shifts going on depending on -- upon capacity points. I think at the highest capacity points, there's some things about our ramp that we're not happy with. The product is really good, and we're ramping it hard right now. At the lower capacity points, the 4s and 8s and things like that, quite happy with our products. That's where the -- some of the China CSP behavior and the smaller customers and their issues that they had across their supply chain were affected. So there's slight share shifts going on, but really only the highest capacity point is super relevant. We think that's temporal. Like I said, the 2 questions that you asked are interrelated somewhat. The systems business that we have is -- there's a few different kinds of business in there. There's some specialty products' buildout that we do, and then there's some things where we were really acting more like an ODM, I'll say. And that stuff is not very good business. And obviously a lot of ODMs get themselves into situations with the supply chain issues, where either they were underwater, they couldn't procure parts at the right point. They had supply that was older supply, so to speak. So it was -- it was a really tough road for the last 2 quarters in that, and we're going to have to really take a look at how much of that business we continue to support going forward."

In fact, this is probably the best way for me to stay engaged with the company for a few more years. But I did, I suppose, retire from the CEO job. But -- so I'm super happy about where I'm headed, and what my engagement will be with the company. Also super happy that Mosley is CEO. As I said to someone the other day, that running a disk drive company is a little bit like driving in stop-and-go traffic. Sometimes you're going 15 miles an hour, and sometimes you're going 85 miles an hour. But you usually get to your destination on time, and no one's hurt. But it's stressful as s*** for the driver and, oftentimes, for the passengers, too. So I think we have a younger driver with better reaction times now. The -- I think your point is right on where we're headed on margins. The way we see the math, to your point, clearly, ramps are always challenging whether or not it's a 2.5-inch notebook product or a 3.5-inch surveillance product or a high-end nearline product. And whenever you're ramping, the products, the yields come up the ramp. You get better and you also do redesigns and bring costs down. And you also start to understand customer needs, which allow you to optimize the firmware, et cetera, et cetera. So we would expect that with the ramp on those products and the overall mix of that occurs as customers move from 10s to 12s, to 14s to 16s, that we have opportunity to move up in that margin range. I think the good news on the quarter, frankly, is even with the weakness that we had on nearline and mission-critical and certain customer bases -- and even within the services group, the margins that they did contribute were not what they should've been. Even with that, the overall margin structure was pretty solid, which I think should give you a good sense of the underlying core HDD businesses is operating pretty nicely right now. And yes, it should improve as we execute here in second half of the year, yes."

We've never talked about where our gross margins are by products, and it's a really dangerous game to get in because we're so leveraged in our manufacturing and our R&D systems that to try and actually splice margins by segments, while it may be a fun accounting practice, it's really deceiving from an overall business practice. I will tell you, though, that our client portfolio has definitely greened up in terms of the technologies we're deploying. And again, we have an areal-density lead there that's now going on almost 2 years. So that means fewer heads and disks. So to reach the same capacity points, those clearly have better margins than they did historically for us competitively. So -- but I think the real message here is that it's -- you have to view it as the manufacturing company as a whole. And we strive to get as much leverage as we can across the components into the products as possible."

Some of that is penetration from flash. Some of that's architectural issues that are going on in the enterprise, and we may see some rebound in that with new chipsets that are coming our from Intel, for example. But it's kind of interesting because the last few quarters, we saw a strong back half to last calendar year. But the last few quarters have been weaker, and that's counterintuitive with flash prices going up the way they did. So that's the stuff that we's referring to as structural, though. The temporal stuff's very different. If you look at the building materials, whether you're a cloud service provider year -- around the world or whether you're an enterprise builder, the building materials was dramatically upset because of some component price increases. And trade-offs had to be made inside of that. In some cases, the trade-off can't be made because your supply chain can't do the build at the right economics. In some cases, you'll make the trade-off by saying, ""I'll prioritize this memory architecture right now or this amount of DRAM, for example, right now and then I'll hold."" The good news on that front for us is -- well, first, the bad news. The bad news is exabytes have been rather flat all the way through last year, and that doesn't make sense for where the cloud's going. The good news is, from the discussions that we have with our customers worldwide, growth of bits inside of data centers is still on a pretty healthy pace. And so this will come back. We've seen this a number of different times in our industry, and that's why we call it temporal."

And secondly, that we were going to work OpEx on 2 different vectors: One was absolute OpEx dollars, and the other was to maintain our margin model that we've committed to and we're staying committed to. That one, as you may remember, wasn't kind of on the steady ramp down because the first -- the last 6 months of last year were quite strong, and we needed to keep a fair amount of people in place to actually meet the upside demand. And there was also some critical product transitioning going on that we felt it made sense to keep the resources in place to make sure those transitions went well. And that benefited us extremely through fiscal year '17, where we obviously overachieved fairly dramatically relative to where we were a year ago. So I think we're back on how do we get to $400 million. I would probably say, though, as we think about going from $400 million to $375 million that, that is not a reflection so much of something going on in the market, as much as a reflection of what happens when you start making adjustments to your OpEx. You obviously, then, see other opportunities where you can take some additional actions. And some of it is also related to things that Dave Mosley mentioned about, what's the quality of business that we're doing in the systems side? And what's the underlying OpEx support for that? And does that math really make sense? So a little bit of that, I'd say, in terms of how we're going to get from $400 million to $375 million, but not like market related to the sale of disk drives. It's more, I think, related to what we think we can do within the context we've always described as one that's positive."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call we are hosting from Dublin, Ireland. Joining me today from Seagate's executive team are Steve Luczo, Chairman and CEO; Dave Morton, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Dave Mosley, President and Chief Operating Officer. We've posted our earnings press release and detailed supplemental information for our June quarter and year-end fiscal 2017 on our Investor Relations site at seagate.com. 
During today's call, we will review the highlights for the June quarter and fiscal year '17 and provide the company's outlook for the September quarter and then open the call for questions. We are planning for the call today to go approximately half an hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits.
We will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures on this call. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investors section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.
As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance, customer demand, technology and product development advancements and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the Investors section of the company's website.
I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Luczo. Please go ahead, Steve."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business, and Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter. 
Before I begin my operational comments, I would like to discuss our announcement today of Seagate's CEO succession plan. Today, Seagate's Board of Directors voted unanimously in favor of my transition to Executive Chairman of Seagate and appointed Dave Mosley as Chief Executive Officer. Dave and I will assume our new roles effective October 1, at which time I will shift my focus primarily to strategic growth initiatives and other opportunities designed to enhance shareholder value for the company. Dave has also been appointed to the Seagate's Board of Directors effective immediately. 
Over the last 2 years, the board and I have been focused on executive management succession. In addition to Dave's appointment, Dave Morton transitioned to CFO 18 months ago. And recently, we have appointed Jim Murphy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Marketing; Kate Schuelke as Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary; and Ravi Naik as our Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer. In addition, as part of the restructuring actions taken over the last 12 months to optimize our global manufacturing and development center investments, we have also aligned all of our manufacturing operations under Senior Vice President of Operations, Jeff Nygaard, and we have reorganized our R&D functions to meet the evolving storage marketplace requirements. 
The board and I believe we have the right management team and organizational structure in place to execute Seagate's business strategy, capitalize on opportunities in the storage marketplace and continue to create long-term shareholder value. It's been an honor and a privilege for me to serve as Seagate's CEO in 16 of the last 20 years. I'm grateful to our amazing employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders, and I look forward to working closely with the management team on our future opportunities in my new role as Executive Chairman at Seagate.
Turning to our operational results. The overall macro environment continues to exhibit stability, and we believe this will continue through the rest of the calendar year and well into 2018. We remain cautiously optimistic that this should translate to moderate IT spending growth. 
In the context of the storage marketplace, the major transformative shifts from a client server to mobile cloud, high-capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate. The long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending for the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies remains intact as they continue to increase their service offerings and demonstrate significant business momentum. At the same time, the more mature enterprise storage technologies remain a large percentage of the overall IT storage market and can exhibit variance beyond seasonal patterns as the structural shift to a wide variety of IT and cloud service providers accelerates.
In addition, the end-to-end storage supply chain is continuing to experience price increases by as much as 2x to 3x in the memory markets. The effect of this significant price increase is evidenced by some near-time enterprise customer demand softness, which we believe will be resolved over the next several quarters. 
For the June quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.4 billion, GAAP gross margins of 27.7%, net income of $114 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.38. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 28.9%, up 310 basis points year-over-year; net income of $192 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.65. HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 62 exabytes. Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was approximately 1.8 terabytes per drive, and ASPs per unit were $64. 
We saw strength in the quarter from our largest nearline U.S.-based CSP customers and relative seasonal demand in the compute and branded markets. Offsetting this was weakness in our enterprise storage customers, including traditional OEM nearline and mission-critical demand; China CSP nearline demand and our own cloud storage systems business. In addition, there was weakness in the surveillance and NAS markets due to some inter-quarter channel inventory management. 
As a result, our overall revenue results were approximately 5% below plan with approximately half of that shortfall from our cloud storage systems and half from HDD enterprise weakness and channel inventory management. We believe some of these factors, particularly China CSP demand and NAS and surveillance market demand, are temporal and supply chain-related while some of the OEM revenue declines are more structural. 
Our non-GAAP margin results of 28.9% were approximately 210 basis points below our guidance. Within this, approximately 2/3 of the impact was due to operational [ trans ] issues in our CSSG business, and approximately 1/3 was due to lower-than-expected enterprise and surveillance HDD portfolio mix. GAAP operating expenses were $470 million, down 16% year-over-year; and non-GAAP operating expenses were $422 million, down 5% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $243 million, and free cash flow was $139 million, up 13% year-over-year.
While we were disappointed to not meet our top line targets in the June quarter, Seagate effectively achieved our operating margin and gross margin profitability targets for fiscal year '17. For the year, diluted earnings per share grew 215% on a GAAP basis and 82% on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, for fiscal year '17, we generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations and returned 53% of that to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. 
In summary, I'm pleased with the operational improvements we made in fiscal year '17. And we're well positioned for the markets that are being served by our products and systems. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more details on our operational activities."

For the June quarter, we achieved $2.4 billion in revenue and shipped 62 exabytes of storage with an average capacity per drive of 1.8 terabytes. For the enterprise market, we shipped 23.5 exabytes with the average capacity per drive of 3.4",693,"Thanks, Steve. For the June quarter, we achieved $2.4 billion in revenue and shipped 62 exabytes of storage with an average capacity per drive of 1.8 terabytes. For the enterprise market, we shipped 23.5 exabytes with the average capacity per drive of 3.4 terabytes. Our average capacity per drive for our nearline products has reached over 4.8 terabytes per drive, up 8% over last year's strong 8 terabyte sales quarter and up 60% from the June quarter 2 years ago.
We continue to ramp our 10TB nearline product and shipped approximately 300,000 units in the June quarter. Our sales for this capacity point have almost doubled over the last 2 quarters, and we expect to ship approximately 1 million 10TB units in the September quarter. In addition, our 12TB product shipped with revenue in the June quarter with excellent customer feedback, and we are confident our qualification process is competitive. We expect to achieve approximately 50% of the exabyte share within the 10TB and 12TB markets by the end of the calendar year. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continue to represent a significant opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these storage environments. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect the nearline market to be diversified in capacity points for different application workloads with use cases from 2 to 4TB products for certain applications and up to 16 terabyte for other use cases. 
In the client and retail markets, our 1TB per platter, 2.5-inch platform continues to perform well. And to date, we have shipped over 45 million drives, substantially ahead of the competition. Using similar technology, our 2TB per platter, 3.5-inch platform began ramping last quarter for desktop markets, providing great value for customers needing 2, 4 and 8TB client capacity points. Customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition. 
Operating expenses for the June quarter were [indiscernible] (sic) [ $470 million ] GAAP basis and $422 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 5% year-over-year. Total consolidated expenses were slightly lower than forecast, primarily due to lower variable compensation. 
We continue to identify areas for cost improvements and this morning, we filed a restructuring plan that will provide savings of approximately $90 million annually. These cost actions provide support of our objective to exit the calendar year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $400 million per quarter. In addition to these actions, we will continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of FY '18. 
Capital expenditures were $104 million for the June quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment. Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $243 million, and free cash flow was $139 million. These results include approximately $50 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the June quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 292 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the June quarter, which will be payable on October 4.
Interest expense for the June quarter was $62 million and will be lower in the September quarter due to the lower debt balance. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In FY '17, we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment-grade financing with weighted average interest rate of less than 5% and paid $316 million to repurchase and redeem outstanding debt, including our 2021 7% senior notes. 
Overall, our operational and financial performance in FY '17 reflect execution of our business model profitability improvement objectives and our ability to generate cash flow from our storage portfolio. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business model and focus on our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Turning to the market outlook, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT and enterprise spending trends. We believe the end-to-end supply chain issues we identified last quarter will persist at least through the end of the year and, therefore, we want to exercise more caution than seasonally normal for traditional enterprise spending and other markets affected by higher-than-normal supply-chain pricing. At the same time, we are continuing to anticipate a stronger back half of the calendar year for exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem and seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs and the branded market. 
For the September quarter, we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. Our gross margin expectations for the September quarter are relatively flat and within our 29% to 33% targeted range. Cash flow from operations will be up sequentially. As Dave indicated, non-GAAP operating expenses will trend sequentially down to approximately $415 million in the September quarter, and we expect to exit the December quarter at or below $400 million. While we are not on a trajectory to meet our previous guide of non-GAAP EPS of $4.50 for calendar year '17, we do anticipate revenue and profit growth sequentially for the December quarter.

So on the nearline side, some customers, you're heavy with; and other customers, you're not as heavy with. So there are some fundamental shifts going on depending on -- upon capacity points. I think at the highest capacity points, there's some things about our ramp that we're not happy with. The product is really good, and we're ramping it hard right now. At the lower capacity points, the 4s and 8s and things like that, quite happy with our products. That's where the -- some of the China CSP behavior and the smaller customers and their issues that they had across their supply chain were affected. So there's slight share shifts going on, but really only the highest capacity point is super relevant. We think that's temporal. Like I said, the 2 questions that you asked are interrelated somewhat. The systems business that we have is -- there's a few different kinds of business in there. There's some specialty products' buildout that we do, and then there's some things where we were really acting more like an ODM, I'll say. And that stuff is not very good business. And obviously a lot of ODMs get themselves into situations with the supply chain issues, where either they were underwater, they couldn't procure parts at the right point. They had supply that was older supply, so to speak. So it was -- it was a really tough road for the last 2 quarters in that, and we're going to have to really take a look at how much of that business we continue to support going forward."

In fact, this is probably the best way for me to stay engaged with the company for a few more years. But I did, I suppose, retire from the CEO job. But -- so I'm super happy about where I'm headed, and what my engagement will be with the company. Also super happy that Mosley is CEO. As I said to someone the other day, that running a disk drive company is a little bit like driving in stop-and-go traffic. Sometimes you're going 15 miles an hour, and sometimes you're going 85 miles an hour. But you usually get to your destination on time, and no one's hurt. But it's stressful as s*** for the driver and, oftentimes, for the passengers, too. So I think we have a younger driver with better reaction times now. The -- I think your point is right on where we're headed on margins. The way we see the math, to your point, clearly, ramps are always challenging whether or not it's a 2.5-inch notebook product or a 3.5-inch surveillance product or a high-end nearline product. And whenever you're ramping, the products, the yields come up the ramp. You get better and you also do redesigns and bring costs down. And you also start to understand customer needs, which allow you to optimize the firmware, et cetera, et cetera. So we would expect that with the ramp on those products and the overall mix of that occurs as customers move from 10s to 12s, to 14s to 16s, that we have opportunity to move up in that margin range. I think the good news on the quarter, frankly, is even with the weakness that we had on nearline and mission-critical and certain customer bases -- and even within the services group, the margins that they did contribute were not what they should've been. Even with that, the overall margin structure was pretty solid, which I think should give you a good sense of the underlying core HDD businesses is operating pretty nicely right now. And yes, it should improve as we execute here in second half of the year, yes."

We've never talked about where our gross margins are by products, and it's a really dangerous game to get in because we're so leveraged in our manufacturing and our R&D systems that to try and actually splice margins by segments, while it may be a fun accounting practice, it's really deceiving from an overall business practice. I will tell you, though, that our client portfolio has definitely greened up in terms of the technologies we're deploying. And again, we have an areal-density lead there that's now going on almost 2 years. So that means fewer heads and disks. So to reach the same capacity points, those clearly have better margins than they did historically for us competitively. So -- but I think the real message here is that it's -- you have to view it as the manufacturing company as a whole. And we strive to get as much leverage as we can across the components into the products as possible."

Some of that is penetration from flash. Some of that's architectural issues that are going on in the enterprise, and we may see some rebound in that with new chipsets that are coming our from Intel, for example. But it's kind of interesting because the last few quarters, we saw a strong back half to last calendar year. But the last few quarters have been weaker, and that's counterintuitive with flash prices going up the way they did. So that's the stuff that we's referring to as structural, though. The temporal stuff's very different. If you look at the building materials, whether you're a cloud service provider year -- around the world or whether you're an enterprise builder, the building materials was dramatically upset because of some component price increases. And trade-offs had to be made inside of that. In some cases, the trade-off can't be made because your supply chain can't do the build at the right economics. In some cases, you'll make the trade-off by saying, ""I'll prioritize this memory architecture right now or this amount of DRAM, for example, right now and then I'll hold."" The good news on that front for us is -- well, first, the bad news. The bad news is exabytes have been rather flat all the way through last year, and that doesn't make sense for where the cloud's going. The good news is, from the discussions that we have with our customers worldwide, growth of bits inside of data centers is still on a pretty healthy pace. And so this will come back. We've seen this a number of different times in our industry, and that's why we call it temporal."

And secondly, that we were going to work OpEx on 2 different vectors: One was absolute OpEx dollars, and the other was to maintain our margin model that we've committed to and we're staying committed to. That one, as you may remember, wasn't kind of on the steady ramp down because the first -- the last 6 months of last year were quite strong, and we needed to keep a fair amount of people in place to actually meet the upside demand. And there was also some critical product transitioning going on that we felt it made sense to keep the resources in place to make sure those transitions went well. And that benefited us extremely through fiscal year '17, where we obviously overachieved fairly dramatically relative to where we were a year ago. So I think we're back on how do we get to $400 million. I would probably say, though, as we think about going from $400 million to $375 million that, that is not a reflection so much of something going on in the market, as much as a reflection of what happens when you start making adjustments to your OpEx. You obviously, then, see other opportunities where you can take some additional actions. And some of it is also related to things that Dave Mosley mentioned about, what's the quality of business that we're doing in the systems side? And what's the underlying OpEx support for that? And does that math really make sense? So a little bit of that, I'd say, in terms of how we're going to get from $400 million to $375 million, but not like market related to the sale of disk drives. It's more, I think, related to what we think we can do within the context we've always described as one that's positive."

Beginning with our operational results for the September quarter. Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.6 billion, GAAP gross margins of 28%, net income of $181 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.62. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 29%, net income of $279 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.96. 
HDD exabyte shipments for the September quarter were a record 70.3 exabytes, up 5% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was also a record 1.9 terabytes per drive, and the average selling price per unit was $64.
GAAP operating expenses were $481 million, down 17% year-over-year. And non-GAAP operating expenses were $408 million, down 14% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $237 million, and free cash flow was $113 million. 
At the end of September, Seagate announced our participation in this consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation. We are pleased to be part of the consortium and to help facilitate maintaining Toshiba Memory as a world-leading, independent NAND technology company. Over the course of many years, Seagate's developed a long-term relationship with Toshiba Memory, and we have also been impressed with their consistent leadership in advancing NAND technology. We believe that Bain Capital is dedicated to the long-term success of Toshiba Memory, and this acquisition is in the long-term best interest of our industry and the storage customers worldwide. 
In addition, we expect to enter into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory, and that will provide continuity of raw NAND for our expanding product portfolio. We have developed our NAND storage technology portfolio over the last several years, and today, we have a broad offering of flash-based products that are ready to scale and grow across multiple markets. 
Our NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory will enable Seagate to continue innovating and providing customers with storage solutions that fit their needs, be it HDDs, SSDs or hybrid solutions. This agreement has the opportunity to increase the potential for meaningful future revenue growth from Seagate's NAND storage portfolio while providing significant value for our storage customers. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. However, we will not be providing further color on the details of the transaction until we are closer to the deal closure. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities."

For the September quarter, we achieved at $2.6 billion in revenue and shipped a record 70.3 exabytes of storage, with an average capacity per drive of 1.9 terabytes, also a record.

For the September quarter, we achieved at $2.6 billion in revenue and shipped a record 70.3 exabytes of storage, with an average capacity per drive of 1.9 terabytes, also a record. 
For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped 27.2 exabytes, with a record average capacity of 3.9 terabytes per drive. Our average capacity per drive for our nearline products reached over 5.4 terabytes per drive, up 17% over last year's strong ATB demand and up 75% from the September quarter 2 years ago. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect that a diverse and strong market with multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Use cases will cause capacity points to span from 2 to 4 terabytes for certain applications and up to 16 terabytes for other customer needs. At Seagate, we believe we are well poised to help our cloud customers with their stringent and varied requirements. 
Our 10-terabyte helium nearline product was our leading enterprise revenue SKU in the September quarter, and we shipped over 1 million 10-terabyte units, up threefold from the June quarter. We also achieved sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12-terabyte helium nearline product in the September quarter. Customer feedback has been excellent, and we are confident in our competitiveness across our key customer qualification processes.
For the December quarter, we are planning for significant sequential volume and revenue growth for our 10-terabyte and our 12-terabyte helium products as the market adoption grows. 
In the edge and consumer verticals, our 1-terabyte per platter, 2.5-inch platform continues to perform well. Using our areal density advantage, our 2-terabyte per platter, 3.5-inch platform continues to ramp for desktop markets, providing a great value for customers needing 2-, 4- and 8-terabyte capacity points. Customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition in these important verticals.
Within this, notebook compute revenue was up 37% year-over-year, with exabytes up 75% year-over-year. Average capacity per notebook compute drive [indiscernible] year-over-year.
Our gaming business revenue grew sequentially 13%, and average capacity per drive was up 27% over last year. We continue to be selective in our participation in this market, and we are focused on the highest capacity areas for the gaming customers that are demanding more local mass storage for the rich gaming experiences. 
Our non-HDD revenue, primarily from our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, in the September quarter was $242 million, up 30% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% year-over-year. Our operating expenses for the September quarter were $481 million on a GAAP basis and $408 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 14% year-over-year. Total operating expenses were slightly lower than forecast, primarily due to restructuring and other cost-containment measures.
We continue to identify areas for cost improvements, and during the September quarter, we divested the majority of our high-performance computing assets, which will result in a cost savings of approximately $20 million a year and impact revenues by approximately $50 million per year in our non-HDD revenue. 
We remain on track to exit the calendar year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $400 million per quarter.
Capital expenditures were $124 million for the September quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment, supporting the continued ramp of our new HDD products in our portfolio, which utilize new tooling and equipment. For December quarter, we expect capital expenditures to decrease sequentially and remain less than 5% of our total consolidated revenue for FY '18. 
Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $237 million, and free cash flow was $113 million. These results include approximately $46 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges and some inventory staging related to a strong October demand signals. 
For the December quarter, we anticipate cash flow from operations to be at least 2x more than the September quarter due to working capital improvements in our business outlook. 
Our balance sheet remains heavy -- healthy, and we ended the September quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with 289 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 3, 2018.
Interest expense for the September quarter was $61 million. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the September quarter, we deployed $166 million to redeem 5 million shares and $22 million towards redeeming our 2018 senior notes.
As Dave Mosley noted, at the end of September, we announced our participation in the consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation. We committed to provide up to $1.25 billion in financing to support the acquisition. Upon closing, we would expect to fund the transaction with existing cash balances and some short-term financing mechanisms. Including the long-term NAND supply agreements we expect to enter with Toshiba Memory, we anticipate this transaction to be accretive to our earnings. 
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the September quarter reflects execution of our business model and profitability improvement objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and focus on aligning our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

The long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies appear intact, as they continue to demonstrate and increase their service offerings and exhibit significant business momentum. 
Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. 
Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products. Over the last 5 years, we have been the leader in areal density with our SMR and TDMR areal density solutions, and we continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR, technology portfolio, which is expected to be shipping in volume in 2019. 
Over the past year, we have been ramping production of our HAMR evaluation drives, and we have shared samples of current generation shipping product with HAMR technology substituted in these devices. Early customer feedback from more than 6 months ago, using standard qualification processes, demonstrates that the technology will not require any changes for customers to adopt. We believe that HAMR technology opens up a rich design space for high capacity and great value, and we've been communicating that with customers for some months now. 
In terms of future investment in order to launch our HAMR portfolio, the costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model. 
While we don't have time today, I personally am looking forward to discussing more about HDD areal density and future technology development at our next strategic update that Kate mentioned earlier. 
Turning to our market outlook. With major transformative shifts taking place in the storage marketplace from client/server to mobile cloud, high-capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate. We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment as well as enterprise and consumer spending trends. 
On the heels of the various IT component supply constraints we witnessed in late calendar 2016 and early 2017, we are continuing to monitor outgoing inventory closely. From Seagate's vantage point, our channel inventory positions and inventory for our customers that are visible to us are, in general, lower than last year. Sell-through appears reasonable.
For the December quarter, we anticipate strong exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem; normal seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs in the consumer market; and sequential growth in our Cloud Systems and silicon businesses. Almost all of our vertical markets are now engaged in exabyte growth again compared to the first half of the calendar year. 
Given this demand environment, for the December quarter, we expect to achieve revenues up approximately 3% to 5% sequentially from the September quarter. This is consistent to slightly better than the sequential growth we saw at this time last year. 
Gross margins to expand slightly sequentially and within our 29% to 33% long-term range; non-GAAP operating expenses down sequentially 2% to 3%, with further cost containment measures, as we continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of fiscal '18; and cash flow from operations to be up significantly sequentially, with improvements in working capital and less restructuring costs. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners for their contributions to our quarter's results. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

I think, if I think about 2016, calendar 2016, we were strong from March through November in all markets geographically. So CSPs were strong, and we saw strength in some of the more nascent cloud spaces. We believe that the various component supply issues that existed and pricing of those components and so on actually caused a little bit of an overbuy and some further disruption in the supply chain, which we've talked about. And so some of the markets, not necessarily all the CSPs, but some of the markets, were impacted in early 2017. And I would say, at this point, all the way through July, we were still seeing that impact. August and September started to turn back on, which resulted in some of the growth that we saw in the quarter. But year point, it's not back to the level it was before, although it appears to be coming back. What we hear inside of the data centers is that the exabyte growth is still high, so the bit growth is still high. That's irrespective of whether you're talking to large-scale CSPs or some of the smaller cloud players who still have yet to build out the scale. But people couldn't exactly stretch for all those solutions. And now it looks like now they figured out architecturally how they're going to respond to the new cost structures or maybe they had supply -- other supply chain issues that would cause them to -- some of the suppliers to not want to build for them for a while. I think we're through most of that, and I think we're seeing the world starting to turn on."

The exabyte growth, as both the previous people have asked the question about, has been rather muted this last year if you look at it in aggregate. And some of it's driven by the cloud. Some of it's driven by other dynamics. Long term, we think data's growing at 30% to 35%. We've been talking about that fairly openly. But the fact that we're off the trend this year means that we'll get back on the trend in the future. Now now fast does it come back, some of that depends on the architectural nuance that I referred to earlier. Are people truly on to further architectures that they can deploy? Or do they still have parts in the system? And what's going on with their specific applications? I actually think we're going into fairly healthy period of the growth that gets us back under the trend line, and that's what's something we're trying to respond to. We can do it with higher and higher capacity drives because we have areal density to solution it."

Now, obviously, our job is to turn that into orders as quickly as we possibly can, and we're out pursuing strategic agreements to go do that because these are large investments that these companies are can have to make. But I do think that calendar year '18 will be better than calendar year '17 was from an exabyte perspective. On the Skylight question, it's kind of interesting because we look back ourselves at some of these Intel transitions and said, ""What does that typically mean for our industry? And when do things latch?"" This one's very different because, I think, the nature of the interface and performance and so on are actually pretty exciting for the entire enterprise space. Typically, it doesn't latch very quickly. But typically, does mode to a different value proposition overtime, and that's consistent with the mixup discussions that we had in mission-critical. We believe that some of the lower capacity points will be flushed from the system and will mix up to higher capacity points and mission-critical. As we look towards the future, that market, it's not a big market, but the mix will be high.

Beginning with our operational results for the September quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.6 billion, GAAP gross margins of 28%, net income of $181 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.62. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 29%, net income of $279 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.96. HDD exabyte shipments for the September quarter were a record 70.3 exabytes, up 5% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was also a record 1.9 terabytes per drive, and the average selling price per unit was $64. GAAP operating expenses were $481 million, down 17% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $408 million, down 14% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $237 million, and free cash flow was $113 million. 
At the end of September, Seagate announced our participation in this consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation. We're pleased to be part of the consortium and to help facilitate maintaining Toshiba Memory as a world-leading, independent NAND technology company. Over the course of many years, Seagate's developed a long-term relationship with Toshiba Memory, and we've always been impressed with their consistent leadership in advancing NAND technology. We believe that Bain Capital is dedicated to the long-term success of Toshiba Memory, and this acquisition is in the long-term best interest of our industry and the storage customers worldwide. 
In addition, we expect to enter into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory, and that will provide continuity of raw NAND for our expanding product portfolio. We have developed our NAND storage technology portfolio over the last several years, and today, we have a broad offering of flash-based products that are ready to scale and grow across multiple markets. Our NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory will enable Seagate to continue innovating and providing customers with storage solutions that fit their needs, be it HDDs, SSDs or hybrid solutions. This agreement has the opportunity to increase the potential for meaningful future revenue growth from Seagate's NAND storage portfolio while providing significant value for our storage customers. 
We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. However, we will not be providing further color on the details of the transaction until we're closer to deal closure. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities."

For the September quarter, we achieved $2.6 billion in revenue and shipped a record 70.3 exabytes of storage with an average capacity per drive of 1.9 terabytes, also a record.

For the September quarter, we achieved $2.6 billion in revenue and shipped a record 70.3 exabytes of storage with an average capacity per drive of 1.9 terabytes, also a record. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped 27.2 exabytes with a record average capacity of 3.9 terabytes per drive. Our average capacity per drive for our nearline products reached over 5.4 terabytes per drive, up 17% over last year's strong ATB demand and up 75% from the September quarter 2 years ago. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we're confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect a diverse and strong market with multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Use cases will cause capacity points to span from 2 to 4 terabytes for certain applications and up to 16 terabytes for other customer needs. At Seagate, we believe we're well poised to help our cloud customers with their stringent and varied requirements. 
Our 10-terabyte helium nearline product was our leading enterprise revenue SKU in the September quarter, and we shipped over 1 million 10-terabyte units, up threefold from the June quarter. We also achieved sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12-terabyte helium nearline product in the September quarter. Customer feedback has been excellent, and we're confident in our competitiveness across our key customer qualification processes. For the December quarter, we're planning for significant sequential volume and revenue growth for our 10-terabyte and our 12-terabyte helium products as the market adoption grows. 
In the edge and consumer verticals, our 1-terabyte per platter, 2.5-inch platform continues to perform well. Using our areal density advantage, our 2-terabyte per platter, 3.5-inch platform continues to ramp for desktop markets, providing a great value for customers needing 2-, 4- and 8-terabyte capacity points. Customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition in these important verticals. Within this, notebook compute revenue was up 37% year-over-year with exabytes up 75% year-over-year. Average capacity per notebook compute drive [indiscernible] year-over-year. 
Our gaming business revenue grew sequentially 13%, and average capacity per drive was up 27% over last year. We continue to be selective in our participation in this market, and we're focused on the highest capacity areas for the gaming customers that are demanding more local mass storage for the rich gaming experiences. 
Our non-HDD revenue, primarily from our cloud systems and silicon group in the September quarter was $242 million, up 30% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% year-over-year. Our operating expenses for the September quarter were $481 million on a GAAP basis and $408 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 14% year-over-year. Total operating expenses were slightly lower than forecast, primarily due to restructuring and other cost-containment measures. We continue to identify areas for cost improvements. And during the September quarter, we divested the majority of our high-performance computing assets, which will result in a cost savings of approximately $20 million a year and impact revenues by approximately $50 million per year in our non-HDD revenue. We remain on track to exit the calendar year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $400 million per quarter.
Capital expenditures were $124 million for the September quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment, supporting the continued ramp of our new HDD products in our portfolio, which utilize new tooling and equipment. For December quarter, we expect capital expenditures to decrease sequentially and remain less than 5% of our total consolidated revenue for FY '18. 
Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $237 million, and free cash flow was $113 million. These results include approximately $46 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges and some inventory staging related to a strong October demand signals. For December quarter, we anticipate cash flow from operations to be at least 2x more than the September quarter due to working capital improvements in our business outlook. 
Our balance sheet remains heavy -- healthy, and we ended the September quarter for -- with $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents with 289 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 3, 2018.
Interest expense for the September quarter was $61 million. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the September quarter, we deployed $166 million to redeem 5 million shares and $22 million towards redeeming our 2018 senior notes.
As Dave Mosley noted, at the end of September, we announced our participation in the consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation. We committed to provide up to $1.25 billion in financing to support the acquisition. Upon closing, we would expect to fund the transaction with existing cash balances and some short-term financing mechanisms. Including the long-term NAND supply agreements we expect to enter with Toshiba Memory, we anticipate this transaction to be accretive to our earnings. 
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the September quarter reflects execution of our business model and profitability improvement objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and focus on aligning our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

The long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies appear intact, as they continue to demonstrate and increase their service offerings and exhibit significant business momentum. 
Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products. Over the last 5 years, we've been the leader in areal density with our SMR and TDMR areal density solutions, and we continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR, technology portfolio, which is expected to be shipping in volume in 2019. 
Over the past year, we have been ramping production of our HAMR evaluation drives, and we have shared samples of current generation shipping product with HAMR technology substituted in these devices. Early customer feedback from more than 6 months ago, using standard qualification processes, demonstrates that the technology will not require any changes for customers to adopt. We believe that HAMR technology opens up a rich design space for high capacity and great value, and we've been communicating that with customers for some months now. 
In terms of future investment in order to launch our HAMR portfolio, the costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model. While we don't have time today, I personally am looking forward to discussing more about HDD areal density and future technology development at our next strategic update that Kate mentioned earlier. 
Turning to our market outlook. With major transformative shifts taking place in the storage marketplace from client/server to mobile cloud, high-capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate. We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment as well as enterprise and consumer spending trends. 
On the heels of the various IT component supply constraints we witnessed in late calendar 2016 and early 2017, we're continuing to monitor outgoing inventory closely. From Seagate's vantage point, our channel inventory positions and inventory for our customers that are visible to us are, in general, lower than last year. Sell-through appears reasonable.
For the December quarter, we anticipate: strong exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem; normal seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs in the consumer market; and sequential growth in our cloud systems and silicon businesses. Almost all of our vertical markets are now engaged in exabyte growth again compared to the first half of the calendar year. 
Given this demand environment, for the December quarter, we expect to achieve: revenues up approximately 3% to 5% sequentially from the September quarter. This is consistent to slightly better than the sequential growth we saw at this time last year; gross margins to expand slightly sequentially and within our 29% to 33% long-term range; non-GAAP operating expenses down sequentially 2% to 3% with further cost-containment measures as we continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of fiscal '18; and cash flow from operations to be up significantly sequentially with improvements in working capital and less restructuring costs. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners for their contributions to our quarter's results. 
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

I think -- if I think about 2016, calendar 2016, we were strong from March through November in all markets geographically. So CSPs were strong, and we saw strength in some of the more nascent cloud spaces. We believe that the various component supply issues that existed and pricing of those components and so on actually caused a little bit of an overbuy and some further disruption in the supply chain, which we've talked about. And so some of the markets, not necessarily all the CSPs, but some of the markets, were impacted in early 2017. And I would say, at this point, all the way through July, we were still seeing that impact. August and September started to turn back on, which resulted in some of the growth that we saw in the quarter. But to your point, it's not back to the level it was before, although it appears to be coming back. What we hear inside of the data centers is that the exabyte growth is still high, so the bit growth is still high. That's irrespective of whether you're talking to large-scale CSPs or some of the smaller cloud players who are -- still have yet to build out the scale. But people couldn't exactly stretch for all those solutions. And now it looks like -- now they figured out architecturally how they're going to respond to the new cost structures or maybe they had supply -- other supply chain issues that would cause them to -- some of their suppliers to not want to build for them for a while. I think we're through most of that, and I think we're seeing the world starting to turn on."

The fact that we're off the trend this year means we'll get back on the trend in the future. Now how fast does it come back, some of that depends on the architectural nuance that I referred to earlier. Are people truly on to further architectures that they can deploy? Or do they still have parts in the system? And what's going on with their specific applications?

Thanks, C.J. I think we've talked about it quite a bit on the call.

We think that there'll be substantial nearline growth into next year. Now obviously, we -- our job is to turn that into orders as quickly as we possibly can, and we're out pursuing strategic agreements to go do that because these are large investments that these companies are going to have to make. But I do think that calendar year '18 will be better than calendar year '17 was from an exabyte perspective. On the Skylake question, it's kind of interesting because we look back ourselves at some of these Intel transitions and said, ""What does that typically mean for our industry? And when do things latch?"" This one's very different because, I think, the nature of the interfaces and performance and so on are actually pretty exciting for the entire enterprise space. Typically, it doesn't latch very quickly. But typically, it does move to a different value proposition over time, and that's consistent with the mix-up discussions that we had in mission-critical. We believe that some of the lower capacity points will be flushed from the system and will mix up to higher capacity points in mission-critical. As we look towards the future, that market, it's not a big market, but the mix will be high.

Beginning with our operational results for the September quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.6 billion, GAAP gross margins of 28%, net income of $181 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.62. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 29%, net income of $279 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.96. HDD exabyte shipments for the September quarter were a record 70.3 exabytes, up 5% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was also a record 1.9 terabytes per drive, and the average selling price per unit was $64. GAAP operating expenses were $481 million, down 17% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $408 million, down 14% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $237 million, and free cash flow was $113 million. 
At the end of September, Seagate announced our participation in this consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation. We're pleased to be part of the consortium and to help facilitate maintaining Toshiba Memory as a world-leading, independent NAND technology company. Over the course of many years, Seagate's developed a long-term relationship with Toshiba Memory, and we've always been impressed with their consistent leadership in advancing NAND technology. We believe that Bain Capital is dedicated to the long-term success of Toshiba Memory, and this acquisition is in the long-term best interest of our industry and the storage customers worldwide. 
In addition, we expect to enter into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory, and that will provide continuity of raw NAND for our expanding product portfolio. We have developed our NAND storage technology portfolio over the last several years, and today, we have a broad offering of flash-based products that are ready to scale and grow across multiple markets. Our NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory will enable Seagate to continue innovating and providing customers with storage solutions that fit their needs, be it HDDs, SSDs or hybrid solutions. This agreement has the opportunity to increase the potential for meaningful future revenue growth from Seagate's NAND storage portfolio while providing significant value for our storage customers.

For the September quarter, we achieved $2.6 billion in revenue and shipped a record 70.3 exabytes of storage with an average capacity per drive of 1.9 terabytes, also a record. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped 27.2 exabytes with a r",918,"Thanks, Dave. For the September quarter, we achieved $2.6 billion in revenue and shipped a record 70.3 exabytes of storage with an average capacity per drive of 1.9 terabytes, also a record. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped 27.2 exabytes with a record average capacity of 3.9 terabytes per drive. Our average capacity per drive for our nearline products reached over 5.4 terabytes per drive, up 17% over last year's strong ATB demand and up 75% from the September quarter 2 years ago. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we're confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect a diverse and strong market with multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Use cases will cause capacity points to span from 2 to 4 terabytes for certain applications and up to 16 terabytes for other customer needs. At Seagate, we believe we're well poised to help our cloud customers with their stringent and varied requirements. 
Our 10-terabyte helium nearline product was our leading enterprise revenue SKU in the September quarter, and we shipped over 1 million 10-terabyte units, up threefold from the June quarter. We also achieved sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12-terabyte helium nearline product in the September quarter. Customer feedback has been excellent, and we're confident in our competitiveness across our key customer qualification processes. For the December quarter, we're planning for significant sequential volume and revenue growth for our 10-terabyte and our 12-terabyte helium products as the market adoption grows. 
In the edge and consumer verticals, our 1-terabyte per platter, 2.5-inch platform continues to perform well. Using our areal density advantage, our 2-terabyte per platter, 3.5-inch platform continues to ramp for desktop markets, providing a great value for customers needing 2-, 4- and 8-terabyte capacity points. Customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition in these important verticals. Within this, notebook compute revenue was up 37% year-over-year with exabytes up 75% year-over-year. Average capacity per notebook compute drive [indiscernible] year-over-year. 
Our gaming business revenue grew sequentially 13%, and average capacity per drive was up 27% over last year. We continue to be selective in our participation in this market, and we're focused on the highest capacity areas for the gaming customers that are demanding more local mass storage for the rich gaming experiences. 
Our non-HDD revenue, primarily from our cloud systems and silicon group in the September quarter was $242 million, up 30% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% year-over-year. Our operating expenses for the September quarter were $481 million on a GAAP basis and $408 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 14% year-over-year. Total operating expenses were slightly lower than forecast, primarily due to restructuring and other cost-containment measures. We continue to identify areas for cost improvements. And during the September quarter, we divested the majority of our high-performance computing assets, which will result in a cost savings of approximately $20 million a year and impact revenues by approximately $50 million per year in our non-HDD revenue. We remain on track to exit the calendar year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $400 million per quarter.
Capital expenditures were $124 million for the September quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment, supporting the continued ramp of our new HDD products in our portfolio, which utilize new tooling and equipment. For December quarter, we expect capital expenditures to decrease sequentially and remain less than 5% of our total consolidated revenue for FY '18. 
Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $237 million, and free cash flow was $113 million. These results include approximately $46 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges and some inventory staging related to a strong October demand signals. For December quarter, we anticipate cash flow from operations to be at least 2x more than the September quarter due to working capital improvements in our business outlook. 
Our balance sheet remains heavy -- healthy, and we ended the September quarter for -- with $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents with 289 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 3, 2018.
Interest expense for the September quarter was $61 million. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the September quarter, we deployed $166 million to redeem 5 million shares and $22 million towards redeeming our 2018 senior notes.
As Dave Mosley noted, at the end of September, we announced our participation in the consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation. We committed to provide up to $1.25 billion in financing to support the acquisition. Upon closing, we would expect to fund the transaction with existing cash balances and some short-term financing mechanisms. Including the long-term NAND supply agreements we expect to enter with Toshiba Memory, we anticipate this transaction to be accretive to our earnings. 
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the September quarter reflects execution of our business model and profitability improvement objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and focus on aligning our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

The long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies appear intact, as they continue to demonstrate and increase their service offerings and exhibit significant business",580,"Thanks, Dave. The long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies appear intact, as they continue to demonstrate and increase their service offerings and exhibit significant business momentum. 
Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products. Over the last 5 years, we've been the leader in areal density with our SMR and TDMR areal density solutions, and we continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR, technology portfolio, which is expected to be shipping in volume in 2019. 
Over the past year, we have been ramping production of our HAMR evaluation drives, and we have shared samples of current generation shipping product with HAMR technology substituted in these devices. Early customer feedback from more than 6 months ago, using standard qualification processes, demonstrates that the technology will not require any changes for customers to adopt. We believe that HAMR technology opens up a rich design space for high capacity and great value, and we've been communicating that with customers for some months now. 
In terms of future investment in order to launch our HAMR portfolio, the costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model. While we don't have time today, I personally am looking forward to discussing more about HDD areal density and future technology development at our next strategic update that Kate mentioned earlier. 
Turning to our market outlook. With major transformative shifts taking place in the storage marketplace from client/server to mobile cloud, high-capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate. We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment as well as enterprise and consumer spending trends. 
On the heels of the various IT component supply constraints we witnessed in late calendar 2016 and early 2017, we're continuing to monitor outgoing inventory closely. From Seagate's vantage point, our channel inventory positions and inventory for our customers that are visible to us are, in general, lower than last year. Sell-through appears reasonable.
For the December quarter, we anticipate: strong exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem; normal seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs in the consumer market; and sequential growth in our cloud systems and silicon businesses. Almost all of our vertical markets are now engaged in exabyte growth again compared to the first half of the calendar year. 
Given this demand environment, for the December quarter, we expect to achieve: revenues up approximately 3% to 5% sequentially from the September quarter. This is consistent to slightly better than the sequential growth we saw at this time last year; gross margins to expand slightly sequentially and within our 29% to 33% long-term range; non-GAAP operating expenses down sequentially 2% to 3% with further cost-containment measures as we continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of fiscal '18; and cash flow from operations to be up significantly sequentially with improvements in working capital and less restructuring costs. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners for their contributions to our quarter's results. 
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

I think -- if I think about 2016, calendar 2016, we were strong from March through November in all markets geographically. So CSPs were strong, and we saw strength in some of the more nascent cloud spaces. We believe that the various component supply issues that existed and pricing of those components and so on actually caused a little bit of an overbuy and some further disruption in the supply chain, which we've talked about. And so some of the markets, not necessarily all the CSPs, but some of the markets, were impacted in early 2017. And I would say, at this point, all the way through July, we were still seeing that impact. August and September started to turn back on, which resulted in some of the growth that we saw in the quarter. But to your point, it's not back to the level it was before, although it appears to be coming back. What we hear inside of the data centers is that the exabyte growth is still high, so the bit growth is still high. That's irrespective of whether you're talking to large-scale CSPs or some of the smaller cloud players who are -- still have yet to build out the scale. But people couldn't exactly stretch for all those solutions. And now it looks like -- now they figured out architecturally how they're going to respond to the new cost structures or maybe they had supply -- other supply chain issues that would cause them to -- some of their suppliers to not want to build for them for a while. I think we're through most of that, and I think we're seeing the world starting to turn on."

But I do think that calendar year '18 will be better than calendar year '17 was from an exabyte perspective. On the Skylake question, it's kind of interesting because we look back ourselves at some of these Intel transitions and said, ""What does that typically mean for our industry? And when do things latch?"" This one's very different because, I think, the nature of the interfaces and performance and so on are actually pretty exciting for the entire enterprise space. Typically, it doesn't latch very quickly. But typically, it does move to a different value proposition over time, and that's consistent with the mix-up discussions that we had in mission-critical. We believe that some of the lower capacity points will be flushed from the system and will mix up to higher capacity points in mission-critical. As we look towards the future, that market, it's not a big market, but the mix will be high. 
So okay, I would like to thank all of our customers, suppliers, employees, for all their hard work on this quarter and all their partnership. It's been a very good back half of the year coming. We -- in July, when last time we spoke to investors, things were pretty tough with the slow Q4. It's good to see August and September turning on, and we look forward to talking to you on the next call."

Beginning with our operational results for the September quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.6 billion, GAAP gross margins of 28%, net income of $181 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.62. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 29%, net income of $279 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.96. HDD exabyte shipments for the September quarter were a record 70.3 exabytes, up 5% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was also a record 1.9 terabytes per drive, and the average selling price per unit was $64. GAAP operating expenses were $481 million, down 17% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $408 million, down 14% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $237 million, and free cash flow was $113 million. 
At the end of September, Seagate announced our participation in this consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation. We're pleased to be part of the consortium and to help facilitate maintaining Toshiba Memory as a world-leading, independent NAND technology company. Over the course of many years, Seagate's developed a long-term relationship with Toshiba Memory, and we've always been impressed with their consistent leadership in advancing NAND technology. We believe that Bain Capital is dedicated to the long-term success of Toshiba Memory, and this acquisition is in the long-term best interest of our industry and to storage customers worldwide. 
In addition, we expect to enter into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory, and that will provide continuity of raw NAND for our expanding product portfolio. We have developed our NAND storage technology portfolio over the last several years, and today, we have a broad offering of flash-based products that are ready to scale and grow across multiple markets. Our NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory will enable Seagate to continue innovating and providing customers with storage solutions that fit their needs, be they HDDs, SSDs or hybrid solutions. This agreement has the opportunity to increase the potential for meaningful future revenue growth from Seagate's NAND storage portfolio while providing significant value for our storage customers. 
We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. However, we will not be providing further color on the details of the transaction until we're closer to deal closure. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities."

For the September quarter, we achieved $2.6 billion in revenue and shipped a record 70.3 exabytes of storage with an average capacity per drive of 1.9 terabytes, also a record.

For the September quarter, we achieved $2.6 billion in revenue and shipped a record 70.3 exabytes of storage with an average capacity per drive of 1.9 terabytes, also a record. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped 27.2 exabytes with a record average capacity of 3.9 terabytes per drive. Our average capacity per drive for our nearline products reached over 5.4 terabytes per drive, up 17% over last year's strong ATB demand and up 75% from the September quarter 2 years ago. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we're confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect a diverse and strong market with multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Use cases will cause capacity points to span from 2 to 4 terabytes for certain applications and up to 16 terabytes for other customer needs. At Seagate, we believe we're well poised to help our cloud customers with their stringent and varied requirements. 
Our 10-terabyte helium nearline product was our leading enterprise revenue SKU in the September quarter, and we shipped over 1 million 10-terabyte units, up threefold from the June quarter. We also achieved sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12-terabyte helium nearline product in the September quarter. Customer feedback has been excellent, and we're confident in our competitiveness across our key customer qualification processes. For the December quarter, we're planning for significant sequential volume and revenue growth for our 10-terabyte and our 12-terabyte helium products as the market adoption grows. 
In the edge and consumer verticals, our 1-terabyte per platter, 2.5-inch platform continues to perform well. Using our areal density advantage, our 2-terabyte per platter, 3.5-inch platform continues to ramp for desktop markets, providing a great value for customers needing 2-, 4- and 8-terabyte capacity points. Customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition in these important verticals. Within this, notebook compute revenue was up 37% year-over-year with exabytes up 75% year-over-year. Average capacity per notebook compute drive [Audio Gap] year-over-year. 
Our gaming business revenue grew sequentially 13%, and average capacity per drive was up 27% over last year. We continue to be selective in our participation in this market, and we're focused on the highest capacity areas for the gaming customers that are demanding more local mass storage for their rich gaming experiences. 
Our non-HDD revenue, primarily from our cloud systems and silicon group in the September quarter was $242 million, up 30% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% year-over-year. Our operating expenses for the September quarter were $481 million on a GAAP basis and $408 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 14% year-over-year. Total operating expenses were slightly lower than forecast, primarily due to restructuring and other cost-containment measures. We continue to identify areas for cost improvements. And during the September quarter, we divested the majority of our high-performance computing assets, which will result in a cost savings of approximately $20 million a year and impact revenues by approximately $50 million per year in our non-HDD revenue. We remain on track to exit the calendar year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $400 million per quarter.
Capital expenditures were $124 million for the September quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment, supporting the continued ramp of our new HDD products in our portfolio, which utilize new tooling and equipment. For the December quarter, we expect capital expenditures to decrease sequentially and remain less than 5% of our total consolidated revenue for FY '18. 
Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $237 million, and free cash flow was $113 million. These results include approximately $46 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges and some inventory staging related to a strong October demand signals. For the December quarter, we anticipate cash flow from operations to be at least 2x more than the September quarter due to working capital improvements in our business outlook. 
Our balance sheet remains heavy -- healthy, and we ended the September quarter for -- with $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents with 289 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 3, 2018.
Interest expense for the September quarter was $61 million. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the September quarter, we deployed $166 million to redeem 5 million shares and $22 million towards redeeming our 2018 senior notes.
As Dave Mosley noted, at the end of September, we announced our participation in the consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation. We committed to provide up to $1.25 billion in financing to support that acquisition. Upon closing, we would expect to fund the transaction with existing cash balances and some short-term financing mechanisms. Including the long-term NAND supply agreements we expect to enter with Toshiba Memory, we anticipate this transaction to be accretive to our earnings. 
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the September quarter reflects execution of our business model and profitability improvement objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and focus on aligning our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

The long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies appear intact, as they continue to demonstrate and increase their service offerings and exhibit significant business momentum. 
Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products. Over the last 5 years, we've been the leader in areal density with our SMR and TDMR areal density solutions, and we continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR, technology portfolio, which is expected to be shipping in volume in 2019. 
Over the past year, we have been ramping production of our HAMR evaluation drives, and we have shared samples of current generation shipping product with HAMR technology substituted in these devices. Early customer feedback from more than 6 months ago, using standard qualification processes, demonstrates that the technology will not require any changes for customers to adopt. We believe that HAMR technology opens up a rich design space for high capacity and great value, and we've been communicating that with customers for some months now. 
In terms of future investment in order to launch our HAMR portfolio, the costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model. While we don't have time today, I personally am looking forward to discussing more about HDD areal density and future technology development at our next strategic update that Kate mentioned earlier. 
Turning to our market outlook. With major transformative shifts taking place in the storage marketplace from client/server to mobile cloud, high-capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate. We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment as well as enterprise and consumer spending trends. 
On the heels of the various IT component supply constraints we witnessed in late calendar 2016 and early 2017, we're continuing to monitor outgoing inventory closely. From Seagate's vantage point, our channel inventory positions and inventory for our customers that are visible to us are, in general, lower than last year. Sell-through appears reasonable.
For the December quarter, we anticipate: strong exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem; normal seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs in the consumer market; and sequential growth in our cloud systems and silicon businesses. Almost all of our vertical markets are now engaged in exabyte growth again compared to the first half of the calendar year. 
Given this demand environment, for the December quarter, we expect to achieve: revenues up approximately 3% to 5% sequentially from the September quarter. This is consistent to slightly better than the sequential growth we saw at this time last year; gross margins to expand slightly sequentially and within our 29% to 33% long-term range; non-GAAP operating expenses down sequentially 2% to 3% with further cost-containment measures as we continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of fiscal '18; and cash flow from operations to be up significantly sequentially with improvements in working capital and less restructuring costs. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners for their contributions to our quarter's results. 
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

I think -- if I think about 2016, calendar 2016, we were strong from March through November in all markets geographically. So CSPs were strong, and we saw strength in some of the more nascent cloud spaces. We believe that the various component supply issues that existed and pricing of those components and so on actually caused a little bit of an overbuy and some further disruption in the supply chain, which we've talked about. And so some of the markets, not necessarily all the CSPs, but some of the markets, were impacted in early 2017. And I would say, at this point, all the way through July, we were still seeing that impact. August and September started to turn back on, which resulted in some of the growth that we saw in the quarter. But to your point, it's not back to the level it was before, although it appears to be coming back. What we hear inside of the data centers is that the exabyte growth is still high, so the bit growth is still high. That's irrespective of whether you're talking to large-scale CSPs or some of the smaller cloud players who are -- still have yet to build out to scale. But people couldn't exactly stretch for all those solutions. And now it looks like -- now they figured out architecturally how they're going to respond to the new cost structures or maybe they had supply -- other supply chain issues that would cause them to -- some of their suppliers to not want to build for them for a while. I think we're through most of that, and I think we're seeing the world starting to turn on."

We think that there'll be substantial nearline growth in the next year. Obviously, we -- our job is to turn that into orders as quickly as we possibly can, and we're out pursuing strategic agreements to go do that because these are large investments that these companies are going to have to make. But I do think that calendar year '18 will be better than calendar year '17 was from an exabyte perspective. On the Skylake question, it's kind of interesting because we've looked back ourselves at some of these Intel transitions and said, ""What does that typically mean for our industry? And when do things latch?"" This one's very different because, I think, the nature of the interfaces and performance and so on are actually pretty exciting for the entire enterprise space. Typically, it doesn't latch very quickly. But typically, it does move to a different value proposition over time, and that's consistent with the mix-up discussions that we had in mission-critical. We believe that some of the lower capacity points will be flushed from the system and will mix up to higher capacity points in mission-critical. As we look towards the future, that market, it's not a big market, but the mix will be high, so.

Beginning with our operational results for the September quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.6 billion, GAAP gross margins of 28%, net income of $181 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.62. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 29%, net income of $279 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.96. HDD exabyte shipments for the September quarter were a record 70.3 exabytes, up 5% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was also a record 1.9 terabytes per drive, and the average selling price per unit was $64. GAAP operating expenses were $481 million, down 17% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $408 million, down 14% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $237 million, and free cash flow was $113 million. 
At the end of September, Seagate announced our participation in this consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation. We're pleased to be part of the consortium and to help facilitate maintaining Toshiba Memory as a world-leading, independent NAND technology company. Over the course of many years, Seagate's developed a long-term relationship with Toshiba Memory, and we've always been impressed with their consistent leadership in advancing NAND technology. We believe that Bain Capital is dedicated to the long-term success of Toshiba Memory, and this acquisition is in the long-term best interest of our industry and to storage customers worldwide. 
In addition, we expect to enter into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory, and that will provide continuity of raw NAND for our expanding product portfolio. We have developed our NAND storage technology portfolio over the last several years, and today, we have a broad offering of flash-based products that are ready to scale and grow across multiple markets. Our NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory will enable Seagate to continue innovating and providing customers with storage solutions that fit their needs, be they HDDs, SSDs or hybrid solutions. This agreement has the opportunity to increase the potential for meaningful future revenue growth from Seagate's NAND storage portfolio while providing significant value for our storage customers. 
We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. However, we will not be providing further color on the details of the transaction until we're closer to deal closure. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities."

For the September quarter, we achieved $2.6 billion in revenue and shipped a record 70.3 exabytes of storage with an average capacity per drive of 1.9 terabytes, also a record. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped 27.2 exabytes with a record average capacity of 3.9 terabytes per drive. Our average capacity per drive for our nearline products reached over 5.4 terabytes per drive, up 17% over last year's strong ATB demand and up 75% from the September quarter 2 years ago. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we're confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect a diverse and strong market with multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Use cases will cause capacity points to span from 2 to 4 terabytes for certain applications and up to 16 terabytes for other customer needs. At Seagate, we believe we're well poised to help our cloud customers with their stringent and varied requirements. 
Our 10-terabyte helium nearline product was our leading enterprise revenue SKU in the September quarter, and we shipped over 1 million 10-terabyte units, up threefold from the June quarter. We also achieved sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12-terabyte helium nearline product in the September quarter. Customer feedback has been excellent, and we're confident in our competitiveness across our key customer qualification processes. For the December quarter, we're planning for significant sequential volume and revenue growth for our 10-terabyte and our 12-terabyte helium products as the market adoption grows. 
In the edge and consumer verticals, our 1-terabyte per platter, 2.5-inch platform continues to perform well. Using our areal density advantage, our 2-terabyte per platter, 3.5-inch platform continues to ramp for desktop markets, providing a great value for customers needing 2-, 4- and 8-terabyte capacity points. Customer feedback indicates we are well ahead of the competition in these important verticals. Within this, notebook compute revenue was up 37% year-over-year with exabytes up 75% year-over-year. Average capacity per notebook compute drive [Audio Gap] year-over-year. 
Our gaming business revenue grew sequentially 13%, and average capacity per drive was up 27% over last year. We continue to be selective in our participation in this market, and we're focused on the highest capacity areas for the gaming customers that are demanding more local mass storage for their rich gaming experiences. 
Our non-HDD revenue, primarily from our cloud systems and silicon group in the September quarter was $242 million, up 30% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% year-over-year. Our operating expenses for the September quarter were $481 million on a GAAP basis and $408 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 14% year-over-year. Total operating expenses were slightly lower than forecast, primarily due to restructuring and other cost-containment measures. We continue to identify areas for cost improvements. And during the September quarter, we divested the majority of our high-performance computing assets, which will result in a cost savings of approximately $20 million a year and impact revenues by approximately $50 million per year in our non-HDD revenue. We remain on track to exit the calendar year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $400 million per quarter.
Capital expenditures were $124 million for the September quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment, supporting the continued ramp of our new HDD products in our portfolio, which utilize new tooling and equipment. For the December quarter, we expect capital expenditures to decrease sequentially and remain less than 5% of our total consolidated revenue for FY '18. 
Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $237 million, and free cash flow was $113 million. These results include approximately $46 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges and some inventory staging related to a strong October demand signals. For the December quarter, we anticipate cash flow from operations to be at least 2x more than the September quarter due to working capital improvements in our business outlook. 
Our balance sheet remains heavy -- healthy, and we ended the September quarter for -- with $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents with 289 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 3, 2018.
Interest expense for the September quarter was $61 million. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the September quarter, we deployed $166 million to redeem 5 million shares and $22 million towards redeeming our 2018 senior notes.
As Dave Mosley noted, at the end of September, we announced our participation in the consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity that has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation to acquire Toshiba Memory Corporation. We committed to provide up to $1.25 billion in financing to support that acquisition. Upon closing, we would expect to fund the transaction with existing cash balances and some short-term financing mechanisms. Including the long-term NAND supply agreements we expect to enter with Toshiba Memory, we anticipate this transaction to be accretive to our earnings. 
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the September quarter reflects execution of our business model and profitability improvement objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and focus on aligning our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

The long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies appear intact, as they continue to demonstrate and increase their service offerings and exhibit significant business momentum. 
Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products. Over the last 5 years, we've been the leader in areal density with our SMR and TDMR areal density solutions, and we continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR, technology portfolio, which is expected to be shipping in volume in 2019. 
Over the past year, we have been ramping production of our HAMR evaluation drives, and we have shared samples of current generation shipping product with HAMR technology substituted in these devices. Early customer feedback from more than 6 months ago, using standard qualification processes, demonstrates that the technology will not require any changes for customers to adopt. We believe that HAMR technology opens up a rich design space for high capacity and great value, and we've been communicating that with customers for some months now. 
In terms of future investment in order to launch our HAMR portfolio, the costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model. While we don't have time today, I personally am looking forward to discussing more about HDD areal density and future technology development at our next strategic update that Kate mentioned earlier. 
Turning to our market outlook. With major transformative shifts taking place in the storage marketplace from client/server to mobile cloud, high-capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate. We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment as well as enterprise and consumer spending trends. 
On the heels of the various IT component supply constraints we witnessed in late calendar 2016 and early 2017, we're continuing to monitor outgoing inventory closely. From Seagate's vantage point, our channel inventory positions and inventory for our customers that are visible to us are, in general, lower than last year. Sell-through appears reasonable.
For the December quarter, we anticipate: strong exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem; normal seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs in the consumer market; and sequential growth in our cloud systems and silicon businesses. Almost all of our vertical markets are now engaged in exabyte growth again compared to the first half of the calendar year. 
Given this demand environment, for the December quarter, we expect to achieve: revenues up approximately 3% to 5% sequentially from the September quarter. This is consistent to slightly better than the sequential growth we saw at this time last year; gross margins to expand slightly sequentially and within our 29% to 33% long-term range; non-GAAP operating expenses down sequentially 2% to 3% with further cost-containment measures as we continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of fiscal '18; and cash flow from operations to be up significantly sequentially with improvements in working capital and less restructuring costs. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners for their contributions to our quarter's results. 
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

I think -- if I think about 2016, calendar 2016, we were strong from March through November in all markets geographically. So CSPs were strong, and we saw strength in some of the more nascent cloud spaces. We believe that the various component supply issues that existed and pricing of those components and so on actually caused a little bit of an overbuy and some further disruption in the supply chain, which we've talked about. And so some of the markets, not necessarily all the CSPs, but some of the markets, were impacted in early 2017. And I would say, at this point, all the way through July, we were still seeing that impact. August and September started to turn back on, which resulted in some of the growth that we saw in the quarter. But to your point, it's not back to the level it was before, although it appears to be coming back. What we hear inside of the data centers is that the exabyte growth is still high, so the bit growth is still high. That's irrespective of whether you're talking to large-scale CSPs or some of the smaller cloud players who are -- still have yet to build out to scale. But people couldn't exactly stretch for all those solutions. And now it looks like -- now they figured out architecturally how they're going to respond to the new cost structures or maybe they had supply -- other supply chain issues that would cause them to -- some of their suppliers to not want to build for them for a while. I think we're through most of that, and I think we're seeing the world starting to turn on."

The exabyte growth, as both the previous people have asked the question about, has been rather muted this last year, if you look at it in aggregate. And some of that's driven by the cloud, some of it's driven by other dynamics. Long term, we think data's growing at 30% to 35%. We've been talking about that fairly openly. The fact that we're off the trend this year means we'll get back on the trend in the future. Now how fast does it come back, some of that depends on the architectural nuance that I referred to earlier. Are people truly on to further architectures that they can deploy? Or do they still have parts in the system? And what's going on with their specific applications? I actually think we're going into fairly healthy period of the growth that gets us back on to the trend line, and that's what's -- something we're trying to respond to. We can do it with higher and higher capacity drives because we have areal density to solution it."

Mission-critical is actually a very rich, diverse space. There's not -- it's not a one-size-fits-all solution, and we do see mix-up to 1.2 and 2.4-terabyte type drives.

Thanks, C.J. I think we've talked about it quite a bit on the call. With the issues that there were earlier, that's why the year-over-year compare is pretty tough on the nearline space with now higher capacity drives and ramping in the market and some of the markets, especially geographically, turning on, some of the smaller cloud providers now seeing the architectures that they want to go invest in. We think that there'll be substantial nearline growth in the next year. Obviously, we -- our job is to turn that into orders as quickly as we possibly can, and we're out pursuing strategic agreements to go do that because these are large investments that these companies are going to have to make. But I do think that calendar year '18 will be better than calendar year '17 was from an exabyte perspective. On the Skylake question, it's kind of interesting because we've looked back ourselves at some of these Intel transitions and said, ""What does that typically mean for our industry? And when do things latch?"" This one's very different because, I think, the nature of the interfaces and performance and so on are actually pretty exciting for the entire enterprise space. Typically, it doesn't latch very quickly. But typically, it does move to a different value proposition over time, and that's consistent with the mix-up discussions that we had in mission-critical. We believe that some of the lower capacity points will be flushed from the system and will mix up to higher capacity points in mission-critical. As we look towards the future, that market, it's not a big market, but the mix will be high, so.
