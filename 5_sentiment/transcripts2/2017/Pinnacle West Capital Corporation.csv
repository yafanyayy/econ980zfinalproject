Pinnacle West concluded a productive 2016, with earnings in line with our expectations. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another record year. Our employees set a new company-wide safety record,",1253,"Thanks, Ted, and thank you all for joining us today. Pinnacle West concluded a productive 2016, with earnings in line with our expectations. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another record year. Our employees set a new company-wide safety record, and we continue making progress on our regulatory initiatives. Our capital execution program is on track for several noteworthy projects, recently placed into service. And our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results in a moment. My comments will focus on our 2016 highlights and the year ahead.
Our fleet performed very well in 2016, highlighted by Palo Verde's 25th consecutive year as the nation's largest power producer. Total production reached 32.2 billion kilowatt-hours of carbon-free electricity. In fact, the refueling outage for Unit 3 set a station record for the shortest outage ever and set a nuclear industry record for radiological safety. 
Before I continue, I want to recognize Randy Ellington for his significant positive impact on our company as Chief Nuclear Officer. Randy will be retiring from APS in March, and I want to thank him for the great service to our company and the nuclear industry as a whole during his decade of leadership here in Arizona. Because of his skill and experience as well as his ability to develop strong leaders and sustainable processes, he left a lasting legacy of excellence in Palo Verde.
In 2016, APS also achieved its safest year, with the fewest recordable injuries in our history. I consider the safety of our employees a top priority, and I also believe safety metrics are good indicators of management's ability to lead an organization. These aren't just statistics but the result of a continued commitment from all our employees and management team to drive operational excellence.
Turning to the regulatory front. We've had a busy few months with the ongoing progress of our rate review and the conclusion of the value and cost of distributed generation proceeding. I'll provide an update on these important items in a moment, but first I want to thank Arizona Corporation Commissioner Bob Stump, whose term ended in early January of this year. We appreciate his commitment to the state over his many years of public service and for driving the dialogue on several complex regulatory issues. Commissioner Bob Burns, Andrew Tobin and Dunn were sworn in January 3, to 4-year terms. Commissioner Got Phrase was also elected by his fellow commissioners as Chairman, succeeding Commissioner Doug Little, who led the commission through a challenging period. 
I'll now provide an update on 2 important regulatory dockets. The value and cost of distributed generation decision and our 2016 rate review filing. On December 20, the Corporation Commission completed its proceeding on the value on cost of the D. The commission approved the recommendation to replace the current net leader in tariff with a more formula-driven approach. The formula will use inputs from utility scale solar power costs and eventually transition to an avoided cost methodology. 
In addition, the AFUDC made the following determinations: first, banking of energy produced by Solar Systems has been eliminated; second, customers with E.G. Solar may be considered a separate class of customers for ratemaking purposes; and third, VG solar customers who have interconnected systems prior to the decision in APS's pending rate review will be bothered for a period of 20 years. This decision marks an important milestone in our commitment to modernize customer rates while minimizing subsidies among customer classes. Although other jurisdictions have attempted to make similar changes, this was among the first fully litigated cases in the country and was founded on actual evidence sworn testimony and a judge's order. 
Moreover, the decision was embraced by a wide variety of stakeholders, including local solar installers who share our vision for creating a sustainable energy future for Arizona. I know APS's rate review is top of mind for many of you, and we continue making good progress with this proceeding. 
Since our last call, the ACC staff and intervenors filed testimony in response to our initial proposal. This provided the foundation for us to engage in meaningful settlement negotiations in January and earlier this month. We continue working with parties toward a constructive settlement proposal that will be filed no later than March 17. 
Last month, the administrative law judge revised a procedural schedule for this case in order to provide staff with sufficient time to incorporate the recent value of cost -- excuse me, value and cost of VG decision. As a result, the time clock was extended by 33 days, and the new hearing date is April 24. 
2017 marks a period of unprecedented capital investment for our company. As we manage more than $1.3 billion in projects and plan to spend more than $3.4 billion in capital over the next 3 years. Our focus continues to be modernizing the distribution grid, investing in flexible generation and advancing our customer experience. We're well positioned to be a leader in grid automation and technology integration. The APS Solar Power Program recently won the award for Renewable Integration Project of the Year at the Annual Distributech Conference. Through this program, our employees are starting the application of smart inverters to integrate rooftop solar and battery storage on the distribution grid. In addition, we recently placed into service an industry-leading advanced distribution management system. Next month, we'll launch a new state-of-the-art customer information system. Both systems are innovative, forward thinking and bring greater value to our customers while preparing for the future. These investments drive operating efficiencies through leveraging technology on the grid, with results in continued cost management and improved reliability for our customers. 
We also remain committed to upgrading our generation portfolio with more flexible gas generation as the Ocotillo Modernization Project hits full stride this year. 
Finally, our traditional generation and transmission business continues to drive meaningful investments as we further expand our high-voltage transmission system and install environmental control technology at the Four Corners power plant. Recently, the owners of Navajo Generating Station announced the decision to repower the plant by 2019, in which APS has a 350-megawatt stake. This generation shortfall is in addition to the existing shortfall of 3,500 megawatts by 2022. As outlined in our 2017 preliminary Integrated Resource Plan, which I described for you last quarter. Although a portion of this research gap will be filled by the Ocotillo project and our recent 565-megawatt power purchase agreement, the remainder will be procured through additional market opportunities, customer conservation and distributed generation. 
In addition to our changing energy mix, we've continued to embrace the growing Western marketplace for wholesale power. In October, we joined the Western Energy Imbalance Market, which produced $6 million in savings for our customers in the fourth quarter of 2016 alone. We expect continued savings throughout 2017, which reduces cost for customers and improves the competitiveness of our retail rates.
In summary, we delivered on our commitments in 2016 and are well positioned for 2017 in the long term. We have a clear plan and a strong leadership team in place to deliver on the plan. The priorities we have for the year ahead, in particular order: Completing the rate review and executing on our capital investments, laying the foundation for APS to be a sustainable leader in an evolving industry. We remain focused on creating value through our core business while delivering on our financial and operational commitments. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a good year and ended on a strong note. Be",1212,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a good year and ended on a strong note. 
Before I review the details of our 2016 results, let me touch on a couple of highlights for the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we earned $0.47 per share compared to $0.37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Slide 4 outlines the variances which drove the increase in our quarterly earnings per share. Gross margin was flat, including lower sales, which were offset by higher LFCR revenues. Lower operations and maintenance expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 improved earnings by $0.06 per share, largely due to more employee benefit cost driven by the adoption of a new stock compensation accounting guidance.
Now turning to Slide 5. Let's review some of the details of our full year results. 2016 results were in line with our expectations, earning $3.95 per share compared to $3.92 per share in 2015, translating to an earned consolidated ROE of 9.5 on a [indiscernible] basis. Gross margin was a positive driver for the year, contributing $0.33 per share, including favorable year-over-year weather. Sales in 2016 compared to 2015 added $0.05 to gross margin. Weather normalized to retail kilowatt-hour sales after the effects of the efficiency program and distributed generation were flat year-over-year. But similar to the pattern we saw throughout 2016, the usage trends related pricing by customer class were mixed and generated a positive gross margin effect. Transmission and LFCR revenues also continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.17 per share collectively.
Looking next at operating expenses. As expected, higher operation to maintenance expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was a primary offset to ongoing results, increasing earnings by $0.30 per share. With the major planned outages at Four Corners Units 4 and 5 serving as the largest headwinds. Power transmission, distribution and customer service costs and higher employee benefit costs also contributed to the year-over-year increase in O&M. Power depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 versus 2015 reduced earnings by $0.03 per share, including higher depreciation due to additional plant service.
Interest expense net of AFUDC was a $0.02 per share benefit to the earnings in 2016 compared to 2015. The net reduction included a higher interest charges resulting from higher debt balances, which were more than offset by higher construction work in progress benefiting AFUDC. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude amounts related to our renewable energy and demand-side management programs. Also note that the gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues and expense related to the Palo Verde Unit 2 decommissioning that covered dresses to benefit charge. The drivers I discussed exclude these items, as there was no net impact on full year results.
As you know, Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the next trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. In 2016, the Metro Phoenix region continued to have job growth above the national average. For the full year, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.7% compared to 1.7% for the entire United States. This above-average job growth is seen in virtually every major industry sector, although the most significant performance gains are seen in the construction and financial services sector. This solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the metro state areas for commercial and residential real estate markets. 
As seen on the upper panel of Slide 6, the net absorption of vacant office and retail space has been growing steadily since 2010. Vacancy rates in both markets have fallen to levels last seen in 2008 or earlier and almost 3 [ph] million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect the continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development.
Metro Phoenix has also grown in the real estate market. As you can see on the lower panels on Slide 6, housing construction in 2016 was [indiscernible] level in 2007. This kind of suspected to continue in 2017 as housing permits are expected to increase by about 7,000, driven largely by single-family permits. Several factors are driving this increase. Vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to prerecession levels. Record-level apartment vacancies and absorption of available single-family homes, which providing meaningful support on home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to expand over the next couple of years. 
Reflecting the steady improvement and economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.4% in 2016. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appears to be in place.
In closing, I will review our financial outlook and financing plan. As previously indicated, we will not be hedging 2017 earnings per share guidance at this time, but we'll continue to evaluate the appropriate time to do so as our rate case progresses. In the meantime, to assist with your estimate, a list of key drivers that may affect 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix to today's slides. 
One item worth noting, we expect planned outage spend in 2017 to be comparable to 2016 in part driven by preparation LFCR [ph] from Four Corners. In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate APS's spend to average around $1.1 billion annually from 2017 to 2019, which we primarily to internally generated cash flow. We continue to expect our rate base to grow at an average annual rate of 6% to 7% through 2019.
Turning to 2017 financing. We expect to issue up to $850 billion of long-term debt, including the refinancing of Pinnacle $125 million term loan. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continues to remain very strong.
[indiscernible]. Our sport of status remained steady at 88% as of year-end 2016. The continued implementation of our liability-driven investment strategy has helped keep cost down. There is a slide in the appendix with additional details on our hedged outlook.
Lastly, I'll share a few thoughts on proposed tax reform. We are actively assessing tax reform scenarios and are working closely with our peers. Overall, we've reviewed the proposed changes are beneficial to customers with the potential to release some rate pressure. We generally do the potential company impact as mild, especially given Pinnacle's minimal appearance for debt but with so much uncertainty at this point just to speculate with any degree of certainty. So we will continue to monitor discussions closely as they develop.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Pinnacle West concluded a productive 2016, with earnings in line with our expectations. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another record year. Our employees set a new company-wide safety record,",1257,"Thanks, Ted, and thank you all for joining us today. Pinnacle West concluded a productive 2016, with earnings in line with our expectations. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another record year. Our employees set a new company-wide safety record, and we continue making progress on our regulatory initiatives. Our capital execution program is on track with several noteworthy projects recently placed into service, and our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results in a moment. My comments will focus on our 2016 highlights and the year ahead.
Our fleet performed very well in 2016, highlighted by Palo Verde's 25th consecutive year as the nation's largest power producer. Total production reached 32.2 billion kilowatt-hours of carbon-free electricity. In fact, the fall refueling outage for Unit 3 set a station record for the shortest outage ever and set a nuclear industry record for radiological safety.
Before I continue, I want to recognize Randy Edington for his significant positive impact on our company as Chief Nuclear Officer. Randy will be retiring from APS in March, and I want to thank him for the great service to our company and the nuclear industry as a whole during his decade of leadership here in Arizona. Because of his skill and experience as well as his ability to develop strong leaders and sustainable processes, he has left a lasting legacy of excellence at Palo Verde.
In 2016, APS also achieved its safest year with the fewest OSHA recordable injuries in our history. I consider the safety of our employees a top priority, and I also believe safety metrics are good indicators of management's ability to lead an organization. These just aren't statistics, but the result of a continued commitment from all our employees and management team to drive operational excellence.
Turning to the regulatory front. We've had a busy few months with the ongoing progress of our rate review and the conclusion of the value and cost of distributed generation proceeding. I'll provide an update on these important items in a moment, but first, I want to thank Arizona Corporation Commissioner Bob Stump, whose term ended in early January of this year. We appreciate his commitment to the state over his many years of public service and for driving the dialogue on several complex regulatory issues. Commissioner Bob Burns, Andy Tobin and Boyd Dunn were sworn in on January 3 to 4-year terms. Commissioner Tom Forese was also selected by his fellow commissioners as Chairman succeeding Commissioner Doug Little, who led the commission through a challenging period.
I'll now provide an update on 2 important regulatory dockets: the value and cost of distributed generation decision; and our 2016 rate review filing. On December 20, the Corporation Commission completed its proceeding on the value and cost of DG. The commission approved the recommendation to replace the current net metering tariff with a more formula-driven approach. The formula will use inputs from utility-scale solar power costs and eventually transition to an avoided cost methodology. 
In addition, the ACC made the following determinations: first, banking of energy produced by DG solar systems has been eliminated; second, customers with DG solar may be considered a separate class of customers for ratemaking purposes; and third, DG solar customers who have interconnected systems prior to the decision on APS's pending rate review will be grandfathered for a period of 20 years. This decision marks an important milestone in our commitment to modernize customer rates while minimizing subsidies among customer classes. Although other jurisdictions have attempted to make similar changes, this was among the first fully litigated cases in the country and was founded on actual evidence, sworn testimony and a judge's order.
Moreover, the decision was embraced by a wide variety of stakeholders, including local solar installers who share our vision for creating a sustainable energy future for Arizona. I know APS's rate review is top of mind for many of you, and we continue making good progress with this proceeding.
Since our last call, the ACC staff and intervenors filed a testimony in response to our initial proposal. This provided a foundation for us to engage in meaningful settlement negotiations in January and earlier this month. We continue working with parties toward a constructive settlement proposal to be filed no later than March 17.
Last month, the administrative law judge revised the procedural schedule for this case in order to provide staff with sufficient time to incorporate the recent value of cost -- excuse me, value and cost of DG decision. As a result, the time clock was extended by 33 days, and the new hearing date is April 24.
2017 marks a period of unprecedented capital investments for our company as we manage more than $1.3 billion in projects and plan to spend more than $3.4 billion in capital over the next 3 years. Our focus continues to be modernizing the distribution grid, investing in flexible generation and advancing our customer experience. We're well positioned to be a leader in grid automation and technology integration. 
The APS Solar Partner Program recently won the award for Renewable Integration Project of the Year at the annual DistribuTECH conference. Through this program, our employees are studying the application of smart inverters to integrate rooftop solar and battery storage on the distribution grid. 
In addition, we recently placed into service an industry-leading advanced distribution management system. Next month, we'll launch a new state-of-the-art customer information system. Both systems are innovative, forward thinking and bring greater value to our customers while preparing for the future. These investments drive operating efficiencies through leveraging technology on the grid, which result in continued cost management and improved reliability for our customers. We also remain committed to upgrading our generation portfolio with more flexible gas generation as the Ocotillo Modernization Project hits full stride this year.
Finally, our traditional generation and transmission business continues to drive meaningful investments as we further expand our high-voltage transmission system and install environmental control technology at the Four Corners Power Plant. 
Recently, the owners of Navajo Generating Station announced the decision to repower the plant by 2019, in which APS has a 350-megawatt stake. This generation shortfall is in addition to the existing shortfall of 3,500 megawatts by 2022, as outlined in our 2017 preliminary Integrated Resource Plan, which I described for you last quarter. Although a portion of this resource gap will be filled by the Ocotillo project and our recent 565-megawatt power purchase agreement, the remainder will be procured through additional market opportunities, customer conservation and distributed generation.
In addition to our changing energy mix, we continue to embrace the growing Western marketplace for wholesale power. In October, we joined the Western Energy Imbalance Market, which produced $6 million in savings for our customers in the fourth quarter of 2016 alone. We expect continued savings throughout 2017, which reduces cost for customers and improves the competitiveness of our retail rates.
In summary, we delivered on our commitments in 2016 and are well positioned for 2017 in the long term. We have a clear plan and a strong leadership team in place to deliver on the plan. The priorities we have for the year ahead, in particular, are completing the rate review and executing on our capital investments and laying the foundation for APS to be a sustainable leader in an evolving industry. We remain focused on creating value through our core business while delivering on our financial and operational commitments.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a good year and ended on a strong note.Bef",1218,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a good year and ended on a strong note.
Before I review the details of our 2016 results, let me touch on a couple of highlights from the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we earned $0.47 per share compared to $0.37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Slide 4 outlines the variances which drove the increase in our quarterly earnings per share. Gross margin was flat, including lower sales, which were offset by higher LFCR revenues. Lower operations and maintenance expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 improved earnings by $0.06 per share, largely due to lower employee benefit costs driven by the adoption of a new stock compensation accounting guidance.
Now turning to Slide 5. Let's review some of the details of our full year results. 2016 results were in line with our expectations, earning $3.95 per share compared to $3.92 per share in 2015, translating to an earned consolidated ROE of 9.5% on a weather-normalized basis. 
Gross margin was a positive driver for the year, contributing $0.33 per share, including favorable year-over-year weather. Sales in 2016 compared to 2015 added $0.05 to gross margin. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt-hour sales after the effects from energy efficiency program and distributed generation were flat year-over-year. But similar to the pattern we saw throughout 2016, the usage trends and related pricing by customer class were mixed and generated a positive gross margin effect. Transmission and LFCR revenues also continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.17 per share collectively.
Looking next at operating expenses. As expected, higher operations and maintenance expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was a primary offset to ongoing results, increasing earnings by $0.30 per share, with the major planned outages at Four Corners Units 4 and 5 serving as the largest headwinds. Power transmission, distribution and customer service costs and higher employee benefit costs also contributed to the year-over-year increase in O&M. Power depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 versus 2015 reduced earnings by $0.03 per share, including higher depreciation due to additional plant in service.
Interest expense net of AFUDC was a $0.02 per share benefit to the earnings in 2016 compared to 2015. The net reduction included higher interest charges resulting from higher debt balances, which were more than offset by higher construction work in progress benefiting AFUDC. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude amounts related to our renewable energy and demand side management programs. Also note that the gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues and expense related to the Palo Verde Unit 2 decommissioning recovered from a system benefits charge. The drivers I discussed exclude these items as there was no net impact on full year results.
As you know, Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the next trends we are seeing in our local economy and, in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. In 2016, the Metro Phoenix region continued to have job growth above the national average. For the full year, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.7% compared to 1.7% for the entire United States. This above-average job growth is seen in virtually every major industry sector, although the most significant performance gains are seen in the construction and financial services sectors. This solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets.
As seen on the upper panel of Slide 6, the net absorption of vacant office and retail space has been growing steadily since 2010. Vacancy rates in both markets have fallen to levels last seen in 2008 or earlier, and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect the continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development.
Metro Phoenix has also growth in the real estate market. As you can see on the lower panels of Slide 6, housing construction in 2016 was at its highest level in 2007. This trend is expected to continue in 2017 as housing permits are expected to increase by about 7,000, driven largely by single-family permits. 
Several factors are driving this increase. Vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to pre-recession levels. Record-level apartment vacancies and absorption of available single-family homes is providing meaningful support on home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to expand over the next couple of years.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.4% in 2016. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appears to be in place.
In closing, I will review our financial outlook and financing plan. As previously indicated, we will not be issuing 2017 earnings per share guidance at this time, but we'll continue to evaluate the appropriate time to do so as our rate case progresses. In the meantime, to assist with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix to today's slides.
One item worth noting, we expect planned outage spend in 2017 to be comparable to 2016, in part driven by preparation for the SCR's installation at Four Corners. In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate APS's spend to average around $1.1 billion annually from 2017 to 2019, which we primarily funded through internally generated cash flow. We continue to expect our rate base to grow at an average annual rate of 6% to 7% through 2019.
Turning to 2017 financing. We expect to issue up to $850 million of long-term debt, including the refinance of Pinnacle's $125 million term loan. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continues to remain very strong.
A quick note on pension. Our funded status remained steady at 88% as of year-end 2016. The continued implementation of our liability-driven investment strategy has helped keep costs down. There is a slide in the appendix with additional details on our pension outlook.
Lastly, I'll share a few thoughts on proposed tax reform. We are actively assessing tax reform scenarios and are working closely with our EEI peers. Overall, we've reviewed the proposed changes as beneficial to customers with the potential to release some rate pressure. We generally view the potential company impact as mild, especially given Pinnacle's minimal parent-level debt. But with so much uncertainty at this point, it's difficult to speculate with any degree of certainty. So we'll continue to monitor discussions closely as they develop.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

A lot couple owners have made it clear that you're not going to operate beyond 2019. In the meantime, Department of Interior and our ACC as well as others had called all the parties together and are looking for some sort of resolution post 2019 in order to continue to operate the facility. The economics of the facility, as it stands today, would not warrant continued operation without some significant changes. So that's an ongoing issue still to be resolved. As far as the impact of the generation, we will update our RFP as we go forward. But the current expectation is we have [indiscernible] leased 2019 potentially longer, and we'll put it into our future plans and what we do from an RFP or some more other position with regards to another generation decision."

Pinnacle West concluded a productive 2016, with earnings in line with our expectations. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another record year. Our employees set a new company-wide safety record,",1256,"Thanks, Ted, and thank you all for joining us today. Pinnacle West concluded a productive 2016, with earnings in line with our expectations. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another record year. Our employees set a new company-wide safety record, and we continue making progress on our regulatory initiatives. Our capital execution program is on track, with several noteworthy projects recently placed into service, and our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results in a moment. My comments will focus on our 2016 highlights and the year ahead.
Our fleet performed very well in 2016, highlighted by Palo Verde's 25th consecutive year as the nation's largest power producer. Total production reached 32.2 billion kilowatt-hours of carbon-free electricity. In fact, the fall refueling outage for Unit 3 set a station record for the shortest outage ever and set a nuclear industry record for radiological safety.
Before I continue, I want to recognize Randy Edington for his significant positive impact on our company as Chief Nuclear Officer. Randy will be retiring from APS in March, and I want to thank him for the great service to our company and the nuclear industry as a whole during his decade of leadership here in Arizona. Because of his skill and experience as well as his ability to develop strong leaders and sustainable processes, he has left a lasting legacy of excellence at Palo Verde.
In 2016, APS also achieved its safest year with the fewest OSHA recordable injuries in our history. I consider the safety of our employees a top priority, and I also believe safety metrics are good indicators of management's ability to lead an organization. These just aren't statistics, but the result of a continued commitment from all our employees and management team to drive operational excellence.
Turning to the regulatory front. We've had a busy few months, with the ongoing progress of our rate review and the conclusion of the value and cost of distributed generation proceeding. I'll provide an update on these important items in a moment, but first, I want to thank Arizona Corporation Commissioner Bob Stump, whose term ended in early January of this year. We appreciate his commitment to the state over his many years of public service and for driving the dialogue on several complex regulatory issues. Commissioner Bob Burns, Andy Tobin and Boyd Dunn were sworn in on January 3 to 4-year terms. Commissioner Tom Forese was also selected by his fellow commissioners as Chairman, succeeding Commissioner Doug Little, who led the commission through a challenging period.
I'll now provide an update on 2 important regulatory dockets: the value and cost of distributed generation decision; and our 2016 rate review filing. On December 20, the Corporation Commission completed its proceeding on the value and cost of DG. The commission approved the recommendation to replace the current net metering tariff with a more formula-driven approach. The formula will use inputs from utility-scale solar power costs and eventually transition to an avoided cost methodology. 
In addition, the ACC made the following determinations: first, banking of energy produced by DG solar systems has been eliminated; second, customers with DG solar may be considered a separate class of customers for rate-making purposes; and third, DG solar customers who have interconnected systems prior to the decision on APS's pending rate review will be grandfathered for a period of 20 years. This decision marks an important milestone in our commitment to modernize customer rates while minimizing subsidies among customer classes. Although other jurisdictions have attempted to make similar changes, this was among the first fully litigated cases in the country and was founded on actual evidence, sworn testimony and a judge's order.
Moreover, the decision was embraced by a wide variety of stakeholders, including local solar installers who share our vision for creating a sustainable energy future for Arizona. I know APS's rate review is top of mind for many of you, and we continue making good progress with this proceeding.
Since our last call, the ACC staff and intervenors filed a testimony in response to our initial proposal. This provided a foundation for us to engage in meaningful settlement negotiations in January and earlier this month. We continue working with parties toward a constructive settlement proposal to be filed no later than March 17.
Last month, the administrative law judge revised the procedural schedule for this case in order to provide staff with sufficient time to incorporate the recent value of cost -- excuse me, value and cost of DG decision. As a result, the time clock was extended by 33 days, and the new hearing date is April 24.
2017 marks a period of unprecedented capital investment for our company. As we manage more than $1.3 billion in projects and plan to spend more than $3.4 billion in capital over the next 3 years, our focus continues to be modernizing the distribution grid, investing in flexible generation and advancing our customer experience. We're well positioned to be a leader in grid automation and technology integration. 
The APS Solar Partner Program recently won the award for Renewable Integration Project of the Year at the annual DistribuTECH conference. Through this program, our employees are studying the application of smart inverters to integrate rooftop solar and battery storage on the distribution grid. 
In addition, we recently placed into service an industry-leading advanced distribution management system. Next month, we'll launch a new state-of-the-art customer information system. Both systems are innovative, forward thinking and bring greater value to our customers while preparing for the future. These investments drive operating efficiencies through leveraging technology on the grid, which resulted in continued cost management and improved reliability for our customers. We also remain committed to upgrading our generation portfolio with more flexible gas generation as the Ocotillo Modernization Project hits full stride this year.
Finally, our traditional generation and transmission business continues to drive meaningful investments as we further expand our high-voltage transmission system and install environmental control technology at the Four Corners Power Plant. 
Recently, the owners of Navajo Generating Station announced the decision to repower the plant by 2019, in which APS has a 350-megawatt stake. This generation shortfall is in addition to the existing shortfall of 3,500 megawatts by 2022, as outlined in our 2017 preliminary Integrated Resource Plan, which I described for you last quarter. Although a portion of this resource gap will be filled by the Ocotillo project and our recent 565-megawatt power purchase agreement, the remainder will be procured through additional market opportunities, customer conservation and distributed generation.
In addition to our changing energy mix, we continue to embrace the growing Western marketplace for wholesale power. In October, we joined the Western Energy Imbalance Market, which produced $6 million in savings for our customers in the fourth quarter of 2016 alone. We expect continued savings throughout 2017, which reduces cost for customers and improves the competitiveness of our retail rates.
In summary, we delivered on our commitments in 2016 and are well positioned for 2017 in the long term. We have a clear plan and a strong leadership team in place to deliver on the plan. The priorities we have for the year ahead, in particular, completing the rate review and executing on our capital investments, are laying the foundation for APS to be a sustainable leader in an evolving industry. We remain focused on creating value through our core business while delivering on our financial and operational commitments.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a good year and ended on a strong note.Bef",1218,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a good year and ended on a strong note.
Before I review the details of our 2016 results, let me touch on a couple of highlights from the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we earned $0.47 per share compared to $0.37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Slide 4 outlines the variances which drove the increase in our quarterly earnings per share. Gross margin was flat, including lower sales, which were offset by higher LFCR revenues. Lower operations and maintenance expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 improved earnings by $0.06 per share, largely due to lower employee benefit costs driven by the adoption of the new stock compensation accounting guidance.
Now turning to Slide 5. Let's review some of the details of our full year results. 2016 results were in line with our expectations, earning $3.95 per share compared to $3.92 per share in 2015, translating to an earned consolidated ROE of 9.5% on a weather-normalized basis. 
Gross margin was a positive driver for the year, contributing $0.33 per share, including favorable year-over-year weather. Sales in 2016 compared to 2015 added $0.05 to gross margin. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt-hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency program and distributed generation were flat year-over-year. But similar to the pattern we saw throughout 2016, the usage trends and related pricing by customer class were mixed and generated a positive gross margin effect. Transmission and LFCR revenues also continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin, as designed, contributing $0.17 per share collectively.
Looking next at operating expenses. As expected, higher operations and maintenance expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was a primary offset to ongoing results, increasing earnings by $0.30 per share, with the major planned outages at Four Corners Units 4 and 5 serving as the largest headwinds. Power transmission, distribution and customer service costs and higher employee benefit costs also contributed to the year-over-year increase in O&M. Power depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 versus 2015 reduced earnings by $0.03 per share, including higher depreciation due to additional plant in service.
Interest expense net of AFUDC was a $0.02 per share benefit to the earnings in 2016 compared to 2015. The net reduction included higher interest charges resulting from higher debt balances, which were more than offset by higher construction work in progress benefiting AFUDC. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude amounts related to our renewable energy and demand side management programs. Also note that the gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues and expense related to the Palo Verde Unit 2 decommissioning recovered through a system benefits charge. The drivers I discussed exclude these items as there was no net impact on full year results.
As you know, Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the next trends we are seeing in our local economy and, in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. In 2016, the Metro Phoenix region continued to have job growth above the national average. For the full year, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.7% compared to 1.7% for the entire United States. This above-average job growth is seen in virtually every major industry sector, although the most significant performance gains are seen in the construction and financial services sectors. This solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets.
As seen on the upper panel of Slide 6, the net absorption of vacant office and retail space has been growing steadily since 2010. Vacancy rates in both markets have fallen to levels last seen in 2008 or earlier, and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect the continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial developments.
Metro Phoenix has also growth in the real estate market. As you can see on the lower panels of Slide 6, housing construction in 2016 was at its highest level since 2007. This trend is expected to continue in 2017 as housing permits are expected to increase by about 7,000, driven largely by single-family permits. 
Several factors are driving this increase. Vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to pre-recession levels. Record-level apartment vacancies and absorption of available single-family homes is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market, and the economy more generally, to expand over the next couple of years.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.4% in 2016. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appears to be in place.
In closing, I will review our financial outlook and financing plan. As previously indicated, we will not be issuing 2017 earnings per share guidance at this time but will continue to evaluate the appropriate time to do so as our rate case progresses. In the meantime, to assist with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix to today's slides.
One item worth noting, we expect planned outage spend in 2017 to be comparable to 2016, in part driven by preparations for the SCR's installation at Four Corners. In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate APS's spend to average around $1.1 billion annually from 2017 to 2019, which we primarily funded through internally generated cash flow. We continue to expect our rate base to grow at an average annual rate of 6% to 7% through 2019.
Turning to 2017 financing. We expect to issue up to $850 million of long-term debt, including the refinance of Pinnacle's $125 million term loan. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continues to remain very strong.
A quick note on pension. Our funded status remains steady at 88% as of year-end 2016. The continued implementation of our liability-driven investment strategy has helped keep costs down. There is a slide in the appendix with additional details on our pension outlook.
Lastly, I'll share a few thoughts on proposed tax reform. We are actively assessing tax reform scenarios and are working closely with our EEI peers. Overall, we've reviewed the proposed changes as beneficial to customers, with the potential to release some rate pressure. We generally view the potential company impact as mild, especially given Pinnacle's minimal parent-level debt. But with so much uncertainty at this point, it's difficult to speculate with any degree of certainty. We will continue to monitor discussions closely as they develop.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

A lot couple owners have made it clear that you're not going to operate beyond 2019. In the meantime, the Department of Interior and our ACC as well as others have pulled all the parties together and are looking for some sort of resolution post 2019 in order to continue to operate the facility. The economics of the facility, as it stands today, would not warrant continued operation without some significant changes. So that's an ongoing issue still to be resolved. As far as the impact of the generation, we will update our RFP as we go forward. But the current expectation is we have the resources until at least 2019, potentially longer, and we'll put it into our future plans and what we do from an RFP or some other position with regards to another generation decision."

So you'll have a full year impact of that. And we just see a lot of construction, especially multifamily homes, going on in downtown Phoenix.

Pinnacle West concluded a productive 2016, with earnings in line with our expectations. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another record year. Our employees set a new company-wide safety record,",1256,"Thanks, Ted, and thank you all for joining us today. Pinnacle West concluded a productive 2016, with earnings in line with our expectations. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another record year. Our employees set a new company-wide safety record, and we continue making progress on our regulatory initiatives. Our capital execution program is on track, with several noteworthy projects recently placed into service, and our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results in a moment. My comments will focus on our 2016 highlights and the year ahead.
Our fleet performed very well in 2016, highlighted by Palo Verde's 25th consecutive year as the nation's largest power producer. Total production reached 32.2 billion kilowatt-hours of carbon-free electricity. In fact, the fall refueling outage for Unit 3 set a station record for the shortest outage ever and set a nuclear industry record for radiological safety.
Before I continue, I want to recognize Randy Edington for his significant positive impact on our company as Chief Nuclear Officer. Randy will be retiring from APS in March, and I want to thank him for the great service to our company and the nuclear industry as a whole during his decade of leadership here in Arizona. Because of his skill and experience as well as his ability to develop strong leaders and sustainable processes, he has left a lasting legacy of excellence at Palo Verde.
In 2016, APS also achieved its safest year with the fewest OSHA recordable injuries in our history. I consider the safety of our employees a top priority, and I also believe safety metrics are good indicators of management's ability to lead an organization. These just aren't statistics, but the result of a continued commitment from all our employees and management team to drive operational excellence.
Turning to the regulatory front. We've had a busy few months, with the ongoing progress of our rate review and the conclusion of the value and cost of distributed generation proceeding. I'll provide an update on these important items in a moment, but first, I want to thank Arizona Corporation Commissioner Bob Stump, whose term ended in early January of this year. We appreciate his commitment to the state over his many years of public service and for driving the dialogue on several complex regulatory issues. Commissioner Bob Burns, Andy Tobin and Boyd Dunn were sworn in on January 3 to 4-year terms. Commissioner Tom Forese was also selected by his fellow commissioners as Chairman, succeeding Commissioner Doug Little, who led the commission through a challenging period.
I'll now provide an update on 2 important regulatory dockets: the value and cost of distributed generation decision; and our 2016 rate review filing. On December 20, the Corporation Commission completed its proceeding on the value and cost of DG. The commission approved the recommendation to replace the current net metering tariff with a more formula-driven approach. The formula will use inputs from utility-scale solar power costs and eventually transition to an avoided cost methodology. 
In addition, the ACC made the following determinations: first, banking of energy produced by DG solar systems has been eliminated; second, customers with DG solar may be considered a separate class of customers for rate-making purposes; and third, DG solar customers who have interconnected systems prior to the decision on APS's pending rate review will be grandfathered for a period of 20 years. This decision marks an important milestone in our commitment to modernize customer rates while minimizing subsidies among customer classes. Although other jurisdictions have attempted to make similar changes, this was among the first fully litigated cases in the country and was founded on actual evidence, sworn testimony and a judge's order.
Moreover, the decision was embraced by a wide variety of stakeholders, including local solar installers who share our vision for creating a sustainable energy future for Arizona. I know APS's rate review is top of mind for many of you, and we continue making good progress with this proceeding.
Since our last call, the ACC staff and intervenors filed a testimony in response to our initial proposal. This provided a foundation for us to engage in meaningful settlement negotiations in January and earlier this month. We continue working with parties toward a constructive settlement proposal to be filed no later than March 17.
Last month, the administrative law judge revised the procedural schedule for this case in order to provide staff with sufficient time to incorporate the recent value of cost -- excuse me, value and cost of DG decision. As a result, the time clock was extended by 33 days, and the new hearing date is April 24.
2017 marks a period of unprecedented capital investment for our company. As we manage more than $1.3 billion in projects and plan to spend more than $3.4 billion in capital over the next 3 years, our focus continues to be modernizing the distribution grid, investing in flexible generation and advancing our customer experience. We're well positioned to be a leader in grid automation and technology integration. 
The APS Solar Partner Program recently won the award for Renewable Integration Project of the Year at the annual DistribuTECH conference. Through this program, our employees are studying the application of smart inverters to integrate rooftop solar and battery storage on the distribution grid. 
In addition, we recently placed into service an industry-leading advanced distribution management system. Next month, we'll launch a new state-of-the-art customer information system. Both systems are innovative, forward thinking and bring greater value to our customers while preparing for the future. These investments drive operating efficiencies through leveraging technology on the grid, which resulted in continued cost management and improved reliability for our customers. We also remain committed to upgrading our generation portfolio with more flexible gas generation as the Ocotillo Modernization Project hits full stride this year.
Finally, our traditional generation and transmission business continues to drive meaningful investments as we further expand our high-voltage transmission system and install environmental control technology at the Four Corners Power Plant. 
Recently, the owners of Navajo Generating Station announced the decision to repower the plant by 2019, in which APS has a 350-megawatt stake. This generation shortfall is in addition to the existing shortfall of 3,500 megawatts by 2022, as outlined in our 2017 preliminary Integrated Resource Plan, which I described for you last quarter. Although a portion of this resource gap will be filled by the Ocotillo project and our recent 565-megawatt power purchase agreement, the remainder will be procured through additional market opportunities, customer conservation and distributed generation.
In addition to our changing energy mix, we continue to embrace the growing Western marketplace for wholesale power. In October, we joined the Western Energy Imbalance Market, which produced $6 million in savings for our customers in the fourth quarter of 2016 alone. We expect continued savings throughout 2017, which reduces cost for customers and improves the competitiveness of our retail rates.
In summary, we delivered on our commitments in 2016 and are well positioned for 2017 in the long term. We have a clear plan and a strong leadership team in place to deliver on the plan. The priorities we have for the year ahead, in particular, completing the rate review and executing on our capital investments, are laying the foundation for APS to be a sustainable leader in an evolving industry. We remain focused on creating value through our core business while delivering on our financial and operational commitments.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a good year and ended on a strong note.Bef",1217,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a good year and ended on a strong note.
Before I review the details of our 2016 results, let me touch on a couple of highlights from the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we earned $0.47 per share compared to $0.37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Slide 4 outlines the variances which drove the increase in our quarterly earnings per share. Gross margin was flat, including lower sales, which were offset by higher LFCR revenues. Lower operations and maintenance expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 improved earnings by $0.06 per share, largely due to lower employee benefit costs driven by the adoption of the new stock compensation accounting guidance.
Now turning to Slide 5. Let's review some of the details of our full year results. 2016 results were in line with our expectations, earning $3.95 per share compared to $3.92 per share in 2015, translating to an earned consolidated ROE of 9.5% on a weather-normalized basis. 
Gross margin was a positive driver for the year, contributing $0.33 per share, including favorable year-over-year weather. Sales in 2016 compared to 2015 added $0.05 to gross margin. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt-hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency program and distributed generation were flat year-over-year. But similar to the pattern we saw throughout 2016, the usage trends and related pricing by customer class were mixed and generated a positive gross margin effect. Transmission and LFCR revenues also continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin, as designed, contributing $0.17 per share collectively.
Looking next at operating expenses. As expected, higher operations and maintenance expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was a primary offset to ongoing results, increasing earnings by $0.30 per share, with the major planned outages at Four Corners Units 4 and 5 serving as the largest headwinds. Power transmission, distribution and customer service costs and higher employee benefit costs also contributed to the year-over-year increase in O&M. Power depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 versus 2015 reduced earnings by $0.03 per share, including higher depreciation due to additional plant in service.
Interest expense net of AFUDC was a $0.02 per share benefit to the earnings in 2016 compared to 2015. The net reduction included higher interest charges resulting from higher debt balances, which were more than offset by higher construction work in progress benefiting AFUDC. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude amounts related to our renewable energy and demand-side management programs. Also note that the gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues and expense related to the Palo Verde Unit 2 decommissioning recovered through a system benefits charge. The drivers I discussed exclude these items as there was no net impact on full year results.
As you know, Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the next trends we are seeing in our local economy and, in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. In 2016, the Metro Phoenix region continued to have job growth above the national average. For the full year, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.7% compared to 1.7% for the entire United States. This above-average job growth is seen in virtually every major industry sector, although the most significant performance gains are seen in the construction and financial services sectors. This solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets.
As seen on the upper panel of Slide 6, the net absorption of vacant office and retail space has been growing steadily since 2010. Vacancy rates in both markets have fallen to levels last seen in 2008 or earlier, and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect the continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial developments.
Metro Phoenix has also growth in the real estate market. As you can see on the lower panels of Slide 6, housing construction in 2016 was at its highest level since 2007. This trend is expected to continue in 2017 as housing permits are expected to increase by about 7,000, driven largely by single-family permits. 
Several factors are driving this increase. Vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to pre-recession levels. Record-level apartment vacancies and absorption of available single-family homes is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market, and the economy more generally, to expand over the next couple of years.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.4% in 2016. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appears to be in place.
In closing, I will review our financial outlook and financing plan. As previously indicated, we will not be issuing 2017 earnings per share guidance at this time but will continue to evaluate the appropriate time to do so as our rate case progresses. In the meantime, to assist with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix to today's slides.
One item worth noting, we expect planned outage spend in 2017 to be comparable to 2016, in part driven by preparations for the SCR's installation at Four Corners. In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate APS's spend to average around $1.1 billion annually from 2017 to 2019, which we primarily funded through internally generated cash flow. We continue to expect our rate base to grow at an average annual rate of 6% to 7% through 2019.
Turning to 2017 financing. We expect to issue up to $850 million of long-term debt, including the refinance of Pinnacle's $125 million term loan. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continues to remain very strong.
A quick note on pension. Our funded status remains steady at 88% as of year-end 2016. The continued implementation of our liability-driven investment strategy has helped keep costs down. There is a slide in the appendix with additional details on our pension outlook.
Lastly, I'll share a few thoughts on proposed tax reform. We are actively assessing tax reform scenarios and are working closely with our EEI peers. Overall, we've reviewed the proposed changes as beneficial to customers, with the potential to release some rate pressure. We generally view the potential company impact as mild, especially given Pinnacle's minimal parent-level debt. But with so much uncertainty at this point, it's difficult to speculate with any degree of certainty. We will continue to monitor discussions closely as they develop.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

A lot couple owners have made it clear that you're not going to operate beyond 2019. In the meantime, the Department of Interior and our ACC as well as others have pulled all the parties together and are looking for some sort of resolution post 2019 in order to continue to operate the facility. The economics of the facility, as it stands today, would not warrant continued operation without some significant changes. So that's an ongoing issue still to be resolved. As far as the impact of the generation, we will update our RFP as we go forward. But the current expectation is we have the resources until at least 2019, potentially longer, and we'll put it into our future plans and what we do from an RFP or some other position with regards to another generation decision."

First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. [indiscernible] comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because the actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Our first quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements cautionary language as well as the risk factors and the MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.

Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. I know APS's rate review is top of mind for many of you, and we continue making good progress with this proceeding. On March 1, we announced a settlement, which has broad-based support. In total, 29 intervenors signed this settlement agreement, including the Arizona Corporation Commission Staff, the Residential Utility Consumer Office, or RUCO, members of the Local and National Solar Industry and Low Income Advocates. The settlement provisions contain a number of benefits for our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. Details of the settlement are outlined in the appendix of our slides today, and I'll review some of the highlights with you now. 
Slide 8 shows the settlement's proposed base rate changes, which includes a non-fuel, non-depreciation base rate increase of $87.2 million per year, excluding the transfer of adjust for balances. Additionally, APS will decrease rates by $53.6 million, attributable to reduce fuel and purchase power costs, and increase rates by $61 million due to changes in depreciation schedules. The result is a total base rate increase of $94.6 million or an overall 3.3% bill increase. Other elements that underpin the settlement including maintaining our allowed return on equity of 10%, our capital structure and base fuel rate are also listed on the slide. The settlement contains a number of important financial provisions, which reduce regulatory lag and better align the rates with the cost to service. In particular, the settlement provides for a cost deferral order for the Ocotillo Modernization Project and a cost deferral order plus rate adjustment for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at Four Corners. Also, the current property tax deferral continues in the power supply adjustors expanded to include additional production costs. APS proposed changes to the rate options offered to customers, ensuring the price a customer pays more accurately reflects the way that customer uses the electric grid. This one is an important focus of our filing. The settlement includes meaningful changes to modernize rates, including shifting the on-peak period from 12:00 noon to 7:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the afternoon and early evening, which is more aligned with actual peak usage by customers. Importantly, new distributed generation customers will be required to select a rate option that has time of use rates, including a grid access charge or demand component. APS was among the first utilities in the nation to introduce time of use rates for residential customers back in 1984. Today, more than half of our customers choose the time of use rate for their service. This settlement will create another first by establishing time of use rates as a standard for all new customers after May 1, 2018, except for our smallest customers. The settlement also contains a self-build moratorium through January 1, 2022, with certain exceptions. For example, the moratorium excludes investments in new combustion turbines that will be placed in service after January 1, 2022. Finally, the settlement includes a 3-year stay-out for the next general rate case application. Under this provision, APS may file its next general rate case on or after June 1, 2019. Last week, the ACC's formal hearing on the APS rate review began and is currently underway. Looking ahead, we anticipate the administrative law judge to issue a recommended order followed by a commissioner vote at an upcoming open meeting. We view that the proposed settlement agreement is a further sign of Arizona's constructive regulatory environment. We appreciate the opportunity to continue working with the ACC in various stakeholders to find solutions that balance the interest of customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another successful quarter, operating above a 100% capacity factor. A planned [indiscernible] outage for Palo Verde Unit 2 began on April 8. Additionally, at the Four Corners Power Plant, our employees are making solid progress on the installation of selective catalytic reduction equipment and construction activity is ramping up at our Ocotillo Modernization Project. This year, we are investing more in our distribution system than ever before. Our focus on modernizing the distribution grid is not a temporary phase, but instead, a shift in how we prioritize investments, with a greater emphasis on our transmission and distribution business. Over the next few years, we expect to invest $1.8 billion in our grid infrastructure, enabling a more secure and resilient grid, which has greater access to the Western energy market. On April 10, we filed our 2017 Integrated Resource Plan, which includes a 15-year forecast of customer electricity demands and the resources needed to serve our customers reliably in the future. An important part of our forecast is the growing requirement for flexible peaking generation over the planning horizon. By 2025, we expect an additional 1.3 gigawatts of quick start combustion-driven capacity will be needed in order to meet our growing summer peak as well as supplement the intermittency created by solar resources. Moreover, we are witnessing lower average daily prices on the wholesale market, with sharp price spikes and increased volatility during peak periods. This new pricing pattern is a result of excess energy supply during the middle of the day throughout much of the year, largely created by an oversupply of solar energy in California. In order to take advantage of this oversupply and pass the energy savings to our customers, we value investments and flexible resources that [indiscernible] shut down to allow the import of market power, and then quickly ramp back up when demand and prices spike again later in the day. We expect these market conditions to exist for the foreseeable future, and we're positioning our generation investments to be more aligned with these market conditions. Ultimately, this will result in a lower cost of service to our customers, improve reliability for the region and new investment opportunities for our company. This also means that our view is on the value of baseload and intermediate generation for our customers are evolving, and we will focus our future investments for new generation towards flexible peaking technology, like combustion turbines and eventually, energy storage, which is better optimized for emerging market conditions. 
Finally, I'd like to update you on a change on our executive team. When I became CEO in early 2009, the top of my priority list was recruit one of the finest legal minds in the electricity industry, [indiscernible], to join the company as our General Counsel. Fortunately for us, Dave accepted the offer and has provided Pinnacle West [indiscernible] with consistently thoughtful counsel ever since. He's a trusted adviser, so it is with mixes feelings that I share Dave's decision to begin to transition into retirement. Dave will become Pinnacle West's Executive Vice President [indiscernible] through his retirement in the spring of 2018, and will continue to advise the Board of Directors [indiscernible] on governance matters and industries issues. Dave's transition period allows us to continue our commitment to succession planning and talent development on all levels of our company, and I'm pleased to announce that Jeff Guldner has been promoted to Executive Vice President, and will assume the role of General Counsel for Pinnacle West and APS in addition to his current responsibilities of leading our public policy organization. Jeff's a skilled lawyer and a thoughtful and respected leader with a deep understanding of our industry. 
In closing, we're delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for a solid year in 2017. We're focused on completing our rate review filing and maintaining operational excellence, while positioning Pinnacle West as a sustainable leader through strategic capital investments. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2017, we earned $0.21 per share com",1010,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us on our call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. 
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2017, we earned $0.21 per share compared to $0.04 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. An increase in gross margin [indiscernible] per share compared with the first -- prior-year first quarter period, supported by higher [indiscernible] and favorable weather. [indiscernible] sales in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 decreased earnings by $0.04 per share, where positive effects of customer growth were more than offset by energy savings, driven by customer behavior, energy efficiency programs and distributed renewable generation and [indiscernible] 2016. Although sales were down in the first quarter, it should be noted that normalized usage per customer in our first and fourth quarters tend to have more variability than usage in the second and third quarters and results in these periods are less indicative of full year results. As an example of this month-to-month variability, we've seen positive weather-normalized sales growth in April, although I will remind you that we're only 1 month of data. [indiscernible] operations and maintenance expense contributed $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower planned outage costs. As you recall, we had large planned outages at the Four Corners Power Plant in both the first and second quarters of 2016 as part of the plant's routine maintenance schedule. As we previously indicated, we expect additional planned outages at Four Corners this year as we prepare for the FCR installations, the timing of which will be largely focused in the second half of 2017. Higher D&A decreased earnings by $0.04 per share in the first quarter due to increased expenses resulting from additional planned service. And lastly, you will notice a $0.05 benefit to first quarter earnings, driven by a lower effective tax rate in the current year period, primarily due to the adoption of the new stock compensation guidance in 2016. The new guidance requires income tax benefits and deficiencies, resulting from share-based payments to be recognized in the period as they occur. 
Now turning to Arizona's economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the trends that we are seeing in our local economy, and in particular, the Phoenix Metro area. In 2017, the Metro Phoenix [indiscernible] continues to have job growth above the national average. Through February, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.6% compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. This above-average job growth is driven largely by the financial services sector. This solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. As seen on the upward panel of Slide 4, vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall in the levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, over 2 million square feet of new office in the retail space is under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth at a Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you could see on the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the upward postrecession trend. In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 7,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits for new single-family homes in March were at the highest levels since August of 2007. Several factors are driving this increase. [indiscernible] County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. Also, as I mentioned on previous calls, vacant housing in Phoenix are solidly back to prerecession levels. The activity in the market has provided a meaningful build support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth or mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households [indiscernible] during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand at the states over the next couple of years. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.4% in the first quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamental supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
Finally, I'll comment on our liquidity and financing. On March 21, APS issued an additional $250 million of its outstanding 4.35% senior unsecured notes that mature in November 2045. The proceeds were used to refinance commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. We expect to issue up to $600 million of additional long-term debt this year, one transaction at Pinnacle, including financing of the $125 million term loan and one at APS. Overall, our balance sheet liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the first quarter, Pinnacle and APS had approximately $91 million and $117 million of [indiscernible] outstanding, respectively. 
And just a quick thought on guidance. We do not intend to issue earnings guidance for 2017 until after final approval in APS's rate review. However, to assist you with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix in today's slides. Additionally, if the proposed settlement [indiscernible] rate review [indiscernible] by the Arizona Corporation Commission, we would be comfortable with our ability to continue to fund APS's capital expenditure program with no new equity through our planning horizon. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because the actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Our first quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements cautionary language as well as the Risk Factors and the MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.

Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. I know APS's rate review is top of mind for many of you, and we continue making good progress with this proceeding. On March 1, we announced a settlement, which has broad-based support. In total, 29 intervenors signed the settlement agreement, including the Arizona Corporation Commission staff, the Residential Utility Consumer Office, or RUCO, members of the local and national solar industry and low-income advocates. The settlement provisions contain a number of benefits for our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. Details of the settlement are outlined in the appendix of our slides today, and I'll review some of the highlights with you now. 
Slide 8 shows the settlement's proposed base rate changes, which includes a non-fuel, non-depreciation base rate increase of $87.2 million per year, excluding the transfer of adjust for balances. Additionally, APS will decrease rates by $53.6 million, attributable to reduced fuel and purchase power cost, and increase rates by $61 million due to changes in depreciation schedules. The result is a total base rate increase of $94.6 million or an overall 3.3% bill increase. Other elements that underpin the settlement, including maintaining our allowed return on equity of 10%, our capital structure and base fuel rate are also listed on the slide. The settlement contains a number of important financial provisions, which reduce regulatory lag and better align rates with the cost of service. In particular, the settlement provides for a cost deferral order for the Ocotillo Modernization Project and a cost deferral order plus rate adjustment for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at Four Corners. Also, the current property tax deferral continues and the power supply adjustor is expanded to include additional production cost. APS proposed changes to the rate options offered to customers, ensuring the price a customer pays more accurately reflects the way that customer uses the electric grid. This one is an important focus of our filing. The settlement includes meaningful changes to modernize rates, including shifting the on-peak period from 12:00 noon to 7:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the afternoon and early evening, which is more aligned with actual peak usage by customers. Importantly, new distributed generation customers will be required to select a rate option that has time of use rates, including a grid access charge or demand component. APS was among the first utilities in the nation to introduce time of use rates for residential customers back in 1984. Today, more than half of our customers choose the time of use rate for their service. This settlement would create another first by establishing time of use rates as the standard for all new customers after May 1, 2018, except for our smallest customers. The settlement also contains a self-build moratorium through January 1, 2022, with certain exceptions. For example, the moratorium excludes investments in new combustion turbines that will be placed in service after January 1, 2022. Finally, the settlement includes a 3-year stay-out for the next general rate case application. Under this provision, APS may file its next general rate case on or after June 1, 2019. Last week, the ACC's formal hearing on the APS rate review began and is currently underway. Looking ahead, we anticipate the administrative law judge to issue a recommended order followed by a commissioner vote at an upcoming open meeting. We view the proposed settlement agreement as a further sign of Arizona's constructive regulatory environment. We appreciate the opportunity to continue working with the ACC and various stakeholders to find solutions that balance the interest of customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another successful quarter, operating above a 100% capacity factor. A planned refueling outage for Palo Verde Unit 2 began on April 8. Additionally, at the Four Corners Power Plant, our employees are making solid progress on the installation of selective catalytic reduction equipment and construction activity is ramping up at our Ocotillo Modernization Project. This year, we are investing more in our distribution system than ever before. Our focus on modernizing the distribution grid is not a temporary phase, but instead, a shift in how we prioritize investments, with a greater emphasis on our transmission and distribution business. Over the next few years, we expect to invest $1.8 billion in our grid infrastructure, enabling a more secure and resilient grid, which has greater access to the Western energy market. On April 10, we filed our 2017 Integrated Resource Plan, which includes a 15-year forecast of customer electricity demands and the resources needed to serve our customers reliably in the future. An important part of our forecast is the growing requirement for flexible peaking generation over the planning horizon. By 2025, we expect an additional 1.3 gigawatts of quick start combustion-driven capacity will be needed in order to meet our growing summer peak as well as supplement the intermittency created by solar resources. Moreover, we are witnessing lower average daily prices on the wholesale market, with sharp price spikes and increased volatility during peak periods. This new pricing pattern is a result of excess energy supply during the middle of the day throughout much of the year, largely created by an oversupply of solar energy in California. In order to take advantage of this oversupply and pass the energy savings to our customers, we value investments and flexible resources that can shut down to allow the import of market power and then quickly ramp back up when demand and prices spike again later in the day. We expect these market conditions to exist for the foreseeable future, and we're positioning our generation investments to be more aligned with these market conditions. Ultimately, this will result in a lower cost of service to our customers, improve reliability for the region and new investment opportunities for our company. This also means that our views on the value of baseload and intermediate generation for our customers are evolving, and we will focus our future investments for new generation towards flexible peaking technology, like combustion turbines and eventually, energy storage, which is better optimized for emerging market conditions. 
Finally, I'd like to update you on a change on our executive team. When I became CEO in early 2009, the top of my priority list was recruit one of the finest legal minds in the electricity industry, Dave Falck, to join the company as our General Counsel. Fortunately for us, Dave accepted the offer and has provided Pinnacle West and me with consistently thoughtful counsel ever since. He's a trusted adviser, so it is with mixed feelings that I share Dave's decision to begin to transition into retirement. Dave will become Pinnacle West's Executive Vice President of Law through his retirement in the spring of 2018, and will continue to advise the Board of Directors and me on governance matters and industry's issues. Dave's transition period allows us to continue our commitment to succession planning and talent development on all levels of our company, and I'm pleased to announce that Jeff Guldner has been promoted to Executive Vice President, and will assume the role of General Counsel for Pinnacle West and APS in addition to his current responsibilities of leading our public policy organization. Jeff's a skilled lawyer and a thoughtful and respected leader with a deep understanding of our industry. 
In closing, we're delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for a solid year in 2017. We're focused on completing our rate review filing and maintaining operational excellence while positioning Pinnacle West as a sustainable leader through strategic capital investments. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2017, we earned $0.21 per share com",1035,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us on our call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. 
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2017, we earned $0.21 per share compared to $0.04 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. An increase in gross margin added $0.06 per share compared with the first -- prior-year first quarter period, supported by higher LFCR revenues and favorable weather. Lower net sales in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 decreased earnings by $0.04 per share, where positive effects of customer growth were more than offset by energy savings, driven by customer behavior, energy efficiency programs and distributed renewable generation and one less day of sales due to the leap year in 2016. Although sales were down in the first quarter, it should be noted that normalized usage per customer in our first and fourth quarters tend to have more variability than usage in the second and third quarters and results in these periods are less indicative of full year results. As an example of this month-to-month variability, we have seen positive weather-normalized sales growth in April, although I will remind you this is only 1 month of data. Lower operations and maintenance expense contributed $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower planned outage costs. As you recall, we had large planned outages at the Four Corners Power Plant in both the first and second quarters of 2016 as part of the plant's routine maintenance schedule. As we previously indicated, we expect additional planned outages at Four Corners this year as we prepare for the FCR installations, the timing of which will be largely focused in the second half of 2017. Higher D&A decreased earnings by $0.04 per share in the first quarter due to increased expenses resulting from additional plant in service. And lastly, you will notice a $0.05 benefit to first quarter earnings, driven by a lower effective tax rate in the current year period, primarily due to the adoption of the new stock compensation guidance in 2016. The new guidance requires income tax benefits and deficiencies, resulting from share-based payments to be recognized in the period in which they occur. 
Now turning to Arizona's economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the trends that we are seeing in our local economy, and in particular, the Phoenix Metro area. In 2017, the Metro Phoenix region continues to have job growth above the national average. Through February, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.6% compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. This above-average job growth is driven largely by the financial services sector. This solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. As seen on the upward panel of Slide 4, vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall in the levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, over 2 million square feet of new office in the retail space is under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you could see on the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the upward postrecession trend. In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 7,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits for new single-family homes in March were at the highest level since August of 2007. Several factors are driving this increase. Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. Also, as I mentioned on previous calls, vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to prerecession levels. The activity in the market has provided a meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth or mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand at their space over the next couple of years. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.4% in the first quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamental supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
Finally, I'll comment on our liquidity and financing. On March 21, APS issued an additional $250 million of its outstanding 4.35% senior unsecured notes that mature in November 2045. The proceeds were used to refinance commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. We expect to issue up to $600 million of additional long-term debt this year, one transaction at Pinnacle, including financing of the $125 million term loan and one at APS. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the first quarter, Pinnacle and APS had approximately $91 million and $117 million of short term debt outstanding, respectively. 
And just a quick thought on guidance. We do not intend to issue earnings guidance for 2017 until after final approval in APS's pending rate review. However, to assist you with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix in today's slides. Additionally, if the proposed settlement and the pending rate review is approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission, we would be comfortable with our ability to continue to fund APS's capital expenditure program with no new equity through our planning horizon. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. I know APS's rate review is top of mind for many of you, and we continue making good progress with this proceeding. On March 1, we announced a settlement, which has broad-based support. In total, 29 intervenors signed the settlement agreement, including the Arizona Corporation Commission staff; the Residential Utility Consumer Office, or RUCO; members of the local and national solar industry and low-income advocates. The settlement provisions contain a number of benefits for our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. Details of the settlement are outlined in the appendix of our slides today, and I'll review some of the highlights with you now. 
Slide 8 shows the settlement's proposed base rate changes, which includes a non-fuel, non-depreciation base rate increase of $87.2 million per year, excluding the transfer of adjust for balances. Additionally, APS will decrease rates by $53.6 million, attributable to reduced fuel and purchase power cost, and increase rates by $61 million due to changes in depreciation schedules. The result is a total base rate increase of $94.6 million or an overall 3.3% bill increase. Other elements that underpin the settlement, including maintaining our allowed return on equity of 10%, our capital structure and base fuel rate, are also listed on the slide. The settlement contains a number of important financial provisions, which reduce regulatory lag and better align rates with the cost of service. In particular, the settlement provides for a cost deferral order for the Ocotillo Modernization Project and a cost deferral order plus rate adjustment for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at Four Corners. Also, the current property tax deferral continues and the power supply adjustor is expanded to include additional production cost. APS proposed changes to the rate options offered to customers, ensuring the price a customer pays more accurately reflects the way that customer uses the electric grid. This one is an important focus of our filing. The settlement includes meaningful changes to modernize rates, including shifting the on-peak period from 12:00 noon to 7:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the afternoon and early evening, which is more aligned with actual peak usage by customers. Importantly, new distributed generation customers will be required to select a rate option that has time of use rates, including a grid access charge or demand component. APS was among the first utilities in the nation to introduce time of use rates for residential customers back in 1984. Today, more than half of our customers choose the time of use rate for their service. This settlement would create another first by establishing time of use rates as the standard for all new customers after May 1, 2018, except for our smallest customers. The settlement also contains a self-build moratorium through January 1, 2022, with certain exceptions. For example, the moratorium excludes investments in new combustion turbines that will be placed in service after January 1, 2022. Finally, the settlement includes a 3-year stay-out for the next general rate case application. Under this provision, APS may file its next general rate case on or after June 1, 2019. Last week, the ACC's formal hearing on the APS rate review began and is currently underway. Looking ahead, we anticipate the administrative law judge to issue a recommended order followed by a commissioner vote at an upcoming open meeting. We view the proposed settlement agreement as a further sign of Arizona's constructive regulatory environment. We appreciate the opportunity to continue working with the ACC and various stakeholders to find solutions that balance the interest of customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another successful quarter, operating above a 100% capacity factor. A planned refueling outage for Palo Verde Unit 2 began on April 8. Additionally, at the Four Corners Power Plant, our employees are making solid progress on the installation of selective catalytic reduction equipment and construction activity is ramping up at our Ocotillo Modernization Project. This year, we are investing more in our distribution system than ever before. Our focus on modernizing the distribution grid is not a temporary phase, but instead, a shift in how we prioritize investments, with a greater emphasis on our transmission and distribution business. Over the next few years, we expect to invest $1.8 billion in our grid infrastructure, enabling a more secure and resilient grid, which has greater access to the Western energy market. On April 10, we filed our 2017 Integrated Resource Plan, which includes a 15-year forecast of customer electricity demands and the resources needed to serve our customers reliably in the future. An important part of our forecast is the growing requirement for flexible peaking generation over the planning horizon. By 2025, we expect an additional 1.3 gigawatts of quick start combustion-driven capacity will be needed in order to meet our growing summer peak as well as supplement the intermittency created by solar resources. Moreover, we are witnessing lower average daily prices on the wholesale market, with sharp price spikes and increased volatility during peak periods. This new pricing pattern is a result of excess energy supply during the middle of the day throughout much of the year, largely created by an oversupply of solar energy in California. In order to take advantage of this oversupply and pass the energy savings to our customers, we value investments and flexible resources that can quickly shut down to allow the import of market power and then quickly ramp back up when demand and prices spike again later in the day. We expect these market conditions to exist for the foreseeable future, and we're positioning our generation investments to be more aligned with these market conditions. Ultimately, this will result in a lower cost of service to our customers, improve reliability for the region and new investment opportunities for our company. This also means that our views on the value of baseload and intermediate generation for our customers are evolving, and we will focus our future investments for new generation towards flexible peaking technology, like combustion turbines and eventually, energy storage, which is better optimized for emerging market conditions. 
Finally, I'd like to update you on a change on our executive team. When I became CEO in early 2009, the top of my priority list was to recruit one of the finest legal minds in the electricity industry, Dave Falck, to join the company as our General Counsel. Fortunately for us, Dave accepted the offer and has provided Pinnacle West and me with consistently thoughtful counsel ever since. He's a trusted adviser, so it is with mixed feelings that I share Dave's decision to begin to transition into retirement. Dave will become Pinnacle West's Executive Vice President of Law through his retirement in the spring of 2018, and will continue to advise the Board of Directors and me on governance matters and industry's issues. Dave's transition period allows us to continue our commitment to succession planning and talent development on all levels of our company, and I'm pleased to announce that Jeff Guldner has been promoted to Executive Vice President, and will assume the role of General Counsel for Pinnacle West and APS in addition to his current responsibilities of leading our public policy organization. Jeff's a skilled lawyer and a thoughtful and respected leader with a deep understanding of our industry. 
In closing, we're delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for a solid year in 2017. We're focused on completing our rate review filing and maintaining operational excellence while positioning Pinnacle West as a sustainable leader through strategic capital investments. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2017, we earned $0.21 per share com",1036,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us on our call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. 
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2017, we earned $0.21 per share compared to $0.04 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. An increase in gross margin added $0.06 per share compared with the first -- prior-year first quarter period, supported by higher LFCR revenues and favorable weather. Lower net sales in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 decreased earnings by $0.04 per share, where positive effects of customer growth were more than offset by energy savings driven by customer behavior, energy efficiency programs and distributed renewable generation and one less day of sales due to the leap year in 2016. Although sales were down in the first quarter, it should be noted that normalized usage per customer in our first and fourth quarters tend to have more variability than usage in the second and third quarters and results in these periods are less indicative of full year results. As an example of this month-to-month variability, we have seen positive weather-normalized sales growth in April, although I will remind you this is only 1 month of data. Lower operations and maintenance expense contributed $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower planned outage costs. As you recall, we had large planned outages at the Four Corners Power Plant in both the first and second quarters of 2016 as part of the plant's routine maintenance schedule. As we previously indicated, we expect additional planned outages at Four Corners this year as we prepare for the SCR installations, the timing of which will be largely focused in the second half of 2017. Higher D&A decreased earnings by $0.04 per share in the first quarter due to increased expenses resulting from additional plant in service. And lastly, you will notice a $0.05 benefit to first quarter earnings, driven by a lower effective tax rate in the current year period, primarily due to the adoption of the new stock compensation guidance in 2016. The new guidance requires income tax benefits and deficiencies, resulting from share-based payments to be recognized in the period in which they occur. 
Now turning to Arizona's economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the trends that we are seeing in our local economy, and in particular, the Phoenix Metro area. In 2017, the Metro Phoenix region continues to have job growth above the national average. Through February, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.6% compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. This above-average job growth is driven largely by the financial services sector. This solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. As seen on the upward panel of Slide 4, vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall and are at levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, over 2 million square feet of new office in the retail space is under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you could see on the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the upward postrecession trend. In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 7,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits for new single-family homes in March were at the highest level since August of 2007. Several factors are driving this increase. Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. Also, as I mentioned on previous calls, vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to prerecession levels. The activity in the market has provided a meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.4% in the first quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
Finally, I'll comment on our liquidity and financing. On March 21, APS issued an additional $250 million of its outstanding 4.35% senior unsecured notes that mature in November 2045. The proceeds were used to refinance commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. We expect to issue up to $600 million of additional long-term debt this year, one transaction at Pinnacle, including financing of the $125 million term loan and one at APS. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the first quarter, Pinnacle and APS had approximately $91 million and $117 million of short term debt outstanding, respectively. 
And just a quick thought on guidance. We do not intend to issue earnings guidance for 2017 until after final approval in APS's pending rate review. However, to assist you with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix in today's slides. Additionally, if the proposed settlement and the pending rate review is approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission, we would be comfortable with our ability to continue to fund APS's capital expenditure program with no new equity through our planning horizon. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. I know APS's rate review is top of mind for many of you, and we continue making good progress with this proceeding. On March 1, we announced a settlement, which has broad-based support. In total, 29 intervenors signed the settlement agreement, including the Arizona Corporation Commission staff; the Residential Utility Consumer Office, or RUCO; members of the local and national solar industry and low-income advocates. The settlement provisions contain a number of benefits for our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. Details of the settlement are outlined in the appendix of our slides today, and I'll review some of the highlights with you now. 
Slide 8 shows the settlement's proposed base rate changes, which includes a non-fuel, non-depreciation base rate increase of $87.2 million per year, excluding the transfer of adjust for balances. Additionally, APS will decrease rates by $53.6 million, attributable to reduced fuel and purchase power cost, and increase rates by $61 million due to changes in depreciation schedules. The result is a total base rate increase of $94.6 million or an overall 3.3% bill increase. Other elements that underpin the settlement, including maintaining our allowed return on equity of 10%, our capital structure and base fuel rate, are also listed on the slide. The settlement contains a number of important financial provisions, which reduce regulatory lag and better align rates with the cost of service. In particular, the settlement provides for a cost deferral order for the Ocotillo Modernization Project and a cost deferral order plus rate adjustment for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at Four Corners. Also, the current property tax deferral continues and the power supply adjustor is expanded to include additional production cost. APS proposed changes to the rate options offered to customers, ensuring the price a customer pays more accurately reflects the way that customer uses the electric grid. This one is an important focus of our filing. The settlement includes meaningful changes to modernize rates, including shifting the on-peak period from 12:00 noon to 7:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the afternoon and early evening, which is more aligned with actual peak usage by customers. 
Importantly, new distributed generation customers will be required to select a rate option that has time of use rates, including a grid access charge or demand component. APS was among the first utilities in the nation to introduce time of use rates for residential customers back in 1984. Today, more than half of our customers choose the time of use rate for their service. This settlement would create another first by establishing time of use rates as the standard for all new customers after May 1, 2018, except for our smallest customers. The settlement also contains a self-build moratorium through January 1, 2022, with certain exceptions. For example, the moratorium excludes investments in new combustion turbines that will be placed in service after January 1, 2022. Finally, the settlement includes a 3-year stay-out for the next general rate case application. Under this provision, APS may file its next general rate case on or after June 1, 2019. Last week, the ACC's formal hearing on the APS rate review began and is currently underway. Looking ahead, we anticipate the administrative law judge to issue a recommended order followed by a commissioner vote at an upcoming open meeting. We view the proposed settlement agreement as a further sign of Arizona's constructive regulatory environment. We appreciate the opportunity to continue working with the ACC and various stakeholders to find solutions that balance the interest of customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another successful quarter, operating above a 100% capacity factor. A planned refueling outage for Palo Verde Unit 2 began on April 8. Additionally, at the Four Corners Power Plant, our employees are making solid progress on the installation of selective catalytic reduction equipment and construction activity is ramping up at our Ocotillo Modernization Project. This year, we are investing more in our distribution system than ever before. Our focus on modernizing the distribution grid is not a temporary phase, but instead, a shift in how we prioritize investments, with a greater emphasis on our transmission and distribution business. Over the next few years, we expect to invest $1.8 billion in our grid infrastructure, enabling a more secure and resilient grid, which has greater access to the Western energy market. On April 10, we filed our 2017 Integrated Resource Plan, which includes a 15-year forecast of customer electricity demands and the resources needed to serve our customers reliably in the future. An important part of our forecast is the growing requirement for flexible peaking generation over the planning horizon. By 2025, we expect an additional 1.3 gigawatts of quick start combustion-driven capacity will be needed in order to meet our growing summer peak as well as supplement the intermittency created by solar resources. 
Moreover, we are witnessing lower average daily prices on the wholesale market, with sharp price spikes and increased volatility during peak periods. This new pricing pattern is a result of excess energy supply during the middle of the day throughout much of the year, largely created by an oversupply of solar energy in California. In order to take advantage of this oversupply and pass the energy savings to our customers, we value investments and flexible resources that can quickly shut down to allow the import of market power and then quickly ramp back up when demand and prices spike again later in the day. We expect these market conditions to exist for the foreseeable future, and we're positioning our generation investments to be more aligned with these market conditions. Ultimately, this will result in a lower cost of service to our customers, improve reliability for the region and new investment opportunities for our company. This also means that our views on the value of baseload and intermediate generation for our customers are evolving, and we will focus our future investments for new generation towards flexible peaking technology, like combustion turbines and eventually, energy storage, which is better optimized for emerging market conditions. 
Finally, I'd like to update you on a change on our executive team. When I became CEO in early 2009, the top of my priority list was to recruit one of the finest legal minds in the electricity industry, Dave Falck, to join the company as our General Counsel. Fortunately for us, Dave accepted the offer and has provided Pinnacle West and me with consistently thoughtful counsel ever since. He's a trusted adviser, so it is with mixed feelings that I share Dave's decision to begin to transition into retirement. Dave will become Pinnacle West's Executive Vice President of Law through his retirement in the spring of 2018, and will continue to advise the Board of Directors and me on governance matters and industry's issues. Dave's transition period allows us to continue our commitment to succession planning and talent development on all levels of our company, and I'm pleased to announce that Jeff Guldner has been promoted to Executive Vice President, and will assume the role of General Counsel for Pinnacle West and APS in addition to his current responsibilities of leading our public policy organization. Jeff's a skilled lawyer and a thoughtful and respected leader with a deep understanding of our industry. 
In closing, we're delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for a solid year in 2017. We're focused on completing our rate review filing and maintaining operational excellence while positioning Pinnacle West as a sustainable leader through strategic capital investments. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2017, we earned $0.21 per share com",1036,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us on our call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. 
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2017, we earned $0.21 per share compared to $0.04 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. An increase in gross margin added $0.06 per share compared with the first -- prior-year first quarter period, supported by higher LFCR revenues and favorable weather. Lower net sales in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 decreased earnings by $0.04 per share, where positive effects of customer growth were more than offset by energy savings driven by customer behavior, energy efficiency programs and distributed renewable generation and one less day of sales due to the leap year in 2016. Although sales were down in the first quarter, it should be noted that normalized usage per customer in our first and fourth quarters tend to have more variability than usage in the second and third quarters and results in these periods are less indicative of full year results. As an example of this month-to-month variability, we have seen positive weather-normalized sales growth in April, although I will remind you this is only 1 month of data. 
Lower operations and maintenance expense contributed $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower planned outage costs. As you recall, we had large planned outages at the Four Corners Power Plant in both the first and second quarters of 2016 as part of the plant's routine maintenance schedule. As we previously indicated, we expect additional planned outages at Four Corners this year as we prepare for the SCR installations, the timing of which will be largely focused in the second half of 2017. Higher D&A decreased earnings by $0.04 per share in the first quarter due to increased expenses resulting from additional plant in service. And lastly, you will notice a $0.05 benefit to first quarter earnings, driven by a lower effective tax rate in the current year period, primarily due to the adoption of the new stock compensation guidance in 2016. The new guidance requires income tax benefits and deficiencies, resulting from share-based payments to be recognized in the period in which they occur. 
Now turning to Arizona's economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the trends that we are seeing in our local economy, and in particular, the Phoenix Metro area. In 2017, the Metro Phoenix region continues to have job growth above the national average. Through February, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.6% compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. This above-average job growth is driven largely by the financial services sector. This solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. As seen on the upward panel of Slide 4, vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall and are at levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, over 2 million square feet of new office in the retail space is under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. 
As you could see on the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the upward postrecession trend. In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 7,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits for new single-family homes in March were at the highest level since August of 2007. Several factors are driving this increase. Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. Also, as I mentioned on previous calls, vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to prerecession levels. The activity in the market has provided a meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.4% in the first quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
Finally, I'll comment on our liquidity and financing. On March 21, APS issued an additional $250 million of its outstanding 4.35% senior unsecured notes that mature in November 2045. The proceeds were used to refinance commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. We expect to issue up to $600 million of additional long-term debt this year, one transaction at Pinnacle, including financing of the $125 million term loan and one at APS. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the first quarter, Pinnacle and APS had approximately $91 million and $117 million of short term debt outstanding, respectively. 
And just a quick thought on guidance. We do not intend to issue earnings guidance for 2017 until after final approval in APS's pending rate review. However, to assist you with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix in today's slides. Additionally, if the proposed settlement and the pending rate review is approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission, we would be comfortable with our ability to continue to fund APS's capital expenditure program with no new equity through our planning horizon. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

In other words, I mean, are you seeing the same kind of real estate activity that you actually saw in 2008? Or could you just elaborate a little bit more on that?"

We continue to demonstrate operational excellence through the second quarter of 2017, and we remain well positioned for a solid year. Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. Two significant milestones in the APS rate review had been completed as we near the conclusion of that process. The hearing ended on May 2 and the administrative law judge issued a recommended order on July 26. The recommended order supports the settlement agreement without material modification, including the 10% return on equity; a $94.6 million base rate increase, which is the equivalent of an overall 3.3% bill increase; deferrals for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at Four Corners; and the Ocotillo Modernization Project, with a step increase in 2019 for the SCRs and moving the time of use window from noon to 7:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. The administrative law judge also recommended that the new rates go into effect on September 1. APS will file exceptions and clarifications to the recommended order tomorrow on August 4. The settlement agreement will bring about sustainable solar, a smarter energy infrastructure, a cleaner energy mix and more options for customers. The judge's recommendation to support the settlement agreement continues to move us in that direction. The final step in the rate review process is for the commission to vote at an upcoming open meeting. We view the progress to this point, including the judge's recommendation to approve the settlement as very positive. With the anticipated conclusion of our rate review and the related imminent grant deadline for net metering, we continue to see an increase in residential solar. In June, we received over 4,500 applications for solar interconnections, which is more than double the recent monthly average. As of July, there have been more than 62,000 residential TV installations in the APS service territory, totaling 483 megawatts. As you know, APS customers also receive solar power from the large Solana generating station and from 10 AZ Sun utility scale solar plants. Turning to our operations, power generating station successfully completed a planned refueling outage for unit 2 in less than 31 days, with no OSHA recordable injuries. The units operated at 93.1% capacity factor through the first half of the year. At our Four Corners Power Plant, the installation of new selective catalytic reduction equipment is more than 75% complete. The first unit with the new equipment will come online later this year and the second in early 2018. The 5 new fast start flexible generating units being installed at our Ocotillo plant are more than 60% complete, and all are expected to be in service by summer 2019. The Navajo Generating Station co-owners and the Navajo Nation agreed that the Navajo plant will remain in operation until December 2019. On June 26, the Navajo Nation council approved a replacement lease that would allow the plant to operate through 2019 and sets guidelines for decommissioning activities that will begin after 2019. Certain additional approvals are required, which are expected to occur by late 2017. Various stakeholders, including regulators, tribal representatives, the plant's coal supplier and the United States Department of the Interior have been meeting to determine if an alternative solution can be reached that would permit continued operation of the plant beyond 2019. On June 20, amidst stay week long spell of temperatures ranging between 115 and 119 degrees. APS customers set an all-time record peak demand of 7,367 megawatts between the hours of 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. This record demands equips the 11-year-old record of 7,236 megawatts set back in 2006. Allow me to expand on a few more observations about energy supply on that peak day, June 20. By 8:00 p.m. that evening, the system load was still within 6% of the record peak, demonstrating how energy demand remains very strong, even after the sun goes down. Production from private rooftop solar had peaked at 1:00 p.m. that afternoon and was only producing 30% of its capacity during the 6:00 p.m. hour. Our growing customer demand and the misalignment between when our demand peak occurs and when rooftop solar produces the most energy, further demonstrates the need to continue grid enhancements, while adding peaking resources. Looking to our capital investment program, in June, the Daisy Mountain substation came online, helping to provide strong reliability for a growing population north of the Phoenix Metropolitan area. The new system is 1 of over 2 prototype substations that incorporate self-correcting technology. As part of our continuing proactive approach to modernizing the grid, APS has implemented advanced technologies, completed multiple high-voltage transmission projects to further improve reliability and introduced new ways for customers to receive important energy usage information. This planned investment strategy helps to ensure we are able to meet our customers' increasing energy requirements. For our future resource needs, APS issued an RFP on April 12, seeking proposals for 400 to 700 megawatts of capacity to meet peak demand requirements beginning in 2021. This RFP will be used primarily to backfill a 480-megawatt seasonal exchange agreement, which expires in 2020. The RFP required proposals to be submitted by July 14, last month. APS is currently evaluating those proposals, and we expect to have a decision by the end of 2017. In closing, we continue to be well positioned for a very solid 2017. We're focused on completing our rate review filing and positioning the company to continue to grow to meet the increasing energy needs of our customers. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2017. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials for the second quarter of 2017, we earned $1.49 per share compared to $1.08 pressure in the second quarter of 2016. Slide 4 outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Total gross margin was up $0.27 per share compared with the second quarter of 2016, supported by stronger customer usage, favorable weather and higher transmission and loss fixed cost recovery revenues. Higher net sales in the second quarter of 2017 compared with the second quarter of 2016 increased earnings by $0.10 per share, which we believe reflects the improving economic conditions we are seeing locally. And I'll talk more about that in a moment, which was supported by 1.8% customer growth as well as higher average usage by our residential customers. Weather-normalized retail our sales were up 2.9% in the quarterly comparison, net of the impact of customer conservation energy efficiency programs and distributed renewable generation. Although we are pleased with the favorable sales growth we saw in the second quarter, year-to-date, through the end of June, sales were up 0.1% and we still expect that weather-normalized sales growth will fall within the range of about 0% to 1% for the year. Lower operations and maintenance expense contributed $0.14 per share in the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by less fossil generation plant outage activity during the current period. As you'll recall, we had a large plant outage at the Four Corners Power Plant in both the first and second quarters of 2016 as part of the plant's routine maintenance schedule. And keep in mind that we expect into the Four Corners in the second half of this year as we prepare for the installation of control equipment. Also want to note that the quarterly variance includes a charge related to the cancellation of capital projects at the Navajo Generating Station, which has an offsetting adjustment depreciation. On the topic of depreciation, higher D&A decreased earnings by $0.01 per share in the second quarter, primarily due to increased plant in service, partly offset by the Navajo plant item I just mentioned. Turning now to the Arizona economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. As seen on the upper panel on Slide 5, the Phoenix Metropolitan area continued to show job growth above the national average. Through May, employment in the Metro Phoenix area increased 2.4%, compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. This above-average job growth is driven largely by the financial services sector. The solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. Vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall and are at levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, about 2 million-square-foot of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in its residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel, Slide 5, housing construction is expected to continue to be upward post-recession trend. In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 5,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits for new single-family homes in March through May were at the highest level seen since August of 2007. One factor driving this increase is that Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. That activity in the market is providing meaningful support for home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow Metro Phoenix housing market and economy more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years. As I previously mentioned, reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.8% in the second quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals support future population job growth and economic development in the Arizona compared to the inflation. Finally, a quick update on our financing and guidance plans. We expect to issue about $650 million of additional long-term debt this year, 1 transaction at Pinnacle including the refinancing of $125 million term loan and 1 at APS. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong. We plan to issue earnings guidance for 2017 after the final approval of APS' pending rate review through a separate communication. However, to assist you with estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect in 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the Appendix to today's slides. We also plan to release 2018 ongoing guidance on our third quarter call consistent with our standard practice. This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

We continue to demonstrate operational excellence through the second quarter of 2017, and we remain well positioned for a solid year. Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. Two significant milestones in the APS rate review had been completed as we near the conclusion of that process. The hearing ended on May 2 and the administrative law judge issued a recommended order on July 26. The recommended order supports the settlement agreement without material modification, including the 10% return on equity; a $94.6 million base rate increase, which is the equivalent of an overall 3.3% bill increase; deferrals for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at Four Corners; and the Ocotillo Modernization Project, with a step increase in 2019 for the SCRs and moving the time of use window from noon to 7:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. The administrative law judge also recommended that the new rates go into effect on September 1. APS will file exceptions and clarifications to the recommended order tomorrow on August 4. The settlement agreement will bring about sustainable solar, a smarter energy infrastructure, a cleaner energy mix and more options for customers. The judge's recommendation to support the settlement agreement continues to move us in that direction. The final step in the rate review process is for the commission to vote at an upcoming open meeting. We view the progress to this point, including the judge's recommendation to approve the settlement, as very positive. With the anticipated conclusion of our rate review and the related imminent grandfathering deadline for net metering, we continue to see an increase in residential solar. In June, we received over 4,500 applications for solar interconnections, which is more than double the recent monthly average. As of July, there have been more than 62,000 residential TV installations in the APS service territory, totaling 483 megawatts. As you know, APS customers also receive solar power from the large Solana Generating Station and from 10 AZ Sun utility scale solar plants. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde generating station successfully completed a planned refueling outage for Unit 2 in less than 31 days, with no OSHA recordable injuries. The units operated at 93.1% capacity factor through the first half of the year. At our Four Corners Power Plant, the installation of new selective catalytic reduction equipment is more than 75% complete. The first unit with the new equipment will come online later this year and the second in early 2018. The 5 new fast start flexible generating units being installed at our Ocotillo plant are more than 60% complete, and all are expected to be in service by summer 2019. The Navajo Generating Station co-owners and the Navajo Nation agreed that the Navajo plant will remain in operation until December 2019. On June 26, the Navajo Nation council approved a replacement lease that will allow the plant to operate through 2019 and sets guidelines for decommissioning activities that will begin after 2019. Certain additional approvals are required, which are expected to occur by late 2017. Various stakeholders, including regulators, tribal representatives, the plant's coal supplier and the United States Department of the Interior have been meeting to determine if an alternative solution can be reached that would permit continued operation of the plant beyond 2019. On June 20, amidst a week long spell of temperatures ranging between 115 and 119 degrees, APS customers set an all-time record peak demand of 7,367 megawatts between the hours of 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. This record demand eclipsed the 11-year-old record of 7,236 megawatts set back in 2006. Allow me to expand on a few more observations about energy supply on that peak day, June 20. By 8:00 p.m. that evening, the system load was still within 6% of the record peak, demonstrating how energy demand remains very strong even after the sun goes down. Production from private rooftop solar had peaked at 1:00 p.m. that afternoon and was only producing 30% of its capacity during the 6:00 p.m. hour. Our growing customer demand and the misalignment between when our demand peak occurs and when rooftop solar produces the most energy, further demonstrates the need to continue grid enhancements, while adding peaking resources. 
Looking to our capital investment program. In June, the Daisy Mountain Substation came online, helping to provide strong reliability for a growing population north of the Phoenix Metropolitan area. The new system is 1 of over 2 prototype substations that incorporate self-correcting technology. As part of our continuing proactive approach to modernizing the grid, APS has implemented advanced technologies, completed multiple high-voltage transmission projects to further improve reliability and introduced new ways for customers to receive important energy usage information. This planned investment strategy helps to ensure we are able to meet our customers' increasing energy requirements. For our future resource needs, APS issued an RFP on April 12, seeking proposals for 400 to 700 megawatts of capacity to meet peak demand requirements beginning in 2021. This RFP will be used primarily to backfill a 480-megawatt seasonal exchange agreement, which expires in 2020. The RFP require proposals to be submitted by July 14, last month. APS is currently evaluating those proposals, and we expect to have a decision by the end of 2017. In closing, we continue to be well positioned for a very solid 2017. We're focused on completing our rate review filing and positioning the company to continue to grow to meet the increasing energy needs of our customers. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2017, we earned $1.49 per share com",916,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2017. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2017, we earned $1.49 per share compared to $1.08 pressure in the second quarter of 2016. Slide 4 outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Total gross margin was up $0.27 per share compared with the second quarter of 2016, supported by stronger customer usage, favorable weather and higher transmission and loss fixed cost recovery revenues. Higher net sales in the second quarter of 2017 compared with the second quarter of 2016 increased earnings by $0.10 per share, which we believe reflects the improving economic conditions we are seeing locally, and I'll talk about more on that in a moment, which was supported by 1.8% customer growth as well as higher average usage by our residential customers. Weather-normalized retail, our sales were up 2.9% in the quarterly comparison, net of the impact of customer conservation energy efficiency programs and distributed renewable generation. Although we are pleased with the favorable sales growth we saw in the second quarter, year-to-date, through the end of June, sales were up 0.1% and we still expect that weather-normalized sales growth will fall within the range of about 0% to 1% for the year. Lower operations and maintenance expense contributed $0.14 per share in the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by less fossil generation plant outage activity during the current period. As you recall, we had a large plant outage at the Four Corners Power Plant in both the first and second quarters of 2016 as part of the plant's routine maintenance schedule. And keep in mind that we expect extended outages at Four Corners in the second half of this year as we prepare for the installation of pollution control equipment. Also want to note that the quarterly O&M variance includes a charge related to the cancellation of capital projects at the Navajo Generating Station, which has an offsetting adjustment depreciation. On the topic of depreciation, higher D&A decreased earnings by $0.01 per share in the second quarter, primarily due to increased plant in service, partly offset by the Navajo plant item I just mentioned. 
Turning now to the Arizona's economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. As seen on the upper panel on Slide 5, the Phoenix Metropolitan area continued to show job growth above the national average. Through May, employment in the Metro Phoenix area increased 2.4%, compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. This above-average job growth is driven largely by the financial services sector. The solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. Vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall and at are levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, about 2 million-square-foot of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in its residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel on Slide 5, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 5,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits for new single-family homes in March through May were at their highest level seen since August of 2007. One factor driving this increase is that Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. That activity in the market is providing meaningful support for home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years. As I previously mentioned, reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.8% in the second quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals support future population, job growth, economic development in Arizona prepare to be in place. 
Finally, a quick update on our financing and guidance plans. We expect to issue about $650 million of additional long-term debt this year, 1 transaction at Pinnacle, including the refinancing of the $125 million term loan, and 1 at APS. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. We plan to issue earnings guidance for 2017 after the final approval of APS's pending rate review through a separate communication. However, to assist you with estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the Appendix to today's slides. We also plan to release 2018 ongoing guidance on our third quarter call consistent with our standard practice. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

We continue to demonstrate operational excellence through the second quarter of 2017, and we remain well positioned for a solid year. Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. Two significant milestones in the APS rate review had been completed as we near the conclusion of that process. The hearing ended on May 2 and the administrative law judge issued a recommended order on July 26. The recommended order supports the settlement agreement without material modification, including the 10% return on equity; a $94.6 million base rate increase, which is the equivalent of an overall 3.3% bill increase; deferrals for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at Four Corners; and the Ocotillo Modernization Project, with a step increase in 2019 for the SCRs and moving the time of use window from noon to 7:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. The administrative law judge also recommended that the new rates go into effect on September 1. APS will file exceptions and clarifications to the recommended order tomorrow on August 4. The settlement agreement will bring about sustainable solar, a smarter energy infrastructure, a cleaner energy mix and more options for customers. The judge's recommendation to support the settlement agreement continues to move us in that direction. The final step in the rate review process is for the commission to vote at an upcoming open meeting. We view the progress to this point, including the judge's recommendation to approve the settlement, as very positive. With the anticipated conclusion of our rate review and the related imminent grandfathering deadline for net metering, we continue to see an increase in residential solar. In June, we received over 4,500 applications for solar interconnections, which is more than double the recent monthly average. As of July, there have been more than 62,000 residential TV installations in the APS service territory, totaling 483 megawatts. As you know, APS customers also receive solar power from the large Solana Generating Station and from 10 AZ Sun utility scale solar plants. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde generating station successfully completed a planned refueling outage for Unit 2 in less than 31 days, with no OSHA recordable injuries. The units operated at 93.1% capacity factor through the first half of the year. At our Four Corners Power Plant, the installation of new selective catalytic reduction equipment is more than 75% complete. The first unit with the new equipment will come online later this year and the second in early 2018. The 5 new fast-start flexible generating units being installed at our Ocotillo plant are more than 60% complete, and all are expected to be in service by summer 2019. The Navajo Generating Station co-owners and the Navajo Nation agreed that the Navajo plant will remain in operation until December 2019. On June 26, the Navajo Nation council approved a replacement lease that will allow the plant to operate through 2019 and sets guidelines for decommissioning activities that will begin after 2019. Certain additional approvals are required, which are expected to occur by late 2017. Various stakeholders, including regulators, tribal representatives, the plant's coal supplier and the United States Department of the Interior have been meeting to determine if an alternative solution can be reached that would permit continued operation of the plant beyond 2019. On June 20, amidst a week long spell of temperatures ranging between 115 and 119 degrees, APS customers set an all-time record peak demand of 7,367 megawatts between the hours of 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. This record demand eclipsed the 11-year-old record of 7,236 megawatts set back in 2006. Allow me to expand on a few more observations about energy supply on that peak day, June 20. By 8:00 p.m. that evening, the system load was still within 6% of the record peak, demonstrating how energy demand remains very strong even after the sun goes down. Production from private rooftop solar had peaked at 1:00 p.m. that afternoon and was only producing 30% of its capacity during the 6:00 p.m. hour. Our growing customer demand and the misalignment between when our demand peak occurs and when rooftop solar produces the most energy, further demonstrates the need to continue grid enhancements, while adding peaking resources. 
Looking to our capital investment program. In June, the Daisy Mountain Substation came online, helping to provide strong reliability for a growing population north of the Phoenix Metropolitan area. The new system is 1 of over 2 prototype substations that incorporate self-correcting technology. As part of our continuing proactive approach to modernizing the grid, APS has implemented advanced technologies, completed multiple high-voltage transmission projects to further improve reliability and introduced new ways for customers to receive important energy usage information. This planned investment strategy helps to ensure we are able to meet our customers' increasing energy requirements. For our future resource needs, APS issued an RFP on April 12, seeking proposals for 400 to 700 megawatts of capacity to meet peak demand requirements beginning in 2021. This RFP will be used primarily to backfill a 480-megawatt seasonal exchange agreement, which expires in 2020. The RFP required proposals to be submitted by July 14, last month. APS is currently evaluating those proposals, and we expect to have a decision by the end of 2017. In closing, we continue to be well positioned for a very solid 2017. We're focused on completing our rate review filing and positioning the company to continue to grow to meet the increasing energy needs of our customers. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2017. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2017, we earned $1.49 per share com",918,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2017. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2017, we earned $1.49 per share compared to $1.08 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Slide 4 outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Total gross margin was up $0.27 per share compared with the second quarter of 2016, supported by stronger customer usage, favorable weather and higher transmission and loss fixed cost recovery revenues. Higher net sales in the second quarter of 2017 compared with the second quarter of 2016 increased earnings by $0.10 per share, which we believe reflects the improving economic conditions we are seeing locally, and I'll talk about more on that in a moment, which was supported by 1.8% customer growth as well as higher average usage by our residential customers. Weather-normalized retail, kilowatt-hour sales were up 2.9% in the quarterly comparison, net of the impact of customer conservation energy efficiency programs and distributed renewable generation. Although we are pleased with the favorable sales growth we saw in the second quarter, year-to-date, through the end of June, sales were up 0.1% and we still expect that weather-normalized sales growth will fall within the range of about 0% to 1% for the year. Lower operations and maintenance expense contributed $0.14 per share in the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by less fossil generation plant outage activity during the current period. As you recall, we had a large plant outage at the Four Corners Power Plant in both the first and second quarters of 2016 as part of the plant's routine maintenance schedule. And keep in mind that we expect extended outages at Four Corners in the second half of this year as we prepare for the installation of pollution control equipment. Also want to note that the quarterly O&M variance includes a charge related to the cancellation of capital projects at the Navajo Generating Station, which has an offsetting adjustment depreciation. On the topic of depreciation, higher D&A decreased earnings by $0.01 per share in the second quarter, primarily due to increased plant in service, partly offset by the Navajo plant item I just mentioned. 
Turning now to the Arizona's economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. As seen on the upper panel on Slide 5, the Phoenix Metropolitan area continued to show job growth above the national average. Through May, employment in the Metro Phoenix area increased 2.4%, compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. This above-average job growth is driven largely by the financial services sector. The solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. Vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall and at are levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, about 2 million-square-foot of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in its residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel on Slide 5, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 5,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits for new single-family homes in March through May were at their highest level seen since August of 2007. One factor driving this increase is that Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. That activity in the market is providing meaningful support for home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years. As I previously mentioned, reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.8% in the second quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals support future population, job growth, and economic development in Arizona prepare to be in place. 
Finally, a quick update on our financing and guidance plans. We expect to issue about $650 million of additional long-term debt this year, 1 transaction at Pinnacle, including the refinancing of the $125 million term loan, and 1 at APS. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. We plan to issue earnings guidance for 2017 after the final approval of APS's pending rate review through a separate communication. However, to assist you with estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the Appendix to today's slides. We also plan to release 2018 ongoing guidance on our third quarter call consistent with our standard practice. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

We continue to demonstrate operational excellence through the second quarter of 2017, and we remain well positioned for a solid year. Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. Two significant milestones in the APS rate review had been completed as we near the conclusion of that process. The hearing ended on May 2 and the administrative law judge issued a recommended order on July 26. The recommended order supports the settlement agreement without material modification, including the 10% return on equity; a $94.6 million base rate increase, which is the equivalent of an overall 3.3% bill increase; deferrals for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at Four Corners; and the Ocotillo Modernization Project, with a step increase in 2019 for the SCRs and moving the time of use window from noon to 7:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. The administrative law judge also recommended that the new rates go into effect on September 1. APS will file exceptions and clarifications to the recommended order tomorrow on August 4. The settlement agreement will bring about sustainable solar, a smarter energy infrastructure, a cleaner energy mix and more options for customers. The judge's recommendation to support the settlement agreement continues to move us in that direction. The final step in the rate review process is for the commission to vote at an upcoming open meeting. We view the progress to this point, including the judge's recommendation to approve the settlement, as very positive. With the anticipated conclusion of our rate review and the related imminent grandfathering deadline for net metering, we continue to see an increase in residential solar. In June, we received over 4,500 applications for solar interconnections, which is more than double the recent monthly average. As of July, there have been more than 62,000 residential TV installations in the APS service territory, totaling 483 megawatts. As you know, APS customers also receive solar power from the large Solana Generating Station and from 10 AZ Sun utility scale solar plants. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde generating station successfully completed a planned refueling outage for Unit 2 in less than 31 days, with no OSHA recordable injuries. The units operated at 93.1% capacity factor through the first half of the year. At our Four Corners Power Plant, the installation of new selective catalytic reduction equipment is more than 75% complete. The first unit with the new equipment will come online later this year and the second in early 2018. The 5 new fast-start flexible generating units being installed at our Ocotillo plant are more than 60% complete, and all are expected to be in service by summer 2019. The Navajo Generating Station co-owners and the Navajo Nation agreed that the Navajo plant will remain in operation until December 2019. On June 26, the Navajo Nation council approved a replacement lease that will allow the plant to operate through 2019 and sets guidelines for decommissioning activities that will begin after 2019. Certain additional approvals are required, which are expected to occur by late 2017. Various stakeholders, including regulators, tribal representatives, the plant's coal supplier and the United States Department of the Interior have been meeting to determine if an alternative solution can be reached that would permit continued operation of the plant beyond 2019. On June 20, amidst a week long spell of temperatures ranging between 115 and 119 degrees, APS customers set an all-time record peak demand of 7,367 megawatts between the hours of 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. This record demand eclipsed the 11-year-old record of 7,236 megawatts set back in 2006. Allow me to expand on a few more observations about energy supply on that peak day, June 20. By 8:00 p.m. that evening, the system load was still within 6% of the record peak, demonstrating how energy demand remains very strong even after the sun goes down. Production from private rooftop solar had peaked at 1:00 p.m. that afternoon and was only producing 30% of its capacity during the 6:00 p.m. hour. Our growing customer demand and the misalignment between when our demand peak occurs and when rooftop solar produces the most energy, further demonstrates the need to continue grid enhancements, while adding peaking resources. 
Looking to our capital investment program. In June, the Daisy Mountain Substation came online, helping to provide strong reliability for a growing population north of the Phoenix Metropolitan area. The new system is 1 of over 2 prototype substations that incorporate self-correcting technology. As part of our continuing proactive approach to modernizing the grid, APS has implemented advanced technologies, completed multiple high-voltage transmission projects to further improve reliability and introduced new ways for customers to receive important energy usage information. This planned investment strategy helps to ensure we are able to meet our customers' increasing energy requirements. For our future resource needs, APS issued an RFP on April 12, seeking proposals for 400 to 700 megawatts of capacity to meet peak demand requirements beginning in 2021. This RFP will be used primarily to backfill a 480-megawatt seasonal exchange agreement, which expires in 2020. The RFP required proposals to be submitted by July 14, last month. APS is currently evaluating those proposals, and we expect to have a decision by the end of 2017. In closing, we continue to be well positioned for a very solid 2017. We're focused on completing our rate review filing and positioning the company to continue to grow to meet the increasing energy needs of our customers. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2017, we earned $1.49 per share com",918,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2017. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2017, we earned $1.49 per share compared to $1.08 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Slide 4 outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Total gross margin was up $0.27 per share compared with the second quarter of 2016, supported by stronger customer usage, favorable weather and higher transmission and loss fixed cost recovery revenues. Higher net sales in the second quarter of 2017 compared with the second quarter of 2016 increased earnings by $0.10 per share, which we believe reflects the improving economic conditions we are seeing locally, and I'll talk about more on that in a moment, which was supported by 1.8% customer growth as well as higher average usage by our residential customers. Weather-normalized retail, kilowatt-hour sales were up 2.9% in the quarterly comparison, net of the impact of customer conservation energy efficiency programs and distributed renewable generation. Although we are pleased with the favorable sales growth we saw in the second quarter, year-to-date, through the end of June, sales were up 0.1% and we still expect that weather-normalized sales growth will fall within the range of about 0% to 1% for the year. Lower operations and maintenance expense contributed $0.14 per share in the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by less fossil generation plant outage activity during the current period. As you recall, we had a large plant outage at the Four Corners Power Plant in both the first and second quarters of 2016 as part of the plant's routine maintenance schedule. And keep in mind that we expect extended outages at Four Corners in the second half of this year as we prepare for the installation of pollution control equipment. Also want to note that the quarterly O&M variance includes a charge related to the cancellation of capital projects at the Navajo Generating Station, which has an offsetting adjustment depreciation. On the topic of depreciation, higher D&A decreased earnings by $0.01 per share in the second quarter, primarily due to increased plant in service, partly offset by the Navajo plant item I just mentioned. 
Turning now to the Arizona's economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. As seen on the upper panel on Slide 5, the Phoenix Metropolitan area continued to show job growth above the national average. Through May, employment in the Metro Phoenix area increased 2.4%, compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. This above-average job growth is driven largely by the financial services sector. The solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. Vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall and at are levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, about 2 million-square-foot of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in its residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel on Slide 5, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 5,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits for new single-family homes in March through May were at their highest level seen since August of 2007. One factor driving this increase is that Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. That activity in the market is providing meaningful support for home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years. As I previously mentioned, reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.8% in the second quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals support future population, job growth, and economic development in Arizona prepare to be in place. 
Finally, a quick update on our financing and guidance plans. We expect to issue about $650 million of additional long-term debt this year, 1 transaction at Pinnacle, including the refinancing of the $125 million term loan, and 1 at APS. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. We plan to issue earnings guidance for 2017 after the final approval of APS's pending rate review through a separate communication. However, to assist you with estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the Appendix to today's slides. We also plan to release 2018 ongoing guidance on our third quarter call consistent with our standard practice. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

This year continued to be in line with our expectations and keeps on pace with our full year guidance. Although we experienced milder weather compared to normal during September, our positive customer growth, ample investment opportunities and disciplined cost management continued to support our ability to meet financial commitments. Just last month, our board also approved a 6.1% dividend increase, demonstrating the confidence our board and our management team have in our ability to maintain sustainable growth. Before Jim discusses the details of our third quarter results, I'll provide several updates on recent regulatory and operational developments. Our rate review concluded on August 15 with on a corporation commission voting to approve our settlement agreement without material modifications, including a 10% return on equity; and a $94.6 million base rate increase, which results in an overall 3.3% customer bill increase. New rates went into effect on August 19. The successful rate review outcome continues to demonstrate Arizona's constructive regulatory environment. On September 1, we filed our proposed 2018 demand site management, or DSM, plan with the corporation commission. The 2018 DSM plan shifts focus to better align with our changing resource needs. The plan moves away from incentives, where savings no longer aligned with the system needs. It also introduces new programs to shift customer usage to the middle of the day, when solar resources are abundant and energy is less expensive. For example, the 2018 DSM plan includes a pilot proposal to electrify school buses and provide charging infrastructure. We believe an electrifying vehicle fleets is a win-win solution, utilizing excess power generated by solar during the middle of the day, while effectively reducing carbon emissions in a cost-efficient manner. To further address excess mid-day power, the 2018 DSM plan also includes an innovative reversed demand response pilot, allowing customers to take advantage of negative pricing events. Further recognizing the growing market for electric vehicles, for 2018, DSM plan includes a managed EV charging pilot program for electric fleets, workplaces and multi-family housing locations. And charging stations would be utility-controlled and available to provide demand response and load-shifting capabilities. The shift in energy efficiency towards a strategic focus on managing peak demand allows customers to save money by encouraging usage during periods where energy is less expensive. From an operational perspective, this shift helps address our overgeneration challenges in the middle of the day. In addition, it plays a key role in providing environmental benefits by allowing us to more fully utilize 0 or low-carbon resources. 
Turning to our operations. Our employees once again did an excellent job, maintaining the generation fleet and electric grid this summer. The Palo Verde generating station performed well, with all 3 units operating at a combined capacity factor of 99.4%. Also, unit 1 at Palo Verde ended its plan refueling outage on October 7. In September, 4 corners began a 95-day plant outage on unit 5. During the outage, we will tie in with selective catalytic reduction equipment referred to as SCRs. A second 95 date planned outage will result -- will occur in early 2018 to repeat the process for 4 corners unit #4. The SCR will be installed and 4 corners will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 80%. APS customers have benefited from savings of $30 million in the company's first year in the Western regional energy imbalance market. Our EIM participation has allowed us to garner efficiencies by decreasing production costs, lowering the cost of integrating renewable resources and taking advantage of negatively priced power from other seats. The summer of 2017, also, we wrote APS energy records, an all-time peak usage record and new technology defined the season. On the technology front, we experienced our first summer with a newly-implemented advanced distribution management system, or ADMS. And ADMS provides grid operators increase visibility of our system and the ability to remotely control a greater portions of the distribution grid across the state. And this ability played an important role in in APS' response to monsoon storms over the course of the summer. And with our operating system and other grid-enhancing technology, APS is positioned to meet the evolving needs and expectations of our customers. Our capital investment program continues to be robust and is focused on flexible generation, new grid technology and advancing core utility operations. We are progressing on the installation of 5 new fast-start, flexible generating units at the Ocotillo power plant. Also, in middle of rebuilding about 20 miles of poles and wires and rulers on Arizona. We'll be installing a battery storage system to meet the area's growing demand for electricity. Construction on our new 8-megawatt hour battery storage project will begin in early November and is expected to be operational early next year. We also installed 2 battery storage units in the West Valley in December, 2016, as part of the solar partner program, and we're installing for storage opportunities. These innovative projects are indicative of the type of grid we envisioned for customers: smart, multifunctional and a platform for additional customer-cited technology. Looking forward, our long-term strategic plan positions us well to capitalize on new investment opportunities. Our fundamentals and our expectation for growth remain unchanged. And the recent dividend increase reinforces the boards' and management's confidence and our ability to execute and deliver value to our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

And thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call.

And thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. Today, I'll discuss the details for our third quarter financial results, provide an update on Arizona economy and review our financial outlook, including introducing 2018 guidance. This morning, reported our financial results for the third quarter 2017 which were in line with expectations. As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2017, we earned $2.46 per share compared to $2.35 per share in the third quarter of 2016. Slide 4 outlines the vacancies that drove -- the variances that drove the changes in our currently ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Gross margin was up $0.22 per share in the third quarter this year compared to last year by several factors. The rate increase approved by the commission in ADS' rate case proceeding which became effective August 19, improved those margins by $0.13 per share; higher sales in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 increased earnings by $0.02 per share, driven by customer growth, partly offset by the effects of energy efficiency and the disputed generation. As a matter of fact, the -- $0.02 per share. Accrued were higher in the third quarter this year compared to last year, although whether the 2016 and 2017 third quarters was less favorable than senior averages. Higher operations and maintenance decreased earnings by $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to an increase in employee benefit costs. We also have had higher plant outage cost related to the beginning stages of the SCR installation of 4 corners unit 5. Depreciation and amortization spent is higher in the third quarter of 2017 compared to -- to third quarter of 2016 impacting earnings by $0.07 per share. The increase was primarily driven related to additions and the $61 million annual increase in DNA rates -- in the rate case. Looking next to Arizona's economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis. I'll cover some of the trends we are seeing on the local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth of about the national average. Through August, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2% compared to 1.5% for the entire U.S. The above-average growth is broad-based and driven largely by tourism, health care, manufacturing, finance and construction. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate of 4.3% also reflects a strength of the job market. Job growth continued to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area commercial and residential real estate markets. As seen on the upper of Slide 5, vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall or at the levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, about 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect the continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 5, housing construction is expected to continue the upwards, trend. In 2017, houses are expected to increase by about 2,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits of single-family homes in the third quarter was the highest levels since 2006. One factor driving this increase is that Maricopa County was the fastest-growing County in the U.S. in 2016. We had activity on the market is providing meaningful support to home prices, which returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth and low mortgage rates can allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and it's more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years. Reflecting the steady improvement in the economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.9% of the third quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. Finally, I will review our financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On September 11, APS issued $300 million of 10-year 2.95% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds will be used to refinance commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash used to fund capital expenditures. Overall, our balance sheet in the quarter remain strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West and APS had approximately $100 million and $32 million of short-term debt outstanding, respectively. As Don discussed, in October, the Board of Directors increased annual dividend by $0.16 per share or approximately 6% to $2.78 per share effective with the December payments. Turning to guidance. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2017 will be in the range of $4.15 to $4.36 per share. be the remainder of the year include the impact from our rate case, entire O&Ms as we complete the plant outage at Four Corners. The extended plant outage at Four Corners is why earnings in the fourth quarter of this year are expected to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2016. We are also introducing 2018 ongoing guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share, which includes an increase in our weather-normalized sales forecast to 0.5% to 1.5%. The rate increase, our adjustment mechanisms and sales growth will be important gross margin drivers, with -- we expect will be partially offset by higher plant outage cost and higher other operating expenses relating to more plant service, including higher G&A and property tax. We've also increased our 2018 capital expenditures growth by approximately $40 million, mainly from reliability-related projects. We have higher cost possible planned outages in 2018 to including the 95-day ACR installation at Four Corners unit 4. We also have planned outages at gas plant, including Redhawk. Nick has said our gas plant is based on 1 hours and starts. Our participation in the energy and balance market increasing levels of solar generation and low gas prices combined with the result and more starts in many of our plants. We added -- we'll continue to plant to operate our business for long-term success, but we continue to [indiscernible] managed costs in a stable manner. In 2018, there are larger than normal number of planned outages will provide the maintenance to continue operating or diversified fleet with a high level of reliability our customers expect. We also believe that thoughtful and well-executed preventive maintenance can limit more costly emergent work in the future. We will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlining our 2017 and 2018 guidance in the appendix to today's slides. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% through 2019, and this growth takes annualized consolidated return on common equity at more than 9.5% over the same time last year. The combination of modest customer growth supported by robust economic development activity, investment capital investments and renewable resources sets and we modernizations, together with its constructive and predatory combination of, we believe we are well-positioned to continuing Orth record of success. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

This year continues to be in line with our expectations and keeps us on pace with our full year guidance. Although we experienced milder weather compared to normal during September, our positive customer growth, ample investment opportunities and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet financial commitments. Just last month, our board also approved a 6.1% dividend increase, demonstrating the confidence our board and our management team have in our ability to maintain sustainable growth. Before Jim discusses the details of our third quarter results, I'll provide several updates on recent regulatory and operational developments. Our rate review concluded on August 15 [indiscernible] on a corporation commission voting to approve our settlement agreement without material modifications, including a 10% return on equity; and a $94.6 million base rate increase, which results in an overall 3.3% customer bill increase. New rates went into effect on August 19. The successful rate review outcome continues to demonstrate Arizona's constructive regulatory environment. On September 1, we filed our proposed 2018 demand side management, or DSM, plan with the corporation commission. The 2018 DSM plan shifts focus to better align with our changing resource needs. The plan moves away from incentives, where savings no longer align with system needs. It also introduces new programs to shift customer usage to the middle of the day, when solar resources are abundant and energy is less expensive. For example, the 2018 DSM plan includes a pilot proposal to electrify school buses and provide charging infrastructure. We believe electrifying vehicle fleets is a win-win solution, utilizing excess power generated by solar during the middle of the day while effectively reducing carbon emissions in a cost-efficient manner. To further address excess mid-day power, the 2018 DSM plan also includes an innovative reverse demand response pilot, allowing customers to take advantage of negative pricing events. Further recognizing the growing market for electric vehicles, for 2018, DSM plan includes a managed EV charging pilot program for electric fleets, workplaces and multi-family housing locations. And charging stations would be utility-controlled and available to provide demand response and load-shifting capabilities. The shift in energy efficiency towards a strategic focus on managing peak demand allows customers to save money by encouraging usage during periods when energy is less expensive. From an operational perspective, this shift helps address our overgeneration challenges in the middle of the day. In addition, it plays a key role in providing environmental benefits by allowing us to more fully utilize 0 or low-carbon resources. 
Turning to our operations. Our employees once again did an excellent job, maintaining the generation fleet and electric grid this summer. The Palo Verde generating station performed well, with all 3 units operating at a combined capacity factor of 99.4%. Also, Unit 1 at Palo Verde ended its planned refueling outage on October 7. In September, Four Corners began a 95-day planned outage on Unit 5. During the outage, we will tie in with selective catalytic reduction equipment referred to as SCRs. A second 95-day planned outage will result -- will occur in early 2018 to repeat the process for Four Corners Unit #4. The SCR being installed at Four Corners will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 80%. APS customers have benefited from savings of $30 million in the company's first year in the Western regional energy imbalance market. Our EIM participation has allowed us to garner efficiencies by decreasing production costs, lowering the cost of integrating renewable resources and taking advantage of negatively priced power from other states. The summer of 2017 also rewrote APS energy records, an all-time peak usage record and new technology defined the season. On the technology front, we experienced our first summer with the newly-implemented advanced distribution management system, or ADMS. And ADMS provides grid operators increased visibility of our system and the ability to remotely control greater portions of a distribution grid across the state. And this ability played an important role in APS' response to monsoon storms over the course of the summer. And with our operating system and other grid-enhancing technology, APS is positioned to meet the evolving needs and expectations of our customers. Our capital investment program continues to be robust and is focused on flexible generation, new grid technology and advancing core utility operations. We are progressing on the installation of 5 new fast-start, flexible generating units at the Ocotillo power plant. Also, in lieu of rebuilding about 20 miles of poles and wires in rural Arizona, we will be installing a battery storage system to meet the area's growing demand for electricity. Construction on our new 8-megawatt hour battery storage project will begin in early November and is expected to be operational early next year. We also installed 2 battery storage units in the West Valley in December 2016, as part of the Solar Partner Program, and we're exploring additional storage opportunities. These innovative projects are indicative of the type of grid we envision for customers: smart, multifunctional and a platform for additional customer-cited technology. Looking forward, our long-term strategic plan positions us well to capitalize on new investment opportunities. Our fundamentals and our expectation for growth remain unchanged. And the recent dividend increase reinforces the boards' and management's confidence in our ability to execute and deliver value to our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

And thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. Today, I'll discuss the details for our third quarter financial results, provide an update on Arizona economy and review our financial outlook, including introducing 2018 guidance.",1267,"Thank you, Don. And thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. Today, I'll discuss the details for our third quarter financial results, provide an update on Arizona economy and review our financial outlook, including introducing 2018 guidance. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2017 which were in line with expectations. As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2017, we earned $2.46 per share compared to $2.35 per share in the third quarter of 2016. Slide 4 outlines the vacancies that drove -- the variances that drove the changes in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Gross margin was up $0.22 per share in the third quarter this year compared to last year supported by several factors: the rate increase approved by the commission in ADS' rate case proceeding, which became effective August 19, improved gross margins by $0.13 per share; higher sales in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 increased earnings by $0.02 per share, driven by customer growth, partly offset by the effects of energy efficiency and distributed generation; the net effect of weather variations added $0.02 per share. Cooling degree days were higher in the third quarter this year compared to last year, although weather on both the 2016 and 2017 third quarters were less favorable than the 10-year averages. Higher operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to an increase in employee benefit costs. We also had a higher planned outage cost related to the beginning stages of the SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 5. Depreciation and amortization expense is a little higher in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016, impacting earnings by $0.07 per share. The increase was primarily driven -- related to plant additions and the $61 million annual increase in D&A rates accrued in the rate case. Looking next to Arizona's economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis. I'll cover some of the trends we are seeing on the local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average. Through August, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2% compared to 1.5% for the entire U.S. The above-average job growth is broad based and driven largely by tourism, health care, manufacturing, finance and construction. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate of 4.3% also reflects the strength of the job market. This job growth continued to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area commercial and residential real estate markets. As seen on the upper panel of Slide 5, vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall and are at the levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, about 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 5, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 2,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits from the single-family homes in the third quarter were the highest levels seen since 2006. One factor driving this increase is that Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. The activity in the market is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the county more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years. Reflecting a steady improvement in the economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.9% in the third quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. Finally, I will review our financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On September 11, APS issued $300 million of 10-year 2.95% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds were use to finance -- refinance commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West and APS had approximately $100 million and $32 million of short-term debt outstanding, respectively. As Don discussed, in October, the Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend by $0.16 per share or approximately 6% to $2.78 per share effective with the December payments. Turning to guidance. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2017 will be in the range of $4.15 to $4.36 per share. Key drivers for the remainder of the year include impact from our rate case and higher O&Ms as we complete the plant outage at Four Corners. The extended planned outage at Four Corners is why earnings in the fourth quarter of this year are expected to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2016. We are also introducing 2018 ongoing guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share, which includes an increase in our weather-normalized sales forecast to 0.5% to 1.5%. The rate increase, our adjustment mechanisms and sales growth will be important gross margin drivers, with -- we expect will be partially offset by higher fossil plant outage cost and higher other operating expenses related to more plant in service, including higher D&A and property tax. We have also increased our 2018 capital expenditure growth cap by approximately $40 million, mainly from reliability-related projects. We have higher fossil plant outage cost in 2018, including the 95-day SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 4. We also have planned outages at gas plants, including Redhawk. Maintenance at our gas plant is based on [ run hours ] and starts. Our participation in the Energy Imbalance Market, increasing levels of solar generation and low gas prices, combined, have resulted in more starts at many of our plants. We added -- we'll continue to plan to operate our business for long-term success, and we continue [indiscernible] to managed costs in a sustainable manner. In 2018, the larger than normal number of planned outages will provide the necessary maintenance to continue operating our diversified fleet with the high level of reliability our customers expect. We also believe that thoughtful and well-executed preventive maintenance can limit more costly emergent work in the future. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlining our 2017 and 2018 guidance in the appendix to today's slides. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% through 2019, and we still expect to achieve an annualized consolidated earn -- return on average common equity of more than 9.5% over the same time horizon. The combination of modest customer growth supported by robust economic development activity, extensive capital investments opportunities and renewable resources, technology and grid modernizations, together with a constructive and forward-thinking regulatory commission, we believe we are well positioned to continue our track record of success. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

This year continues to be in line with our expectations and keeps us on pace with our full year guidance. Although we experienced milder weather compared to normal during September, our positive customer growth, ample investment opportunities and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet financial commitments. Just last month, our board also approved a 6.1% dividend increase, demonstrating the confidence our board and our management team have in our ability to maintain sustainable growth. Before Jim discusses the details of our third quarter results, I'll provide several updates on recent regulatory and operational developments. Our rate review concluded on August 15 [indiscernible] on a corporation commission voting to approve our settlement agreement without material modifications, including a 10% return on equity; and a $94.6 million base rate increase, which results in an overall 3.3% customer bill increase. New rates went into effect on August 19. The successful rate review outcome continues to demonstrate Arizona's constructive regulatory environment. On September 1, we filed our proposed 2018 demand side management, or DSM, plan with the corporation commission. The 2018 DSM plan shifts focus to better align with our changing resource needs. The plan moves away from incentives, where savings no longer align with system needs. It also introduces new programs to shift customer usage to the middle of the day, when solar resources are abundant and energy is less expensive. For example, the 2018 DSM plan includes a pilot proposal to electrify school buses and provide charging infrastructure. We believe electrifying vehicle fleets is a win-win solution, utilizing excess power generated by solar during the middle of the day while effectively reducing carbon emissions in a cost-efficient manner. To further address excess mid-day power, the 2018 DSM plan also includes an innovative reverse demand response pilot, allowing customers to take advantage of negative pricing events. Further recognizing the growing market for electric vehicles, for 2018, DSM plan includes a managed EV charging pilot program for electric fleets, workplaces and multi-family housing locations. And charging stations would be utility-controlled and available to provide demand response and load-shifting capabilities. The shift in energy efficiency towards a strategic focus on managing peak demand allows customers to save money by encouraging usage during periods when energy is less expensive. From an operational perspective, this shift helps address our overgeneration challenges in the middle of the day. In addition, it plays a key role in providing environmental benefits by allowing us to more fully utilize 0 or low-carbon resources. 
Turning to our operations. Our employees once again did an excellent job, maintaining the generation fleet and electric grid this summer. The Palo Verde generating station performed well, with all 3 units operating at a combined capacity factor of 99.4%. Also, Unit 1 at Palo Verde ended its planned refueling outage on October 7. In September, Four Corners began a 95-day planned outage on Unit 5. During the outage, we will tie in with selective catalytic reduction equipment referred to as SCRs. A second 95-day planned outage will result -- will occur in early 2018 to repeat the process for Four Corners Unit #4. The SCR being installed at Four Corners will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 80%. APS customers have benefited from savings of $30 million in the company's first year in the Western regional energy imbalance market. Our EIM participation has allowed us to garner efficiencies by decreasing production costs, lowering the cost of integrating renewable resources and taking advantage of negatively priced power from other states. The summer of 2017 also rewrote APS energy records, an all-time peak usage record and new technology defined the season. On the technology front, we experienced our first summer with the newly-implemented advanced distribution management system, or ADMS. And ADMS provides grid operators increased visibility of our system and the ability to remotely control greater portions of a distribution grid across the state. And this ability played an important role in APS' response to monsoon storms over the course of the summer. And with our operating system and other grid-enhancing technology, APS is positioned to meet the evolving needs and expectations of our customers. Our capital investment program continues to be robust and is focused on flexible generation, new grid technology and advancing core utility operations. We are progressing on the installation of 5 new fast-start, flexible generating units at the Ocotillo power plant. Also, in lieu of rebuilding about 20 miles of poles and wires in rural Arizona, we will be installing a battery storage system to meet the area's growing demand for electricity. Construction on our new 8-megawatt hour battery storage project will begin in early November and is expected to be operational early next year. We also installed 2 battery storage units in the West Valley in December 2016, as part of the Solar Partner Program, and we're exploring additional storage opportunities. These innovative projects are indicative of the type of grid we envision for customers: smart, multifunctional and a platform for additional customer-cited technology. Looking forward, our long-term strategic plan positions us well to capitalize on new investment opportunities. Our fundamentals and our expectation for growth remain unchanged. And the recent dividend increase reinforces the boards' and management's confidence in our ability to execute and deliver value to our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

And thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. Today, I'll discuss the details for our third quarter financial results, provide an update on Arizona economy and review our financial outlook, including introducing 2018 guidance.",1267,"Thank you, Don. And thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. Today, I'll discuss the details for our third quarter financial results, provide an update on Arizona economy and review our financial outlook, including introducing 2018 guidance. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2017 which were in line with expectations. As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2017, we earned $2.46 per share compared to $2.35 per share in the third quarter of 2016. Slide 4 outlines the vacancies that drove -- the variances that drove the changes in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Gross margin was up $0.22 per share in the third quarter this year compared to last year supported by several factors: the rate increase approved by the commission in ADS' rate case proceeding, which became effective August 19, improved gross margins by $0.13 per share; higher sales in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 increased earnings by $0.02 per share, driven by customer growth, partly offset by the effects of energy efficiency and distributed generation; the net effect of weather variations added $0.02 per share. Cooling degree days were higher in the third quarter this year compared to last year, although weather on both the 2016 and 2017 third quarters were less favorable than the 10-year averages. Higher operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to an increase in employee benefit costs. We also had a higher planned outage cost related to the beginning stages of the SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 5. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016, impacting earnings by $0.07 per share. The increase was primarily driven -- related to plant additions and the $61 million annual increase in D&A rates accrued in the rate case. Looking next to Arizona's economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis. I'll cover some of the trends we are seeing on the local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average. Through August, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2% compared to 1.5% for the entire U.S. The above-average job growth is broad based and driven largely by tourism, health care, manufacturing, finance and construction. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate of 4.3% also reflects the strength of the job market. This sort of job growth continued to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area commercial and residential real estate markets. As seen on the upper panel of Slide 5, vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall and are at the levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, about 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 5, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 2,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits from the single-family homes in the third quarter were the highest levels seen since 2006. One factor driving this increase is that Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. The activity in the market is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the county more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years. Reflecting a steady improvement in the economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.9% in the third quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. Finally, I will review our financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On September 11, APS issued $300 million of 10-year 2.95% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds were use to finance -- refinance commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West and APS had approximately $100 million and $32 million of short-term debt outstanding, respectively. As Don discussed, in October, the Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend by $0.16 per share or approximately 6% to $2.78 per share effective with the December payments. Turning to guidance. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2017 will be in the range of $4.15 to $4.36 per share. Key drivers for the remainder of the year include impact from our rate case and higher O&Ms as we complete the plant outage at Four Corners. The extended planned outage at Four Corners is why earnings in the fourth quarter of this year are expected to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2016. We are also introducing 2018 ongoing guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share, which includes an increase in our weather-normalized sales forecast to 0.5% to 1.5%. The rate increase, our adjustment mechanisms and sales growth will be important gross margin drivers, with -- we expect will be partially offset by higher fossil plant outage cost and higher other operating expenses related to more plant in service, including higher D&A and property tax. We have also increased our 2018 capital expenditure growth cap by approximately $40 million, mainly from reliability-related projects. We have higher fossil plant outage cost in 2018, including the 95-day SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 4. We also have planned outages at gas plants, including Redhawk. Maintenance at our gas plant is based on [ run hours ] and starts. Our participation in the Energy Imbalance Market, increasing levels of solar generation and low gas prices, combined, have resulted in more starts at many of our plants. We added -- we'll continue to plan to operate our business for long-term success, and we continuously strive to manage costs in a sustainable manner. In 2018, the larger than normal number of planned outages will provide the necessary maintenance to continue operating our diversified fleet with the high level of reliability our customers expect. We also believe that thoughtful and well-executed preventive maintenance can limit more costly emergent work in the future. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlining our 2017 and 2018 guidance in the appendix to today's slides. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% through 2019, and we still expect to achieve an annualized consolidated earn -- return on average common equity of more than 9.5% over the same time horizon. The combination of modest customer growth supported by robust economic development activity, extensive capital investments opportunities and renewable resources, technology and grid modernizations, together with a constructive and forward-thinking regulatory commission, we believe we are well positioned to continue our track record of success. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

296957,539334031,1334015,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2017",2017-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stefanie, and thank you all for joining us today.

This year continues to be in line with our expectations and keeps us on pace with our full year guidance. Although we experienced milder weather compared to normal during September, our positive customer growth, ample investment opportunities and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet financial commitments. Just last month, our board also approved a 6.1% dividend increase, demonstrating the confidence our board and our management team have in our ability to maintain sustainable growth. Before Jim discusses the details of our third quarter results, I'll provide several updates on recent regulatory and operational developments. Our rate review concluded on August 15 [indiscernible] on a corporation commission voting to approve our settlement agreement without material modifications, including a 10% return on equity; and a $94.6 million base rate increase, which results in an overall 3.3% customer bill increase. New rates went into effect on August 19. The successful rate review outcome continues to demonstrate Arizona's constructive regulatory environment. On September 1, we filed our proposed 2018 demand side management, or DSM, plan with the corporation commission. The 2018 DSM plan shifts focus to better align with our changing resource needs. The plan moves away from incentives, where savings no longer align with system needs. It also introduces new programs to shift customer usage to the middle of the day, when solar resources are abundant and energy is less expensive. For example, the 2018 DSM plan includes a pilot proposal to electrify school buses and provide charging infrastructure. We believe electrifying vehicle fleets is a win-win solution, utilizing excess power generated by solar during the middle of the day while effectively reducing carbon emissions in a cost-efficient manner. To further address excess mid-day power, the 2018 DSM plan also includes an innovative reverse demand response pilot, allowing customers to take advantage of negative pricing events. Further recognizing the growing market for electric vehicles, for 2018, DSM plan includes a managed EV charging pilot program for electric fleets, workplaces and multi-family housing locations. And charging stations would be utility-controlled and available to provide demand response and load-shifting capabilities. The shift in energy efficiency towards a strategic focus on managing peak demand allows customers to save money by encouraging usage during periods when energy is less expensive. From an operational perspective, this shift helps address our overgeneration challenges in the middle of the day. In addition, it plays a key role in providing environmental benefits by allowing us to more fully utilize 0 or low-carbon resources. 
Turning to our operations. Our employees once again did an excellent job, maintaining the generation fleet and electric grid this summer. The Palo Verde generating station performed well, with all 3 units operating at a combined capacity factor of 99.4%. Also, Unit 1 at Palo Verde ended its planned refueling outage on October 7. In September, Four Corners began a 95-day planned outage on Unit 5. During the outage, we will tie in with selective catalytic reduction equipment referred to as SCRs. A second 95-day planned outage will result -- will occur in early 2018 to repeat the process for Four Corners Unit #4. The SCR being installed at Four Corners will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 80%. APS customers have benefited from savings of $30 million in the company's first year in the Western regional energy imbalance market. Our EIM participation has allowed us to garner efficiencies by decreasing production costs, lowering the cost of integrating renewable resources and taking advantage of negatively priced power from other states. The summer of 2017 also rewrote APS energy records, an all-time peak usage record and new technology defined the season. On the technology front, we experienced our first summer with the newly-implemented advanced distribution management system, or ADMS. And ADMS provides grid operators increased visibility of our system and the ability to remotely control greater portions of a distribution grid across the state. And this ability played an important role in APS' response to monsoon storms over the course of the summer. And with our operating system and other grid-enhancing technology, APS is positioned to meet the evolving needs and expectations of our customers. Our capital investment program continues to be robust and is focused on flexible generation, new grid technology and advancing core utility operations. We are progressing on the installation of 5 new fast-start, flexible generating units at the Ocotillo power plant. Also, in lieu of rebuilding about 20 miles of poles and wires in rural Arizona, we will be installing a battery storage system to meet the area's growing demand for electricity. Construction on our new 8-megawatt hour battery storage project will begin in early November and is expected to be operational early next year. We also installed 2 battery storage units in the West Valley in December 2016, as part of the Solar Partner Program, and we're exploring additional storage opportunities. These innovative projects are indicative of the type of grid we envision for customers: smart, multifunctional and a platform for additional customer-cited technology. Looking forward, our long-term strategic plan positions us well to capitalize on new investment opportunities. Our fundamentals and our expectation for growth remain unchanged. And the recent dividend increase reinforces the boards' and management's confidence in our ability to execute and deliver value to our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

And thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. Today, I'll discuss the details for our third quarter financial results, provide an update on Arizona economy and review our financial outlook, including introducing 2018 guidance.",1267,"Thank you, Don. And thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. Today, I'll discuss the details for our third quarter financial results, provide an update on Arizona economy and review our financial outlook, including introducing 2018 guidance. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2017 which were in line with expectations. As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2017, we earned $2.46 per share compared to $2.35 per share in the third quarter of 2016. Slide 4 outlines the vacancies that drove -- the variances that drove the changes in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Gross margin was up $0.22 per share in the third quarter this year compared to last year supported by several factors: the rate increase approved by the commission in ADS' rate case proceeding, which became effective August 19, improved gross margins by $0.13 per share; higher sales in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 increased earnings by $0.02 per share, driven by customer growth, partly offset by the effects of energy efficiency and distributed generation; the net effect of weather variations added $0.02 per share. Cooling degree days were higher in the third quarter this year compared to last year, although weather on both the 2016 and 2017 third quarters were less favorable than the 10-year averages. Higher operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to an increase in employee benefit costs. We also had a higher planned outage cost related to the beginning stages of the SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 5. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016, impacting earnings by $0.07 per share. The increase was primarily driven -- related to plant additions and the $61 million annual increase in D&A rates accrued in the rate case. Looking next to Arizona's economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis. I'll cover some of the trends we are seeing on the local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average. Through August, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2% compared to 1.5% for the entire U.S. The above-average job growth is broad based and driven largely by tourism, health care, manufacturing, finance and construction. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate of 4.3% also reflects the strength of the job market. This sort of job growth continued to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area commercial and residential real estate markets. As seen on the upper panel of Slide 5, vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall and are at the levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, about 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 5, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 2,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits from the single-family homes in the third quarter were the highest levels seen since 2006. One factor driving this increase is that Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. The activity in the market is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the county more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years. Reflecting a steady improvement in the economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.9% in the third quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. Finally, I will review our financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On September 11, APS issued $300 million of 10-year 2.95% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds were use to finance -- refinance commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West and APS had approximately $100 million and $32 million of short-term debt outstanding, respectively. As Don discussed, in October, the Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend by $0.16 per share or approximately 6% to $2.78 per share effective with the December payments. Turning to guidance. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2017 will be in the range of $4.15 to $4.36 per share. Key drivers for the remainder of the year include impact from our rate case and higher O&Ms as we complete the plant outage at Four Corners. The extended planned outage at Four Corners is why earnings in the fourth quarter of this year are expected to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2016. We are also introducing 2018 ongoing guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share, which includes an increase in our weather-normalized sales forecast to 0.5% to 1.5%. The rate increase, our adjustment mechanisms and sales growth will be important gross margin drivers, with -- we expect will be partially offset by higher fossil plant outage cost and higher other operating expenses related to more plant in service, including higher D&A and property tax. We have also increased our 2018 capital expenditure growth cap by approximately $40 million, mainly from reliability-related projects. We have higher fossil plant outage cost in 2018, including the 95-day SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 4. We also have planned outages at gas plants, including Redhawk. Maintenance at our gas plant is based on [ run hours ] and starts. Our participation in the Energy Imbalance Market, increasing levels of solar generation and low gas prices, combined, have resulted in more starts at many of our plants. We added -- we'll continue to plan to operate our business for long-term success, and we continuously strive to manage costs in a sustainable manner. In 2018, the larger than normal number of planned outages will provide the necessary maintenance to continue operating our diversified fleet with the high level of reliability our customers expect. We also believe that thoughtful and well-executed preventive maintenance can limit more costly emergent work in the future. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlining our 2017 and 2018 guidance in the appendix to today's slides. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% through 2019, and we still expect to achieve an annualized consolidated earn -- return on average common equity of more than 9.5% over the same time horizon. The combination of modest customer growth supported by robust economic development activity, extensive capital investments opportunities and renewable resources, technology and grid modernizations, together with a constructive and forward-thinking regulatory commission, we believe we are well positioned to continue our track record of success. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."
