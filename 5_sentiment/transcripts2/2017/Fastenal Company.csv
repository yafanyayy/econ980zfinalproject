And I'll start by just apologizing for the state of my voice on today's call. I'm recovering from a bit of a cold, so I'll try to speak clearly. My comments this morning will be relative",1191,"Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. And I'll start by just apologizing for the state of my voice on today's call. I'm recovering from a bit of a cold, so I'll try to speak clearly. 
My comments this morning will be relatively brief. I just want to touch on 5 points. First off, we had an upbeat finish to a tough year. Secondly, I believe we obtained [indiscernible] of our business. Third, I believe we've improved the health of our business. The fourth and fifth aren't comments so much on 2016, but I think a comment [ph] that we should always remind ourself of: One is we have great people close to the customer and we have great people behind the scenes to support our local business. Those are structurally important components to the success of our business today, historically, and I believe going forward. 
In regards to the upbeat finish, our sales trends and our gross profit stabilized and/or improved, depending on if you look at it out of comparison to Q3 or comparison to Q4  of a year ago; and we grew our earnings. And for a new CEO, you can appreciate the importance that comes with having a release that doesn't have some either parentheses or dashes in front of a number or 2 after we've come through, quite frankly, a pretty tough 2015 and 2016 period.
Secondly, our trends have improved. In both -- in the last several years, primarily 2014 and 2015, we have significantly added people costs [ph] to our organization as we grew our headcount, primarily at the store, but throughout the organization. These costs, when I look at the trends that come with it, had about peaked in the second quarter of 2016. And as we have gone through the year, those costs have cycled down a bit. And I believe we are poised quite well to manage that expense as we go into the new year. 
We also have added occupancy costs quite dramatically in the last several years. A piece of it relates to our vending platform, a piece of it relates to the automation we put into our distribution centers and a piece of it relates to our store network. There's always some built-in inflation in the store network, and our job every day is to manage that well. But whether it might be property taxes or some  -- or some [ph] charges or some inflation in the lease, we have to be very mindful of how we manage that in the long term, especially as the business is evolving. 
And again, similar to the people cost, I believe we exit the year in a much better spot. But we still have some work ahead of us on the occupancy side of the equation because we want to plan for and allow for growth there that comes from a continued expansion of our vending platform. 
In regards to business health, we upgraded around 2,100 stores to our CSP 16 format. And while we haven't talked about it [ph] a lot on our calls, that's a tremendous undertaking when you look at our store-based [ph] business. And this 2,100 upgrade was primarily in our U.S.-based business. We have some upgrades for our Canadian business as we enter 2017.
We also upgraded over 50 -- excuse me, upgraded or optimized, if you will, over 50,000 vending machines. And that's more about improving our cost to serve than it is about revenue enhance. [ph] So there's some revenue improvements because of it, but we had rapidly rolled out those 50,000-plus machines over the last 5 years. And in 2016, we took the opportunity to go and visit each and every machine and to challenge how we could be more efficient with that machine, and I believe that will -- that improves the health of that vending business and improves our ability to serve and grow the business in the future.
We also changed our mindset over the last several years as it relates to Onsite. We've been -- our first Onsite occurred in 1992. And at the end of 2014, we had [ph] around 200 Onsites that we've slowly grown in our business. If I think of 2014, just under 5% of our district leaders, and we have today roughly 255 district managers across the company, just under 5% of them signed in [ph] Onsite. We signed -- I don't know the exact number, but it was around 14 Onsites that year. In 2015, we took a big step forward and around 25% of our district leaders signed in Onsite that year and we signed around 80 Onsites.
In 2016, Fastenal has a hallmark of finding great people, challenging them to be successful, but not micromanaging. In 2016, over 50%, I believe 54% is the exact number, but over 50% of our district leaders had an Onsite signed in their business, and that translated into 176 signings during the year. Our goal going into 2017 is quite simple: To keep moving that participation up and for 80% of our district managers or district leaders to have an Onsite signed in their district. If we're able to accomplish that, we believe we could sign somewhere between 275 and 300 Onsites. We believe that's an achievable number from a signings perspective. It's an absorbable number from an execution standpoint because very much of the work is spread across 255 business units, 2,600 stores not concentrated in 1 small support group. So we're very excited about that.  And we also believe with the CSP 16 in place, the team that helped roll that out is there to also help with the implementation of our Onsite, so we believe we're -- approved that capacity to [indiscernible].
Finally, we talked about -- excuse me, fourth, we talked about great people close to the customer. 75% of our employees know our customers on a first-name basis, and yet, we have a very efficient cost structure. I don't believe any other nationwide distributor can lay claim to that and we're proud of that fact. 
Finally, the team behind the scene. Our team is strong. We are wired for change and we're frugal. All of these things help us serve our customer well.
I'll close with one thought. We believe in our people. We challenge each other to improve and we challenge each other to grow each day. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Holden, but before Holden starts in, I just want to -- so this is Holden's second earnings call. Many of you know Holden Lewis from his previous career as a sell-side analyst. He'd covered us for quite a few years. We knew Holden well. We're not quick to bring in somebody from the outside into our organization in this senior of a role. But we really liked Holden's ability. We felt he culturally fit with us. And the fact that he can bring a new set of eyes, a new critique [ph] and a tremendous skill set to our organization. So with that, I'll turn it over to Holden."
270747,415002455,1113279,"Fastenal Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2017",2017-01-18,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","All right. Thank you, Dan. Good morning, and thanks for joining this Fastenal fourth quarter call. I'm going to begin with a quick recap of our full year 2016 results and then I'll move on to a discussion of the quarterly performance. So in 2016, Fasten",1634,"All right. Thank you, Dan. Good morning, and thanks for joining this Fastenal fourth quarter call. I'm going to begin with a quick recap of our full year 2016 results and then I'll move on to a discussion of the quarterly performance. 
So in 2016, Fastenal generated $3.96 billion in sales. That's up 2.4% from 2015. We did have an extra day in the year so on a days basis, we were up about 2%. I'm not going to belabor the tough conditions that persisted through the year. I feel like that's well understood by you, but I would like to highlight some of the drivers that allowed us to grow despite it. 
First, on vending. We finished 2016 with 62,822 machines, that's about up 7,300 units or 13% over 2015. At this point, 46.1% of our sales now go to customers that use vending so it's fairly well represented in the field. Revenues through our machines increased by more than 10% in the fourth quarter. Signings of 18,059 machines were up 1% year-over-year. Note that these figures exclude the nearly 15,000 units that we installed related to our leased locker program. 
Despite all those excesses, vending did not quite reach the goals we'd set forth in 2016. But note that signings were at a 3-year high and we think that with the distractions related to our optimization efforts and the leased locker initiative now past us, we're targeting more than 20,000 signings in 2017. 
Secondly on our Onsites, we signed 176 new agreements in 2016, a little shy of our goal of 200 but substantially above the 80 that we signed last year. And this frankly contributed to driving sales through these sites up at a better than 25% rate for the year. We're gaining momentum here and we are targeting 275 to 300 signings in 2017.
With respect to National Accounts, we signed 190 new agreements, that's up 14% from '15. Even with softness among our largest 100 customers, these signings contributed to our total National Accounts revenues being up by a bit more than 4% on the year. We still see significant opportunity with new and existing customers and even with National Accounts now being about 47% of our total sales. 
Lastly, the SKUs related to our CSP 16 initiative, they also grew at a little bit better than a 4% rate in 2016. So we feel good overall about the strides that we're making in our growth drivers. We remain convinced of their effectiveness in driving share gains, and we look forward to further progress in 2017. 
Margins in 2016 were a challenge. Our gross margin finished the year at 49.6%. That's down 80 basis points, which is primarily from mix and pressure on product margins, the latter being particularly early in the year. Our operating margin finished 2016 at 20.1%, that was down about 130 basis points. 
In addition to the gross margin decline, occupancy was up as we continued to invest in our vending initiatives. We're likely to remain challenged by mix in vending-related occupancy, but some of the product pressures that we experienced in the first half of this year have eased at this point. We've been tighter with cost in the second half of '16 and some of the minor expenses for things like store closures or CSP 16 rollout hopefully don't recur. So as a result, we think we're better equipped to defend our margins in a slow growth environment or even expand it if growth accelerates from year than was the case in 2016. 
Our interest expense on the year roughly doubled while our average share count was down 1%. Both those facts reflect our share buyback activity over the last 8 quarters. Our tax rate was down from 37.5% to 36.8% in the year, which really just jurisdictional shifts as well as the resolution of certain state tax matters. It all blended into a 2016 EPS figure of $1.73, which was down about 2.3% for the year.
Then moving on to the fourth quarter results. Total and daily sales in the fourth quarter were up 2.7%, that's a modest acceleration from the prior 9 months. We can't ignore the easier comparison relative to last year's fourth quarter when our daily sales rate was actually down 2%. Still, the December daily sales were up 3.2%, and that was likely understated because of holiday timing. So in contrast to a poor November, frankly, we consider December to have been as expected. 
Now the details of the quarter remain a bit of a mixed bag. Growth from our top 100 accounts remain flattish on weakness among general industrial companies. The proportion of stores in National Accounts that were growing in the fourth quarter was largely unchanged from the third quarter, and construction fasteners actually weakened in the period. So in the end, growth of 1.6% in North America really wasn't much changed from the prior period. 
On the other hand, it's notable that heavy manufacturing was up 2.3% in the fourth quarter. That's the first time that's been up since the second quarter 2015. Similarly, OEM fasteners were weak but the down 2.8% was also the narrowest decline we've seen since the second quarter of 2015 [ph] Further, I would note that there is a more favorable tone surrounding process industries as we enter 2017. 
We're going to continue to assume the sluggish business conditions that have prevailed through '16 are going to continue into '17. But there does remain and there remains a great deal of uncertainty on a number of fronts but that said, the environment has become more optimistic.
Our gross margin was 49.8% in the fourth quarter, that's down 10 basis points versus the prior year but it's up 50 basis points against the third quarter. With respect to the year-over-year change, mix continues to weigh as the fasteners fell 180 basis points and now represent 35.6% of our sales. Given this, we view the stability in the period favorably. There was no single meaningful offset. Rather, it was small improvements in areas like purchase discounts and freight that benefited the quarter relative to the prior year.
As it relates to the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see the margin rebound from the third quarter of '16. Similar to the annual result, this is less from a single item than it is from the accumulation of many small but favorable improvements, including better margins on non-fasteners, a higher mix of exclusive brands, building revenue associated with our leased locker program, better purchasing and other variables like that. 
A lot of these things worked in our favor at the gross margin in the fourth quarter but there is nothing in this improvement that strikes us as onetime or temporary in nature. And at this point, we would characterize the margin environment as stable. 
Our operating margin was 19.3% in the fourth quarter, also down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis. SG&A as a percentage of sales was unchanged at 30.6% of revenues. Payroll, which is 65% to 70% of our SG&A, was down 30 basis points as a percentage of sales. 
Persistently sluggish demand had 2 effects here. First, they continued to temper the incentive pay in the fourth quarter. Second, we spent much of 2016 attrition unwind the rise and staffing we experienced in '15. We finished 2016 with headcount being down 5.4% or down 4.1% on an FTE basis. These variables more than offset the effect of higher health insurance costs.
Occupancy, which is 15% to 20% of total SG&A, was up 30 basis points as a percentage of sales. Vending was a primary catalyst behind this. And we don't expect that dynamic to change in 2017. We did expect efforts to rationalize our store base in the second half of '16 would provide a larger benefit and wound up being the case, and that's going to be a point of emphasis for our company in 2017.
In 2016, we trimmed staffing in stores, we invested in growth drivers and technology and used our balance sheet to invest strategically in inventory. We like where our cost structure sits as we exit the fourth quarter. We're going to continue to invest in our growth drivers but given the investments and rationalization we've already made, we believe that with a little faster growth, we can leverage the income statement in 2017. 
Finally, we generated $133 million in operating cash in the fourth quarter, that's down 8.5% versus last year. It also represents 116% of the quarter's net income, which is below last year. This decline year-over-year reflects 3 things: first, in the fourth quarter of '16, we took advantage of favorable year-end buys; second, payables are much higher in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to adding CSP 16 inventory in that period; and then third, our receivables fell at the faster rate in the fourth quarter of '15 due to the relatively sharper pullback in demand in that period. These factors all served to inflate the cash flow in fourth quarter '15 relative to fourth quarter '16.
That said, we generated free cash flow after dividends of $18.5 million. Our capital expenditures are down 23% year-over-year and down 63% sequentially as we wind up the rollout of our leased locker program. As a result, we reduced our net debt by roughly $21 million and retained flexible leverage of net debt being 12.5% of total capital. We expect cash generation to be improved and free cash flow after dividends to be positive in 2017. We don't anticipate a CSP program of the sort that we had in '16, and we expect capital spending to come in around $120 million. 
With that, we'll turn it over to Kevin to take your questions."

So to address your second question first, we all know how the math works. We've updated the sequentials. As we go into 2017, we're going to begin discussing those sequential rates have changed in terms of the prior 5-year averages as opposed to what we've done historically with '98 -- going from 1998 forward. So the numbers are what the numbers are. I'll let you plug them in an figure out where it is. But I think you're on the right track in terms of how that should fall out, given those sequential rates of change. On the second question, where we saw the most encouraging signs, I would say, would have been in the process industries. And we go about this a couple of ways. We listen to our regional vice presidents and what they're seeing in the market base and then we look at our top 100 accounts to get a sense, of which areas are doing well which ones are not. And what I'll tell you is the general industrial companies on our lists, there's still challenged. That's been the case most of the year, and I'm not sure that I saw or have heard any meaningful difference in the fourth quarter as it relates to general industrial firms. As it relates to the process industries, I would tell you that a lot of those, including oil and gas, looked better among our top 100. And then if you sort of listen to some of our RBPs talk about energy, there definitely is more of an enthusiasm and some more encouraging facts on the ground in those regions that are heavier in oil and gas. So what I would tell you is I don't feel like the fourth quarter felt a lot different in a lot of places than what we saw in the third quarter, but the notable exception would have been in those process industries and that oil and gas space. As you know, we were surprised how impactful the decline in oil and gas was to us when it began to head south a couple of years ago. We would consider it a positive if, in fact, or in and gas had some legs and did better from here but we'll see how that plays out."

The impact of -- we had -- I believe we had a very successful year on taking some first steps, steps that started 1 and 2 years ago of expanding our Onsite presence. All those things continue a pattern that's been in place for 20 years, and that is our mix of customers are changing. Our product mix continues to move a bit away from fasteners. Perhaps can will the a little bit if there is some recovery that helps our fastener business in calendar 2017. But the underlying long-term pattern is still what it is. And what we need to be smart about every day is identifying those pieces we can grab on to and make a little better. A decade ago, a piece we grabbed onto was freight. In the last 5 to 7 years, a piece we grabbed onto was our exclusive brands, our private labels and making sure we have a great strategy to support our supplier base and our product mix in serving our customers. And -- but the underlying trends are still there. We just need to defend the position every day. And I think we gained some footing on that as we went through 2016, still a tough year to go through, '15 and '16, I should say, because the trend has been going on for several years."

Probably the best way to think about the big picture store network standpoint is over the last 20 years, we've been quietly growing Onsite in some of our midwestern business units. So last week, I was in southern Wisconsin, all of our general managers were in. And in that discussion, one of the things that stands out when I think of our business in Wisconsin in Illinois, close -- over 1/3 of our revenue in that business unit, about 35% comes through the Onsite type of strategy where we've been incredibly successful over time on developing our business in a broader fashion. But if I think of that business over the last 20 years, we continue to open stores, we continue to grow our footprint. And in some of that stem from the fact that we have things going on. We had non-fasteners growing our business so a lot of markets of that traditionally weren't viable became viable. In more recent years, we made improvements from the vending side of the equation. But we believe long term, it's a huge market out there, number one. And we [indiscernible] that often. We're not wed to 1 strategy. We're wed to getting close to our customer where it economically works and providing them a level of service that our competitors either can't or unwilling to do. And we believe it's a complement of both. Only time will tell if structurally the fact patterns of our industry change, and it prompts our ultimate store crowd to go up or down. But the market is still there and we need to evolve to serve that market. But history has shown they're complementary to each other Onsite and store. In relation to Onsite, it's typically a multiyear endeavor. Part of it is us getting -- it's like anything it's incremental. So we moved -- when we move in, if you will, in the case of on Onsite, it depends sometimes on the product lines we're starting with. It might move faster if we're moving in with an OEM relationship or a broad vending platform relationship. It might move a little slower if it's a broader mix of products and we're picking up particular the commodities as we go along. I believe it's probably, in many cases, a 2- to 4-year endeavor to get in deeper, maybe it's 1 to 5. But it takes time, and that's one of the points that we stressed earlier in the year is we want to build momentum back into our business. And getting traction in the Onsite is a big piece of that."

And for us, sufficient history meant they had to be operating at least 9 months. And so we looked at that to see what's happening in that group and we liked what we saw. And we weren't surprised by what we saw. We saw a group of accounts. And the numbers that we really analyzed, it was just over 50 of our Onsites that have been operating long enough that we could really get a feel for it. And -- but the trends were solid and it wasn't driven by a few that were pulling it up or pulling it down, which is good to see. It was a good performance, generally speaking, across the group. We saw that the gross margin of the store that's on, I don't know if that's the right word, but the Onsite business. Their gross margin went up post separating the business, which is what we would expect because typically, you're taking a larger customer, it might be a $10,000, a $20,000, a $30,000 a month customer and you're extracting it from $100,000, $120,000, $150,000 store. And the remaining business actually have slightly higher gross margin, so we saw that as we expected. We saw that business with a little bit -- with a lower gross margin than our average Onsite but that is very typical because oftentimes, when you're stepping into a new Onsite, you're stepping into some products that you might be not sourcing optimally yet. You might not truly understand some of the products from the standpoint of, and it gets back to that optimal sourcing component. You might have products where you know the optimal source but you're not going to get the product in for 3, 4, 5, 6 months and so you have some lower margin sales that are going out. You might have some product that the customer had a meaningful supply on and you don't pick up that business for a period of time. But when I look at those Onsites that we've studied, again, we were pleased with the results and weren't surprised by the results. I expect when Holden runs his numbers, he's going to find a low single-digit, probably a 1 [ph] to 2 [ph] kind of number.

When I -- for us, profitability at the end of the day really stems from where's our average store size in that region and how well are we doing managing our operating -- the growth of our business over time? So if I look at the Midwest where we have the greatest concentration of Onsite, it's also an area of the country where we have the largest average store size because it's grown over time because they have -- our West Coast opened up -- started opening up 20 years ago. Our Midwest started opening up 50 years ago, so we have a 25 -- 20- to 30-year head start. And our highest operating margin business is in the Midwest. With that said, one thing Bob Kierlin has always reminded us in the 20 years that I've been here and probably the 50 years that he's been here is that at the end of the day, gross margin is a marker we look at to understand our business.

And I'll start by just apologizing for the state of my voice on today's call. I'm recovering from a bit of a cold, so I'll try to speak clearly. My comments this morning will be relative",1185,"Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. And I'll start by just apologizing for the state of my voice on today's call. I'm recovering from a bit of a cold, so I'll try to speak clearly. 
My comments this morning will be relatively brief. I just want to touch on 5 points. First off, we had an upbeat finish to a tough year. Secondly, I believe we obtained [indiscernible] of our business. Third, I believe we've improved the health of our business. The fourth and fifth aren't comments so much on 2016, but I think they're comments that we should always remind ourself of: One is we have great people close to the customer and we have great people behind the scenes to support our local business. Those are structurally important components to the success of our business today, historically, and I believe going forward. 
In regards to the upbeat finish, our sales trends and our gross profit stabilized and/or improved, depending on if you look at it out of comparison to Q3 or comparison to Q4  of a year ago; and we grew our earnings. And for a new CEO, you can appreciate the importance that comes with having a release that doesn't have some either parentheses or dashes in front of a number or 2 after we've come through, quite frankly, a pretty tough 2015 and 2016 period.
Secondly, our trends have improved. In both -- in the last several years, primarily 2014 and 2015, we have significantly added people cost to our organization as we grew our headcount, primarily at the store, but throughout the organization. These costs, when I look at the trends that come with it, had about peaked in the second quarter of 2016. And as we have gone through the year, those costs have cycled down a bit. And I believe we are poised quite well to manage that expense as we go into the new year. 
We also have added occupancy costs quite dramatically in the last several years. A piece of it relates to our vending platform, a piece of it relates to the automation we put into our distribution centers and a piece of it relates to our store network. There's always some built-in inflation in the store network, and our job every day is to manage that well. But whether it might be property taxes or some -- or some CAM charges or some inflation in the lease, we have to be very mindful of how we manage that in the long term, especially as the business is evolving. 
And again, similar to the people cost, I believe we exit the year in a much better spot. But we still have some work ahead of us on the occupancy side of the equation because we want to plan for and allow for growth there that comes from a continued expansion of our vending platform. 
In regards to business health, we upgraded around 2,100 stores to our CSP 16 format. And while we haven't talked about it a lot on our calls, that's a tremendous undertaking when you look at our store-based business. And this 2,100 upgrade was primarily in our U.S.-based business. We have some upgrades for our Canadian business as we enter 2017.
We also upgraded over 50 -- excuse me, upgraded or optimized, if you will, over 50,000 vending machines. And that's more about improving our cost to serve than it is about a revenue enhancement. So there's some revenue improvements because of it, but we had rapidly rolled out those 50,000-plus machines over the last 5 years. And in 2016, we took the opportunity to go and visit each and every machine and to challenge how we could be more efficient with that machine, and I believe that will -- that improves the health of that vending business and improves our ability to serve and grow the business in the future.
We also changed our mindset over the last several years as it relates to Onsite. We've been -- our first Onsite occurred in 1992. And at the end of 2014, we had of around 200 Onsites that we've slowly grown in our business. If I think of 2014, just under 5% of our district leaders, and we have today roughly 255 district managers across the company, just under 5% of them signed in Onsite. We signed -- I don't know the exact number, but it was around 14 Onsites that year. In 2015, we took a big step forward and around 25% of our district leaders signed in Onsite that year and we signed around 80 Onsites.
In 2016, Fastenal has a hallmark of finding great people, challenging them to be successful, but not micromanaging. In 2016, over 50%, I believe 54% is the exact number, but over 50% of our district leaders had an Onsite signed in their business, and that translated into 176 signings during the year. Our goal going into 2017 is quite simple: To keep moving that participation up and for 80% of our district managers or district leaders to have an Onsite signed in their district. If we're able to accomplish that, we believe we could sign somewhere between 275 and 300 Onsites. We believe that's an achievable number from a signings perspective. It's an absorbable number from an execution standpoint because very much of the work is spread across 255 business units, 2,600 stores not concentrated in 1 small support group. So we're very excited about that.  And we also believe with the CSP 16 in place, the team that helped roll that out is there to also help with the implementation of our Onsite, so we believe we're -- approved that capacity to [indiscernible].
Finally, we talked about -- excuse me, fourth, we talked about great people close to the customer. 75% of our employees know our customers on a first-name basis, and yet, we have a very efficient cost structure. I don't believe any other nationwide distributor can lay claim to that and we're proud of that fact. 
Finally, the team behind the scene. Our team is strong. We are wired for change and we're frugal. All of these things help us serve our customer well.
I'll close with one thought. We believe in our people. We challenge each other to improve and we challenge each other to grow each day. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Holden, but before Holden starts in, I just want to -- so this is Holden's second earnings call. Many of you know Holden Lewis from his previous career as a sell-side analyst. He'd covered us for quite a few years. We knew Holden well. We're not quick to bring in somebody from the outside into our organization in this senior of a role. But we really liked Holden's ability. We felt he culturally fit with us. And the fact that he can bring a new set of eyes, a new critique and a tremendous skill set to our organization. So with that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

Good morning, and thanks for joining the Fastenal fourth quarter call. I'm going to begin with a quick recap of our full year 2016 results and then I'll move on to a discussion of the quarterly performance. So in 2016, Fastena",1638,"All right. Thank you, Dan. Good morning, and thanks for joining the Fastenal fourth quarter call. I'm going to begin with a quick recap of our full year 2016 results and then I'll move on to a discussion of the quarterly performance. 
So in 2016, Fastenal generated $3.96 billion in sales. That's up 2.4% from 2015. We did have an extra day in the year, so on a days basis, we were up about 2%. I'm not going to belabor the tough conditions that persisted through the year. I feel like that's well understood by you. But I would like to highlight some of the drivers that allowed us to grow despite it. 
First, on vending. We finished 2016 with 62,822 machines, that's about up 7,300 units or 13% over 2015. At this point, 46.1% of our sales now go to customers that use vending, so it's fairly well-represented in the field. Revenues through our machines increased by more than 10% in the fourth quarter. Signings of 18,059 machines were up 1% year-over-year. Note that these figures exclude the nearly 15,000 units that we installed related to our lease locker program. 
Despite all those excesses, vending did not quite reach the goals we'd set forth in 2016, but note that signings were at 3-year high. And we think that with the distractions related to our optimization efforts and the lease locker initiative now past us, we're targeting more than 20,000 signings in 2017. 
Secondly, on our Onsites. We signed 176 new agreements in 2016, a little shy of our goal of 200 but substantially above the 80 that we signed last year. And this frankly contributed to driving sales through these sites up at a better than 25% rate for the year. We're gaining momentum here and we are targeting 275 to 300 signings in 2017.
With respect to National Accounts, we signed 190 new agreements, that's up 14% from '15. Even with softness among our largest 100 customers, these signings contributed to our total National Accounts revenues being up by a bit more than 4% on a year. We still see significant opportunity with new and existing customers and even with National Accounts now being about 47% of our total sales. 
Lastly, the SKUs related to our CSP 16 initiative, they also grew at a little bit better than a 4% rate in 2016. So we feel good overall about the strides that we're making in our growth drivers. We remain convinced of their effectiveness in driving share gains, and we look forward to further progress in 2017. 
Margins in 2016 were a challenge. Our gross margin finished the year at 49.6%. That's down 80 basis points, which is primarily from mix and pressure on product margins, the latter being particularly early in the year. Our operating margin finished 2016 at 20.1%, that was down about 130 basis points. 
In addition to the gross margin decline, occupancy was up as we continued to invest in our vending initiatives. We're likely to remain challenged by mix in vending-related occupancy, but some of the product pressures that we experienced in the first half of this year have eased at this point. We've been tighter with cost in the second half of '16, and some of the minor expenses for things like store closures or CSP 16 rollout hopefully don't recur. So as a result, we think we're better equipped to defend our margins in a slow growth environment or even expand it if growth accelerates from here, than was the case in 2016. 
Our interest expense on the year roughly doubled, while our average share count was down 1%. Both those facts reflect our share buyback activity over the last 8 quarters. Our tax rate was down from 37.5% to 36.8% in the year, which really just those just jurisdictional shifts, as well as the resolution of certain state tax matters. It all blended into a 2016 EPS figure of $1.73, which was down about 2.3% for the year.
Then moving on to the fourth quarter results. Total and daily sales in the fourth quarter were up 2.7%, that's a modest acceleration from the prior 9 months. We can't ignore the easier comparison relative to last year's fourth quarter when our daily sales rate was actually down 2%. Still, the December daily sales were up 3.2%, and that was likely understated because of holiday timing. So in contrast to a poor November, frankly, we consider December to have been as expected. 
Now the details of the quarter remain a bit of a mixed bag. Growth from our top 100 accounts remain flattish on weakness among general industrial companies. The proportion of stores in National Accounts that were growing in the fourth quarter was largely unchanged from the third quarter, and construction fasteners actually weakened in the period. So in the end, growth of 1.6% in North America really wasn't much changed from the prior period. 
On the other hand, it's notable that heavy manufacturing was up 2.3% in the fourth quarter. That's the first time that's been up since the second quarter 2015. Similarly, OEM fasteners were weak but the down 2.8% was also the narrowest decline we've seen since the second quarter of 2015. Further, I would note that there is a more favorable tone surrounding process industries as we enter 2017. 
We're going to continue to assume the sluggish business conditions that have prevailed through '16 are going to continue into '17. But there does remain and there remains a great deal of uncertainty on a number of fronts, but that said, the environment has become more optimistic.
Our gross margin was 49.8% in the fourth quarter, that's down 10 basis points versus the prior year, but it's up 50 basis points against the third quarter. With respect to the year-over-year change, mix continues to weigh as the fasteners fell 180 basis points to now represent 35.6% of our sales. Given this, we view the stability in the period favorably. There was no single meaningful offset. Rather, it was small improvements in areas like purchase discounts and freight that benefited the quarter relative to the prior year.
As it relates to the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see the margin rebound from the third quarter of '16. Similar to the annual result, this is less from a single item than it is from the accumulation of many small but favorable improvements, including better margins on non-fasteners, a higher mix of exclusive brands, building revenue associated with our lease locker program, better purchasing and other variables like that. 
A lot of these things worked in our favor at the gross margin in the fourth quarter but there is nothing in this improvement that strikes us as onetime or temporary in nature. And at this point, we would characterize the margin environment as stable. 
Our operating margin was 19.3% in the fourth quarter, also down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis. SG&A as a percentage of sales was unchanged at 30.6% of revenues. Payroll, which is 65% to 70% of our SG&A, was down 30 basis points as a percentage of sales.  Persistently sluggish demand has had 2 effects here: First, it continued to temper the incentive pay in the fourth quarter. Second, we spent much of 2016 letting attrition unwind the rise in staffing we experienced in '15. We finished 2016 with headcount being down 5.4% or down 4.1% on an FTE basis. These variables more than offset the effect of higher health insurance costs.
Occupancy, which is 15% to 20% of total SG&A, was up 30 basis points as a percentage of sales. Vending was the primary catalyst behind this. And we don't expect that dynamic to change in 2017. We did expect efforts to rationalize our store base in the second half of '16 would provide a larger benefit and wound up being the case, and that's going to be a point of emphasis for our company in 2017.
In 2016, we trimmed staffing in stores, we invested in growth drivers and technology and used our balance sheet to invest strategically in inventory. We like where our cost structure sits as we exit the fourth quarter. We're going to continue to invest in our growth drivers, but given the investments and rationalization we've already made, we believe that with a little faster growth, we can leverage the income statement in 2017. 
Finally, we generated $133 million in operating cash in the fourth quarter, that's down 8.5% versus last year. It also represents 116% of the quarter's net income, which is below last year. This decline year-over-year reflects 3 things: First, in the fourth quarter of '16, we took advantage of favorable year-end buys. Second, payables were much higher in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to adding CSP 16 inventory in that period. And then third, our receivables fell at a faster rate in the fourth quarter of '15 due to the relatively sharper pull back in demand in that period. These factors all serve to inflate the cash flow in fourth quarter of '15 relative to fourth quarter of '16.
That said, we generated free cash flow after dividends of $18.5 million. Our capital expenditures are down 23% year-over-year and down 63% sequentially as we wind up the rollout of our lease locker program. As a result, we reduced our net debt by roughly $21 million and retained flexible leverage of net debt being 12.5% of total capital. We expect cash generation to be improved and free cash flow after dividends to be positive in 2017. We don't anticipate a CSP program of the sort that we had in '16, and we expect capital spending to come in around $120 million. 
With that, we'll turn it over to Kevin to take your questions."

So to address your second question first, we all know how the math works. Yes, we've updated the sequentials. As we go into 2017, we're going to begin discussing those sequential rates have changed in terms of the prior 5-year averages as opposed to what we've done historically with '98 -- going from 1998 forward. So the numbers are what the numbers are. I'll let you plug them in and kind of figure out where it is. But I think you're on the right track in terms of how that should fall out, given those sequential rates of change. On the second question, where we saw the most encouraging signs, I would say, would have been in the process industries. And we go about this a couple of ways. We listen to our regional vice presidents and what they're seeing in the market base, and then we look at our top 100 accounts to get a sense of which areas are doing well, which ones are not. And what I would tell you is the general industrial companies on our lists, they're still challenged. That's been the case most of the year. I'm not sure that I saw or have heard any meaningful difference in the fourth quarter as it relates to general industrial firms. As it relates to the process industries, I would tell you that a lot of those, including oil and gas, looked better among our top 100. And then if you sort of listen to some of our RVPs talk about energy, there definitely is more of an enthusiasm and some more encouraging facts on the ground in those regions that are heavier in oil and gas. So what I would tell you is I don't feel like the fourth quarter felt a lot different in a lot of places than what we saw in the third quarter, but the notable exception would have been in those process industries and that oil and gas space. As you know, we were surprised by how impactful the decline in oil and gas was to us when it began to head south a couple of years ago. We would consider it a positive if, in fact, oil and gas had some legs and did better from here, but we'll see how that plays out."

All those things continue a pattern that's been in place for 20 years, and that is our mix of customers are continually changing. Our product mix continues to move a bit away from fasteners. Perhaps we could slow that down a little bit if there is some recovery that helps our fastener business in calendar 2017. But the underlying long-term pattern is still what it is. And what we need to be smart about every day is identifying those pieces we can grab on to and make a little better. A decade ago, a piece we grabbed onto was freight. In the last 5 to 7 years, a piece we grabbed onto was our exclusive brands, our private labels, and making sure we have a great strategy to support our supplier base and our product mix in serving our customers. And -- but the underlying trends are still there, we just need to defend the position every day. And I think we gained some footing on that as we went through 2016, but it was still a tough year to go through -- '15 and '16, I should say, because the trend has been going on for several years."

Probably the best way to think about the big picture from a store network standpoint is over the last 20 years, we've been quietly growing Onsite in some of our midwestern business units. So last week, I was in Southern Wisconsin, all of our general managers were in. And in that discussion, one of the things that stands out when I think of our business in Wisconsin and Illinois, close -- over 1/3 of our revenue in that business unit, about 35%, comes through the Onsite type of strategy where we've been incredibly successful over time on developing our business in a broader fashion. But if I think of that business over the last 20 years, we continue to open stores, we continue to grow our footprint. And some of that stem from the fact that we have things going on. We had non-fasteners growing in our business, so a lot of markets that traditionally weren't viable became viable. In more recent years, we made improvements from the vending side of the equation. But we believe long term, it's a huge market out there, number one, and we espouse that often. We're not wed to one strategy. We're wed to getting close to our customer where it economically works and providing them a level of service that our competitors either can't or are unwilling to do. And we believe it's a complement of both. Only time will tell if, structurally, the fact patterns of our industry change and it prompts our ultimate store count to go up or down. But the market is still there and we need to evolve to serve that market. But history has shown they're very complementary to each other, Onsite and store. In relation to Onsite, it's typically a multiyear endeavor. Part of it is us getting -- it's like anything, it's incremental. So we move -- when we move in, if you will, in the case of Onsite, it depends sometimes on the product lines we're starting with. It might move faster if we're moving in with an OEM relationship or a broad vending platform relationship. It might move a little slower if it's a broader mix of products and we're picking up particularly commodities as we go along. I believe it's probably, in many cases, a 2- to 4-year endeavor to get in deeper, maybe it's 1 to 5. But it takes time, and that's one of the points that we stressed earlier in the year, is we want to build momentum back into our business. And getting traction in the Onsite is a big piece of that."

And in fact, we do, generally speaking, take some sales out of the store and that becomes the seed revenue for that Onsite. And what we find is that inside 12 to 24 months, that seed revenue has grown dramatically from its original number. As it relates to the store, our expectation generally is that, that store, which now doesn't have to provide a disproportionate service to a single customer, can sort of have it's sort of selling energy reinvigorated, and then they can go out, from an admittedly lower base, begin to grow that business again. And we've sort of altered the compensation with the Onsite business to make it neutral from that standpoint. But the expectation is that the store is sort of no longer responsible for that piece of revenue will go out and find new, active accounts and just begin to grow that business again from that new level."

And for us, sufficient history meant they had to be operating at least 9 months. And so we looked at that to see what's happening in that group and we liked what we saw and we weren't surprised by what we saw. We saw a group of accounts. And the numbers that we really analyzed, it was just over 50 of our Onsites that had been operating long enough that we could really get a feel for it. And -- but the trends were solid and it wasn't driven by a few that were pulling it up or pulling it down and -- which is good to see. It was a good performance, generally speaking, across the group. We saw that the gross margin of the store that spawned, I don't know if that's the right word, but that spawned the Onsite business. Their gross margin went up post separating the business, which is what we would expect, because typically, you're taking a larger customer, it might be a $10,000, a $20,000, a $30,000 month customer and you're extracting it from $100,000, $120,000, $150,000 store. And the remaining business actually have a slightly higher gross margin, so we saw that as we expected. We saw that business with a little bit -- with a lower gross margin than our average Onsite but that is very typical. Because oftentimes, when you're stepping into a new Onsite, you're stepping into some products that you might be not sourcing optimally yet. You might not truly understand some of the products from the standpoint of, and it gets back to that optimal sourcing component. You might have products where you know the optimal source, but you're not going to get the product in for 3, 4, 5, 6 months, and so you have some lower-margin sales that are going out. You might have some product that the customer had a meaningful supply on and you don't pick up that business for a period of time. But when I look at those Onsites that we've studied, again, we were pleased with the results and weren't surprised by the results. I suspect when Holden runs his numbers, he's going to find a low single-digit, probably a 1 to 2 kind of number.

But bear in mind that where that full year impact comes from, companies like Flowserve or Weir Group that are not oil and gas companies, if you will, they're pump companies or engineering companies, but they have significant exposure to the oil and gas within their overall customer mix, that's where our exposure comes from.

Our Midwest started opening up 50 years ago. So we have a 25 -- 20- to 30-year head start. And our highest operating margin business is in the Midwest.

Third, I believe we've improved the health of our business. The fourth and fifth aren't comments so much on 2016, but I think they're comments that we should always remind ourself of: One is we have great people close to the customer and we have great people behind the scenes to support our local business. Those are structurally important components to the success of our business today, historically, and I believe going forward. 
In regards to the upbeat finish, our sales trends and our gross profit stabilized and/or improved, depending on if you're looking at it in comparison to Q3 or comparison to Q4 of a year ago; and we grew our earnings. And for a new CEO, you can appreciate the importance that comes with having a release that doesn't have some either parentheses or dashes in front of a number or 2 after we've come through, quite frankly, a pretty tough 2015 and 2016 period.
Secondly, our trends have improved. In both -- in the last several years, primarily 2014 and 2015, we have significantly added people cost to our organization as we grew our headcount, primarily at the store, but throughout the organization. These costs, when I look at the trends that come with it, had about peaked in the second quarter of 2016. And as we have gone through the year, those costs have cycled down a bit. And I believe we are poised quite well to manage that expense as we go into the new year. 
We also have added occupancy costs quite dramatically in the last several years. A piece of it relates to our vending platform, a piece of it relates to the automation we put into our distribution centers and a piece of it relates to our store network. There's always some built-in inflation in the store network, and our job every day is to manage that well. But whether it might be property taxes or some -- or some CAM charges or some inflation in the lease, we have to be very mindful of how we manage that in the long term, especially as the business is evolving. 
And again, similar to the people cost, I believe we exit the year in a much better spot. But we still have some work ahead of us on the occupancy side of the equation because we want to plan for and allow for growth there that comes from a continued expansion of our vending platform. 
In regards to business health, we upgraded around 2,100 stores to our CSP 16 format. And while we haven't talked about it a lot on our calls, that's a tremendous undertaking when you look at our store-based business. And this 2,100 upgrade was primarily in our U.S.-based business. We have some upgrades for our Canadian business as we enter 2017.
We also upgraded over 50 -- excuse me, upgraded or optimized, if you will, over 50,000 vending machines. And that's more about improving our cost to serve than it is about a revenue enhancement. So there's some revenue improvements because of it, but we had rapidly rolled out those 50,000-plus machines over the last 5 years. And in 2016, we took the opportunity to go and visit each and every machine and to challenge how we could be more efficient with that machine, and I believe that will -- that improves the health of that vending business and improves our ability to serve and grow the business in the future.
We also changed our mindset over the last several years as it relates to Onsite. We've been -- our first Onsite occurred in 1992. And at the end of 2014, we had around 200 Onsites that we've slowly grown in our business. If I think of 2014, just under 5% of our district leaders, and we have today roughly 255 district managers across the company, just under 5% of them signed in Onsite. We signed -- I don't know the exact number, but it was around 14 Onsites that year. In 2015, we took a big step forward and around 25% of our district leaders signed in Onsite that year and we signed around 80 Onsites.
In 2016, Fastenal has a hallmark of finding great people, challenging them to be successful, but not micromanaging. In 2016, over 50% -- I believe 54% is the exact number, but over 50% of our district leaders had an Onsite signed in their business, and that translated into 176 signings during the year. Our goal going into 2017 is quite simple: To keep moving that participation up, and for 80% of our district managers or district leaders, to have an Onsite signed in their district. If we're able to accomplish that, we believe we could sign somewhere between 275 and 300 Onsites. We believe that's an achievable number from a signings perspective. It's an absorbable number from an execution standpoint because very much of the work is spread across 255 business units, 2,600 stores not concentrated in 1 small support group. So we're very excited about that.  And we also believe with the CSP 16 in place, the team that helped roll that out is there to also help with the implementation of our Onsite, so we believe we're -- we've approved our capacity to implement.
Finally, we talked about -- excuse me, fourth, we talked about great people close to the customer. 75% of our employees know our customers on a first-name basis, and yet, we have a very efficient cost structure. I don't believe any other nationwide distributor can lay claim to that and we're proud of that fact. 
Finally, the team behind the scene. Our team is strong. We are wired for change and we're frugal. All of these things help us serve our customer well.
I'll close with one thought. We believe in our people. We challenge each other to improve and we challenge each other to grow each day. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Holden, but before Holden starts in, I just want to -- so this is Holden's second earnings call. Many of you know Holden Lewis from his previous career as a sell-side analyst. He'd covered us for quite a few years. We knew Holden well. We're not quick to bring in somebody from the outside into our organization in this senior of a role. But we really liked Holden's ability. We felt he culturally fit with us. And the fact that he can bring a new set of eyes, a new critique and a tremendous skill set to our organization. So with that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

Good morning, and thanks for joining the Fastenal fourth quarter call. I'm going to begin with a quick recap of our full year 2016 results and then I'll move on to a discussion of the quarterly performance. So in 2016, Fastena",1639,"All right. Thank you, Dan. Good morning, and thanks for joining the Fastenal fourth quarter call. I'm going to begin with a quick recap of our full year 2016 results and then I'll move on to a discussion of the quarterly performance. 
So in 2016, Fastenal generated $3.96 billion in sales. That's up 2.4% from 2015. We did have an extra day in the year, so on a days basis, we were up about 2%. I'm not going to belabor the tough conditions that persisted through the year. I feel like that's well understood by you. But I would like to highlight some of the drivers that allowed us to grow despite it. 
First, on vending. We finished 2016 with 62,822 machines, that's about up 7,300 units or 13% over 2015. At this point, 46.1% of our sales now go to customers that use vending, so it's fairly well-represented in the field. Revenues through our machines increased by more than 10% in the fourth quarter. Signings of 18,059 machines were up 1% year-over-year. Note that these figures exclude the nearly 15,000 units that we installed related to our lease locker program. 
Despite all those excesses, vending did not quite reach the goals we'd set forth in 2016, but note that signings were at 3-year high. And we think that with the distractions related to our optimization efforts and the lease locker initiative now past us, we're targeting more than 20,000 signings in 2017. 
Secondly, on our Onsites. We signed 176 new agreements in 2016, a little shy of our goal of 200 but substantially above the 80 that we signed last year. And this, frankly, contributed to driving sales through these sites up at a better than 25% rate for the year. We're gaining momentum here and we are targeting 275 to 300 signings in 2017.
With respect to National Accounts, we signed 190 new agreements, that's up 14% from '15. Even with softness among our largest 100 customers, these signings contributed to our total National Accounts revenues being up by a bit more than 4% on the year. We still see significant opportunity with new and existing customers and even with National Accounts now being about 47% of our total sales. 
Lastly, the SKUs related to our CSP 16 initiative, they also grew at a little bit better than a 4% rate in 2016. So we feel good overall about the strides that we're making in our growth drivers. We remain convinced of their effectiveness in driving share gains, and we look forward to further progress in 2017. 
Margins in 2016 were a challenge. Our gross margin finished the year at 49.6%. That's down 80 basis points, which is primarily from mix and pressure on product margins, the latter being particularly early in the year. Our operating margin finished 2016 at 20.1%, that was down about 130 basis points. 
In addition to the gross margin decline, occupancy was up as we continued to invest in our vending initiative. We're likely to remain challenged by mix in vending-related occupancy, but some of the product pressures that we experienced in the first half of this year have eased at this point. We've been tighter with cost in the second half of '16, and some of the minor expenses for things like store closures or CSP 16 rollout hopefully don't recur. So as a result, we think we're better equipped to defend our margins in a slow growth environment or even expand it if growth accelerates from here, than was the case in 2016. 
Our interest expense on the year roughly doubled, while our average share count was down 1%. Both those facts reflect our share buyback activity over the last 8 quarters. Our tax rate was down from 37.5% to 36.8% in the year, which really just owes to some jurisdictional shifts, as well as the resolution of certain state tax matters. It all blended into a 2016 EPS figure of $1.73, which was down about 2.3% for the year.
Then moving on to the fourth quarter results. Total and daily sales in the fourth quarter were up 2.7%, that's a modest acceleration from the prior 9 months. We can't ignore the easier comparison relative to last year's fourth quarter when our daily sales rate was actually down 2%. Still, the December daily sales were up 3.2%, and that was likely understated because of holiday timing. So in contrast to a poor November, frankly, we consider December to have been as expected. 
Now the details of the quarter remain a bit of a mixed bag. Growth from our top 100 accounts remain flattish on weakness among general industrial companies. The proportion of stores in National Accounts that were growing in the fourth quarter was largely unchanged from the third quarter, and construction fasteners actually weakened in the period. So in the end, growth of 1.6% in North America really wasn't much changed from the prior period. 
On the other hand, it's notable that heavy manufacturing was up 2.3% in the fourth quarter. That's the first time that's been up since the second quarter 2015. Similarly, OEM fasteners were weak but the down 2.8% was also the narrowest decline we've seen since the second quarter of 2015. Further, I would note that there is a more favorable tone surrounding process industries as we enter 2017. 
We're going to continue to assume the sluggish business conditions that have prevailed through '16 are going to continue into '17. But there does remain and there remains a great deal of uncertainty on a number of fronts, but that said, the environment has become more optimistic.
Our gross margin was 49.8% in the fourth quarter, that's down 10 basis points versus the prior year, but it's up 50 basis points against the third quarter. With respect to the year-over-year change, mix continues to weigh as the fasteners fell 180 basis points to now represent 35.6% of our sales. Given this, we view the stability in the period favorably. There was no single meaningful offset. Rather, it was small improvements in areas like purchase discounts and freight that benefited the quarter relative to the prior year.
As it relates to the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see the margin rebound from the third quarter of '16. Similar to the annual result, this is less from a single item than it is from the accumulation of many small but favorable improvements, including better margins on non-fasteners, a higher mix of exclusive brands, building revenue associated with our lease locker program, better purchasing and other variables like that. 
A lot of these things worked in our favor at the gross margin in the fourth quarter but there is nothing in this improvement that strikes us as onetime or temporary in nature. And at this point, we would characterize the margin environment as stable. 
Our operating margin was 19.3% in the fourth quarter, also down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis. SG&A as a percentage of sales was unchanged at 30.6% of revenues. Payroll, which is 65% to 70% of our SG&A, was down 30 basis points as a percentage of sales. Persistently sluggish demand has had 2 effects here: First, it continued to temper the incentive pay in the fourth quarter. Second, we spent much of 2016 letting attrition unwind the rise in staffing we experienced in '15. We finished 2016 with headcount being down 5.4% or down 4.1% on an FTE basis. These variables more than offset the effect of higher health insurance costs.
Occupancy, which is 15% to 20% of total SG&A, was up 30 basis points as a percentage of sales. Vending was the primary catalyst behind this. And we don't expect that dynamic to change in 2017. We did expect efforts to rationalize our store base in the second half of '16 would provide a larger benefit and wound up being the case, and that's going to be a point of emphasis for our company in 2017.
In 2016, we trimmed staffing in stores, we invested in growth drivers and technology and used our balance sheet to invest strategically in inventory. We like where our cost structure sits as we exit the fourth quarter. We're going to continue to invest in our growth drivers, but given the investments and rationalization we've already made, we believe that with a little faster growth, we can leverage the income statement in 2017. 
Finally, we generated $133 million in operating cash in the fourth quarter, that's down 8.5% versus last year. It also represents 116% of the quarter's net income, which is below last year. This decline year-over-year reflects 3 things: First, in the fourth quarter of '16, we took advantage of favorable year-end buys. Second, payables were much higher in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to adding CSP 16 inventory in that period. And then third, our receivables fell at a faster rate in the fourth quarter of '15 due to the relatively sharper pull back in demand in that period. These factors all serve to inflate the cash flow in fourth quarter of '15 relative to fourth quarter of '16.
That said, we generated free cash flow after dividends of $18.5 million. Our capital expenditures are down 23% year-over-year and down 63% sequentially as we wind up the rollout of our lease locker program. As a result, we reduced our net debt by roughly $21 million and retained flexible leverage of net debt being 12.5% of total capital. We expect cash generation to be improved and free cash flow after dividends to be positive in 2017. We don't anticipate a CSP program of the sort that we had in '16, and we expect capital spending to come in around $120 million. 
With that, we'll turn it over to Kevin to take your questions."

So to address your second question first, we all know how the math works. Yes, we've updated the sequentials. As we go into 2017, we're going to begin discussing those sequential rates have changed in terms of the prior 5-year averages as opposed to what we've done historically with '98 -- going from 1998 forward. So the numbers are what the numbers are. I'll let you plug them in and kind of figure out where it is. But I think that you're on the right track in terms of how that should fall out, given those sequential rates of change. On the second question, where we saw the most encouraging signs, I would say, would have been in the process industries. And we go about this a couple of ways. We listen to our regional vice presidents and what they're seeing in the marketplace, and then we look at our top 100 accounts to get a sense of which areas are doing well, which ones are not. And what I would tell you is the general industrial companies on our lists, they're still challenged. That's been the case most of the year. I'm not sure that I saw or have heard any meaningful difference in the fourth quarter as it relates to general industrial firms. As it relates to the process industries, I would tell you that a lot of those, including oil and gas, looked better among our top 100. And then if you sort of listen to some of our RVPs talk about energy, there definitely is more of an enthusiasm and some more encouraging facts on the ground in those regions that are heavier in oil and gas. So what I would tell you is I don't feel like the fourth quarter felt a lot different in a lot of places than what we saw in the third quarter, but the notable exception would have been in those process industries and that oil and gas space. As you know, we were surprised by how impactful the decline in oil and gas was to us when it began to head south a couple of years ago. We would consider it a positive if, in fact, oil and gas had some legs and did better from here, but we'll see how that plays out."

All those things continue a pattern that's been in place for 20 years, and that is our mix of customers are continually changing. Our product mix continues to move a bit away from fasteners. Perhaps we could slow that down a little bit if there is some recovery that helps our fastener business in calendar 2017. But the underlying long-term pattern is still what it is. And what we need to be smart about every day is identifying those pieces we can grab on to and make a little better. A decade ago, a piece we grabbed onto was freight. In the last 5 to 7 years, a piece we've grabbed onto was our exclusive brands, our private labels, and making sure we have a great strategy to support our supplier base and our product mix in serving our customers. And -- but the underlying trends are still there, we just need to defend the position every day. And I think we gained some footing on that as we went through 2016, but it was still a tough year to go through -- '15 and '16, I should say, because the trend has been going on for several years."

Probably the best way to think about the big picture from a store network standpoint is over the last 20 years, we've been quietly growing Onsite in some of our midwestern business units. So last week, I was in Southern Wisconsin, all of our general managers were in. And in that discussion, one of the things that stands out when I think of our business in Wisconsin and Illinois, close -- over 1/3 of our revenue in that business unit, about 35%, comes through the Onsite type of strategy where we've been incredibly successful over time on developing our business in a broader fashion. But if I think of that business over the last 20 years, we continue to open stores, we continue to grow our footprint. And some of that stem from the fact that we had things going on. We had non-fasteners growing in our business, so a lot of markets that traditionally weren't viable became viable. In more recent years, we made improvements from the vending side of the equation. But we believe long term, it's a huge market out there, number one, and we espouse that often. We're not wed to one strategy. We're wed to getting close to our customer where it economically works and providing them a level of service that our competitors either can't or are unwilling to do. And we believe it's a complement of both. Only time will tell if, structurally, the fact patterns of our industry change and it prompts our ultimate store count to go up or go down. But the market is still there and we need to evolve to serve that market. But history has shown they're very complementary to each other, Onsite and store. In relation to Onsite, it's typically a multiyear endeavor. Part of it is us getting -- it's like anything, it's incremental. So we move -- when we move in, if you will, in the case of an Onsite, it depends sometimes on the product lines we're starting with. It might move faster if we're moving in with an OEM relationship or a broad vending platform relationship. It might move a little slower if it's a broader mix of products and we're picking up particularly commodities as we go along. I believe it's probably, in many cases, a 2- to 4-year endeavor to get in deeper, maybe it's 1 to 5. But it takes time, and that's one of the points that we stressed earlier in the year, is we want to build momentum back into our business. And getting traction in the Onsite is a big piece of that."

And in fact, we do, generally speaking, take some sales out of the store and that becomes the seed revenue for that Onsite. And what we find is that inside 12 to 24 months, that seed revenue has grown dramatically from its original number. As it relates to the store, our expectation generally is that, that store, which now doesn't have to provide a disproportionate service to a single customer, can sort of have it's sort of selling energy reinvigorated, and then they can go out, from an admittedly lower base, begin to grow that business again. And we've sort of altered the compensation with the Onsite business to make it neutral from that standpoint. But the expectation is that the store is sort of no longer responsible for that piece of revenue. We'll go out and find new, active accounts and just begin to grow that business again from that new level."

And for us, sufficient history meant they had to be operating at least 9 months. And so we looked at that to see what's happening in that group and we liked what we saw and we weren't surprised by what we saw. We saw a group of accounts. And the numbers that we really analyzed, it was just over 50 of our Onsites that had been operating long enough that we could really get a feel for it. And -- but the trends were solid and it wasn't driven by a few that were pulling it up or pulling it down and -- which is good to see. It was a good performance, generally speaking, across the group. We saw that the gross margin of the store that spawned -- I don't know if that's the right word, but that spawned the Onsite business. Their gross margin went up post separating the business, which is what we would expect, because typically, you're taking a larger customer, it might be a $10,000, a $20,000, a $30,000 month customer and you're extracting it from $100,000 to $120,000, $150,000 store. And the remaining business actually has a slightly higher gross margin, so we saw that as we expected. We saw that business with a little bit -- with a lower gross margin than our average Onsite but that is very typical. Because oftentimes, when you're stepping into a new Onsite, you're stepping into some products that you might be not sourcing optimally yet. You might not truly understand some of the products from the standpoint of, and it gets back to that optimal sourcing component. You might have products where you know the optimal source, but you're not going to get the product in for 3, 4, 5, 6 months, and so you have some lower-margin sales that are going out. You might have some product that the customer had a meaningful supply on and you don't pick up that business for a period of time. But when I look at those Onsites that we've studied, again, we were pleased with the results and weren't surprised by the results.

But bear in mind that where that full year impact comes from, companies like Flowserve or Weir Group that are not oil and gas companies, if you will, they're pump companies or engineering companies, but they have significant exposure to the oil and gas within their overall customer mix, that's where our exposure comes from.

So if I look at the Midwest where we have the greatest concentration of Onsite, it's also an area of the country where we have the largest average store size because it's grown over time because they have -- our West Coast opened up -- started opening up 20 years ago. Our Midwest started opening up 50 years ago. So we have a 25 -- 20- to 30-year head start. And our highest operating margin business is in the Midwest. With that said, one thing Bob Kierlin has always reminded us in the 20 years that I've been here and probably in the 50 years that he's been here, is that at the end of the day, gross margin is a marker we look at to understand our business.

I'm recovering from a bit of a cold, so I'll try to speak clearly. 
My comments this morning will be relatively brief. I just want to touch on 5 points. First off, we had an upbeat finish to a tough year. Secondly, I believe we've changed the trends of our business. Third, I believe we've improved the health of our business. The fourth and fifth aren't comments so much on 2016, but I think they're comments that we should always remind ourself of: One is we have great people close to the customer and we have great people behind the scenes to support our local business. Those are structurally important components to the success of our business today, historically, and I believe going forward. 
In regards to the upbeat finish, our sales trends and our gross profit stabilized and/or improved, depending on if you're looking at it in comparison to Q3 or comparison to Q4 of a year ago; and we grew our earnings. And for a new CEO, you can appreciate the importance that comes with having a release that doesn't have some either parentheses or dashes in front of a number or 2 after we've come through, quite frankly, a pretty tough 2015 and 2016 period.
Secondly, our trends have improved. In both -- in the last several years, primarily 2014 and 2015, we have significantly added people cost to our organization as we grew our headcount, primarily at the store, but throughout the organization. These costs, when I look at the trends that come with it, had about peaked in the second quarter of 2016. And as we have gone through the year, those costs have cycled down a bit. And I believe we are poised quite well to manage that expense as we go into the new year. 
We also have added occupancy costs quite dramatically in the last several years. A piece of it relates to our vending platform, a piece of it relates to the automation we put into our distribution centers and a piece of it relates to our store network. There's always some built-in inflation in the store network, and our job every day is to manage that well. But whether it might be property taxes or some -- or some CAM charges or some inflation in the lease, we have to be very mindful of how we manage that in the long term, especially as the business is evolving. 
And again, similar to the people cost, I believe we exit the year in a much better spot. But we still have some work ahead of us on the occupancy side of the equation because we want to plan for and allow for growth there that comes from a continued expansion of our vending platform. 
In regards to business health, we upgraded around 2,100 stores to our CSP 16 format. And while we haven't talked about it a lot on our calls, that's a tremendous undertaking when you look at our store-based business. And this 2,100 upgrade was primarily in our U.S.-based business. We have some upgrades for our Canadian business as we enter 2017.
We also upgraded over 50 -- excuse me, upgraded or optimized, if you will, over 50,000 vending machines. And that's more about improving our cost to serve than it is about a revenue enhancement. So there's some revenue improvements because of it, but we had rapidly rolled out those 50,000-plus machines over the last 5 years. And in 2016, we took the opportunity to go and visit each and every machine and to challenge how we could be more efficient with that machine, and I believe that will -- that improves the health of that vending business and improves our ability to serve and grow the business in the future.
We also changed our mindset over the last several years as it relates to Onsite. We've been -- our first Onsite occurred in 1992. And at the end of 2014, we had around 200 Onsites that we've slowly grown in our business. If I think of 2014, just under 5% of our district leaders, and we have today roughly 255 district managers across the company, just under 5% of them signed in Onsite. We signed -- I don't know the exact number, but it was around 14 Onsites that year. In 2015, we took a big step forward and around 25% of our district leaders signed in Onsite that year and we signed around 80 Onsites.
In 2016, Fastenal has a hallmark of finding great people, challenging them to be successful, but not micromanaging. In 2016, over 50% -- I believe 54% is the exact number, but over 50% of our district leaders had an Onsite signed in their business, and that translated into 176 signings during the year. Our goal going into 2017 is quite simple: To keep moving that participation up, and for 80% of our district managers or district leaders, to have an Onsite signed in their district. If we're able to accomplish that, we believe we could sign somewhere between 275 and 300 Onsites. We believe that's an achievable number from a signings perspective. It's an absorbable number from an execution standpoint because very much of the work is spread across 255 business units, 2,600 stores not concentrated in 1 small support group. So we're very excited about that.  And we also believe with the CSP 16 in place, the team that helped roll that out is there to also help with the implementation of our Onsite, so we believe we're -- we've improved our capacity to implement.
Finally, we talked about -- excuse me, fourth, we talked about great people close to the customer. 75% of our employees know our customers on a first-name basis, and yet, we have a very efficient cost structure. I don't believe any other nationwide distributor can lay claim to that and we're proud of that fact. 
Finally, the team behind the scene. Our team is strong. We are wired for change and we're frugal. All of these things help us serve our customer well.
I'll close with one thought. We believe in our people. We challenge each other to improve and we challenge each other to grow each day. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Holden, but before Holden starts in, I just want to -- so this is Holden's second earnings call. Many of you know Holden Lewis from his previous career as a sell-side analyst. He'd covered us for quite a few years. We knew Holden well. We're not quick to bring in somebody from the outside into our organization in this senior of a role. But we really liked Holden's ability. We felt he culturally fit with us. And the fact that he can bring a new set of eyes, a new critique and a tremendous skill set to our organization. So with that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

Good morning, and thanks for joining the Fastenal fourth quarter call. I'm going to begin with a quick recap of our full year 2016 results and then I'll move on to a discussion of the quarterly performance. So in 2016, Fastena",1639,"All right. Thank you, Dan. Good morning, and thanks for joining the Fastenal fourth quarter call. I'm going to begin with a quick recap of our full year 2016 results and then I'll move on to a discussion of the quarterly performance. 
So in 2016, Fastenal generated $3.96 billion in sales. That's up 2.4% from 2015. We did have an extra day in the year, so on a days basis, we were up about 2%. I'm not going to belabor the tough conditions that persisted through the year. I feel like that's well understood by you. But I would like to highlight some of the drivers that allowed us to grow despite it. 
First, on vending. We finished 2016 with 62,822 machines, that's about up 7,300 units or 13% over 2015. At this point, 46.1% of our sales now go to customers that use vending, so it's fairly well-represented in the field. Revenues through our machines increased by more than 10% in the fourth quarter. Signings of 18,059 machines were up 1% year-over-year. Note that these figures exclude the nearly 15,000 units that we installed related to our lease locker program. 
Despite all those excesses, vending did not quite reach the goals we'd set forth in 2016, but note that signings were at 3-year high. And we think that with the distractions related to our optimization efforts and the lease locker initiative now past us, we're targeting more than 20,000 signings in 2017. 
Secondly, on our Onsites. We signed 176 new agreements in 2016, a little shy of our goal of 200 but substantially above the 80 that we signed last year. And this, frankly, contributed to driving sales through these sites up at a better than 25% rate for the year. We're gaining momentum here and we are targeting 275 to 300 signings in 2017.
With respect to National Accounts, we signed 190 new agreements, that's up 14% from '15. Even with softness among our largest 100 customers, these signings contributed to our total National Accounts revenues being up by a bit more than 4% on the year. We still see significant opportunity with new and existing customers and even with National Accounts now being about 47% of our total sales. 
Lastly, the SKUs related to our CSP 16 initiative, they also grew at a little bit better than a 4% rate in 2016. So we feel good overall about the strides that we're making in our growth drivers. We remain convinced of their effectiveness in driving share gains, and we look forward to further progress in 2017. 
Margins in 2016 were a challenge. Our gross margin finished the year at 49.6%. That's down 80 basis points, which is primarily from mix and pressure on product margins, the latter being particularly early in the year. Our operating margin finished 2016 at 20.1%, that was down about 130 basis points. 
In addition to the gross margin decline, occupancy was up as we continued to invest in our vending initiative. We're likely to remain challenged by mix in vending-related occupancy, but some of the product pressures that we experienced in the first half of this year have eased at this point. We've been tighter with cost in the second half of '16, and some of the minor expenses for things like store closures or CSP 16 rollout hopefully don't recur. So as a result, we think we're better equipped to defend our margins in a slow growth environment or even expand it if growth accelerates from here, than was the case in 2016. 
Our interest expense on the year roughly doubled, while our average share count was down 1%. Both those facts reflect our share buyback activity over the last 8 quarters. Our tax rate was down from 37.5% to 36.8% in the year, which really just owes to some jurisdictional shifts, as well as the resolution of certain state tax matters. It all blended into a 2016 EPS figure of $1.73, which was down about 2.3% for the year.
Then moving on to the fourth quarter results. Total and daily sales in the fourth quarter were up 2.7%, that's a modest acceleration from the prior 9 months. We can't ignore the easier comparison relative to last year's fourth quarter when our daily sales rate was actually down 2%. Still, the December daily sales were up 3.2%, and that was likely understated because of holiday timing. So in contrast to a poor November, frankly, we consider December to have been as expected. 
Now the details of the quarter remain a bit of a mixed bag. Growth from our top 100 accounts remain flattish on weakness among general industrial companies. The proportion of stores in National Accounts that were growing in the fourth quarter was largely unchanged from the third quarter, and construction fasteners actually weakened in the period. So in the end, growth of 1.6% in North America really wasn't much changed from the prior period. 
On the other hand, it's notable that heavy manufacturing was up 2.3% in the fourth quarter. That's the first time that's been up since the second quarter 2015. Similarly, OEM fasteners were weak but the down 2.8% was also the narrowest decline we've seen since the second quarter of 2015. Further, I would note that there is a more favorable tone surrounding process industries as we enter 2017. 
We're going to continue to assume the sluggish business conditions that have prevailed through '16 are going to continue into '17. But there does remain and there remains a great deal of uncertainty on a number of fronts, but that said, the environment has become more optimistic.
Our gross margin was 49.8% in the fourth quarter, that's down 10 basis points versus the prior year, but it's up 50 basis points against the third quarter. With respect to the year-over-year change, mix continues to weigh as the fasteners fell 180 basis points to now represent 35.6% of our sales. Given this, we view the stability in the period favorably. There was no single meaningful offset. Rather, it was small improvements in areas like purchase discounts and freight that benefited the quarter relative to the prior year.
As it relates to the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see the margin rebound from the third quarter of '16. Similar to the annual result, this is less from a single item than it is from the accumulation of many small but favorable improvements, including better margins on non-fasteners, a higher mix of exclusive brands, building revenue associated with our lease locker program, better purchasing and other variables like that. 
A lot of these things worked in our favor at the gross margin in the fourth quarter but there is nothing in this improvement that strikes us as onetime or temporary in nature. And at this point, we would characterize the margin environment as stable. 
Our operating margin was 19.3% in the fourth quarter, also down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis. SG&A as a percentage of sales was unchanged at 30.6% of revenues. Payroll, which is 65% to 70% of our SG&A, was down 30 basis points as a percentage of sales. Persistently sluggish demand has had 2 effects here: First, it continued to temper the incentive pay in the fourth quarter. Second, we spent much of 2016 letting attrition unwind the rise in staffing we experienced in '15. We finished 2016 with headcount being down 5.4% or down 4.1% on an FTE basis. These variables more than offset the effect of higher health insurance costs.
Occupancy, which is 15% to 20% of total SG&A, was up 30 basis points as a percentage of sales. Vending was the primary catalyst behind this. And we don't expect that dynamic to change in 2017. We did expect efforts to rationalize our store base in the second half of '16 would provide a larger benefit and wound up being the case, and that's going to be a point of emphasis for our company in 2017.
In 2016, we trimmed staffing in stores, we invested in growth drivers and technology and used our balance sheet to invest strategically in inventory. We like where our cost structure sits as we exit the fourth quarter. We're going to continue to invest in our growth drivers, but given the investments and rationalization we've already made, we believe that with a little faster growth, we can leverage the income statement in 2017. 
Finally, we generated $133 million in operating cash in the fourth quarter, that's down 8.5% versus last year. It also represents 116% of the quarter's net income, which is below last year. This decline year-over-year reflects 3 things: First, in the fourth quarter of '16, we took advantage of favorable year-end buys. Second, payables were much higher in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to adding CSP 16 inventory in that period. And then third, our receivables fell at a faster rate in the fourth quarter of '15 due to the relatively sharper pull back in demand in that period. These factors all serve to inflate the cash flow in fourth quarter of '15 relative to fourth quarter of '16.
That said, we generated free cash flow after dividends of $18.5 million. Our capital expenditures are down 23% year-over-year and down 63% sequentially as we wind up the rollout of our lease locker program. As a result, we reduced our net debt by roughly $21 million and retained flexible leverage of net debt being 12.5% of total capital. We expect cash generation to be improved and free cash flow after dividends to be positive in 2017. We don't anticipate a CSP program of the sort that we had in '16, and we expect capital spending to come in around $120 million. 
With that, we'll turn it over to Kevin to take your questions."

So to address your second question first, we all know how the math works. Yes, we've updated the sequentials. As we go into 2017, we're going to begin discussing those sequential rates have changed in terms of the prior 5-year averages as opposed to what we've done historically with '98 -- going from 1998 forward. So the numbers are what the numbers are. I'll let you plug them in and kind of figure out where it is. But I think that you're on the right track in terms of how that should fall out, given those sequential rates of change. On the second question, where we saw the most encouraging signs, I would say, would have been in the process industries. And we go about this a couple of ways. We listen to our regional vice presidents and what they're seeing in the marketplace, and then we look at our top 100 accounts to get a sense of which areas are doing well, which ones are not. And what I would tell you is the general industrial companies on our lists, they're still challenged. That's been the case most of the year. I'm not sure that I saw or have heard any meaningful difference in the fourth quarter as it relates to general industrial firms. As it relates to the process industries, I would tell you that a lot of those, including oil and gas, looked better among our top 100. And then if you sort of listen to some of our RVPs talk about energy, there definitely is more of an enthusiasm and some more encouraging facts on the ground in those regions that are heavier in oil and gas. So what I would tell you is I don't feel like the fourth quarter felt a lot different in a lot of places than what we saw in the third quarter, but the notable exception would have been in those process industries and that oil and gas space. As you know, we were surprised by how impactful the decline in oil and gas was to us when it began to head south a couple of years ago. We would consider it a positive if, in fact, oil and gas had some legs and did better from here, but we'll see how that plays out."

All those things continue a pattern that's been in place for 20 years, and that is our mix of customers are continually changing. Our product mix continues to move a bit away from fasteners. Perhaps we could slow that down a little bit if there is some recovery that helps our fastener business in calendar 2017. But the underlying long-term pattern is still what it is. And what we need to be smart about every day is identifying those pieces we can grab on to and make a little better. A decade ago, a piece we grabbed onto was freight. In the last 5 to 7 years, a piece we've grabbed onto was our exclusive brands, our private labels, and making sure we have a great strategy to support our supplier base and our product mix in serving our customers.

Probably the best way to think about the big picture from a store network standpoint is over the last 20 years, we've been quietly growing Onsite in some of our midwestern business units. So last week, I was in Southern Wisconsin, all of our general managers were in. And in that discussion, one of the things that stands out when I think of our business in Wisconsin and Illinois, close -- over 1/3 of our revenue in that business unit, about 35%, comes through the Onsite type of strategy where we've been incredibly successful over time on developing our business in a broader fashion. But if I think of that business over the last 20 years, we continue to open stores, we continue to grow our footprint. And some of that stem from the fact that we had things going on. We had non-fasteners growing in our business, so a lot of markets that traditionally weren't viable became viable. In more recent years, we made improvements from the vending side of the equation. But we believe long term, it's a huge market out there, number one, and we espouse that often. We're not wed to one strategy. We're wed to getting close to our customer where it economically works and providing them a level of service that our competitors either can't or are unwilling to do. And we believe it's a complement of both. Only time will tell if, structurally, the fact patterns of our industry change and it prompts our ultimate store count to go up or go down. But the market is still there and we need to evolve to serve that market. But history has shown they're very complementary to each other, Onsite and store. In relation to Onsite, it's typically a multiyear endeavor. Part of it is us getting -- it's like anything, it's incremental. So we move -- when we move in, if you will, in the case of an Onsite, it depends sometimes on the product lines we're starting with. It might move faster if we're moving in with an OEM relationship or a broad vending platform relationship. It might move a little slower if it's a broader mix of products and we're picking up particularly commodities as we go along. I believe it's probably, in many cases, a 2- to 4-year endeavor to get in deeper, maybe it's 1 to 5. But it takes time, and that's one of the points that we stressed earlier in the year, is we want to build momentum back into our business. And getting traction in the Onsite is a big piece of that."

And in fact, we do, generally speaking, take some sales out of the store and that becomes the seed revenue for that Onsite. And what we find is that inside 12 to 24 months, that seed revenue has grown dramatically from its original number. As it relates to the store, our expectation generally is that, that store, which now doesn't have to provide a disproportionate service to a single customer, can sort of have it's sort of selling energy reinvigorated, and then they can go out, from an admittedly lower base, begin to grow that business again. And we've sort of altered the compensation with the Onsite business to make it neutral from that standpoint. But the expectation is that the store is sort of no longer responsible for that piece of revenue. We'll go out and find new, active accounts and just begin to grow that business again from that new level."

Obviously, we have a significant operation with Fasco to directly source his product, but that does not rise, it's near the level of 40% to 45%. So the number that we use includes not only the directly sourced, but also that product that we may buy domestically but ultimately is sourced from an overseas customer.

And for us, sufficient history meant they had to be operating at least 9 months. And so we looked at that to see what's happening in that group and we liked what we saw and we weren't surprised by what we saw. We saw a group of accounts. And the numbers that we really analyzed, it was just over 50 of our Onsites that had been operating long enough that we could really get a feel for it. And -- but the trends were solid and it wasn't driven by a few that were pulling it up or pulling it down and -- which is good to see. It was a good performance, generally speaking, across the group. We saw that the gross margin of the store that spawned -- I don't know if that's the right word, but that spawned the Onsite business. Their gross margin went up post separating the business, which is what we would expect, because typically, you're taking a larger customer, it might be a $10,000, a $20,000, a $30,000 month customer and you're extracting it from $100,000, $120,000, $150,000 store. And the remaining business actually has a slightly higher gross margin, so we saw that as we expected. We saw that business with a little bit -- with a lower gross margin than our average Onsite but that is very typical. Because oftentimes, when you're stepping into a new Onsite, you're stepping into some products that you might be not sourcing optimally yet. You might not truly understand some of the products from the standpoint of, and it gets back to that optimal sourcing component. You might have products where you know the optimal source, but you're not going to get the product in for 3, 4, 5, 6 months, and so you have some lower-margin sales that are going out. You might have some product that the customer had a meaningful supply on and you don't pick up that business for a period of time. But when I look at those Onsites that we've studied, again, we were pleased with the results and weren't surprised by the results.

But bear in mind that where that full year impact comes from, companies like Flowserve or Weir Group that are not oil and gas companies, if you will, they're pump companies or engineering companies, but they have significant exposure to the oil and gas within their overall customer mix, that's where our exposure comes from.

When I -- for us, profitability at the end of the day really stems from where's our average store size in that region and how well are we doing managing our operating -- our-  the growth of our business over time? So if I look at the Midwest where we have the greatest concentration of Onsite, it's also an area of the country where we have the largest average store size because it's grown over time because they have -- our West Coast opened up -- started opening up 20 years ago. Our Midwest started opening up 50 years ago. So we have a 25 -- 20- to 30-year head start. And our highest operating margin business is in the Midwest. With that said, one thing Bob Kierlin has always reminded us in the 20 years that I've been here and probably in the 50 years that he's been here, is that at the end of the day, gross margin is a marker we look at to understand our business. Operating margin is a marker we look at to understand our business. But great organizations, long-term, focus on where they can provide their shareholders -- their employees with an opportunity, their customer with the service, and their shareholders with the return on investment. And we like the various businesses within Fastenal because they all provide a very attractive return. And that is, at the end of the day, the ultimate test of a business. And if you're providing opportunities to your employees, you have a great organization to serve your customer long term. We believe we have all those components in our store network and in Onsite.

The -- you will note 2 meaningful changes to our method of reporting from prior quarters, and I attribute that to our CFO and our Chief Accounting Officer really challenging the format which we convey the information. You will find a much more abbreviated press earnings release document. And then something new as we have a short slide deck to supplement the earnings call to help on some of the talking points, I hope you find it useful. 
My comments are going to primarily center on the first 2 pages of commentary, which I believe are Pages 3 and 4 in the book, if you are looking at those pages.
Earlier this morning, and this is typical with every quarter end, at 7 this morning, Central Time, had a call with our regional leaders and our national leaders, talked a bit about the quarter, give them some insight, a little bit about what we are going to cover in the call, but really give some insight on the quarter. I want to touch on a couple of points that were mentioned in that call and into the slide deck. 
The first one, and for those of you that have covered Fastenal for any period of time, you know that we are a sales centered organization, a growth-centered organization. That's been our DNA for 50 years, and 2017 does mark our 50th year in business. The first one centers on establishing goals and hitting goals. In the first quarter of 2017, we came in at roughly 101% of goal, 100.7% is the exact number, but roughly 101% of goal. And we hit or exceeded goal every month for the first quarter. I mentioned that because part of growth is a mindset and attitude. And I think we have a great mindset and a great attitude of going forward of serving our customers at a high level and challenging each other to grow and grow every day, every month, every quarter. And so very pleased with that.
The second item that I felt was noteworthy is, if you look across our 2,400 store locations, our 400 plus Onsite locations, business in general, you always have customers that are going through different aspects in their business cycle. We might be growing handsomely with that customer because we're picking up market share. We might be growing nicely with that customer because their business is expanding. Or we might be contracting with that customer because their business is contracting. And that is true of every one of our stores. So in any given month, a percentage of our stores grow, [indiscernible] percentage of our stores don't. 
In the first quarter, over 60% of our stores or 52% of our stores grew. The last time we did better than that was in the first quarter of 2015. And I say that because as we transition from the first quarter 2015 to the second quarter of 2015, the oil and gas market of which we had meaningful presence collapsed in North America, collapsed globally, but it North America, and our business suffered as a result. So it is good to see us participating from a store-to-store perspective in growth in a way we did before the oil and gas business dramatically slowed.
Getting onto the flipbook here. First item mentioned, demand gains drove daily sales growth of 6%, 6.2% annually. Again our fastest growth since the first quarter of '15 so that my earlier comments go hand in hand. 
Our fastener sales, which are early indicators of the economy in all honesty, have struggled ever since the second quarter of 2015. And that business group, returned to growth in the first quarter. And that business represents over 1/3 of our revenue, about 36%, 37%. 
Our non-fastener business grew at 9.5%, and in the month of March grew almost 12%. So double-digit growth. So very pleased with the trends in our business as it relates to both aspects of Fastenal, fasteners and nonfasteners.
Our pretax earnings grew 5.5%, the fastest rate of growth for us since the second quarter of 2015. We achieved 20 basis points of operating expense leverage. And one thing about our business is we have a tremendous amount of incentive comp, tremendous amount of investments we make made periodically in our business. In 2015, we made dramatic investments and as the economy weakened late in the year, we pulled investments back. And 2016 was a lot about right riding the shift, lowering some operating expenses, improving some operating expenses to set us up for into '17 and '18 and beyond.
I'm pleased by the fact that we had 20 basis points of operating expense leverage. When you consider the fact that incentive comp which was historically low number in 2016, expanded nicely in the first quarter, because our incentive comp expands our gross profit dollars and our earnings dollars grow. And so it expanded nicely and that in gated some of it. And our profit-sharing contribution that goes to our employees in general expanded nicely from Q1 to Q1 despite those natural headwinds, we obtained operating expense leverage.
Very strong cash flow. First quarter is always strong for us as it is for everybody in our industry because of the absence of a large tax payment, but very pleased with it. Our capital spending is at a lower level as we talked about on our first quarter call. Or -- excuse me, our January call. And we didn't have the CSP 16 investment driving our inventory increase. In fact, if you remove the acquisition we did during the quarter, from December to March, our inventory essentially held flat. 
Speaking of acquisition, on the last day of the quarter, we closed our acquisition of Manufacturers Supply Company, or Mansco. It's about a $50 million distributor, so for the next 12 months, we'll enjoy about an extra point of growth from this acquisition.
Looking onto our growth driver update on Page 2, some things I think are noteworthy. We got to a nice start on our Onsite signings. We signed 64 in the first quarter. We currently have 437 active Onsite locations, that's a 51% increase from the 289 we had [ end ] of last year.
And our goal remains to sign 275 to 300 onsites this year, that's a huge goal. Last year, we signed 176, which was more than doubling of the year before, where we had had signed 80.
We also signed 5,437 vending units, that's a 17% increase from first quarter of last year. I didn't go back and look at it in detail, but to those who -- it was either the early part of 2013 or during 2012 when vending initially exploded for us from the standpoint of we really gained traction. It's probably the last time we've signed over 5,000 vending devices in a quarter. So very, very pleased with our start to the year. Our goal is to sign 22,000 to 24,000 for the year and very pleased with that. Probably the only challenge we had is every year there is a certain number of machines that we pull out. And we pulled out some machines in the first quarter. But again, very good traction as we enter the year. And as sales of product our vending machines grew double digits again.
National Accounts grew over 9% during the quarter. We've talked in previous quarters about sales to our top 100 customers. 64 of our top 100 customers grew with us, so that helped our national account number. 
Probably the one challenge point that I see when I look at that is National Accounts represent roughly half of our business and our business grew at 6% and National Accounts grew at 9%, it means the other half of our business is growing in the low single digits, 3% or so. That's a challenge. And you see that challenge shine through a little bit in our gross margin. The one positive in that though is as we exited the quarter, that group of local other customers changed from growing around 3% to about 5.5%. So a nice way to finish the quarter. And one of things that's driving that number up a bit is the CSP investments we made last year. And that group of products are growing about 10.5% in the first quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

Before jumping into the quarterly results, I do want to remind the listeners that Dan said we closed the acquisition of Mansco on March 31. So what this means is our first quarter income statement is not going to reflec",1456,"Great, thank you, and good morning. Before jumping into the quarterly results, I do want to remind the listeners that Dan said we closed the acquisition of Mansco on March 31. So what this means is our first quarter income statement is not going to reflect any of Mansco's revenues across. Our balance sheet will included the assumed working capital and assets. So bear that in mind, and we'll call out, where necessary, when we are moving that information.
But flipping over now to Slide 5. As Dan had covered on Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the first quarter of '17 were up 6.2%, that's a nice acceleration from up 2.7% in the fourth quarter. We do estimate that the benefit of the shift of Good Friday from March into April this year was about a 50 basis point benefit to the quarter. But regardless, even adjusting for this, the first quarter was the strongest that we've seen in the last 2 years. And frankly, that strengthening was also evident through the quarter with March finishing up 8.4%. Now that does probably include about 100, 150 basis points benefit from holiday timing in the month in particular, but again, we just continue to see acceleration during the period.
On Page 5 of the presentation, first to point is the backdrop against which we are operating, it really did continue to improve in the quarter. The purchasing index in the U.S., which still represents 88% of our revenue, that averaged and improved to a pretty healthy reading of 57 in the period. Industrial production returned to growth, was an even stronger showing from key sub components like primary metal, fabricated metal and machinery, areas that are more pertinent to our business. And this broadening of industrial demand was reflected by the fact that, as Dan alluded to, a significant a greater number of our stores were actually growing in the first quarter relative to the 53% to 54% pace they have been set through 2016.
This general improvement showed up in other metrics that we track. Again our fastener line returned to growth, finishing up 0.8% in the quarter. Growth at our largest customers, as reflected by the National Accounts, accelerated to be up 9% in the quarter. And that included up 11.5% in March. Growth among our manufacturing customers accelerated to be up 6.4%. And our construction customers also returned to solid growth being up [4.4% ] in the quarter.
The tone from the regional vice presidents mirror these improvements. There remains a great deal of enthusiasm around oil and gas. And during the quarter, the outlook for the general manufacturing space and the construction space also improved even as the quarter wore on. The only laggard we could see would be manufacturing that's going into transportation markets, things like heavy-duty truck, rail, et cetera. But other than that, frankly on the whole, customer demand strengthened and broadened throughout the quarter and we remain encouraged about the near-term trend. 
Now flipping over to Slide 6. Our gross margin was 49.4% in the first quarter, which is down 40 basis points versus the first quarter last year. Now we've discussed before the ramifications of the relative growth in our nonfastener and large customer mix in the short and intermediate term. And that dynamic probably explains about 30 basis points of the decline in gross margin this quarter. The remaining drag can be attributed to a couple of things.
First, net freight expense remained a challenge in the first quarter. That said, I do want to note that the freight revenue actually rose on an annual basis for the first time since the first quarter of 2015. On top of that, the freight expense is a challenge, we did see the overall expense improved in the first quarter relative to where we were in the fourth quarter and the third quarter last year. So again, that was an impact on our gross margin, but we saw some signs of improvement there. 
Secondly, we did incur some costs in the period related to an inventory tracking initiative that we have in some in some of our non-U.S. markets. These 2 things were partially offset by growth in the sales and margin of our Fastenal brands products. But collectively, if you take the impacts of these latter items, they are relatively modest. And frankly if we ignore mix and just look at our fastener and nonfastener lines, margins were actually stable to slightly higher in the period. 
As it relates it to pricing, there was not any meaningful impact from that source in the first quarter. Now our operating margin was 23.3% in the first quarter, that's down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis. But again, given that our gross margin was down 40 basis points, frankly we believe our organization did a really nice job leveraging operating expenses in the period. 
I'm looking at a couple of numbers to make the point. Employee-related expenses were up 3.7%. This is well below sales growth, and that's despite the increase in bonus comp that Dan referred to and its a result of our being able to grow our revenues with a 1.7% decline in our FTE headcount. Now we did add almost 200 new employees in the first quarter over the fourth. And frankly, if demand remains strong, we would expect that headcount to keep rising. However, we are committed to be disciplined with the headcount and continuing to leverage this line. 
Occupancy-related expenses were only up 1.2% in the quarter. Now we had 146 net store closures since the first quarter of last year, and that includes 23 this first quarter. And that's result in the flattening of the store occupancy expense. The modest increase in cost then is mostly attributable to vending growth. The higher selling transportation-related expenses were influenced by really [ was ] a 23%, 24% increase in the price of diesel and unleaded fuel in the period versus last year. 
The incremental margin in the first quarter was 18.5%. However, we had been able to -- had we been able to hold the gross margin steady, this would have been well north of 20%. And we continue to believe that assuming a stable gross margin, we can achieve 20%, 25% incremental margins at low- to mid-single-digit growth and 25% plus incremental margins at mid- to high single-digit growth in 2017. 
Flipping to Slide 7. We generated $210 million in operating cash in the first quarter. Now first quarters are seasonally stronger as the period tax is not due until April. But by any measure, this was a record for any quarter. The amount also represents 156.8% of the quarter's net income, which is above last year's 131.9%. Better earnings contributed as is working capital, which I'll address in a moment. 
The net CapEx was $19.1 million, and that's down 34% on lower spending on CSP 16 and DC automation. As a result, our first quarter free cash flow was $191 million, up nearly 39%. We used the proceeds to pay down $93 million dividends. We obviously acquired Mansco and we still were able to lower our debt in the period by $25 million to $365 million at the end of Q1. Our debt-to-total capital at the end of the quarter was 15.6%, modestly below the 16.9% a year ago and 16.8% in the forth quarter of '16. We view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business and pay our dividend. 
In terms of the working capital. We are really comfortable with where the numbers came out. Receivables growth, if you exclude Mansco, was up about 6.5% in the quarter, and that was consistent with the growth in sales. Inventory, if you exclude Mansco, was up almost 3% in the first quarter, but it was flattish sequentially. And this reflects the absence of last year's heavy CSP-related inventory investment. It also reflects though just greater productivity from our distribution centers and I think more energy enterprise-wide focusing on this line. Payables, if you exclude Mansco, were down about 19%. Last year's payables reflected the aggressive inventory investment we were making for CSP 16, so we had an easy comp there.
The second quarter of 2017 should have seasonally lower operating cash flow but better earnings in the absence of CSP spending suggest good cash flow for the full year. Similarly, we continue to anticipate lower CapEx in 2017 of approximately $120 million due to less spending on the DC automation and the leased locker. That's all we have for our formal presentation, and with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

Could you just help us understand what the difference is between the high and the low? And then the second part of the question, is you mentioned that if you can keep the gross margin flat, you can get to 25% plus contribution margin. Assuming that this mix shift that's going that's going on is pretty much a secular trend given your growth initiatives, if you are able to keep gross margin flat, what would be the mechanism that would get you there that you haven't been able to achieve over the past several years?"

First off, David, if you've known from prior conversations, the range of margins in our business are quite dramatic, depending on, are you selling something that's relatively low value",516,"I'm going to chime in and help with that question just given my years. First off, David, if you've known from prior conversations, the range of margins in our business are quite dramatic, depending on, are you selling something that's relatively low value, [indiscernible] item or something our store that is I need it right now and price really doesn't matter, I just need that item, to basically brokering a transaction and I'm getting paid a fee for brokering and I'm buying a product or something. so I mean the ranges can be from the teens to 80%, I mean if you really want to get crazy with it. But if you look at the bulk of our business, you really have a range that goes from probably the mid-30s to the low 60s. And our fastener product line runs in the 50s. Our nonfastener products as a group run in the 40s. And I kind of give you some semblance of it. You can see that play out when you're looking at a lot of our competitors in where their gross margins are relative to the products they sell. And the only wildcard I'd throw into that will be the fact that, in our industry, we're a little bit unique in that we've one of the lowest-cost structures for freight. And we all sell a product line of that by and large a lot of items have relatively low value per pound. So freight becomes a big deal and that's a structural advantage we have for years to come. If you look at some of the things that we have done or can do to manage to offset a piece of that mix shift, and I think it's just that we will be able to offset a piece of it over time because we've talked about our Onsite strategy and what that means. Just like we talk about our vending strategy or we talk about our nonfastener strategy, 10 and 20 years ago. All those things, over time, lowered our gross margin. And the way we offset it, one is by better sourcing; one is by structurally challenging ourselves to lower our trucking costs and those the things that we've done very effectively over the last 20 years. The third one is continuing to grow our exclusive brand offerings. And so it's really a case of looking at it and saying, here are our branded supplier offerings and working closely with those brands to grow that business. But over time, I mean, some of those events brands. The other one is having a strategy for our exclusive brands. Today in the nonfastener world, exclusive brands are about 20% of our revenue. If you were looking at that a decade ago, it was probably 10% of our revenue. And I really don't see a reason why that can't be closer to 30% at some point in time. So continuing to challenge and carve out different pieces. And you can bring the cost savings to your customers and improve your gross margin at the same time."

I mean, our growth drivers when you think about Onsite and the and vending and and things like that, they lend themselves to that. So do I think that even we're seeing our growth that it that is a reality each quarter of this year? It is. Now as Dan alluded to, we still hope that there are some things that are going to contribute to somewhat better gross margins. Exclusive brand is something we talk a lot about. I called out the freight a little bit because again, while freight was a bit of a drag in the first quarter, there were some signs that perhaps the freight picture is getting a little bit better. And hopefully as we go into Q2 and Q3, we'll make further strides on that to help us sort of dig into that more structurally decline, if you will. So I think the answer is, yes, that structural mix issue is certainly there. But we think that we have means by which to dig into that, if you will, and improve. Also bear in mind that we're coming into the Q1 gross margin. When we think about the decline versus the fourth quarter, some of that reflected the fact that the fourth quarter was an extremely strong period. And we went and looked at a couple of things. I mean, one thing we looked at was fourth quarter of '16 was up 40 basis points over the third quarter. If you look back historically what fourth quarters typically do against third, sorry that's 5 -- I mean sorry, 50 basis points against it. If you look back historically of what Q4 typically looks like against Q3, it's been more like a 60 basis point decline. And last quarter, we called out we didn't leverage the trucking network as much as the historically perhaps have. We had a number of other things that were small individually but added up that just went our way. So I think a better way to think about the quarter, about the first quarter number is, historically, if you look at how Q1 plays out versus the prior year's Q3, we were actually up 10 basis points versus last year's Q3 and historically we're down a couple -- 20 basis points or so again the [ preceding ] 5 years. So we -- we believe that we should be able to dig more into that structural decline than we did this quarter. But we feel like we're making some progress on the freight, on the EBs and things of that sort. And yes, we don't view this as the degradation in our margin picture by any means."

The other thing is if you look at our -- the $60 million in growth we've had in the last 12 months, 50% of that came from either Onsite or vending.

When I look at the margin in the first quarter, the only thing that I'm troubled by is there's about 10 to 15 basis points in there that I find just personally frustrating.

And again, every year I ignore Q4, whether it's a good or bad number, because I don't think it's indicative much of anything. So yes, the commentary around incremental margins is really to try to make a point that we believe from an operating expense standpoint that we can leverage those lines and that's despite the fact that we are, as we grow, obviously, we have that shock Observer effect coming from incentive comp and that sort of thing, but the point about the sort of the leverage incremental margins is, yes, we feel that we can continue to leverage those lights.

We talked a little bit about how employment grew and occupancy grew from a cost the standpoint. But if you really look at it, when we think about like sales per head for instance, that was up 10% during the quarter, right, because we grew revenue nicely on slightly lower FTE. And that -- those are sort of the keys to how we get the type of incremental margins that we hope to get. But the discussion we've had was really we wanted to address our ability to leverage our operating expenses and tending to hold gross margin flat.

And so it's not so much about you're putting more boxes into a truck. It's those boxes you are putting into the truck, what customer are they going to, what's the nature of the business. If it's -- if it's if it's a box or an item that's going to a vending machine and it's a may be a safety product, it's going to have a different margin profile than if it's a box of fasteners that's going to an MRO user. And so it's really depending on what that box is destined for. The other thing to remainder is, as a distributor, the very large majority of the cost that runs through COGS for us is simply the cost of the product. So there may be pieces within COGS that we can get leverage on, but at the end of the day, the very large majority of what goes through cost on COGS is going to be the cost of the product."

History has said the bulk of that cash we return to our shareholders in the form of dividends. That's the way we've structurally over time. Our earnings -- our dividend release went out last evening, it's a good 10-year history to give you a perspective on that. No secret anyway on this call. Our stock carries an attractive multiple.

Price is something that we just continue to review at this point. Now we obviously have seen some of our competitors take price increases, many of them have talked about it publicly. We've seen charge where prices for metals are clearly up. So it's hard to consider nothing other than the environment today is certainly more inflationary than it's been for quite some time. But that said, Fastenal has the advantage of being a FIFO company with a pretty long supply chain for fasteners, and that means it takes a while for cost to hit our COGS. And that gives us the ability to evaluate how durable the marketplace is for pricing. And if remember last year, there was a time or 2 where we thought pricing could occur and wound up materially for probably demand reasons. And so it's nice to be able to get that sort of look if you will. I think the real question at this point is, if the marketplace in fact does look like it's going to be willing to accept pricing, is that something that we believe we can get to protect our margins and protect our place in the market? And the answer is we think that we can but we do have some time to evaluate it at this point."

Yes, there seems to have been a consensus that has come together through March from our regionals that construction is doing much better. And I think you can see some of that in the growth of the CSP products. I mean, the fact they grew 10% plus in the quarter I think tells you something about construction as well.

But we remain committed to be able to achieve the leverage of the operating -- the operating expenses. And we are going to just keep doing work to try to dig into the structural decline in the gross margin that you start with. And we certainly had that conversation with our regionals and our folks. And so I think that there was some early signs within the freight side and maybe there's some progress there. So we're just going to have to keep working on improving the gross margin metric. But we do anticipate getting leverage. With regards to the headcount, we would expect that to move up as demand goes up, and also as we continue to accelerate our Onsite signings. Onsite signings take some folks in the store and we like to backfill those and really get a lot of energy in that store to keep growing from the new base. And so as growth in our -- growth drivers continue to move up, then we would expect to add heads. But again, we saw some good productivity in Q1.

In the previous calls, we've said south of 6%, 7%, it's difficult with the cost components we had coming out of '15 and into the first part of '16. That picture improves and lowers, that's why you saw our ability to grow our operating expenses roughly 5.5%. And if you think about you have to take a look at what drove the operating expense increase when you look at Q1 to Q1. I often try to put things into some buckets so I can think think of them easier. 25%, 30% of that increase is incentive comp, whether it's in a commission in a store, a bonus pay to somebody outside the store, the profit-sharing contribution, those things that are expanding as our profit growth improves, that really drives our labor increase for now, it's not so much about headcount because the headcount you're adding typically in a period like this, a lot of it is more on the entry level side, so you could manage through that. If you think of what's of the next the biggest group of cost that drove our expense up. We've been it's no secret, we've been increasing our IT spend over a number of years. We have some pieces that are turning training on actually this quarter that will help our store, our Onsite model quite meaningfully. We are turning our new website up in Canada. So there's things that we're turning on that are sizable investments. Those investments we've been making going through our P&L. And the other component when I think about that second bucket, that was a jump from last year, was the fuel that Holden talked about. The big increase in our cost components, that piece of it, normalizes in Q2. Because last year from Q1 to Q2, fuel prices jumped up dramatically, so we'll lap that in Q2, but we haven't lapped it in Q1. The final driver of increases is the continued success we're seeing in vending. We when we had those vending machines, there is an expense that shows up in our occupancy around cost of equipment. So those things are really what's driving it. And outside of that, managing the expense really, really quite well. And so it puts us in a position when we go into the deep part of the year I believe to be able to be more optimistic.
Thanks, everybody. It's about 45, 46 minutes past the hour. Thank you for your interest in Fastenal.

The -- you will note 2 meaningful changes to our method of reporting from prior quarters, and I attribute that to our CFO and our Chief Accounting Officer really challenging the format which we convey the information. You will find a much more abbreviated press earnings release document. And then something new as we have a short slide deck to supplement the earnings call to help on some of the talking points. I hope you find it useful. 
My comments are going to primarily center on the first 2 pages of commentary, which I believe are Pages 3 and 4 on the book, if you're looking at those pages.
Earlier this morning, and this is typical with every quarter end, at 7 this morning, Central Time, had a call with our regional leaders and our national leaders, talked a bit about the quarter, give them some insight, a little bit about what we're going to cover on the call, but really just give some insight on the quarter. I want to touch on a couple of points that were mentioned in that call and then we'll dig into the slide deck. 
The first one, and for those of you that have covered Fastenal for any period of time, you know that we are a sales-centered organization, a growth-centered organization. That's been our DNA for 50 years, and 2017 does mark our 50th year in business. 
The first one centers on establishing goals and hitting goals. In the first quarter of 2017, we came in at roughly 101% of goal, 100.7% is the exact number, but roughly 101% of goal. And we hit or exceeded goal every month for the first quarter. I mentioned that because part of growth is a mindset and attitude. And I think we have a great mindset and a great attitude of going forward of serving our customers at a high level and challenging each other to grow and grow every day, every month, every quarter. And so very pleased with that.
The second item that I felt was noteworthy is, if you look across our 2,400 store locations, our 400-plus Onsite locations, look at our business in general, you always have customers that are going through different aspects in their business cycle. We might be growing handsomely with that customer because we're picking up market share. We might be growing nicely with that customer because their business is expanding. Or we might be contracting with that customer because their business is contracting. And that is true of every one of our stores. So in any given month, a percentage of our stores grow and a percentage of our stores don't. 
In the first quarter, over 60% of our stores -- or 52% of our stores grew. The last time we did better than that was in the first quarter of 2015. And I cite that because as we transition from the first quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015, the oil and gas market of which we had a meaningful presence collapsed in North America, collapsed globally, but collapsed in North America, and our business suffered as a result. So it's good to see us participating from a store-to-store perspective in growth in a way we did before the oil and gas business dramatically slowed.
Getting onto the flipbook here. First item mentioned, demand gains drove daily sales growth of 6%, 6.2% annually. Again our fastest growth since the first quarter of '15 so that my earlier comments go hand in hand. Our fastener sales, which are really indicators of the economy in all honesty, have struggled ever since the second quarter of 2015. And that business grew, returned to growth in the first quarter. And that business represents over 1/3 of our revenue, about 36%, 37%. 
Our non-fastener business grew at 9.5%, and in the month of March, grew almost 12%. So double-digit growth. So very pleased with the trends in our business as it relates to both aspects of Fastenal, fasteners and non-fasteners.
Our pretax earnings grew 5.5%, the fastest rate of growth for us since the second quarter of '15. We achieved 20 basis points of operating expense leverage. And one thing about our business is we have a tremendous amount of incentive comp, a tremendous amount of investments we make periodically in our business. In 2015, we made dramatic investments, and as the economy weakened late in the year, we pulled those investments back. In 2016, it was a lot about riding the ship, lowering some operating expenses, improving some operating expenses to set us up for -- into '17 and '18 and beyond.
I'm pleased by the fact that we had 20 basis points of operating expense leverage. When you consider the fact that incentive comp, which that was a historically low number in 2016, expanded nicely in the first quarter, because our incentive comp expands as our gross profit dollars and our earnings dollars grow. And so it expanded nicely and that aid in to some of it. And our profit-sharing contribution that goes to our employees in general expanded nicely from Q1 to Q1. Despite those natural headwinds, we obtained operating expense leverage.
Very strong cash flow. First quarter is always strong for us as it is for everybody in our industry because of the absence of a large tax payment, but very pleased with it. Our capital spending is at a lower level as we'd talked about on our first quarter call. Or -- excuse me, our January call. And we didn't have the CSP 16 investment driving our inventory increase. In fact, if you remove the acquisition we did during the quarter, from December to March, our inventory essentially held flat. 
Speaking of acquisition, on the last day of the quarter, we closed our acquisition of Manufacturers Supply Company, or Mansco. It's about a $50 million distributor, so for the next 12 months, we'll enjoy about an extra point of growth from this acquisition.
Flipping onto our growth driver update on Page 2, some things I think are noteworthy. We got to a nice start on our Onsite signings. We signed 64 in the first quarter. We currently have 437 active Onsite locations. That's a 51% increase from the 289 we had in the last year. And our goal remains to sign 275 to 300 Onsites this year. That's a huge goal. Last year, we signed 176, which was more than doubling of the year before, where we had had signed 80.
We also signed 5,437 vending units. That's a 17% increase from first quarter of last year. I didn't go back and look at it in detail, but those -- it was either the early part of 2013 or during 2012 when vending initially exploded for us from the standpoint of we really gained traction. It's probably the last time we've signed over 5,000 vending devices in a quarter. So very, very pleased with our start to the year. Our goal is to sign 22,000 to 24,000 for the year and very pleased with that. Probably the only challenge we had is, every year, there's a certain number of machines that we pull out. And we pulled out some machines in the first quarter. But again, very good traction as we enter the year and as sales of product through our vending machines grew double digits again.
National Accounts grew over 9% during the quarter. We've talked in previous quarters about sales to our top 100 customers. 64 of our top 100 customers grew with us, so that helped our national account number. 
Probably the one challenge point that I see when I look at that is if our -- if National Accounts represent roughly half our business and our business grew at 6% and National Accounts grew at 9%, it means the other half of our business is growing in the low single digits, 3% or so. That's a challenge. And you see that challenge shine through a little bit in our gross margin. The one positive in that though is as we exited the quarter, that group of local other customers changed from growing around 3% to about 5.5%. So a nice way to finish the quarter. And one of the things that's driving that number up a bit is the CSP investments we made last year. And that group of products are growing about 10.5% in the first quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

Before jumping into the quarterly results, I do want to remind the listeners that Dan said we closed the acquisition of Mansco on March 31.

Before jumping into the quarterly results, I do want to remind the listeners that Dan said we closed the acquisition of Mansco on March 31. So what this means is our first quarter income statement is not going to reflect any of Mansco's revenues or costs, but our balance sheet will include the assumed working capital asset. So bear that in mind, and we'll call out where necessary, when we're moving that information.
But flipping over now to Slide 5. As Dan had covered on Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the first quarter of '17 were up 6.2%. That's a nice acceleration from up 2.7% in the fourth quarter. We do estimate that the benefit of the shift of Good Friday from March into April this year was about a 50 basis point benefit to the quarter. But regardless, even adjusting for this, the first quarter was the strongest that we've seen in the last 2 years. And frankly, that strengthening was also evident through the quarter, with March finishing up 8.4%. Now that does probably include about 100, 150 basis points benefit from holiday timing in the month in particular. But again, we just continue to see acceleration during the period.
On Page 5 of the presentation. First, the point is that the backdrop against which we're operating, it really did continue to improve in the quarter. The Purchasing Managers' Index in the U.S., which still represents 88% of our revenue, that averaged and improved to a pretty healthy reading of 57 in the period. Industrial production returned to growth, with an even stronger showing from key sub components like primary metal, fabricated metal and machinery, areas that are more pertinent to our business. And this broadening of industrial demand was reflected by the fact that, as Dan alluded to, a significant a greater number of our stores were actually growing in the first quarter relative to the 53% to 54% pace they have been set through 2016.
This general improvement showed up in other metrics that we track. Again, our fastener line returned to growth, finishing up 0.8% in the quarter. Growth at our largest customers, as reflected by the National Accounts, accelerated to be up 9% in the quarter. And that included up 11.5% in March. Growth among our manufacturing customers accelerated to be up 6.4%. And our construction customers also returned to solid growth being up 4% in the quarter.
The tone from the regional vice presidents mirror these improvements. There remains a great deal of enthusiasm around oil and gas. And during the quarter, the outlook for the general manufacturing space and the construction space also improved even as the quarter wore on. The only laggard we could see would be manufacturing that's going into transportation markets, things like heavy-duty truck, rail, et cetera. But other than that, frankly, on the whole, customer demand strengthened and broadened throughout the quarter, and we remain encouraged about the near-term trend. 
Now flipping over to Slide 6. Our gross margin was 49.4% in the first quarter, which is down 40 basis points versus the first quarter last year. Now we've discussed before the ramifications of the relative growth in our non-fastener and large customer mix in the short and intermediate term. And that dynamic probably explains about 30 basis points of the decline in gross margin this quarter. 
The remaining drag can be attributed to a couple of things. First, net freight expense remained a challenge in the first quarter. That said, I do want to note that the freight revenue actually rose on an annual basis for the first time since the first quarter of 2015. On top of that, while the freight expense is a challenge, we did see the overall expense improved in the first quarter relative to where we were in the fourth quarter and the third quarter of last year. So again, that was an impact on our gross margin, but we saw some signs of improvement there. 
Secondly, we did incur some costs in the period related to an inventory tracking initiative that we have in some in some of our non-U.S. markets. These 2 things were partly offset by growth in the sales and margin of our Fastenal brands products. But collectively, if you take the impacts of these latter items, they are relatively modest. And frankly, if we ignore mix and just look at our fastener and non-fastener lines, margins were actually stable to slightly higher in the period.  As it relates it to pricing, there was not any meaningful impact from that source in the first quarter. 
Now our operating margin was 20.3% in the first quarter. That's down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis. But again, given that our gross margin was down 40 basis points, frankly, we believe our organization did a really nice job leveraging operating expenses in the period. 
I'm looking at a couple of numbers to make the point. Employee-related expenses were up 3.7%. This is well below sales growth. And that's despite the increase in bonus comp that Dan referred to, and its a result of our being able to grow our revenues with a 1.7% decline in our FTE headcount. I know we did add almost 200 new employees in the first quarter over the fourth. And frankly, if demand remains strong, we would expect that headcount to keep rising. However, we are committed to be disciplined with the headcount and continuing to leverage this line. 
Occupancy-related expenses were only up 1.2% in the quarter. Now we had 146 net store closures since the first quarter of last year. It includes 23 this first quarter. And that resulted in the flattening of the store occupancy expense. The modest increase in cost then is mostly attributable to vending growth. The higher selling transportation-related expenses were influenced by really with a 23%, 24% increase in the price of diesel and unleaded fuel in the period versus last year. 
The incremental margin in the first quarter was 18.5%. However, we had been able to -- had we been able to hold the gross margin steady, this would have been well north of 20%. And we continue to believe that, assuming a stable gross margin, we can achieve 20%, 25% incremental margins at low to mid-single-digit growth and 25% plus incremental margins at mid- to high single-digit growth in 2017. 
Flipping to Slide 7. We generated $210 million in operating cash in the first quarter. Now first quarters are seasonally stronger as the period's tax is not due until April. But by any measure, this was a record for any quarter. The amount also represents 156.8% of the quarter's net income, which is above last year's 131.9%. Better earnings contributed as is working capital, which I'll address in a moment. 
The net CapEx was $19.1 million, and that's down 34% on lower spending on CSP 16 and DC automation. As a result, our first quarter free cash flow was $191 million, up nearly 39%. We used the proceeds to pay down $93 million -- or to pay $93 million dividends. We obviously acquired Mansco, and we still were able to lower our debt in the period by $25 million to $365 million at the end of Q1. 
Our debt-to-total capital at the end of the quarter was 15.6%, modestly below the 16.9% a year ago and 16.8% in the forth quarter of '16. We view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized, with ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business and pay our dividend. 
In terms of the working capital. We're really comfortable with where the numbers came out. Receivables growth, if you exclude Mansco, was up about 6.5% in the quarter, and that was consistent with the growth in sales. Inventory, if you exclude Mansco, was up almost 3% in the first quarter, but it was flattish sequentially. And this reflects the absence of last year's heavy CSP-related inventory investment. It also reflects though just greater productivity from our distribution centers, and I think more energy enterprise-wide focusing on this line. Payables, if you exclude Mansco, were down about 19%. Last year's payables reflected the aggressive inventory investment we were making for CSP 16, so we had an easy comp there.
The second quarter of 2017 should have seasonally lower operating cash flow, but better earnings in the absence of CSP spending suggest good cash flow for the full year. Similarly, we continue to anticipate lower CapEx in 2017 of approximately $120 million due to less spending on the DC automation and the leased lockers. 
That's all we have for our formal presentation, and with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

First off, David, if you've known from prior conversations, the range of margins in our business are quite dramatic, depending on, are you selling something that's a relatively low value, a [indiscernible] item or something in our store that is, I need it right now and price really doesn't matter, I just need that item, to I'm basically brokering a transaction and I'm getting paid a fee for brokering, and I'm buying a palette of this product or something. So I mean, the ranges can be from the teens to 80%. I mean, if you really want to get crazy with it. But if you look at the bulk of our business, you really have a range that goes from probably the mid-30s to the low 60s. And our fastener product line runs in the 50s. Our non-fastener products as a group run in the 40s. And I kind of give you some semblance of it. And you can see that play out when you're looking at a lot of our competitors in where their gross margins are and relative to the products they sell. And the only wildcard I'd throw into that would be the fact that, in our industry, we're a little bit unique in that we have one of the lowest cost structures for freight. And we all sell a product line that by and large a lot of items have relatively low value per pound. So freight becomes a big deal, and that's a structural advantage we have for years to come. If you look at some of the things that we have done or can do to manage to offset a piece of that makeshift. And I think it's just that we will be able to offset a piece of it over time because -- we've talked about our Onsite strategy and what that means. Just like we talked about our vending strategy or we talked about our non-fastener strategy, 10 and 20 years ago. All those things, over time, lowered our gross margin. And the way we offset it, one is by better sourcing; one is by structurally challenging ourselves to lower our trucking costs. And those are things we've done very effectively over the last 20 years. A third one is continuing to grow our exclusive brand offerings. And so it's really a case of looking at it and saying, here are our branded supplier offerings and working closely with those brands to grow that business. But over time, maybe narrow some of those brands, [indiscernible] brands. The other one is having a strategy for our exclusive brands. Today in the non-fastener world, exclusive brands are about 20% of our revenue. If you were looking at that a decade ago, it was probably 10% of our revenue. And I really don't see a reason why that can't be closer to 30% at some point in time. So continuing to challenge and carve out different pieces, and you can bring the cost savings to your customer and improve your gross margin at the same time."

I mean, our growth drivers, when you think about Onsite and safety and vending and and things like that, I mean, they lend themselves to that. So do I think that given where we're seeing our growth that, that is a reality each quarter of this year? It is. Now, as Dan alluded to, we still hope that there are some things that are going to contribute to somewhat better gross margins. Exclusive brand is something we talk a lot about. I called out the freight a little bit because again, while freight was a bit of a drag in the first quarter, there were some signs that perhaps the freight picture is getting a little bit better. And hopefully as we go into Q2 and Q3, we'll make further strides on that to help us sort of dig into that more structural decline, if you will. So I think the answer is, yes. That structural mix issue is certainly there. But we think that we have means by which to dig into that, if you will, and improve. Also bear in mind that we're coming into the Q1 gross margin, when we think about the decline versus the fourth quarter, some of that reflected the fact that the fourth quarter was an extremely strong period. And we went and looked at a couple of things. I mean, one thing we looked at was, fourth quarter of '16 was up 40 basis points over the third quarter. If you look back historically what fourth quarters typically do against third, sorry that's 5 -- I'm sorry, 50 basis points against it. If you look back historically what Q4 typically looks like against Q3, it's been more like a 60 basis point decline. And last quarter, we called out, we didn't leverage the trucking network as much as we historically perhaps have, and we had a number of other things that were small individually but added up that just went our way. And so I think a better way to think about the quarter -- about the first quarter number is, historically, if you look at how Q1 plays out versus the prior year's Q3, we were actually up 10 basis points versus last year's Q3, and historically, we're down a couple -- 20 basis points or so, again, the preceding 5 years. So we believe that we should be able to dig more into that structural decline than we did this quarter. But we feel like we're making some progress on the freight, on the EBs and things of that sort. And yes, we're -- we don't view this as a degradation in our margin picture by any means."

And again, every year I ignore Q4, whether it's a good or bad number, because I don't think it's indicative much of anything. So yes, the commentary around the incremental margins is really to try to make a point that we believe from an operating expense standpoint that we can leverage those lines. And that's despite the fact that we are, as we grow, obviously, we have that shock absorber effect coming from incentive comp and that sort of thing. But the point about the sort of the leverage, those incremental margins is, we feel that we can continue to leverage those lines.

The -- we talked a little bit about how employment grew and occupancy grew from a cost standpoint. But if you really look at it, when we think about like sales per head for instance, that was up 10% during the quarter, right, because we grew revenues nicely on slightly lower FTE. And that's -- those are sort of the keys to how we get the type of incremental margins that we hope to get. But the discussion that we've had was really we wanted to address our ability to leverage our operating expenses and tending to hold gross margin flat.

And so it's not so much about you're putting more boxes into a truck. It's those boxes you're putting into the truck, what customer are they going to, what's the nature of the business. If it's a box or an item that's going into a vending machine and it's a -- maybe it's a safety product, it's going to have a different margin profile than if it's a box of fasteners that's going into an MRO user. And so it's really depending on what that box is destined for. The other thing to remember is, as a distributor, the very large majority of the cost that runs through COGS for us is simply the cost of the product. So there may be pieces within COGS that we can get leverage on, but at the end of the day, the very large majority of what goes through cost on COGS is going to be the cost of the product."

Now we obviously have seen some of our competitors take price increases. Many of them have talked about it publicly. We've seen charge where prices for metals are clearly up. So it's hard to conclude anything other than the environment today is certainly more inflationary than it's been for quite some time. But that said, Fastenal has the advantage of being a FIFO company with a pretty long supply chain for fasteners, and that means it takes a while for cost to hit our COGS. And that gives us the ability to evaluate how durable the marketplace is for pricing. And if you remember, last year, there was a time or 2 where we thought pricing could occur and then it wound up not materializing for probably demand reasons. And so it's nice to be able to get that sort of look, if you will. I think the real question at this point is, if the marketplace in fact does look like it's going to be willing to accept pricing, is that something that we believe we can get to protect our margins and protect our place in the market? And the answer is, we think that we can, but we do have some time to evaluate it at this point."

And frankly, through March, that continues to be the case, and I think there remains enthusiasm from that area. But what we began to see begin to gain some real excitement as we exited February and then into March was the manufacturing side. And frankly, the construction side. There seems to have been a consensus that has come together through March from our regionals that construction is doing much better. And I think you can see some of that in the growth of the CSP products. I mean, the fact they grew 10% plus in the quarter, I think, tells you something about construction as well. So the -- even as recently as December, the marketplace didn't feel that great.

But we remain committed to be able to achieve the leverage of the operating  expenses. And we're going to just keep doing work to try to dig into the structural decline in the gross margin that you start with. And we certainly have had that conversation with our regionals and our folks. And so I think that there were some early signs within the freight side, and maybe there's some progress there. So we're just going to have to keep working on improving the gross margin metric. But we do anticipate getting leverage. With regards to the headcount, we would expect that to move up as demand goes up, and also as we continue to accelerate our Onsite signings. We -- Onsite signings take some folks in the store, and we like to backfill those and really get a lot of energy in that store to keep growing from the new base. And so as growth in our -- growth drivers continue to move up, then we would expect to add heads. But again, we saw some good productivity in Q1.

In the previous calls, we've said south of 6%, 7%, it's difficult with the cost components we had coming out of '15 and into the first part of '16. That picture improves and lowers at some, and that's why you saw our ability to grow our operating expenses roughly 5.5%. And if you think about that, you have to take a look at what drove the operating expense increase when you look at Q1 to Q1. I often try to pull things into some buckets so I can think of them easier. 25%, 30% of that increase is incentive comp, whether it's in a commission at a store, a bonus pay to somebody outside the store, the profit-sharing contribution, those things that are expanding as our profit growth improves, that's really what drives our labor increase right now. It's not so much about headcount because the headcount you're adding typically in a period like this, a lot of it is more on the entry level side, so you could manage through that. If you think of what's the next the biggest group of cost that drove our expense up. We've been -- it's no secret, we've been increasing our IT spend over a number of years. We have some pieces that are turning on actually this quarter that will help our store, our Onsite model quite meaningfully. We're turning on our new website up in Canada. So there's things that we're turning on that are sizable investments. Those investments we've been making have been going through our P&L. And the other component when I think about that second bucket that was a jump from last year, was the fuel that Holden talked about. The big increase in our cost component, that piece of it, normalizes in Q2. Because last year, from Q1 to Q2, fuel prices jumped up dramatically, so we'll lap that in Q2, but we haven't lapped it in Q1. The final driver of increases is the continued success we're seeing in vending. We when we had those vending machines, there's an expense that shows up in our occupancy around the cost of equipment. So those things are really what's driving it. And outside of that, managing the expense really, really quite well. And so it puts us in a position when we go into the deep part of the year, I believe, to be a little bit more optimistic.
Thanks, everybody. It's about 45, 46 minutes past the hour. Thank you for your interest in Fastenal. I'll close the way I started.

My comments are going to primarily center on the first 2 pages of commentary, which I believe are Pages 3 and 4 in the book, if you're looking at those pages.
Earlier this morning, and this is typical with every quarter end, at 7 this morning, Central Time, had a call with our regional leaders and our national leaders: Talk a bit about the quarter, give them some insight, a little bit about what we're going to cover on the call, but really just give some insight on the quarter. I want to touch on a couple of points that were mentioned in that call and then we'll dig into the slide deck. 
The first one, and for those of you that have covered Fastenal for any period of time, you know that we are a sales-centered organization, a growth-centered organization. That's been our DNA for 50 years, and 2017 does mark our 50th year in business. 
The first one centers on establishing goals and hitting goals. In the first quarter of 2017, we came in at roughly 101% of goal, 100.7% is the exact number, but roughly 101% of goal. And we hit or exceeded goal every month for the first quarter. I mention that because part of growth is a mind-set, an attitude. And I think we have a great mind-set and a great attitude of going forward, of serving our customers at a high level and challenging each other to grow and grow every day, every month, every quarter. And so very pleased with that.
The second item that I felt was noteworthy is, if you look across our 2,400 store locations, our 400-plus Onsite locations, look at our business in general, you always have customers that are going through different aspects in their business cycle. We might be growing handsomely with that customer because we're picking up market share. We might be growing nicely with that customer because their business is expanding. Or we might be contracting with that customer because their business is contracting. And that is true of every one of our stores. So in any given month, a percentage of our stores grow and a percentage of our stores don't. 
In the first quarter, over 60% of our stores, about 62% of our stores grew. The last time we did better than that was in the first quarter of 2015. And I cite that because as we transitioned from the first quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015, the oil and gas market of which we had a meaningful presence collapsed in North America, collapsed globally, but collapsed in North America, and our business suffered as a result. So it's good to see us participating from a store-to-store perspective in growth in a way we did before the oil and gas business dramatically slowed.
Getting onto the flipbook here. First item mentioned, demand gains drove daily sales growth of 6%, 6.2% annually. Again our fastest growth since the first quarter of '15 so that my earlier comments go hand in hand. Our fastener sales, which are really indicators of the economy in all honesty, have struggled ever since the second quarter of 2015. And that business grew, returned to growth in the first quarter. And that business represents over 1/3 of our revenue, about 36%, 37%. 
Our non-fastener business grew at 9.5%, and in the month of March, grew almost 12%. So double-digit growth. So very pleased with the trends in our business as it relates to both aspects of Fastenal, fasteners and non-fasteners.
Our pretax earnings grew 5.5%. It's the fastest rate of growth for us since the second quarter of '15. We achieved 20 basis points of operating expense leverage. And one thing about our business is we have a tremendous amount of incentive comp, a tremendous amount of investments we make periodically in our business. In 2015, we made dramatic investments, and as the economy weakened late in the year, we pulled those investments back. In 2016, it was a lot about righting the ship, lowering some operating expenses, improving some operating expenses to set us up for -- into '17 and '18 and beyond.
I'm pleased by the fact that we had 20 basis points of operating expense leverage. When you consider the fact that incentive comp, which that was a historically low number in 2016, expanded nicely in the first quarter, because our incentive comp expands as our gross profit dollars and our earnings dollars grow. And so it expanded nicely, and that ate in to some of it. And our profit-sharing contribution that goes to our employees in general expanded nicely from Q1 to Q1. Despite those natural headwinds, we obtained operating expense leverage.
Very strong cash flow. First quarter is always strong for us as it is for everybody in our industry because of the absence of a large tax payment, but very pleased with it. Our capital spending is at a lower level as we'd talked about on our first quarter call. Or -- excuse me, our January call. And we didn't have the CSP 16 investment driving our inventory increase. In fact, if you remove the acquisition we did during the quarter, from December to March, our inventory essentially held flat. 
Speaking of acquisition, on the last day of the quarter, we closed our acquisition of Manufacturers Supply Company, or Mansco. It's about a $50 million distributor, so for the next 12 months, we'll enjoy about an extra point of growth from this acquisition.
Flipping onto our growth driver update on Page 2, some things I think are noteworthy. We got to a nice start on our Onsite signings. We signed 64 in the first quarter. We currently have 437 active Onsite locations. That's a 51% increase from the 289 we had at the end of last year. And our goal remains to sign 275 to 300 Onsites this year. That's a huge goal. Last year, we signed 176, which was more than doubling of the year before, where we had signed 80.
We also signed 5,437 vending units. That's a 17% increase from first quarter of last year. I didn't go back and look at it in detail, but those -- it was either the early part of 2013 or during 2012 when vending initially exploded for us from the standpoint of we really gained traction. It's probably the last time we've signed over 5,000 vending devices in a quarter. So very, very pleased with our start to the year. Our goal is to sign 22,000 to 24,000 for the year and very pleased with that. Probably the only challenge we had is, every year, there's a certain number of machines that we pull out. And we pulled out some machines in the first quarter. But again, very good traction as we enter the year and as sales of product through our vending machines grew double digits again.
National Accounts grew over 9% during the quarter. We've talked in previous quarters about sales to our top 100 customers. 64 of our top 100 customers grew with us, so that helped our national account number. 
Probably the one challenge point that I see when I look at that is if our -- if National Accounts represent roughly half our business and our business grew at 6% and National Accounts grew at 9%, it means the other half of our business is growing in the low single digits, 3% or so. That's a challenge. And you see that challenge shine through a little bit in our gross margin. The one positive in that though is as we exit the quarter, that group of local other customers changed from growing around 3% to about 5.5%. So a nice way to finish the quarter. And one of the things that's driving that number up a bit is the CSP investments we made last year. And that group of products are growing about 10.5% in the first quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."
270747,424837013,1170083,"Fastenal Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 12, 2017",2017-04-12,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","Great, thank you, and good morning. Before jumping into the quarterly results, I do want to remind the listeners that as Dan said we closed the acquisition of Mansco on March 31. So what this means is our first quarter income statement is not going to ref",1463,"Great, thank you, and good morning. Before jumping into the quarterly results, I do want to remind the listeners that as Dan said we closed the acquisition of Mansco on March 31. So what this means is our first quarter income statement is not going to reflect any of Mansco's revenues or costs, but our balance sheet will include the assumed working capital asset. So bear that in mind, and we'll call out where necessary, when we're removing that information.
But flipping over now to Slide 5. As Dan had covered on Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the first quarter of '17 were up 6.2%. That's a nice acceleration from up 2.7% in the fourth quarter. We do estimate that the benefit of the shift of Good Friday from March into April this year was about a 50 basis point benefit to the quarter. But regardless, even adjusting for this, the first quarter was the strongest that we've seen in the last 2 years. And frankly, that strengthening was also evident through the quarter, with March finishing up 8.4%. Now that does probably include about 100, 150 basis points benefit from holiday timing in the month in particular. But again, we just continued to see acceleration during the period.
On Page 5 of the presentation. First, the point is that the backdrop against which we're operating, it really did continue to improve in the quarter. The Purchasing Managers' Index in the U.S., which still represents 88% of our revenue, that averaged and improved to a pretty healthy reading of 57 in the period. Industrial production returned to growth, with an even stronger showing from key sub components like primary metal, fabricated metal and machinery, areas that are more pertinent to our business. And this broadening of industrial demand was reflected by the fact that, as Dan alluded to, a significantly greater number of our stores were actually growing in the first quarter relative to the 53% to 54% pace they have been set through 2016.
This general improvement showed up in other metrics that we track. Again, our fastener line returned to growth, finishing up 0.8% in the quarter. Growth at our largest customers, as reflected by the National Accounts, accelerated to be up 9% in the quarter. And that included up 11.5% in March. Growth among our manufacturing customers accelerated to be up 6.4%. And our construction customers also returned to solid growth, being up 4% in the quarter.
The tone from the regional vice presidents mirror these improvements. There remains a great deal of enthusiasm around oil and gas. And during the quarter, the outlook for the general manufacturing space and the construction space also improved even as the quarter wore on. The only laggard we could see would be manufacturing that's going into transportation markets, things like heavy-duty truck, rail, et cetera. But other than that, frankly, on the whole, customer demand strengthened and broadened throughout the quarter, and we remain encouraged about the near-term trend. 
Now flipping over to Slide 6. Our gross margin was 49.4% in the first quarter, which is down 40 basis points versus the first quarter last year. Now we've discussed before the ramifications of the relative growth in our non-fastener and large customer mix in the short and intermediate term. And that dynamic probably explains about 30 basis points of the decline in gross margin this quarter. 
The remaining drag can be attributed to a couple of things. First, net freight expense remained a challenge in the first quarter. That said, I do want to note that the freight revenue actually rose on an annual basis for the first time since the first quarter of 2015. On top of that, while the freight expense is a challenge, we did see the overall expense improve in the first quarter relative to where we were in the fourth quarter and the third quarter of last year. So again, that was an impact on our gross margin, but we saw some signs of improvement there. 
Secondly, we did incur some costs in the period related to an inventory tracking initiative that we have in some in some of our non-U.S. markets. These 2 things were partly offset by growth in the sales and margin of our Fastenal brands products. But collectively, if you take the impacts of these latter items, they were relatively modest. And frankly, if we ignore mix and just look at our fastener and non-fastener lines, margins were actually stable to slightly higher in the period.  As it relates it to pricing, there was not any meaningful impact from that source in the first quarter. 
Now our operating margin was 20.3% in the first quarter. That's down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis. But again, given that our gross margin was down 40 basis points, frankly, we believe our organization did a really nice job leveraging operating expenses in the period. 
I'm looking at a couple of numbers to make the point. Employee-related expenses were up 3.7%. This is well below sales growth. And that's despite the increase in bonus comp that Dan referred to, and it's a result of our being able to grow our revenues with a 1.7% decline in our FTE headcount. Now we did add almost 200 new employees in the first quarter over the fourth. And frankly, if demand remains strong, we would expect that headcount to keep rising. However, we are committed to being disciplined with the headcount and continuing to leverage this line. 
Occupancy-related expenses were only up 1.2% in the quarter. Now we've had 146 net store closures since the first quarter of last year, and that includes 23 this first quarter. And that's resulted in the flattening of the store occupancy expense. The modest increase in cost then is mostly attributable to vending growth. The higher selling transportation-related expenses were influenced by -- really it was a 23%, 24% increase in the price of diesel and unleaded fuel in the period versus last year. 
The incremental margin in the first quarter was 18.5%. However, we had been able to -- had we been able to hold the gross margin steady, this would have been well north of 20%. And we continue to believe that, assuming a stable gross margin, we can achieve 20%, 25% incremental margins at low to mid-single-digit growth and 25% plus incremental margins at mid- to high single-digit growth in 2017. 
Flipping to Slide 7. We generated $210 million in operating cash in the first quarter. Now first quarters are seasonally stronger as the period's tax is not due until April. But by any measure, this was a record for any quarter. The amount also represents 156.8% of the quarter's net income, which is above last year's 131.9%. Better earnings contributed as did working capital, which I'll address in a moment. 
The net CapEx was $19.1 million, and that's down 34% on lower spending on CSP 16 and DC automation. As a result, our first quarter free cash flow was $191 million, up nearly 39%. We used the proceeds to pay down $93 million -- or to pay $93 million in dividends. We obviously acquired Mansco, and we still were able to lower our debt in the period by $25 million to $365 million at the end of Q1. 
Our debt-to-total capital at the end of the quarter was 15.6%, modestly below the 16.9% a year ago and 16.8% in fourth quarter of '16. We view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized, with ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business and pay our dividend. 
In terms of the working capital. We're really comfortable with where the numbers came out. Receivables growth, if you exclude Mansco, was up about 6.5% in the quarter, and that was consistent with the growth in sales. Inventory, if you exclude Mansco, was up almost 3% in the first quarter, but it was flattish sequentially. And this reflects the absence of last year's heavy CSP-related inventory investment. It also reflects though just greater productivity from our distribution centers, and I think more energy enterprise-wide focusing on this line. Payables, if you exclude Mansco, were down about 19%. Last year's payables reflected the aggressive inventory investment we were making for CSP 16, so we had an easy comp there.
The second quarter of 2017 should have seasonally lower operating cash flow, but better earnings and the absence of CSP spending suggest good cash flow for the full year. Similarly, we continue to anticipate lower CapEx in 2017 of approximately $120 million due to less spending on the DC automation and the leased lockers. 
That's all we have for our formal presentation, and with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

First off, David, if you've known from prior conversations, the range of margins in our business are quite dramatic, depending on, are you selling something that's",535,"I'm going to chime in and help Holden out a little with that question just given my years. First off, David, if you've known from prior conversations, the range of margins in our business are quite dramatic, depending on, are you selling something that's a relatively low value, a convenience pack item or something in our store that is, I need it right now and price really doesn't matter, I just need that item; to I'm basically brokering a transaction, and I'm getting paid a fee for brokering and I'm buying a palette of this product or something. So I mean, the ranges can be from the teens to 80%. I mean, if you really want to get crazy with it. But if you look at the bulk of our business, you really have a range that goes from probably the mid-30s to the low 60s. And our fastener product line runs in the 50s. Our non-fastener products as a group run in the 40s. And that kind of gives you some semblance of it. And you can see that play out when you're looking at a lot of our competitors in where their gross margins are and relative to the products they sell. And the only wildcard I'd throw into that would be the fact that, in our industry, we're a little bit unique in that we have one of the lowest cost structures for freight. And we all sell a product line that by and large a lot of items have relatively low value per pound. So freight becomes a big deal, and that's a structural advantage we have for years to come. If you look at some of the things that we have done or can do to manage to offset a piece of that mix-shift, and I think it's just that: we will be able to offset a piece of it over time because -- we've talked about our Onsite strategy and what that means. Just like we talked about our vending strategy or we talked about our non-fastener strategy, 10 and 20 years ago. All those things, over time, lowered our gross margin. And the way we offset it, one is by better sourcing; one is by structurally challenging ourselves to lower our trucking costs. And those are things we've done very effectively over the last 20 years. A third one is continuing to grow our exclusive brand offerings. And so it's really a case of looking at it and saying, here are our branded supplier offerings and working closely with those brands to grow that business. But over time, maybe narrow some of those bands -- oh, excuse me, brands. The other one is having a strategy for our exclusive brands. Today in the non-fastener world, exclusive brands are about 20% of our revenue. If you were looking at that a decade ago, it was probably 10% of our revenue. And I really don't see a reason why that can't be closer to 30% at some point in time. So it's continuing to challenge and carve out different pieces, and you can bring a cost savings to your customer and improve your gross margin at the same time."

I mean, our growth drivers, when you think about Onsite and safety and vending and things like that, I mean, they lend themselves to that. So do I think that given where we're seeing our growth that, that is a reality each quarter of this year? It is. Now, as Dan alluded to, we still hope that there are some things that are going to contribute to somewhat better gross margins. Exclusive brands is something we talked about a lot. I called out the freight a little bit because again, while freight was a bit of a drag in the first quarter, there were some signs that perhaps the freight picture is getting a little bit better. And hopefully as we go into Q2 and Q3, we'll make further strides on that to help us sort of dig into that more structural decline, if you will. So I think the answer is, yes. That structural mix issue is certainly there. But we think that we have means by which to dig into that, if you will, and improve. Also bear in mind that we're coming into the Q1 gross margin. When we think about the decline versus the fourth quarter, some of that reflected the fact that the fourth quarter was an extremely strong period. And we went and looked at a couple of things. I mean, one thing we looked at was, fourth quarter of '16 was up 40 basis points over the third quarter. If you look back historically at what fourth quarters typically do against third -- sorry it's 5 -- I'm sorry, 50 basis points against it. If you look back historically at what Q4 typically looks like against Q3, it's been more like a 60 basis point decline. And last quarter, we called out, we didn't deleverage the trucking network as much as we historically perhaps have, and we had a number of other things that were small individually but added up that just went our way. And so I think a better way to think about the quarter -- about the first quarter number is, historically, if you look at how Q1 plays out versus the prior year's Q3, we were actually up 10 basis points versus last year's Q3, and historically, we're down a couple of -- 20 basis points or so, again, the preceding 5 years. So we believe that we should be able to dig more into that structural decline than we did this quarter. But we feel like we're making some progress on the freight, on the EBs and things of that sort. And yes, we're -- we don't view this as a degradation in our margin picture by any means."

So when we envision discussing those incremental margin levels, I mean, that really talks about leveraging our SG&A more so than the gross profit. And again, it's -- we saw some good signs of that. The -- we talked a little bit about how employment grew and occupancy grew from a cost standpoint. But if you really look at it, when we think about like sales per head for instance, that was up 10% during the quarter, right, because we grew revenues nicely on slightly lower FTE. And that's -- those are sort of the keys to how we get the type of incremental margins that we hope to get. But the discussion that we've had was really we wanted to address our ability to leverage our operating expenses and intending to hold gross margin flat. So if we can achieve significant improvements in our gross margin, I think that that's additive. But again, that's working against the structural mix that we've spoken about."

If it's a box or an item that's going into a vending machine and it's a -- maybe it's a safety product, it's going to have a different margin profile than if it's a box of fasteners that's going into an MRO user. And so it's really depending on what that box is destined for. The other thing to remember is, as a distributor, the very large majority of the cost that runs through COGS for us is simply the cost of the product. So there may be pieces within COGS that we can get leverage on, but at the end of the day, the very large majority of what goes through cost on COGS is going to be the cost of the product."

Now we obviously have seen some of our competitors take price increases. Many of them have talked about it publicly. We've seen charts where prices for metals are clearly up. So it's hard to conclude anything other than the environment today is certainly more inflationary than it's been in quite some time. But that said, Fastenal has the advantage of being a FIFO company with a pretty long supply chain for fasteners, and that means it takes a while for costs to hit our COGS. And that gives us the ability to evaluate how durable the marketplace is for pricing. And if you remember, last year, there was a time or 2 where we thought pricing could occur and then it wound up not materializing for, probably, demand reasons. And so it's nice to be able to get that sort of look, if you will. I think the real question at this point is, if the marketplace in fact does look like it's going to be willing to accept pricing, is that something that we believe we can get to protect our margins and protect our place in the market? And the answer is, we think that we can, but we do have some time to evaluate it at this point."

And frankly, through March, that continues to be the case, and I think there remains enthusiasm from that area. But what we began to see begin to gain some real excitement as we exited February and then into March was the manufacturing side. And frankly, the construction side. There seems to have been a consensus that has come together through March from our regionals that construction is doing much better. And I think you can see some of that in the growth of the CSP products. I mean, the fact they grew 10% plus in the quarter, I think, tells you something about construction as well.

With regards to the headcount, we would expect that to move up as demand goes up, and also as we continue to accelerate our Onsite signings.

In previous calls, we've said south of 6%, 7%, it's difficult with the cost components we had coming out of '15 and into the first part of '16. That picture improves and lowers it some, and that's why you saw our ability to grow our operating expenses roughly 5.5%. And if you think about that, you have to take a look at what drove the operating expense increase when you look at Q1 to Q1. I often try to pull things into some buckets so I can think about them easier. 25%, 30% of that increase is incentive comp, whether it's in a commission in a store, a bonus paid to somebody outside the store, the profit-sharing contributions, those things that are expanding as our profit growth improves, that's really what drives our labor cost increase right now. It's not so much about headcount because the headcount you're adding typically in a period like this, a lot of it is more on the entry level side, so you could manage through that. If you think of what's the next the biggest group of costs that drove our expense up. We've been -- it's no secret, we've been increasing our IT spend over a number of years. We have some pieces that are turning on actually this quarter that will help our store, our Onsite model quite meaningfully. We're turning on our new website up in Canada. So there's things that we're turning on that are sizable investments. Those investments we've been making and have been going through our P&L. And the other component when I think of that second bucket that was a jump from last year, was the fuel that Holden talked about. It's a big increase in our cost component. That piece of it normalizes in Q2. Because last year, from Q1 to Q2, fuel prices jumped up dramatically, so we'll lap that in Q2, but we haven't lapped it in Q1. The final driver of increases is the continued success we're seeing in vending. We when we add those vending machines, there's an expense that shows up in our occupancy around the cost of the equipment. So those things are really what's driving it. And outside of that, managing the expense really, really quite well. And so it puts us in a position when we go into the deeper part of the year, I believe, to be a little bit more optimistic.
Thanks, everybody. It's about 45, 46 minutes past the hour. Thank you for your interest in Fastenal. I'll close the way I started.

The -- you will note 2 meaningful changes to our method of reporting from prior quarters, and I attribute that to our CFO and our Chief Accounting Officer really challenging the format which we convey the information. You will find a much more abbreviated press -- earnings release document. And then something new is we have a short slide deck to supplement the earnings call to help on some of the talking points. I hope you find it useful. 
My comments are going to primarily center on the first 2 pages of commentary, which I believe are Pages 3 and 4 in the book, if you're looking at those pages.
Earlier this morning, and this is typical with every quarter end, at 7 this morning, Central Time, had a call with our regional leaders and our national leaders: Talk a bit about the quarter, give them some insight, a little bit about what we're going to cover on the call, but really just give some insight on the quarter. I want to touch on a couple of points that were mentioned in that call and then we'll dig into the slide deck. 
The first one, and for those of you that have covered Fastenal for any period of time, you know that we are a sales-centered organization, a growth-centered organization. That's been our DNA for 50 years, and 2017 does mark our 50th year in business. 
The first one centers on establishing goals and hitting goals. In the first quarter of 2017, we came in at roughly 101% of goal, 100.7% is the exact number, but roughly 101% of goal. And we hit or exceeded goal every month for the first quarter. I mention that because part of growth is a mind-set, an attitude. And I think we have a great mind-set and a great attitude of going forward, of serving our customers at a high level and challenging each other to grow and grow every day, every month, every quarter. And so very pleased with that.
The second item that I felt was noteworthy is, if you look across our 2,400 store locations, our 400-plus Onsite locations, look at our business in general, you always have customers that are going through different aspects in their business cycle. We might be growing handsomely with that customer because we're picking up market share. We might be growing nicely with that customer because their business is expanding. Or we might be contracting with that customer because their business is contracting. And that is true of every one of our stores. So in any given month, a percentage of our stores grow and a percentage of our stores don't. 
In the first quarter, over 60% of our stores, about 62% of our stores grew. The last time we did better than that was in the first quarter of 2015. And I cite that because as we transitioned from the first quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015, the oil and gas market of which we had a meaningful presence collapsed in North America, collapsed globally, but collapsed in North America, and our business suffered as a result. So it's good to see us participating from a store-to-store perspective in growth in a way we did before the oil and gas business dramatically slowed.
Getting onto the flipbook here. First item mentioned, demand gains drove daily sales growth of 6%, 6.2% annually. Again our fastest growth since the first quarter of '15 so that my earlier comments go hand in hand. Our fastener sales, which are really indicators of the economy in all honesty, have struggled ever since the second quarter of 2015. And that business grew, returned to growth in the first quarter. And that business represents over 1/3 of our revenue, about 36%, 37%. 
Our non-fastener business grew at 9.5%, and in the month of March, grew almost 12%. So double-digit growth. So very pleased with the trends in our business as it relates to both aspects of Fastenal, fasteners and non-fasteners.
Our pretax earnings grew 5.5%. It's the fastest rate of growth for us since the second quarter of '15. We achieved 20 basis points of operating expense leverage. And one thing about our business is we have a tremendous amount of incentive comp, a tremendous amount of investments we make periodically in our business. In 2015, we made dramatic investments, and as the economy weakened late in the year, we pulled those investments back. In 2016, it was a lot about righting the ship, lowering some operating expenses, improving some operating expenses to set us up for -- into '17 and '18 and beyond.
I'm pleased by the fact that we had 20 basis points of operating expense leverage. When you consider the fact that incentive comp, which that was a historically low number in 2016, expanded nicely in the first quarter, because our incentive comp expands as our gross profit dollars and our earnings dollars grow. And so it expanded nicely, and that ate in to some of it. And our profit-sharing contribution that goes to our employees in general expanded nicely from Q1 to Q1. Despite those natural headwinds, we obtained operating expense leverage.
Very strong cash flow. First quarter is always strong for us as it is for everybody in our industry because of the absence of a large tax payment, but very pleased with it. Our capital spending is at a lower level as we'd talked about on our first quarter call. Or -- excuse me, our January call. And we didn't have the CSP 16 investment driving our inventory increase. In fact, if you remove the acquisition we did during the quarter, from December to March, our inventory essentially held flat. 
Speaking of acquisition, on the last day of the quarter, we closed our acquisition of Manufacturers Supply Company, or Mansco. It's about a $50 million distributor, so for the next 12 months, we'll enjoy about an extra point of growth from this acquisition.
Flipping onto our growth driver update on Page 2, some things I think are noteworthy. We got to a nice start on our Onsite signings. We signed 64 in the first quarter. We currently have 437 active Onsite locations. That's a 51% increase from the 289 we had at the end of last year. And our goal remains to sign 275 to 300 Onsites this year. That's a huge goal. Last year, we signed 176, which was more than doubling of the year before, where we had signed 80.
We also signed 5,437 vending units. That's a 17% increase from first quarter of last year. I didn't go back and look at it in detail, but those -- it was either the early part of 2013 or during 2012 when vending initially exploded for us from the standpoint of we really gained traction. It's probably the last time we've signed over 5,000 vending devices in a quarter. So very, very pleased with our start to the year. Our goal is to sign 22,000 to 24,000 for the year and very pleased with that. Probably the only challenge we had is, every year, there's a certain number of machines that we pull out. And we pulled out some machines in the first quarter. But again, very good traction as we enter the year and as sales of product through our vending machines grew double digits again.
National Accounts grew over 9% during the quarter. We've talked in previous quarters about sales to our top 100 customers. 64 of our top 100 customers grew with us, so that helped our national account number. 
Probably the one challenge point that I see when I look at that is if our -- if National Accounts represent roughly half our business and our business grew at 6% and National Accounts grew at 9%, it means the other half of our business is growing in the low single digits, 3% or so. That's a challenge. And you see that challenge shine through a little bit in our gross margin. The one positive in that though is as we exit the quarter, that group of local other customers changed from growing around 3% to about 5.5%. So a nice way to finish the quarter. And one of the things that's driving that number up a bit is the CSP investments we made last year. And that group of products are growing about 10.5% in the first quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."
270747,424837013,1170243,"Fastenal Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 12, 2017",2017-04-12,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","Great, thank you, and good morning. Before jumping into the quarterly results, I do want to remind the listeners that as Dan said we closed the acquisition of Mansco on March 31. So what this means is our first quarter income statement is not going to ref",1463,"Great, thank you, and good morning. Before jumping into the quarterly results, I do want to remind the listeners that as Dan said we closed the acquisition of Mansco on March 31. So what this means is our first quarter income statement is not going to reflect any of Mansco's revenues or costs, but our balance sheet will include the assumed working capital asset. So bear that in mind, and we'll call out where necessary, when we're removing that information.
But flipping over now to Slide 5. As Dan had covered on Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the first quarter of '17 were up 6.2%. That's a nice acceleration from up 2.7% in the fourth quarter. We do estimate that the benefit of the shift of Good Friday from March into April this year was about a 50 basis point benefit to the quarter. But regardless, even adjusting for this, the first quarter was the strongest that we've seen in the last 2 years. And frankly, that strengthening was also evident through the quarter, with March finishing up 8.4%. Now that does probably include about 100, 150 basis points benefit from holiday timing in the month in particular. But again, we just continued to see acceleration during the period.
On Page 5 of the presentation. First, the point is that the backdrop against which we're operating, it really did continue to improve in the quarter. The Purchasing Managers' Index in the U.S., which still represents 88% of our revenue, that averaged and improved to a pretty healthy reading of 57 in the period. Industrial production returned to growth, with an even stronger showing from key sub components like primary metal, fabricated metal and machinery, areas that are more pertinent to our business. And this broadening of industrial demand was reflected by the fact that, as Dan alluded to, a significantly greater number of our stores were actually growing in the first quarter relative to the 53% to 54% pace they have been set through 2016.
This general improvement showed up in other metrics that we track. Again, our fastener line returned to growth, finishing up 0.8% in the quarter. Growth at our largest customers, as reflected by the National Accounts, accelerated to be up 9% in the quarter. And that included up 11.5% in March. Growth among our manufacturing customers accelerated to be up 6.4%. And our construction customers also returned to solid growth, being up 4% in the quarter.
The tone from the regional vice presidents mirror these improvements. There remains a great deal of enthusiasm around oil and gas. And during the quarter, the outlook for the general manufacturing space and the construction space also improved even as the quarter wore on. The only laggard we could see would be manufacturing that's going into transportation markets, things like heavy-duty truck, rail, et cetera. But other than that, frankly, on the whole, customer demand strengthened and broadened throughout the quarter, and we remain encouraged about the near-term trend. 
Now flipping over to Slide 6. Our gross margin was 49.4% in the first quarter, which is down 40 basis points versus the first quarter last year. Now we've discussed before the ramifications of the relative growth in our non-fastener and large customer mix in the short and intermediate term. And that dynamic probably explains about 30 basis points of the decline in gross margin this quarter. 
The remaining drag can be attributed to a couple of things. First, net freight expense remained a challenge in the first quarter. That said, I do want to note that the freight revenue actually rose on an annual basis for the first time since the first quarter of 2015. On top of that, while the freight expense is a challenge, we did see the overall expense improve in the first quarter relative to where we were in the fourth quarter and the third quarter of last year. So again, that was an impact on our gross margin, but we saw some signs of improvement there. 
Secondly, we did incur some costs in the period related to an inventory tracking initiative that we have in some in some of our non-U.S. markets. These 2 things were partly offset by growth in the sales and margin of our Fastenal brands products. But collectively, if you take the impacts of these latter items, they were relatively modest. And frankly, if we ignore mix and just look at our fastener and non-fastener lines, margins were actually stable to slightly higher in the period.  As it relates it to pricing, there was not any meaningful impact from that source in the first quarter. 
Now our operating margin was 20.3% in the first quarter. That's down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis. But again, given that our gross margin was down 40 basis points, frankly, we believe our organization did a really nice job leveraging operating expenses in the period. 
I'm looking at a couple of numbers to make the point. Employee-related expenses were up 3.7%. This is well below sales growth. And that's despite the increase in bonus comp that Dan referred to, and it's a result of our being able to grow our revenues with a 1.7% decline in our FTE headcount. Now we did add almost 200 new employees in the first quarter over the fourth. And frankly, if demand remains strong, we would expect that headcount to keep rising. However, we are committed to being disciplined with the headcount and continuing to leverage this line. 
Occupancy-related expenses were only up 1.2% in the quarter. Now we've had 146 net store closures since the first quarter of last year, and that includes 23 this first quarter. And that's resulted in the flattening of the store occupancy expense. The modest increase in cost then is mostly attributable to vending growth. The higher selling transportation-related expenses were influenced by -- really it was a 23%, 24% increase in the price of diesel and unleaded fuel in the period versus last year. 
The incremental margin in the first quarter was 18.5%. However, we had been able to -- had we been able to hold the gross margin steady, this would have been well north of 20%. And we continue to believe that, assuming a stable gross margin, we can achieve 20%, 25% incremental margins at low to mid-single-digit growth and 25% plus incremental margins at mid- to high single-digit growth in 2017. 
Flipping to Slide 7. We generated $210 million in operating cash in the first quarter. Now first quarters are seasonally stronger as the period's tax is not due until April. But by any measure, this was a record for any quarter. The amount also represents 156.8% of the quarter's net income, which is above last year's 131.9%. Better earnings contributed as did working capital, which I'll address in a moment. 
The net CapEx was $19.1 million, and that's down 34% on lower spending on CSP 16 and DC automation. As a result, our first quarter free cash flow was $191 million, up nearly 39%. We used the proceeds to pay down $93 million -- or to pay $93 million in dividends. We obviously acquired Mansco, and we still were able to lower our debt in the period by $25 million to $365 million at the end of Q1. 
Our debt-to-total capital at the end of the quarter was 15.6%, modestly below the 16.9% a year ago and 16.8% in fourth quarter of '16. We view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized, with ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business and pay our dividend. 
In terms of the working capital. We're really comfortable with where the numbers came out. Receivables growth, if you exclude Mansco, was up about 6.5% in the quarter, and that was consistent with the growth in sales. Inventory, if you exclude Mansco, was up almost 3% in the first quarter, but it was flattish sequentially. And this reflects the absence of last year's heavy CSP-related inventory investment. It also reflects though just greater productivity from our distribution centers, and I think more energy enterprise-wide focusing on this line. Payables, if you exclude Mansco, were down about 19%. Last year's payables reflected the aggressive inventory investment we were making for CSP 16, so we had an easy comp there.
The second quarter of 2017 should have seasonally lower operating cash flow, but better earnings and the absence of CSP spending suggest good cash flow for the full year. Similarly, we continue to anticipate lower CapEx in 2017 of approximately $120 million due to less spending on the DC automation and the leased lockers. 
That's all we have for our formal presentation, and with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

Could you just help us understand what the difference is between the high and the low? And then the second part of the question is, you mentioned that if you can keep the gross margin flat, you can get to 25% plus contribution margin.

First off, David, if you've known from prior conversations, the range of margins in our business are quite dramatic, depending on, are you selling something that's",535,"I'm going to chime in and help Holden out a little with that question just given my years. First off, David, if you've known from prior conversations, the range of margins in our business are quite dramatic, depending on, are you selling something that's a relatively low value, a convenience pack item or something in our store that is, I need it right now and price really doesn't matter, I just need that item; to I'm basically brokering a transaction, and I'm getting paid a fee for brokering and I'm buying a palette of this product or something. So I mean, the ranges can be from the teens to 80%. I mean, if you really want to get crazy with it. But if you look at the bulk of our business, you really have a range that goes from probably the mid-30s to the low 60s. And our fastener product line runs in the 50s. Our non-fastener products as a group run in the 40s. And that kind of gives you some semblance of it. And you can see that play out when you're looking at a lot of our competitors in where their gross margins are and relative to the products they sell. And the only wildcard I'd throw into that would be the fact that, in our industry, we're a little bit unique in that we have one of the lowest cost structures for freight. And we all sell a product line that by and large a lot of items have relatively low value per pound. So freight becomes a big deal, and that's a structural advantage we have for years to come. If you look at some of the things that we have done or can do to manage to offset a piece of that mix-shift, and I think it's just that: we will be able to offset a piece of it over time because -- we've talked about our Onsite strategy and what that means. Just like we talked about our vending strategy or we talked about our non-fastener strategy, 10 and 20 years ago. All those things, over time, lowered our gross margin. And the way we offset it, one is by better sourcing; one is by structurally challenging ourselves to lower our trucking costs. And those are things we've done very effectively over the last 20 years. A third one is continuing to grow our exclusive brand offerings. And so it's really a case of looking at it and saying, here are our branded supplier offerings and working closely with those brands to grow that business. But over time, maybe narrow some of those bands -- oh, excuse me, brands. The other one is having a strategy for our exclusive brands. Today in the non-fastener world, exclusive brands are about 20% of our revenue. If you were looking at that a decade ago, it was probably 10% of our revenue. And I really don't see a reason why that can't be closer to 30% at some point in time. So it's continuing to challenge and carve out different pieces, and you can bring a cost savings to your customer and improve your gross margin at the same time."

I mean, our growth drivers, when you think about Onsite and safety and vending and things like that, I mean, they lend themselves to that. So do I think that given where we're seeing our growth that, that is a reality each quarter of this year? It is. Now, as Dan alluded to, we still hope that there are some things that are going to contribute to somewhat better gross margins. Exclusive brands is something we talked about a lot. I called out the freight a little bit because again, while freight was a bit of a drag in the first quarter, there were some signs that perhaps the freight picture is getting a little bit better. And hopefully as we go into Q2 and Q3, we'll make further strides on that to help us sort of dig into that more structural decline, if you will. So I think the answer is, yes. That structural mix issue is certainly there. But we think that we have means by which to dig into that, if you will, and improve. Also bear in mind that we're coming into the Q1 gross margin. When we think about the decline versus the fourth quarter, some of that reflected the fact that the fourth quarter was an extremely strong period. And we went and looked at a couple of things. I mean, one thing we looked at was, fourth quarter of '16 was up 40 basis points over the third quarter. If you look back historically at what fourth quarters typically do against third -- sorry it's 5 -- I'm sorry, 50 basis points against it. If you look back historically at what Q4 typically looks like against Q3, it's been more like a 60 basis point decline. And last quarter, we called out, we didn't deleverage the trucking network as much as we historically perhaps have, and we had a number of other things that were small individually but added up that just went our way. And so I think a better way to think about the quarter -- about the first quarter number is, historically, if you look at how Q1 plays out versus the prior year's Q3, we were actually up 10 basis points versus last year's Q3, and historically, we're down a couple of -- 20 basis points or so, again, the preceding 5 years. So we believe that we should be able to dig more into that structural decline than we did this quarter. But we feel like we're making some progress on the freight, on the EBs and things of that sort. And yes, we're -- we don't view this as a degradation in our margin picture by any means."

So when we envision discussing those incremental margin levels, I mean, that really talks about leveraging our SG&A more so than the gross profit. And again, it's -- we saw some good signs of that. The -- we talked a little bit about how employment grew and occupancy grew from a cost standpoint. But if you really look at it, when we think about like sales per head for instance, that was up 10% during the quarter, right, because we grew revenues nicely on slightly lower FTE. And that's -- those are sort of the keys to how we get the type of incremental margins that we hope to get. But the discussion that we've had was really we wanted to address our ability to leverage our operating expenses and intending to hold gross margin flat. So if we can achieve significant improvements in our gross margin, I think that that's additive. But again, that's working against the structural mix that we've spoken about."

And so it's really depending on what that box is destined for. The other thing to remember is, as a distributor, the very large majority of the cost that runs through COGS for us is simply the cost of the product. So there may be pieces within COGS that we can get leverage on, but at the end of the day, the very large majority of what goes through cost on COGS is going to be the cost of the product."

Now we obviously have seen some of our competitors take price increases. Many of them have talked about it publicly. We've seen charts where prices for metals are clearly up. So it's hard to conclude anything other than the environment today is certainly more inflationary than it's been in quite some time. But that said, Fastenal has the advantage of being a FIFO company with a pretty long supply chain for fasteners, and that means it takes a while for costs to hit our COGS. And that gives us the ability to evaluate how durable the marketplace is for pricing. And if you remember, last year, there was a time or 2 where we thought pricing could occur and then it wound up not materializing for, probably, demand reasons. And so it's nice to be able to get that sort of look, if you will. I think the real question at this point is, if the marketplace in fact does look like it's going to be willing to accept pricing, is that something that we believe we can get to protect our margins and protect our place in the market?

But what we began to see begin to gain some real excitement as we exited February and then into March was the manufacturing side. And frankly, the construction side. There seems to have been a consensus that has come together through March from our regionals that construction is doing much better. And I think you can see some of that in the growth of the CSP products. I mean, the fact they grew 10% plus in the quarter, I think, tells you something about construction as well.

I often try to pull things into some buckets so I can think about them easier. 25%, 30% of that increase is incentive comp, whether it's in a commission in a store, a bonus paid to somebody outside the store, the profit-sharing contributions, those things that are expanding as our profit growth improves, that's really what drives our labor cost increase right now. It's not so much about headcount because the headcount you're adding typically in a period like this, a lot of it is more on the entry level side, so you could manage through that. If you think of what's the next the biggest group of costs that drove our expense up. We've been -- it's no secret, we've been increasing our IT spend over a number of years. We have some pieces that are turning on actually this quarter that will help our store, our Onsite model quite meaningfully. We're turning on our new website up in Canada. So there's things that we're turning on that are sizable investments. Those investments we've been making and have been going through our P&L. And the other component when I think of that second bucket that was a jump from last year, was the fuel that Holden talked about. It's a big increase in our cost component. That piece of it normalizes in Q2. Because last year, from Q1 to Q2, fuel prices jumped up dramatically, so we'll lap that in Q2, but we haven't lapped it in Q1. The final driver of increases is the continued success we're seeing in vending. We when we add those vending machines, there's an expense that shows up in our occupancy around the cost of the equipment. So those things are really what's driving it. And outside of that, managing the expense really, really quite well. And so it puts us in a position when we go into the deeper part of the year, I believe, to be a little bit more optimistic.
Thanks, everybody. It's about 45, 46 minutes past the hour. Thank you for your interest in Fastenal. I'll close the way I started. I'm pleased, quite frankly, with the quarter from the standpoint of the business is executing better. Our end markets are given us some lift. We are giving ourselves some lift. Thank you."

Before I turn to the flipbook, I'd just like to make a few general comments. One, a message to our team. And that is last December, we sat down an",2025,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our Second Quarter Earnings Call. 
Before I turn to the flipbook, I'd just like to make a few general comments. One, a message to our team. And that is last December, we sat down and we talked about 3 simple concepts for 2017: One was grow our sales; second one was grow our earnings; and the third one is to think big.  And on the gross sales front, it was all about focusing on our growth drivers and your team. And I'm pleased to say, in the first quarter, our internal goal of system, we came in at 100.7% of our internal sales goal. In the second quarter, we came in at 102.6%. So I'm very pleased and proud of the execution put forth by our team thus far in 2017.
The second one was about grow earnings. Biggest message there is have a plan. Gross margin, know your levers, know the trends of our business, but more importantly, know the leverage you can pull in the short term to help your gross margin. I think we executed well on those in the current quarter. 
The second one is our biggest component of operating expenses is payroll. 2017 is going to be a tough year for managing payroll from the standpoint. We were very bullish coming into the year on where our prospects could be. We had great momentum, I felt, coming from 2016. And one of our biggest expense growth in the current year would be incentive comp. I've talked about that in previous calls and at investor conferences that a high percentage of our payroll is incentive-based, whether that be at the branch level, at the distribution level or in the manufacturing or support areas. We reward our people based on our ability to accomplish goals. And I felt we'd have somewhat of a reloading of the incentive comp in the current year and we've seen that in the current quarter. 
Finally on the aspect of occupancy. Frankly, it just can't grow outside of vending. Vending, we included occupancy expense because it's just another shelf within our network of distribution, but being very mindful of where our costs can go, and I think we did a nice job of that in the current quarter as well. 
Finally, think big. I think, Onsite is an example of us thinking big over the last 5 years of how we can grow the business faster. Vending is another of the last 10. And the challenge we put forth to ourselves is always looking for what's next in that think big category about growing the business, growing our service to our customers and growing the opportunities for our employees and our shareholders long term. 
On the gross margin front, I believe it's been, and correct me if I'm wrong on this one, I believe it's been since the last time we had gross profit improvement year-over-year on a relative basis was the third quarter of 2013. I believe we were up 2 basis points that quarter. So I would suspect in the last 14 earnings calls, 12 out of every 10 questions have centered on gross margin, why it's down. I'm thankful we won't get that question today but maybe a variation of that. Holden will provide some more insight on that as he goes through his notets, but I would ask you to indulge me with a few thoughts here. 
One is about human nature. When an organization is struggling to grow, within each of our customers, there's a universal spend that we typically play in. And that universe has the gross margins you've grown accustomed to. Oftentimes, we will step out of that portion of the spend and go deeper into their supply chain and not all that product has the same margin profile. I'm sure some of the improvement of our gross margin in the current quarter is the economy and our growth drivers gave us more a little bit more lift and maybe quite as deep. And but one aspect where we are digging deeper and continue to dig deeper is in our Onsite strategy, that's the core strength of that as you go into a broader range of products because you have cost structure. 
We have a better stocking plan. In 2016, we rolled what we call CSP 16, that's our Customer Service Project. It's helped our in brand sales, it's helped our construction business, both of which have helped our margin. 
We've also done a nice job of stocking, Nick and his team have done a wonderful job balancing inventory dollars to advantages for our branch personnel and what the sell to drive their gross margin. And we've gained some traction on that. It took some inventory dollars to do it, but we are generating great return on that investment. 
And frankly, better analytics. Again, Nick and his team have done I believe a better job supporting the branches, our district managers and our regional VPs on understanding their business, understanding the levers to pull in their gross profit, there's a whole bunch of them. 
And finally, I'll touch on about greater execution. The one thing that I think is really great about our gross margins this quarter isn't the fact that it's up, it's the fact that the improvement came in 5 basis points here and 5 basis points there from about a dozen different places. That gives me more comfort in our ability to execute and our ability to hang on to some of that because the long-term trends that Holden has talked about in previous calls are intact and that is our growth drivers related to non-fasteners, related to Onsite, related to vending, don't raise our gross margin.
And so execution steps is what we need to do to offset some of that impact over time. 
Now switching to the prepared flipbook. Sales growth returned to double digits in the second quarter of 2017. Underlying demand improved, but we outpaced the market due to continued momentum in our key growth drivers. One other item I'll point out is that we did see some improvements in the underlying economy, and again, Holden would touch deeper on that in a few minutes. 
One point that jumped off for me, in previous calls I've talked about our national account business representing just under 50% of our revenue. And that our top 100 customers represent about half of that number. Both of those groups our overall national account and our top 100 have been performing well for us. With one exception, our top 10 customers have been negative for us all year long, and in June, flipped to positive. That improvement from May to June represented -- from those top 10 customers, represented about 20% of our improvement in the growth numbers from May to June. So that's a sign of what the economy did when I look at the May to June numbers that I can tangibly put my finger on. A piece of that 20 obviously came from [indiscernible] customer group to but their activity has improved. The other 80 I'm sure has elements of the economy in it too, but a lot of elements of just pure execution by the Fastenal team, and I'm proud of them for their efforts.
We continue to control our operating costs despite having the growth related compensations or opportunities, how do you want to look at it. As a result, our incremental margins top 25% this quarter, that number was reduced by somewhere between 25% and 30% because of the expansion of incentive comp. We're -- earlier I touched on thinking big, and we can't emphasize that enough, we are encouraging all of our leaders and we have 20,000 of them within Fastenal, we encourage all of our leaders to think big about our long-term planning our future.
Finally, as we mentioned in last quarter's call, we acquired a company in Michigan, Mansco. I'm very pleased to say have exceeded our expectations in the first 3 months. We're learning quickly and really well how to play in the sandbox together. And we don't do a lot of acquisition, a learning curve for us, and they haven't been acquired a lot, so that's a learning curve for them. And -- but I'm pleased to say both teams have gelled really well, and I want to say thanks to the Mansco team for pushing us over the 10% mark and in the double-digit territory for sales growth for the quarter.
On Page 4 of the flipbook, we signed 68 Onsites in the quarter. We have 486 active Onsites today. We've stated earlier that our goal is a lofty one, our goal is to add 275 to 300 signings this year versus the 176 we did last year.
I'm pleased with the 68 because in the quarter, we had a very slow April on signings. We have our big customer show. I'm pleased to say we had in excess of 500 Onsite candidates at that show, so very good showing from our team of inviting great customer opportunities. But when you take your entire group out of commission for a week of the month, you have a weak month. And despite that, we still signed 68.
So year to date 2 years ago, we had 30 signings. Year to date 2016, we had 92 signings. Year-to-date in 2017, we have 132. That's 4x our 2015 number and a 43% increase over prior year. So very good, very pleased with the trends we're seeing there.
Because of the expansion of Ons, one thing you will probably notice reading through our release is we've removed the term from our release, that term is store. We have replaced that with the term branch. A term that we would have used prior to 15 years ago we did for CSP because we thought it described our business well. And we also talked about Onsites and in market units, Holden is better with words than I am and I like the way he's presenting the data. But it's really talking about our market presence and the fact that our branches and Onsites are an extension of our distribution network. We are not a store, we are not a retailer. We're a service organization that's part of our customers' supply chain. 
We signed 4,881 vending devices. Frankly, a little disappointing from my perspective, we didn't break 5,000 like we did in the first quarter. Similar to the Onsite, we a a slowdown in April around the show. The May and June numbers snapped back nicely, and I feel really good about that. Our goal remains 22,000, that's a lofty goal similar to our Onsite goal of that part of thinking big. 
And the final piece is we still are removing a few more machines than I'd like to see. We removed quite a few in 2016 because of our optimization process. I think that's the right move.
In the first 2 quarters of this year, we still are removing some underperforming machines. Our average revenue from machines continues to improve. But we still challenge ourselves on how to get better at the signings, the installs and identifying on day one that 10 is the right number versus 8 versus finding that out a year or 2 years later [indiscernible] to 8. 8 is the right number, it's knowing that sooner is key. And that ties back to our letter to shareholders where we talked about recognizing the facts of our business and figuring out how to improve the business going forward.
National Accounts rose 13% in the second quarter versus second quarter of '16, wonderful job of growing our business and making promises in our branch personnel, our district personnel and our regional personnel are doing a great job of honoring those promises we've made. 
Finally, the CSP products that we rolled out the product continues to grow nicely faster than the company and has brought new life to our construction business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."
270747,528606362,1242875,"Fastenal Company, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 12, 2017",2017-07-12,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","Great, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everybody, thanks for joining the call. So just to hit on what Dan covered on Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the second quarter are up 10.6%, that is an acceleration from up 6.2% in the first quarter. The",1336,"Great, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everybody, thanks for joining the call. 
So just to hit on what Dan covered on Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the second quarter are up 10.6%, that is an acceleration from up 6.2% in the first quarter. The timing of the Good Friday shift into April from March this year did cost the quarter about 50 basis points. But on the other hand, we included Mansco this quarter, which we acquired on March 31 and that added about 130 basis points. If you adjust those 2 factors, the second quarter daily sales rate was around 9.7%. Either way, growth accelerated to the quarter. And even better than that, in June, the daily sales were up 13% or up 11.6%, excluding Mansco.
As Dan covered on Page 4, our growth in the quarter results significantly from customer adoption of our services and growth drivers. However, as demonstrated on Page 5 of the book, some of our improvement clearly reflects a favorable macro backdrop. The Purchasing Managers Index in the U.S., it represents 88% of our revenue, that averaged a healthy 55.8 reading. It does production growth was still modest in the quarter, but did speed up a bit over the prior quarter. These metrics underpin the improvement in our industrial and construction end markets in the second quarter as well as acceleration in both our fastener and nonfastener lines, as you could see from the charts in the presentation. In fact, it's difficult to identify a major market that is acting particularly at this point. And the feedback that we're getting from our RVPs remains overall very favorable. Our National Accounts growth accelerated up 13.1% in the quarter with 68 of our top 100 accounts growing. And we saw similar pattern in our branches, with 62% of our locations growing in the second quarter, which is up from 58% in the first quarter and from the 54% level that we saw [ through much of ] 2016. So the marked improvement that began in the first quarter solidified in the second and the momentum and our growth drivers remain healthy, so we feel pretty good about our top line entering the third quarter.
Flipping over to Slide 6. Our gross margin was 49.8% in the second quarter, that's up 30 basis points versus the second quarter last year. Again, we are pleased to point out that this breaks a significant string of consecutive annual decline in this measure. It really is a combination of products and customer mix as well as the inclusion of Mansco in our results. That still had a 30 to 40 basis point negative impact on the number. But this quarter, that was more than offset by a basket of positive variables. For instance, we did leverage our asset heavy parts of our business like manufacturing and freight. Our sales of private-label brands grew by 30 basis points in the mix versus last year. And efforts to put more product into the field such as the CSP initiative has improved the product decisions and sourcing of both our purchasing operation and our field personnel. None of these variables were individually particularly large, but they did combine to push our margin up for the quarter. In a nutshell, organizational factors skewed heavily in favor of gross margin in the second quarter, though none of those factors would seem to be one time or unsustainable in nature to us.
As it relates to pricing, the combination of good demand and an inflationary environment did provide the branches with some modest pricing lift in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, this did not meaningfully add to sales, it was only a modest contributor to gross margin. Price in excess of cost was a bit more of a factor behind the sequential improvement in gross margin however. We expect favorable price and cost dynamics in the third quarter as well before cost begin to catch up in the fourth quarter.
Our operating margin was 21.2%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. 30 basis points of this improvement relates to the gross margin increase. The other 30 basis points reflect our organization again doing a nice job leveraging total operating expenses. 
If I look at the employee related costs, they were up 9.3% in the quarter. Roughly 3/4 of this increase can be attributed to Mansco's headcount as well as incentive-related expenses coming from our return to growth, such as profit sharing and even more significantly, as Dan alluded to, bonuses. Absent of impacts, we believe the subdued growth better reflects the fact that our headcount is down slightly year over year. We did add 352 new employees in the second quarter over the first quarter. If demand remains strong, we would expect our headcount to rise, however, we're still committed to leveraging the employee-related costs line. 
Occupancy-related expenses were up 3.4%, reflecting the impact of 29 net branch closures, offset by growth in vending. And selling, transportation-related expenses were up 3.2%. That this line grew reflects growth in our business, while the tapering off of that growth rate from the first quarter reflects stabilization of fuel prices and easier year-over-year comparisons. 
It all rolled into an incremental margin in the second quarter that was a 26.4%. If you exclude Mansco, the organic incremental margin would have been 27.5%. And we view this as being consistent with past statements we've made with respect to incremental margin potential. 
Shifting over to Slide 7. We generated $83 million in operating cash in the second quarter, which is 55.7% of net income for the period. Bear in mind the second quarter is a typically poor for cash generation as we typically have 2 tax payments in the period.
In the first half, in total, we generated $293 million, which represents 103.6% of net income, an improvement on the 98.4% that we had in the first half of 2016, primarily as a result of better earnings. 
Net CapEx in the second quarter was $33.7 million, down 41% due in large part to the action of spending on vending machines related to the leased locker program that was ramping up in Q2 last year. We did increase our anticipated capital spending target for 2017 to $127 million, that's from $119 million last quarter, which reflects some investments we are opting to make on the IT and logistics side of our business. Our free cash flow for the quarter and year-to-date then was $49 million and $249 million, up a healthy 43% and 64%, respectively.
In the second quarter, we spent $92.5 million in dividends. We also spent $56.7 million to repurchase 1.3 million shares of Fastenal's' stock, which closed out on most recent authorization. We had an announcement last night noting that our board approved the company to buy back up to 5 million in additional shares at our discretion. This spending in the quarter combined with low seasonal free cash flow pushed our debt up to $445 million as compared to $365 million in the first quarter and $430 million in the second quarter last year. But at 18.3% of total capital, we view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to continue to invest our business and pay our dividend.
In terms of working capital, we were comfortable with where the numbers came out. Receivables growth, excluding Mansco, was up 13% in the second quarter. That it grew faster than sales really just reflects the acceleration in growth that we experienced as the quarter advanced.
Inventory, excluding quoting Mansco, was up 4.5% in the second quarter and now reflects the ability to fill to leverage the heavy investment in branch inventory in 2016 and more energy enterprise-wide on this line.
Payables, excluding Mansco, were down 12.5%. Last year's high payables reflected the aggressive inventory investment we were making for CSP 16. 
That's all that we have for the formal presentation. So with that, we'll turn it over to questions."

So I think what we said in the past is if we continue to see demand get better and the environment remains somewhat inflationary, then a window would probably open for us to take advantage of a little bit of pricing if the market affords. And we sort of deemed the second quarter to be consistent with those themes. And so we saw the opportunity out to be a little bit more prudent with price, knowing that we were going to see costs coming down the pike in the latter half of the year and so we went forward with that. The environment remains consistent, I think, with that -- with that sort of take on it. And we would expect, we've seen the pricing that has come into the market stick in the market at this point. I would expect that you'd probably see a little bit more incremental benefit in the third quarter before you get in the fourth quarter when some of the cost are starting to step up. I will tell you that, initially, I think that the market was more supportive on the nonfastener products. I think going forward, you'll see it become more supportive on the fastener products given we've seen out of steel. But as I said, it's just the market opened up a little bit in the second quarter, should remain open a little in the third quarter. By the time you get into the fourth quarter, you'll probably start to see the cost moves through our supply chain and begin to catch up a little bit with the with what the market has allowed for pricing."

I mean, the mix element that we called out before are still very much there. I mean to the extent that we are successful with our Onsites and safety and things of that nature, the mix elements you called out are still there. They are not going away if we are successful with our growth drivers. If you think about the second quarter, it's not unusual for there to be a little bit of a seasonality, to keep margins flat, maybe slightly down. And frankly, I think this quarter, everything just kind of went our way. That's not necessarily the norm, if you will. So we'll just have to kind of see what Q3 and Q4 look like in that regard. But I mean, that said, I guess, there's 2 things that are working in our favor. And one is I do think in Q3 you might get a little bit of incremental contribution from price that you didn't in Q2, again before that begins to get worked off in Q4 from costs. But the other thing is there was really nothing unsustainable in the pieces that pushed up the gross margin, right? When you think about the shop leverage, when you think about the success that we are having with the CSP and the exclusive brands and things of that nature, there's nothing that's unsustainable in there. And so will they all move in the same direction in Q3 as they seem to in Q2? I mean, we'll have to wait and see. But we think that the fact that we have an opportunity to have a quarter like this, really reflects a lot of good things that we are doing in the field, with a lot of initiatives. And we think that those things will certainly carry forward not just into the next quarter, but sort of beyond that. That's how I'd characterize that gross margin environment."

[indiscernible] grow your sales, grow your earnings, think big. And from what you know about Fastenal for the last 50 years or actually last 30 years that we've been public, gross margins is an important part of our business because it funds our ability to do the things we do and to grow the business. And so it is very important for that matter during the start of April even tweaked away our regional leaders are paid to include a component for gross margin, dollar growth, not percentage, dollar growth, because it's about our growth drivers really center on helping us grow the business faster, knowing that some of the offshoot of that is the gross margin environment over time is challenging. So we'd look at it and say where do our cost structure need to be 2 and 5 years from now nad that's what we are obsessing about. But day-to-day, we're working on all the levers, and as Holden mentioned, those levers went in our direction. What makes me feel better about sustainability is the fact that we picked up 5 or 7 or 8 basis points from a bunch of different places and that makes it a little stickier. It's still a challenging environment and our growth drivers are still going to have a drag on our gross margin that we talked about for the last 1.5 years, 2 years, and that reality hasn't changed. As far as the last part where it starts with a number that I'm not going to mention out loud, and like in Harry Potter, I'm not going to mention it out loud because that's not where our head is at. Our head is at growing sales, growing earnings and thinking big."

And that stabilized this quarter and this quarter we leveraged freight. So when you [indiscernible] an occupancy and selling related transportation expense, that collectively is 85% to 90% of our SG&A. And we leveraged those pieces nicely in the first quarter. And we leveraged those pieces nicely in the second quarter. And one of the reasons why we're not obsessing over the fact that over a period of time our gross margins are likely to be down is because we do think that the growth initiatives that we have, they may be lower gross margin, but we think they're also inherently easier to leverage. And again, I think we saw that in Q1. I think we saw that in Q2. We have certainly emphasized to everybody within the organization that we need to continue to focus on leveraging that SG&A line. And yes, that remains a focus of ours. It's certainly not something that has just emerged this quarter."

That was always predicated on the fact that we saw a certain size of market. And that size of market changed as our product line changed. So if you've been looking company went public back in 1987 that was basically in selling fasteners, we look at our market as $15 billion, maybe a $20 billion opportunity. And someday we have 500 Fastenal locations across North America selling nuts and bolts. As we moved into the mid-1990s, we were expanding our product lines, we were our decentralized nature chunk of business that was outside that fastener product line. And we looked at that and said, boy, if we can really be successful in the nonfastener products, the market is a lot bigger, and over time that number grew to 1,000 potential and 2,000 and ultimately about 3,500 locations in North America. And as I said, included U.S., Canada and Mexico. I'm not intelligent nor informed enough to give a comment on outside of North America at this time. That number is intact from the standpoint of there's this $150 billion, $160 billion market out there, and we think we can continue to enjoy an ever larger piece of that market. I think the 3,500 number is potentially overstated to our branch network, understated to our Holden's [ 2 term ] is in-market network because the Onsite strategy really changes that. So I believe ultimately, we go well above that number. But it's not -- it's not exclusively branches. Its branches and Onsites over time and the vending. The wildcard on your second part of the question occupancy. We categorize both our vending platform and our FMI, which is Fastenal managed inventory platform as part of occupancy. That's principally trying to grow now. And that will continue to be the principal wildcard in there. And we are going to keep investing and growing our vending business."

Once you sign one of these things up, it does -- there's a process that you need to go down before it's sort of open for business, if you will. So that's a short period and a technicality perhaps, but just to sort of clarify that. But the idea that this will be dilutive forever, we don't believe that, right? We're in the early stage of expanding the signings, expanding the openings and growing this within our revenue base. It began in 2015, it picked up speed in '16, and it is picking up further speed in '17. You're certainly right to say then when you first open these things up, they tend to be a little less profitable. As they age, they become somewhat more profitable. And by the way, that speed to profitability is probably faster than people give credit for. But this is this is a business model that today sits in sort of the high-teens in terms of an operating margin. And see as time goes on, as the pathway to profit perhaps applies to this as it has our branch in the past, can these margins exceed where they sit today. And that's we're working very hard to kind of go there. But I think in terms of the sort of emerging bump, if you will, right, I mean as we have a high concentration of very new sites today, I think, in 2017 and 2018, you probably have -- you probably have the fact that the initiative is so new dampening the margin. By the time you get in 2019, 2021, these ones you are opening today begin to age, I think they begin to work against that. And so I think you're sort of -- you're going down into the valley of this initiative in '17 and perhaps a good part of '18. But by the time you get to '19 and '20, I think there is certainly the potential for the margins to stabilize and improve on this initiative."

And but when I look at the -- at the business and the regional businesses within Fastenal that have the greatest concentration of Onsite business within their -- within their business unit, they also have the highest operating margins in the company. Because if you look at it in a static sense, if we just plop a bunch of Onsites in our business today and our store network is static, in short, yes, it would be dilutive to our operating margins. Our returns would be just fine because it requires less working capital to support. But it would be dilutive. But the pathway to profit that we talked about for the last decade, it's still intact and our store network, our branch network is improving every day as the average store branch size increases. And so while it is dilutive, it's no less or no more dilutive than nonfasteners and National Accounts have been to our business for the last 20 years. You -- the business continues to evolve, evolve, your average location revenue continues to go up, and that's probably the strongest anti-dilutive or profit-enhancing component we have within the models, that path to the profit is still there."

So those 68 Onsites we signed in the quarter, those were largely turned on in that next 3 to 4 -- 3 to 5 months. And some of the signings from the first quarter have yet to turn on. And I think it's safe to say you're probably going to see, and I hope you see this because it would tell that the Onsite has taken off, you're probably going to see in the short term, 1 to 3 employees, so let's just say it's a couple, that would imply we're probably adding 150 people, 140 people just from the impact of the Onsite. The remainder will be more of a function of what our business is doing from the standpoint of growth and the improvement we saw in the last 30 days and the underlying economy, I believe can continue to enhance the revenue on a per location basis and will potentially cause that number to be higher, possibly between 200 and 300. Beyond that, I probably won't go too deep into it because a lot is going to depend on the needs, we manage that not centrally, we manage that locally. What we do centrally is we challenge folks with the facts. We point out our expense patterns, we point out the seasonal patterns of our business, it's really a reminder exercise.

270747,528606362,1242941,"Fastenal Company, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 12, 2017",2017-07-12,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Before I turn to the flipbook, I'd just like to make a few general comments. One, a message to our team. And that is last December, we sat down an",2039,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our Second Quarter Earnings Call. 
Before I turn to the flipbook, I'd just like to make a few general comments. One, a message to our team. And that is last December, we sat down and we talked about 3 simple concepts for 2017: One was grow our sales; second one was grow our earnings; and the third one is to think big.  And on the gross sales front, it was all about focusing on our growth drivers and your team. And I'm pleased to say, in the first quarter, our internal goal of system, we came in at 100.7% of our internal sales goal. In the second quarter, we came in at 102.6%. So I'm very pleased and proud of the execution put forth by our team thus far in 2017.
The second one was about grow earnings. Biggest message there is have a plan. Gross margin, know your levers, know the trends of our business, but more importantly, know the leverage you can pull in the short term to help your gross margin. I think we executed well on those in the current quarter. 
The second one is our biggest component of operating expenses is payroll. 2017 is going to be a tough year for managing payroll from the standpoint. We were very bullish coming into the year on where our prospects could be. We had great momentum, I felt, coming from 2016. And one of our biggest expense growth in the current year would be incentive comp. I've talked about that in previous calls and at investor conferences that a high percentage of our payroll is incentive-based, whether that be at the branch level, at the distribution level or in the manufacturing or support areas. We reward our people based on our ability to accomplish goals. And I felt we'd have somewhat of a reloading of the incentive comp in the current year and we've seen that in the current quarter. 
Finally on the aspect of occupancy. Frankly, it just can't grow outside of vending. Vending, we included occupancy expense because it's just another shelf within our network of distribution, but being very mindful of where our costs can go, and I think we did a nice job of that in the current quarter as well. 
Finally, think big. I think, Onsite is an example of us thinking big over the last 5 years of how we can grow the business faster. Vending is another of the last 10. And the challenge we put forth to ourself is always looking for what's next in that think big category about growing the business, growing our service to our customers and growing the opportunities for our employees and our shareholders long term. 
On the gross margin front, I believe it's been, and correct me if I'm wrong on this one, I believe it's been since the last time we had a gross profit improvement year-over-year on a relative basis was the third quarter of 2013. I believe we were up 2 basis points that quarter. So I would suspect in the last 14 earnings calls, 12 out of every 10 questions have centered on gross margin, why it's down. I'm thankful we won't get that question today, but maybe a variation of that. Holden will provide some more insight on that as he goes through his notes, but I would ask you to indulge me with a few thoughts here. 
One is about human nature. When an organization is struggling to grow, within each of our customers, there's a universal spend that we typically play in. And that universe has the gross margins you've grown accustomed to. Oftentimes, we will step out of that portion of the spend and go deeper into their supply chain and not all that product has the same margin profile. I'm sure some of the improvement of our gross margin in the current quarter is the economy, and our growth drivers gave us more -- a little bit more lift and maybe we don't have to dig quite as deep. And -- but one aspect where we are digging deeper and continue to dig deeper is our Onsite strategy, that's the core strength of that, as you go into a broader range of products because you have a different cost structure. 
We have a better stocking plan. In 2016, we rolled out what we called CSP 16, that's our Customer Service Project. It's helped our in-brand sales, it's helped our construction business, both of which have helped our margin. 
We've also done a nice job of [ hub ] stocking. Nick Lundquist and his team have done a wonderful job balancing inventory dollars to advantages for our branch personnel and what to sell to drive their gross margin. And we've gained some traction on that. It took some inventory dollars to do it, but we're generating great return on that investment. 
And frankly, better analytics. Again, Nick and his team have done I believe a better job supporting the branches, our district managers and our regional VPs on understanding their business, understanding the levers to pull in their gross profit, there's a whole bunch of them. 
And finally, I'll touch on about greater execution. The one thing that I think's really great about our gross margin this quarter isn't the fact that it's up, it's the fact that the improvement came in 5 basis points here and 5 basis points there from about a dozen different places. That gives me more comfort in our ability to execute and our ability to hang on to some of that because the long-term trends that Holden has talked about in previous calls are intact, and that is our growth drivers related to non-fasteners, related to Onsite, related to vending, don't raise our gross margin.  And so execution steps is what we need to do to offset some of that impact over time. 
Now switching to the prepared flipbook. Sales growth returned to double digits in the second quarter of 2017. Underlying demand improved, but we outpaced the market due to continued momentum in our key growth drivers. One other item I'll point out is that we did see some improvements in the underlying economy, and again, Holden will touch deeper on that in a few minutes. 
One point that jumped out for me, in previous calls, I've talked about our national account business representing just under 50% of our revenue. And that our top 100 customers represent about half of that number. Both of those groups, our overall national account and our top 100, have been performing well for us, with one exception. Our top 10 customers have been negative for us all year long, and in June, flipped to positive. That improvement from May to June represented -- from those top 10 customers, represented about 20% of our improvement in the growth numbers from May to June. So that's a sign of what the economy did when I look at the May to June numbers that I can tangibly put my finger on. A piece of that 20% obviously came from things we're doing with that customer group, but their activity has improved. The other 80% I'm sure has elements of the economy in it, too, but a lot of elements of just pure execution by the Fastenal team, and I'm proud of them for their efforts.
We continue to control our operating costs despite having the growth-related compensations or opportunities, depending on how you want to look at it. As a result, our incremental margins topped 25% this quarter. That number was reduced by somewhere between 25% and 30% because of the expansion of incentive comp. We're -- earlier, I touched on thinking big, and we can't emphasize that enough, we're encouraging all of our leaders, and we have 20,000 of them within Fastenal. We encourage all of our leaders to think big about our long-term planning and our future.
Finally, as we mentioned in last quarter's call, we acquired a company in Michigan, Mansco. I'm very pleased to say have exceeded our expectations in the first 3 months. We're learning quickly and really well how to play in the sandbox together. And we don't do a lot of acquisitions, that's a learning curve for us. And they haven't been acquired a lot, so that's a learning curve for them. And -- but I'm pleased to say both teams have gelled really well, and I want to say thanks to the Mansco team for pushing us over the 10% mark and in the double-digit territory for sales growth for the quarter.
On Page 4 of the flipbook, we signed 68 Onsites in the quarter. We have 486 active Onsites today. We've stated earlier that our goal is a lofty one, our goal is to add 275 to 300 signings this year versus the 176 we did last year.
I'm pleased with the 68 because in the quarter, we had a very slow April on signings. We have our big customer show. I'm pleased to say we had in excess of 500 Onsite candidates at that show, so very good showing from our team of inviting great customer opportunities. But when you take your entire group out of commission for a week of the month, you have a weak month. And despite that, we still signed 68.
So year-to-date 2 years ago, we had 30 signings. Year-to-date 2016, we had 92 signings. Year-to-date in 2017, we have 132. That's 4x our 2015 number and a 43% increase over prior year. So very good, very pleased with the trends we're seeing there.
Because of the expansion of Onsites, one thing you will probably notice reading through our release is we've removed the term from our release, that term is store. We've replaced that with the term branch. A term that we would have used prior to 15 years ago we did for CSP because we thought it described our business well. And we also talked about Onsites and in-market units. Holden's better with words than I am and I like the way he's presenting the data. But it's really talking about our market presence and the fact that our branches and Onsites are an extension of our distribution network. We're not a store, we're not a retailer. We're a service organization that's part of our customers' supply chain. 
We signed 4,881 vending devices. Frankly, a little disappointing from my perspective. We didn't break 5,000 like we did in the first quarter. Similar to the Onsites, we saw a slowdown in April around the [ shoal ]. [ph] the May and June numbers snapped back nicely, and I feel really good about that. Our goal remains 22,000. That's a lofty goal similar to our Onsite goal, but that's part of our thinking big. 
And the final piece is we still are removing a few more machines than I'd like to see. We removed quite a few in 2016 because of our optimization process. I think that's the right move.
In the first 2 quarters of this year, we still are removing some underperforming machines. Our average revenue from machines continues to improve. And but we still challenge ourselves on how to get better at the signings, the installs and identifying on day 1 that 10 is the right number versus 8, versus finding that out a year or 2 years later and reducing to 8. 8 is the right number, it's just knowing that sooner is key. And that ties back to our letter to shareholders where we talked about recognizing the facts of our business and figuring out how to improve the business going forward.
National Accounts rose 13% in the second quarter versus second quarter of '16, a wonderful job of growing our business and making promises, and our branch personnel, our district personnel and our regional personnel are doing a great job of honoring those promises we've made. 
Finally, the CSP products that we rolled out [indiscernible] product continues to grow nicely faster than the company and has brought new life to our construction business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."
270747,528606362,1242941,"Fastenal Company, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 12, 2017",2017-07-12,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","Great. Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call. So just to hit on what Dan covered on Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the second quarter were up 10.6%, that's an acceleration from up 6.2% in the first quarter. The",1328,"Great. Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call. 
So just to hit on what Dan covered on Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the second quarter were up 10.6%, that's an acceleration from up 6.2% in the first quarter. The timing of the Good Friday shift into April from March this year did cost the quarter about 50 basis points. But on the other hand, we included Mansco this quarter, which we acquired on March 31, and that added about 130 basis points. If you adjust those 2 factors, the second quarter daily sales rate was around 9.7%. Either way, growth accelerated to the quarter. And even better than that, in June, the daily sales were up 13% or up 11.6%, excluding Mansco.
As Dan covered on Page 4, our growth in the quarter results significantly from customer adoption of our services and growth drivers. However, as demonstrated on Page 5 of the book, some of our improvement clearly reflects a favorable macro backdrop. The Purchasing Managers Index in the U.S., it represents 88% of our revenue, that averaged a healthy 55.8 reading. Industrial production growth was still modest in the quarter, but did speed up a bit over the prior quarter. These metrics underpin the improvement in our industrial and construction end markets in the second quarter as well as acceleration in both our fastener and nonfastener lines, as you can see from the charts in the presentation. In fact, it's difficult to identify a major market that is acting particularly poorly at this point. And the feedback that we're getting from our RVPs remains overall very favorable. 
Our National Accounts growth accelerated up 13.1% in the quarter with 68 of our top 100 accounts growing. And we saw similar pattern in our branches, with 62% of our locations growing in the second quarter, which is up from 58% in the first quarter and from the 54% level that we saw through much of 2016. So the market improvement that began in the first quarter solidified in the second, and momentum on our growth drivers remains healthy, so we feel pretty good about our top line entering the third quarter.
Flipping over to Slide 6. Our gross margin was 49.8% in the second quarter. That's up 30 basis points versus the second quarter last year. Again, we're pleased to point out that this breaks a significant string of consecutive annual declines in this measure. And really, the combination of product and customer mix, as well as the inclusion of Mansco in our results, that still had a 30 to 40 basis point negative impact on the number. But this quarter, that was more than offset by a basket of positive variables. For instance, we did leverage our asset-heavy parts of our business like manufacturing and freight. Our sales of private-label brands grew by 30 basis points in the mix versus last year. And efforts to put more product into the field such as the CSP initiative has improved the product decisions and sourcing of both our purchasing operation and our field personnel. None of these variables were individually particularly large, but they did combine to push our margin up for the quarter. In a nutshell, organizational factors skewed heavily in favor of gross margin in the second quarter, though none of those factors would seem to be onetime or unsustainable in nature to us.
As it relates to pricing, the combination of good demand and an inflationary environment did provide the branches with some modest pricing lift in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, this did not meaningfully add to sales, it was only a modest contributor to gross margin. Price in excess of cost was a bit more of a factor behind the sequential improvement in gross margin, however. We expect favorable price and cost dynamics in the third quarter as well before cost begin to catch up in the fourth quarter.
Our operating margin was 21.2%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. 30 basis points of this improvement relates to the gross margin increase. The other 30 basis points reflects our organization again doing a nice job leveraging total operating expenses. 
If I look at the employee-related costs, they were up 9.3% in the quarter. Roughly 3/4 of this increase can be attributed to Mansco's headcount as well as incentive-related expenses coming from our return to growth, such as profit sharing and even more significantly, as Dan alluded to, bonuses. Absent these impacts, we believe the subdued growth better reflects the fact that our headcount is down slightly year over year. We did add 352 new employees in the second quarter over the first quarter. And if demand remains strong, we would expect our headcount to rise. However, we're still committed to leveraging the employee-related cost line. 
Occupancy-related expenses were up 3.4%, reflecting the impact of 29 net branch closures, offset by growth in vending. And selling, transportation-related expenses were up 3.2%. That this line grew reflects growth in our business, while the tapering off of that growth rate from the first quarter reflects stabilization of fuel prices and easier year-over-year comparisons.  It all rolled into an incremental margin in the second quarter that was at 26.4%. If you exclude Mansco, the organic incremental margin would have been 27.5%. And we view this as being consistent with past statements we've made with respect to incremental margin potential. 
Shifting over to Slide 7. We generated $83 million in operating cash in the second quarter, which is 55.7% of net income for the period. Bear in mind, the second quarter is typically poor for cash generation as we typically have 2 tax payments in the period.  In the first half, in total, we generated $293 million, which represents 103.6% of net income, an improvement on the 98.4% that we had in the first half of 2016, primarily as a result of better earnings. 
Net CapEx in the second quarter was $33.7 million, down 41% due in large part to the actions of spending on vending machines related to the lease locker program that was ramping up in Q2 last year. We did increase our anticipated capital spending target for 2017 to $127 million, that's from $119 million last quarter, which reflects some investments we're opting to make on the IT and logistics side of our business. Our free cash flow for the quarter and year-to-date then was $49 million and $249 million, up a healthy 43% and 64%, respectively.
In the second quarter, we spent $92.5 million in dividends. We also spent $56.7 million to repurchase 1.3 million shares of Fastenal's' stock, which closed out on our most recent authorization. We had an announcement last night noting that our board approved the company to buy back up to 5 million in additional shares at our discretion. This spending in the quarter, combined with low seasonal free cash flow, pushed our debt up to $445 million as compared to $365 million in the first quarter and $430 million in the second quarter last year. But at 18.3% of total capital, we view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business and pay our dividend.
In terms of working capital, we were comfortable with where the numbers came out. Receivables growth excluding Mansco, was up 13% in the second quarter. That it grew faster than sales really just reflects the acceleration in growth that we experienced as the quarter advanced.
Inventory, excluding Mansco, was up 4.5% in the second quarter. It now reflects the ability of the field to leverage the heavy investment in branch inventory in 2016 and more energy enterprise-wide on this line.
Payables, excluding Mansco, were down 12.5%. Last year's high payables reflected the aggressive inventory investment we were making for CSP 16. 
That's all that we have for the formal presentation. So with that, we'll turn it over to questions."

So I think what we said in the past is if we continue to see demand get better and the environment remains somewhat inflationary, then a window would probably open for us to take advantage of a little bit of pricing if the market affords. And we sort of deemed the second quarter to be consistent with those themes. And so we saw the opportunity out to be a little bit more prudent with price, knowing that we were going to see costs coming down the pike in the latter half of the year and so we went forward with that. The environment remains consistent, I think, with that sort of take on it. And we would expect -- we've seen the pricing that has come into the market stick in the market at this point. I would expect that you'd probably see a little bit more incremental benefit in the third quarter before you get in the fourth quarter when some of the costs are starting to step up. I will tell you that, initially, I think that the market was more supportive on the nonfastener products. I think going forward, you'll see it become more supportive on the fastener products given what we've seen out of steel. But as I said, it's just the market opened up a little bit in the second quarter It should remain open a little in the third quarter. By the time you get into the fourth quarter, you'll probably start to see the cost move through our supply chain and begin to catch up a little bit with the -- with what the market has allowed from pricing."

I mean, to the extent that we are successful with our Onsites and safety and things of that nature, the mix elements you called out are still there. They're not going away if we're successful with our growth drivers. If you think about the second quarter, it's not unusual for there to be a little bit of a seasonality, to keep margins flat, maybe slightly down. And frankly, I think this quarter, everything just kind of went our way. That's not necessarily the norm, if you will. So we'll just have to kind of see what Q3 and Q4 look like in that regard. But I mean, that said, I guess, there's 2 things that are working in our favor. And one is I do think in Q3, you might get a little bit of incremental contribution from price that you didn't in Q2, again, before that begins to get worked off in Q4 from costs. But the other thing is there was really nothing unsustainable in the pieces that pushed up the gross margin, right? When you think about the shop leverage, when you think about the success that we're having with the CSP and the exclusive brands and things of that nature, there's nothing that's unsustainable in there. And so will they all move in the same direction in Q3 as they seem to in Q2? I mean, we'll have to wait and see. But we think that the fact that we have an opportunity to have a quarter like this, really reflects a lot of good things that we're doing in the field with a lot of initiatives. And we think that those things will certainly carry forward not just into the next quarter, but sort of beyond that. So that's how I'd characterize the gross margin environment."

And from what you know about Fastenal for the last 50 years or actually last 30 years that we've been public, gross margin's an important part of our business because it's the -- it funds our ability to do the things we do and to grow the business. And so it's very important. For that matter, during the start of April, even tweaked away our regional leaders are paid to include a component for gross margin, dollar growth, not percentage, dollar growth, because it's about our growth drivers really center on helping us grow the business faster, knowing that some of the offshoot of that is the gross margin environment over time is challenging. So we'd look at it and say, ""Where do our cost structure need to be 2 and 5 years from now?"" and that's what we're obsessing about. But day-to-day, we're working on all the levers, and as Holden mentioned, those levers went in our direction. What makes me feel better about sustainability is the fact that we picked up 5 or 7 or 8 basis points from a bunch of different places and that makes it a little stickier. It's still a challenging environment, and our growth drivers are still going to have the drag on our gross margin that we've talked about for the last 1.5 years, 2 years, and that reality hasn't changed.

I mean, in Q1, [indiscernible] were a lot of questions around gross margin not being where everyone would have hoped that they would be. But we levered our payroll. We levered our occupancy. We didn't lever the freight within SG&A simply because the fuel costs were up as significantly as they were. And that stabilized this quarter, and this quarter we leveraged freight. So when you [indiscernible] an occupancy and selling related transportation expense, that collectively is 85% to 90% of our SG&A. And we leveraged those pieces nicely in the first quarter. And we leveraged those pieces nicely in the second quarter. And one of the reasons why we're not obsessing over the fact that over a period of time our gross margins are likely to be down is because we do think that the growth initiatives that we have, they may be lower gross margin, but we think they're also inherently easier to leverage. And again, I think we saw that in Q1. I think we saw that in Q2. We have certainly emphasized to everybody within the organization that we need to continue to focus on leveraging that SG&A line. And yes, that remains a focus of ours. It's certainly not something that has just emerged this quarter."

So if",333,"Yes, first off, on the underlying question of the 3,200 or 3,500 potential locations that we've talked about. That was always predicated on the fact that we saw a certain size of market. And that size of market changed as our product lines changed. So if you'd have been looking at that company that went public back in 1987 that was basically in selling fasteners, we looked at our market as $15 billion, maybe a $20 billion opportunity. And someday, we'd have 500 Fastenal locations across North America selling nuts and bolts. As we moved into the mid-1990s, we were expanding our product lines, we were our decentralized nature, we had a chunk of business that was outside that fastener product line. And we looked at that and said, ""Boy, we can really be successful in the nonfastener products."" The market's a lot bigger, and over time, that number grew to 1,000 potential and 2,000, and ultimately, about 3,500 locations in North America. And as I said, included U.S., Canada and Mexico. I'm not intelligent nor informed enough to give a comment on outside of North America at this time. That number is intact from the standpoint of there's this $150 billion, $160 billion market out there, and we think we can continue to enjoy an ever larger piece of that market. I think the 3,500 number is potentially overstated to our branch network, understated to our -- Holden's new term is in-market network. Because the Onsite strategy really changes that, so I believe ultimately, we go well above that number. But it's not exclusively branches. Its branches and Onsites over time, and the vending. The wildcard on your second part of the question about occupancy, we categorize both our vending platform and our FMI, which is Fastenal Managed Inventory platform as part of occupancy. That's principally driving to grow now. And that will continue to be the principal wildcard in there. And we're going to keep investing and growing our vending business."

And so with regard to the 68, just a one correction, those are signings, those aren't necessarily openings in the quarter. Once you sign one of these things up, it does -- there's a process that you need to go down before it's sort of open for business, if you will. So that's a short period and a technicality perhaps, but just to sort of clarify that. But the idea that these will be dilutive forever, we don't believe that, right? We're in the early stage of expanding the signings, expanding the openings and growing this within our revenue base. It began in 2015, it picked up speed in '16, and it is picking up further speed in '17. You're certainly right to say that when you first open these things up, they tend to be a little bit less profitable. As they age, they become somewhat more profitable. And by the way, that speed to profitability is probably faster than people give credit for. But this is a business model that today, sits in sort of the high-teens in terms of an operating margin. And as I see it, as time goes on, as the pathway to profit perhaps applies to this as it has our branches in the past, can these margins exceed where they sit today. And that's -- we're working very hard to kind of go there. But I think in terms of this sort of emerging bump, if you will, right, I mean as we have a high concentration of very new sites today, I think in 2017 and 2018, you probably have -- you probably have the fact that the initiative is so new dampening the margin, by the time you get into 2019, 2020, 2021, these -- ones you are opening today begin to age, I think they begin to work against that. And so I think you're sort of -- you're going down into the valley of this initiative in '17 and perhaps a good part of '18, but by the time you get to '19 and '20, I think there's certainly the potential for the margins to stabilize and improve on this initiative."

We've talked about the Onsite model and the fact that operating margin-wise, it does have lower operating margins than our business today. And -- but when I look at the business and the regional businesses within Fastenal that have the greatest concentration of Onsite business within their business unit, they also have the highest operating margins in the company. Because if you look at it in a static sense, if we just plopped a bunch of Onsites in our business today and our store network is static, in short, yes, it'd be dilutive to our operating margins. Our returns would be just fine because it requires less working capital to support, but it would be dilutive. But the pathway to profit that we talked about for the last decade, it's still intact, and our store network, [indiscernible] our branch network is improving everyday as the average store branch size increases. And so while it is dilutive, it's no less or no more dilutive than nonfasteners, and National Accounts have been to our business over the last 20 years. You -- the business continues to evolve. Your average location revenue continues to go up. And that's probably the strongest anti-dilutive or profit-enhancing component we have within the models, that pathway to profit's still there."

To me, the biggest component, and Holden touched on it a second when he talked about the signings of the Onsites and what that means. So those 68 Onsites we signed in the quarter, those will largely turn on in the next 3 to 4 -- 3 to 5 months. And some of the signings from the first quarter have yet to turn on. And I think it's safe to say you're probably going to see, and I hope you see this because it tells you the Onsite has taken off, you're probably going to see in the short term, 1 to 3 employees. So let's just say it's a couple. That would imply we're probably adding 150 people, 140 people just from the impact of the Onsite. The remainder will be more of a function of what our business is doing from the standpoint of growth. And the improvement we saw in the last 30 days and the underlying economy, I believe can continue to enhance the revenue on a per location basis and will potentially cause that number to be higher possibly between 200 and 300. Beyond that, I probably won't go too deep into it because a lot of it's going to depend on the needs. We manage that not centrally, we manage that locally. What we do centrally is we challenge folks with the facts. We point out our expense patterns. We point out the seasonal patterns of our business. It's really a reminder exercise.

What you're going to be entering into in the second half of this year is you're going to be coming up against that sort of attrition in the back half of '16 even as we're adding now because of better heads. So I think that what we've been seeing is addition of heads all year. I think we'll continue to see that.

And that is last December, we sat down, w",2036,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our Second Quarter Earnings Call. 
Before I turn to the flipbook, I'd just like to make a few general comments. One, a message to our team. And that is last December, we sat down, we talked about 3 simple concepts for 2017: One was grow our sales; second one was grow our earnings; and the third one is to think big.  And on the gross sales front, it was all about focusing on our growth drivers and your team. And I'm pleased to say, in the first quarter, our internal goal of system, we came in at 100.7% of our internal sales goal. In the second quarter, we came in at 102.6%. So I'm very pleased and proud of the execution put forth by our team thus far in 2017.
The second one was about grow earnings. Biggest message there is have a plan. Gross margin, know your levers, know the trends of our business, but more importantly, know the leverage you can pull in the short term to help your gross margin. I think we executed well on those in the current quarter. 
The second one is our biggest component of operating expenses is payroll. 2017 is going to be a tough year for managing payroll from the standpoint. We were very bullish coming into the year on where our prospects could be. We had great momentum, I felt, coming from 2016. And one of our biggest expense growths in the current year would be incentive comp. I've talked about that in previous calls and at investor conferences that a high percentage of our payroll is incentive-based, whether that be at the branch level, at the distribution level or in the manufacturing or support areas. We reward our people based on our ability to accomplish goals. And I felt we'd have somewhat of a reloading of the incentive comp in the current year and we've seen that in the current quarter. 
Finally, on the aspect of occupancy. Frankly, it just can't grow outside of vending. Vending, we include in occupancy expense because it's just another shelf within our network of distribution, but being very mindful of where our costs can go, and I think we did a nice job of that in the current quarter as well. 
Finally, think big. I think, Onsite is an example of us thinking big over the last 5 years of how we can grow the business faster. Vending is another over the last 10. And the challenge we put forth to our self is always looking for what's next in that think big category about growing the business, growing our service to our customers and growing the opportunities for our employees and our shareholders long term. 
On the gross margin front, I believe it's been, and correct me if I'm wrong on this one, I believe it's been since the last time we had a gross profit improvement year-over-year on a relative basis was the third quarter of 2013. I believe we were up 2 basis points that quarter. So I would suspect in the last 14 earnings calls, 12 out of every 10 questions have centered on gross margin, why it's down. I'm thankful we won't get that question today, but maybe a variation of that. Holden will provide some more insight on that as he goes through his notes, but I would ask you to indulge me with a few thoughts here. 
One is about human nature. When an organization is struggling to grow, within each of our customers, there's a universal spend that we typically play in. And that universe has the gross margins you've grown accustomed to. Oftentimes, we will step out of that portion of the spend and go deeper into their supply chain and not all that product has the same margin profile. I'm sure some of the improvement of our gross margin in the current quarter is the economy, and our growth drivers gave us more -- a little bit more lift and maybe we don't have to dig quite as deep. And -- but one aspect where we are digging deeper and continue to dig deeper is our Onsite strategy, that's the core strength of that, is you go into a broader range of products because you have a different cost structure. 
We have a better stocking plan. In 2016, we rolled out what we called CSP 16, that's our Customer Service Project. It's helped our in-brand sales, it's helped our construction business, both of which have helped our margin. 
We've also done a nice job with hub stocking. Nick Lundquist and his team have done a wonderful job balancing inventory dollars to advantages for our branch personnel and what to sell to drive their gross margin. And we've gained some traction on that. It took some inventory dollars to do it, but we're generating a great return on that investment. 
And frankly, better analytics. Again, Nick and his team have done I believe a better job supporting the branches, our district managers and our regional VPs on understanding their business, understanding the levers to pull in their gross profit, there's a whole bunch of them. 
And finally, I'll touch on about greater execution. The one thing that I think's really great about our gross margin this quarter isn't the fact that it's up, it's the fact that the improvement came in 5 basis points here and 5 basis points there from about a dozen different places. That gives me more comfort in our ability to execute and our ability to hang on to some of that because the long-term trends that Holden has talked about in previous calls are intact, and that is our growth drivers related to non-fasteners, related to Onsite, related to vending, don't raise our gross margin.  And so execution steps is what we need to do to offset some of that impact over time. 
Now switching to the prepared flipbook. Sales growth returned to double digits in the second quarter of 2017. Underlying demand improved, but we outpaced the market due to the continual momentum in our key growth drivers. One other item I'll point out is that we did see some improvements in the underlying economy, and again, Holden will touch deeper on that in a few minutes. 
One point that jumped out for me, in previous calls, I've talked about our national account business representing just under 50% of our revenue. And that our top 100 customers represent about half of that number. Both of those groups, our overall national account and our top 100, have been performing well for us with one exception. Our top 10 customers have been negative for us all year long and, in June, flipped to positive. That improvement from May to June represented -- from those top 10 customers, represented about 20% of our improvement in the growth numbers from May to June. So that's a sign of what the economy did when I look at the May to June numbers that I can tangibly put my finger on. A piece of that 20% obviously came from things we're doing with that customer group, but their activity has improved. The other 80% I'm sure has elements of the economy in it, too, but a lot of elements of just pure execution by the Fastenal team, and I'm proud of them for their efforts.
We continue to control our operating costs despite having the growth-related compensations or opportunities, depending on how you want to look at it. As a result, our incremental margins topped 25% this quarter. That number was reduced by somewhere between 25% and 30% because of the expansion of incentive comp. We're -- earlier, I touched on thinking big, and we can't emphasize that enough, we're encouraging all of our leaders, and we have 20,000 of them within Fastenal. We're encouraging all of our leaders to think big about our long-term planning and our future.
Finally, as we mentioned in last quarter's call, we acquired a company in Michigan, Mansco. I'm very pleased to say have exceeded our expectations in the first 3 months. We're learning quickly and really well how to play in the sandbox together. And we don't do a lot of acquisitions, that's a learning curve for us. And they haven't been acquired a lot, so that's a learning curve for them. And -- but I'm pleased to say both teams have gelled really well, and I want to say thanks to the Mansco team for pushing us over the 10% mark and into double-digit territory for sales growth for the quarter.
On Page 4 of the flipbook, we signed 68 Onsites in the quarter. We have 486 active Onsites today. We've stated earlier that our goal, it's a lofty one, our goal is to add 275 to 300 signings this year versus the 176 we did last year.
I'm pleased with the 68 because, in the quarter, we had a very slow April on signings. We have our big customer show. I'm pleased to say we had in excess of 500 Onsite candidates at that show, so a very good showing from our team of inviting great customer opportunities. But when you take your entire group out of commission for a week of the month, you have a weak month. And despite that, we still signed 68.
So year-to-date 2 years ago, we had 30 signings. Year-to-date 2016, we had 92 signings. Year-to-date in 2017, we have 132. That's 4x our 2015 number and a 43% increase over prior year. So very good, very pleased with the trends we're seeing there.
Because of the expansion of Onsites, one thing you will probably notice reading through our release is we've removed a term from our release, that term is store. We've replaced that with the term branch. A term that we would have used prior to 15 years ago, we did for CSP because we thought it described our business well. And we also talked about Onsites in in-market units. Holden's better with words than I am and I like the way he's presenting the data. But it's really talking about our market presence and the fact that our branches and Onsites are an extension of our distribution network. We're not a store, we're not a retailer. We're a service organization that's part of our customers' supply chain. 
We signed 4,881 vending devices. Frankly, a little disappointing from my perspective. We didn't break 5,000 like we did in the first quarter. Similar to the Onsites, we saw a slowdown in April around the show. The May and June numbers snapped back nicely, and I feel really good about that. Our goal remains 22,000. That's a lofty goal similar to our Onsite goal, but that's part about thinking big. 
And the final piece is we still are removing a few more machines than I'd like to see. We removed quite a few in 2016 because of our optimization process. I think that's the right move. In the first 2 quarters of this year, we still are removing some underperforming machines. Our average revenue per machine continues to improve. And but we still challenged ourselves on how to get better at the signings, the installs and identifying on day 1 that 10 is the right number versus 8, versus finding that out a year or 2 years later and reducing to 8. 8 is the right number, it's just knowing that sooner is key. And that ties back to our letter to shareholders where we talked about recognizing the facts of our business and figuring out how to improve the business going forward.
National Accounts rose 13% in the second quarter versus second quarter of '16, a wonderful job of growing our business and making promises, and our branch personnel, our district personnel and our regional personnel are doing a great job of honoring those promises we've made. 
Finally, the CSP products that we rolled out [indiscernible] product continues to grow nicely faster than the company and has brought new life to our construction business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

Thanks for joining the call. So just to hit on what Dan covered on Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the second quarter were up 10.6%, that's an acceleration from up 6.2% in the first quarter. The",1328,"Great. Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call. 
So just to hit on what Dan covered on Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the second quarter were up 10.6%, that's an acceleration from up 6.2% in the first quarter. The timing of the Good Friday shift into April from March this year did cost the quarter about 50 basis points. But on the other hand, we included Mansco this quarter, which we acquired on March 31, and that added about 130 basis points. If you adjust those 2 factors, the second quarter daily sales rate was around 9.7%. Either way, growth accelerated through the quarter. And even better than that, in June, the daily sales were up 13% or up 11.6%, excluding Mansco.
As Dan covered on Page 4, our growth in the quarter results significantly from customer adoption of our services and growth drivers. However, as demonstrated on Page 5 of the book, some of our improvement clearly reflects a favorable macro backdrop. The Purchasing Managers Index in the U.S., which represents 88% of our revenue, that averaged a healthy 55.8 reading. Industrial production growth was still modest in the quarter, but did speed up a bit over the prior quarter. These metrics underpinned improvement in our industrial and construction end markets in the second quarter as well as acceleration in both our fastener and non-fastener lines, as you can see from the charts in the presentation. In fact, it's difficult to identify a major market that is acting particularly poorly at this point. And the feedback that we're getting from our RVPs remains overall very favorable. 
Our National Accounts growth accelerated up 13.1% in the quarter with 68 of our top 100 accounts growing. And we saw a similar pattern in our branches, with 62% of our locations growing in the second quarter, which is up from 58% in the first quarter and from the 54% level that we saw through much of 2016. So the market improvement that began in the first quarter solidified in the second, and momentum in our growth drivers remains healthy, so we feel pretty good about our top line entering the third quarter.
Flipping over to Slide 6. Our gross margin was 49.8% in the second quarter. That's up 30 basis points versus the second quarter last year. Again, we're pleased to point out that this breaks a significant string of consecutive annual declines in this measure. It really -- the combination of product and customer mix, as well as the inclusion of Mansco in our results, that still had a 30 to 40 basis point negative impact on the number. But this quarter, that was more than offset by a basket of positive variables. For instance, we did leverage our asset-heavy parts of our business like manufacturing and freight. Our sales of private-label brands grew by 30 basis points in the mix versus last year. And efforts to put more product into the field such as the CSP initiative has improved the product decisions and sourcing of both our purchasing operation and our field personnel. None of these variables were individually particularly large, but they did combine to push our margin up for the quarter. In a nutshell, organizational factors skewed heavily in favor of gross margin in the second quarter, though none of those factors would seem to be onetime or unsustainable in nature to us.
As it relates to pricing, the combination of good demand and an inflationary environment did provide the branches with some modest pricing lift in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, this did not meaningfully add to sales and was only a modest contributor to gross margin. Price in excess of cost was a bit more of a factor behind the sequential improvement in gross margin, however. We expect favorable price and cost dynamics in the third quarter as well before costs begin to catch up in the fourth quarter.
Our operating margin was 21.2%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. 30 basis points of this improvement relates to the gross margin increase. The other 30 basis points reflects our organization again doing a nice job leveraging total operating expenses. 
If I look at the employee-related costs, they were up 9.3% in the quarter. Roughly 3/4 of this increase can be attributed to Mansco's headcount as well as incentive-related expenses stemming from our return to growth, such as profit sharing and even more significantly, as Dan alluded to, bonuses. Absent these impacts, we believe the subdued growth better reflects the fact that our headcount is down slightly year over year. We did add 352 new employees in the second quarter over the first quarter. And if demand remains strong, we would expect our headcount to rise. However, we're still committed to leveraging the employee-related cost line. 
Occupancy-related expenses were up 3.4%, reflecting the impact of 29 net branch closures, offset by growth in vending. And selling, transportation-related expenses were up 3.2%. That this line grew reflects growth in our business, while the tapering off of that growth rate from the first quarter reflects stabilization of fuel prices and easier year-over-year comparisons.  It all rolled into an incremental margin in the second quarter that was at 26.4%. If you exclude Mansco, the organic incremental margin would have been 27.5%. And we view this as being consistent with past statements we've made with respect to incremental margin potential. 
Shifting over to Slide 7. We generated $83 million in operating cash in the second quarter, which is 55.7% of net income for the period. Bear in mind, the second quarters are typically poor for cash generation as we typically have 2 tax payments in the period.  In the first half, in total, we generated $293 million, which represents 103.6% of net income, an improvement on the 98.4% that we had in the first half of 2016, primarily as a result of better earnings. 
Net CapEx in the second quarter was $33.7 million, down 41% due in large part to the absence of spending on vending machines related to the leased locker program that was ramping up in Q2 last year. We did increase our anticipated capital spending target for 2017 to $127 million, that's from $119 million last quarter, which reflects some investment we're opting to make on the IT and logistics sides of our business. Our free cash flow for the quarter and year-to-date, then, was $49 million and $249 million, up a healthy 43% and 64%, respectively.
In the second quarter, we spent $92.5 million in dividends. We also spent $56.7 million to repurchase 1.3 million shares of Fastenal's' stock, which closed out our most recent authorization. We had an announcement last night noting that our board approved the company to buy back up to 5 million in additional shares at our discretion. This spending in the quarter, combined with low seasonal free cash flow, pushed our debt up to $445 million as compared to $365 million in the first quarter and $430 million in the second quarter last year. But at 18.3% of total capital, we view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business and pay our dividend.
In terms of working capital, we were comfortable with where the numbers came out. Receivables growth excluding Mansco, was up 13% in the second quarter. That it grew faster than sales really just reflects the acceleration in growth that we experienced as the quarter advanced.
Inventory, excluding Mansco, was up 4.5% in the second quarter. And that reflects the ability of the field to leverage the heavy investment in branch inventory in 2016 and more energy enterprise-wide on this line.
Payables, excluding Mansco, were down 12.5%. Last year's high payables reflected the aggressive inventory investment we were making for CSP 16. 
That's all that we have for the formal presentation. So with that, we'll turn it over for questions."

So I think what we said in the past is if we continue to see demand get better and the environment remains somewhat inflationary, then a window would probably open for us to take advantage of a little bit of pricing that the market affords. And we sort of deemed the second quarter to be consistent with those themes. And so we saw the opportunity out to be a little bit more prudent with price, knowing that we were going to see costs coming down the pike in the latter half of the year and so we went forward with that. The environment remains consistent, I think, with that sort of take on it. And we would expect -- we've seen the pricing that has come into the market stick in the market at this point. I would expect that you'd probably see a little bit more incremental benefit in the third quarter before you get into the fourth quarter when some of the costs are starting to step up. I will tell you that, initially, I think that the market was more supportive on the non-fastener products. I think going forward, you'll see it become more supportive on the fastener products given what we've seen out of steel. But as I said, it's just the market opened up a little bit in the second quarter It should remain open a little in the third quarter. And by the time you get into the fourth quarter, you'll probably start to see the costs move through our supply chain to begin to catch up a little bit with the -- with what the market has allowed from pricing."

And frankly, I think this quarter, everything just kind of went our way. That's not necessarily the norm, if you will. So we'll just have to kind of see what Q3 and Q4 look like in that regard. But I mean, that said, I guess, there's 2 things that are working in our favor. And one is I do think in Q3, you might get a little bit of an incremental contribution from price that you didn't in Q2, again, before that begins to get worked off in Q4 from costs. But the other thing is there was really nothing unsustainable in the pieces that pushed up the gross margin, right? When you think about the shop leverage, when you think about the success that we're having with the CSP and the exclusive brands and things of that nature, there's nothing that's unsustainable in there. And so will they all move in the same direction in Q3 as they seem to in Q2? I mean, we'll have to wait and see. But we think that the fact that we have an opportunity to have a quarter like this, really reflects a lot of good things that we're doing in the field with a lot of initiatives. And we think that those things will certainly carry forward not just into the next quarter, but sort of beyond that. So that's how I'd characterize the gross margin environment."

And so it's very important. For that matter, during the start of April, even tweaked the way our regional leaders are paid to include a component for gross margin, dollar growth, not percentage, dollar growth, because it's about our growth drivers really center on helping us grow the business faster, knowing that some of the offshoot of that is the gross margin environment over time is challenging. So we'd look at it and say, ""Where do our cost structure need to be 2 and 5 years from now?"" and that's what we're obsessing about. But day-to-day, we're working on all the levers, and as Holden mentioned, those levers went in our direction. What makes me feel better about sustainability is the fact that we picked up 5 or 7 or 8 basis points from a bunch of different places and that makes it a little stickier. It's still a challenging environment, and our growth drivers are still going to have the drag on our gross margin that we've talked about for the last 1.5 years, 2 years, and that reality hasn't changed. As far as the last part where it starts with a number that I'm not going to mention out loud.

That was always predicated on the fact that we saw a certain size of market. And that size of market changed as our product lines have changed. S",474,"Yes, first off, on the underlying question of the 3,200 or 3,500 potential locations that we've talked about. That was always predicated on the fact that we saw a certain size of market. And that size of market changed as our product lines have changed. So if you'd have been looking at that company that went public back in 1987 that was basically in selling fasteners, we looked at our market as $15 billion, maybe a $20 billion opportunity. And someday, we'd have 500 Fastenal locations across North America selling nuts and bolts. As we moved into the mid-1990s, we were expanding our product lines, we were -- our decentralized nature, we had a chunk of business that was outside that fastener product line. And we looked at that and said, ""Boy, if we can really be successful in the non-fastener products."" The market's a lot bigger, and over time, that number grew to 1,000 potential and 2,000, and ultimately, about 3,500 locations in North America. And as I said, included U.S., Canada and Mexico. I'm not intelligent nor informed enough to give a comment on outside of North America at this time. That number is intact from the standpoint of there's this $150 billion, $160 billion market out there, and we think we can continue to enjoy an ever larger piece of that market. I think the 3,500 number is potentially overstated to our branch network, understated to our -- Holden's new term is in-market network. Because the Onsite strategy really changes that, so I believe, ultimately, we go well above that number. But it's not exclusively branches. Its branches and Onsites over time, and the vending. The wildcard on your second part of the question about occupancy, we categorize both our vending platform and our FMI, which is Fastenal Managed Inventory platform as part of occupancy. That's principally what's driving it to grow now. And that will continue to be the principal wildcard in there. And we're going to keep investing and growing our vending business.
The other thing I wanted to add to that is bear in mind that what you're seeing in terms of the public branches is those are really decisions that are being made in the field, right? Our people have the ability to decide if they want to open a store or a branch, then -- and there's a good economic reason to do so, then we've done some of that. If they decide that it's more prudent to close a branch either because they're pursuing other initiatives, then they can decide to do that as well. But the decisions with regards to the stores at this point or the branches are really much more -- much more being made in the field then they are any sort of corporate initiative, be aware of that as well."

It's one reason why construction is trending the way it is, and it's one reason why our margins are trending the way it is. So but what those really come down to is just us managing our supply chain really well. And I think that we'll continue to find ways to do that. And absolutely, exclusive brands are going to be a part of the equation. I think that we're going to do, not CSPs of the same size that we did last year, but there are ongoing CSPs to continue to tweak and improve the inventory in the field, to make it available. And I think that's going to continue to improve the market -- the market space as well as the margin.

And so with regard to the 68, just a one correction, those are signings, those aren't necessarily openings in the quarter. Once you sign one of these things up, it does -- there is a process that you need to go down before it's sort of open for business, if you will. So that's a short period and a technicality perhaps, but just to sort of clarify that. But the idea that these will be dilutive forever, we don't believe that, right? We're in the early stage of expanding the signings, expanding the openings and growing this within our revenue base. It began in 2015, it picked up speed in '16, and it's picking up further speed in '17. You're certainly right to say that when you first open these things up, they tend to be a little bit less profitable. As they age, they become somewhat more profitable. And by the way, that speed to profitability is probably faster than people give credit for. But this is a business model that today, sits in sort of the high-teens in terms of an operating margin. And it'll be as I see it, as time goes on, as the pathway to profit perhaps applies to this as it has our branches in the past, can these margins exceed where they sit today. And that's -- we're working very hard to kind of go there. But I think in terms of this sort of emerging bump, if you will, right, I mean as we have a high concentration of very new sites today, I think in 2017 and 2018, you probably have -- you probably have the fact that the initiative is so new dampening the margin, by the time you get into 2019, 2020, 2021, these -- ones you are opening today begin to age, I think they begin to work against that. And so I think you're sort of -- you're going down into the valley of this initiative in '17 and perhaps a good part of '18, but by the time you get to '19 and '20, I think there's certainly the potential for the margins to stabilize and improve on this initiative."

We've talked about the Onsite model and the fact that operating margin-wise, it does have lower operating margins than our business today. And -- but when I look at the business and the regional business units within Fastenal that have the greatest concentration of Onsite business within their business unit, they also have the highest operating margins in the company. Because if you look at it in a static sense, if we just plopped a bunch of Onsites in our business today and our store network is static, in short, yes, it'd be dilutive to our operating margins. Our returns would be just fine because it requires less working capital to support, but it would be dilutive. But the pathway to profit that we talked about for the last decade is still intact, and our store network -- excuse me, our branch network is improving every day as the average store -- branch size increases. And so while it is dilutive, it's no less -- or no more dilutive than non-fasteners and National Accounts have been to our business over the last 20 years. You -- the business continues to evolve. Your average location revenue continues to go up. And that's probably the strongest anti-dilutive or profit-enhancing component we have within the model is that pathway to profit, it's still there."

It's really difficult for us to say.

To me, the biggest component, and Holden touched on it a second ago when he talked about the signings of the Onsites and what that means. So those 68 Onsites we signed in the quarter, those will largely turn on in the next 3 to 4 -- 3 to 5 months. And some of the signings from the first quarter have yet to turn on. And I think it's safe to say you're probably going to see, and I hope you see this because it tells me the Onsite is taking off, you're probably going to see in the short term, 1 to 3 employees. So let's just say it's a couple. That would imply we'd probably be adding 150 people, 140 people just from the impact of the Onsite. The remainder will be more of a function of what our business is doing from the standpoint of growth. And the improvement we saw in the last 30 days in the underlying economy, I believe can continue to enhance the revenue on a per location basis and will potentially cause that number to be higher possibly between 200 and 300. Beyond that, I probably wouldn't go too deep into it because a lot of it's going to depend on the needs. We manage that not centrally, we manage that locally. What we do centrally is we challenge folks with the facts. We point out our expense patterns. We point out the seasonal patterns of our business. It's really a reminder exercise. But just the fact that we have close to 70 Onsites that we'll be turning on, that's going to cause some headcount increase."

What you're going to be entering into in the second half of this year is you're going to be coming up against that sort of attrition in the back half of '16 even as we're adding now because of better heads. So I think that what we've been seeing is addition of heads all year. I think we'll continue to see that.

Before I turn to the flipbook, I'd just like to make a few general comments. One, a message to our team. And that is last December, we sat down, w",2036,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our Second Quarter Earnings Call. 
Before I turn to the flipbook, I'd just like to make a few general comments. One, a message to our team. And that is last December, we sat down, we talked about 3 simple concepts for 2017: One was grow our sales; second one was grow our earnings; and the third one is to think big.  And on the gross sales front, it was all about focusing on our growth drivers and your team. And I'm pleased to say, in the first quarter, our internal goal of system, we came in at 100.7% of our internal sales goal. In the second quarter, we came in at 102.6%. So I'm very pleased and proud of the execution put forth by our team thus far in 2017.
The second one was about grow earnings. Biggest message there is have a plan. Gross margin, know your levers, know the trends of our business, but more importantly, know the leverage you can pull in the short term to help your gross margin. I think we executed well on those in the current quarter. 
The second one is our biggest component of operating expenses is payroll. 2017 is going to be a tough year for managing payroll from the standpoint. We were very bullish coming into the year on where our prospects could be. We had great momentum, I felt, coming from 2016. And one of our biggest expense growths in the current year would be incentive comp. I've talked about that in previous calls and at investor conferences that a high percentage of our payroll is incentive-based, whether that be at the branch level, at the distribution level or in the manufacturing or support areas. We reward our people based on our ability to accomplish goals. And I felt we'd have somewhat of a reloading of the incentive comp in the current year and we've seen that in the current quarter. 
Finally, on the aspect of occupancy. Frankly, it just can't grow outside of vending. Vending, we include in occupancy expense because it's just another shelf within our network of distribution, but being very mindful of where our costs can go, and I think we did a nice job of that in the current quarter as well. 
Finally, think big. I think, Onsite is an example of us thinking big over the last 5 years of how we can grow the business faster. Vending is another over the last 10. And the challenge we put forth to our self is always looking for what's next in that think big category about growing the business, growing our service to our customers and growing the opportunities for our employees and our shareholders long term. 
On the gross margin front, I believe it's been, and correct me if I'm wrong on this one, I believe it's been since the last time we had a gross profit improvement year-over-year on a relative basis was the third quarter of 2013. I believe we were up 2 basis points that quarter. So I would suspect in the last 14 earnings calls, 12 out of every 10 questions have centered on gross margin, why it's down. I'm thankful we won't get that question today, but maybe a variation of that. Holden will provide some more insight on that as he goes through his notes, but I would ask you to indulge me with a few thoughts here. 
One is about human nature. When an organization is struggling to grow, within each of our customers, there's a universal spend that we typically play in. And that universe has the gross margins you've grown accustomed to. Oftentimes, we will step out of that portion of the spend and go deeper into their supply chain and not all that product has the same margin profile. I'm sure some of the improvement of our gross margin in the current quarter is the economy, and our growth drivers gave us more -- a little bit more lift and maybe we don't have to dig quite as deep. And -- but one aspect where we are digging deeper and continue to dig deeper is our Onsite strategy, that's the core strength of that, is you go into a broader range of products because you have a different cost structure. 
We have a better stocking plan. In 2016, we rolled out what we called CSP 16, that's our Customer Service Project. It's helped our in-brand sales, it's helped our construction business, both of which have helped our margin. 
We've also done a nice job with hub stocking. Nick Lundquist and his team have done a wonderful job balancing inventory dollars to advantages for our branch personnel and what to sell to drive their gross margin. And we've gained some traction on that. It took some inventory dollars to do it, but we're generating a great return on that investment. 
And frankly, better analytics. Again, Nick and his team have done I believe a better job supporting the branches, our district managers and our regional VPs on understanding their business, understanding the levers to pull in their gross profit, there's a whole bunch of them. 
And finally, I'll touch on about greater execution. The one thing that I think's really great about our gross margin this quarter isn't the fact that it's up, it's the fact that the improvement came in 5 basis points here and 5 basis points there from about a dozen different places. That gives me more comfort in our ability to execute and our ability to hang on to some of that because the long-term trends that Holden has talked about in previous calls are intact, and that is our growth drivers related to non-fasteners, related to Onsite, related to vending, don't raise our gross margin.  And so execution steps is what we need to do to offset some of that impact over time. 
Now switching to the prepared flipbook. Sales growth returned to double digits in the second quarter of 2017. Underlying demand improved, but we outpaced the market due to the continual momentum in our key growth drivers. One other item I'll point out is that we did see some improvements in the underlying economy, and again, Holden will touch deeper on that in a few minutes. 
One point that jumped out for me, in previous calls, I've talked about our national account business representing just under 50% of our revenue. And that our top 100 customers represent about half of that number. Both of those groups, our overall national account and our top 100, have been performing well for us with one exception. Our top 10 customers have been negative for us all year long and, in June, flipped to positive. That improvement from May to June represented -- from those top 10 customers, represented about 20% of our improvement in the growth numbers from May to June. So that's a sign of what the economy did when I look at the May to June numbers that I can tangibly put my finger on. A piece of that 20% obviously came from things we're doing with that customer group, but their activity has improved. The other 80% I'm sure has elements of the economy in it, too, but a lot of elements of just pure execution by the Fastenal team, and I'm proud of them for their efforts.
We continue to control our operating costs despite having the growth-related compensations or opportunities, depending on how you want to look at it. As a result, our incremental margins topped 25% this quarter. That number was reduced by somewhere between 25% and 30% because of the expansion of incentive comp. We're -- earlier, I touched on thinking big, and we can't emphasize that enough, we're encouraging all of our leaders, and we have 20,000 of them within Fastenal. We're encouraging all of our leaders to think big about our long-term planning and our future.
Finally, as we mentioned in last quarter's call, we acquired a company in Michigan, Mansco. I'm very pleased to say have exceeded our expectations in the first 3 months. We're learning quickly and really well how to play in the sandbox together. And we don't do a lot of acquisitions, that's a learning curve for us. And they haven't been acquired a lot, so that's a learning curve for them. And -- but I'm pleased to say both teams have gelled really well, and I want to say thanks to the Mansco team for pushing us over the 10% mark and into double-digit territory for sales growth for the quarter.
On Page 4 of the flipbook, we signed 68 Onsites in the quarter. We have 486 active Onsites today. We've stated earlier that our goal, it's a lofty one, our goal is to add 275 to 300 signings this year versus the 176 we did last year.
I'm pleased with the 68 because, in the quarter, we had a very slow April on signings. We have our big customer show. I'm pleased to say we had in excess of 500 Onsite candidates at that show, so a very good showing from our team of inviting great customer opportunities. But when you take your entire group out of commission for a week of the month, you have a weak month. And despite that, we still signed 68.
So year-to-date 2 years ago, we had 30 signings. Year-to-date 2016, we had 92 signings. Year-to-date in 2017, we have 132. That's 4x our 2015 number and a 43% increase over prior year. So very good, very pleased with the trends we're seeing there.
Because of the expansion of Onsites, one thing you will probably notice reading through our release is we've removed a term from our release, that term is store. We've replaced that with the term branch. A term that we would have used prior to 15 years ago, we did for CSP because we thought it described our business well. And we also talked about Onsites in in-market units. Holden's better with words than I am and I like the way he's presenting the data. But it's really talking about our market presence and the fact that our branches and Onsites are an extension of our distribution network. We're not a store, we're not a retailer. We're a service organization that's part of our customers' supply chain. 
We signed 4,881 vending devices. Frankly, a little disappointing from my perspective. We didn't break 5,000 like we did in the first quarter. Similar to the Onsites, we saw a slowdown in April around the show. The May and June numbers snapped back nicely, and I feel really good about that. Our goal remains 22,000. That's a lofty goal similar to our Onsite goal, but that's part about thinking big. 
And the final piece is we still are removing a few more machines than I'd like to see. We removed quite a few in 2016 because of our optimization process. I think that's the right move. In the first 2 quarters of this year, we still are removing some underperforming machines. Our average revenue per machine continues to improve. And but we still challenged ourselves on how to get better at the signings, the installs and identifying on day 1 that 10 is the right number versus 8, versus finding that out a year or 2 years later and reducing to 8. 8 is the right number, it's just knowing that sooner is key. And that ties back to our letter to shareholders where we talked about recognizing the facts of our business and figuring out how to improve the business going forward.
National Accounts rose 13% in the second quarter versus second quarter of '16, a wonderful job of growing our business and making promises, and our branch personnel, our district personnel and our regional personnel are doing a great job of honoring those promises we've made. 
Finally, the CSP products that we rolled out [indiscernible] product continues to grow nicely faster than the company and has brought new life to our construction business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

Thanks for joining the call. So just to hit on what Dan covered on Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the second quarter were up 10.6%, that's an acceleration from up 6.2% in the first quarter. The",1328,"Great. Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call. 
So just to hit on what Dan covered on Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the second quarter were up 10.6%, that's an acceleration from up 6.2% in the first quarter. The timing of the Good Friday shift into April from March this year did cost the quarter about 50 basis points. But on the other hand, we included Mansco this quarter, which we acquired on March 31, and that added about 130 basis points. If you adjust those 2 factors, the second quarter daily sales rate was around 9.7%. Either way, growth accelerated through the quarter. And even better than that, in June, the daily sales were up 13% or up 11.6%, excluding Mansco.
As Dan covered on Page 4, our growth in the quarter results significantly from customer adoption of our services and growth drivers. However, as demonstrated on Page 5 of the book, some of our improvement clearly reflects a favorable macro backdrop. The Purchasing Managers Index in the U.S., which represents 88% of our revenue, that averaged a healthy 55.8 reading. Industrial production growth was still modest in the quarter, but did speed up a bit over the prior quarter. These metrics underpinned improvement in our industrial and construction end markets in the second quarter as well as acceleration in both our fastener and non-fastener lines, as you can see from the charts in the presentation. In fact, it's difficult to identify a major market that is acting particularly poorly at this point. And the feedback that we're getting from our RVPs remains overall very favorable. 
Our National Accounts growth accelerated up 13.1% in the quarter with 68 of our top 100 accounts growing. And we saw a similar pattern in our branches, with 62% of our locations growing in the second quarter, which is up from 58% in the first quarter and from the 54% level that we saw through much of 2016. So the market improvement that began in the first quarter solidified in the second, and momentum in our growth drivers remains healthy, so we feel pretty good about our top line entering the third quarter.
Flipping over to Slide 6. Our gross margin was 49.8% in the second quarter. That's up 30 basis points versus the second quarter last year. Again, we're pleased to point out that this breaks a significant string of consecutive annual declines in this measure. It really -- the combination of product and customer mix, as well as the inclusion of Mansco in our results, that still had a 30 to 40 basis point negative impact on the number. But this quarter, that was more than offset by a basket of positive variables. For instance, we did leverage our asset-heavy parts of our business like manufacturing and freight. Our sales of private-label brands grew by 30 basis points in the mix versus last year. And efforts to put more product into the field such as the CSP initiative has improved the product decisions and sourcing of both our purchasing operation and our field personnel. None of these variables were individually particularly large, but they did combine to push our margin up for the quarter. In a nutshell, organizational factors skewed heavily in favor of gross margin in the second quarter, though none of those factors would seem to be onetime or unsustainable in nature to us.
As it relates to pricing, the combination of good demand and an inflationary environment did provide the branches with some modest pricing lift in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, this did not meaningfully add to sales and was only a modest contributor to gross margin. Price in excess of cost was a bit more of a factor behind the sequential improvement in gross margin, however. We expect favorable price and cost dynamics in the third quarter as well before costs begin to catch up in the fourth quarter.
Our operating margin was 21.2%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. 30 basis points of this improvement relates to the gross margin increase. The other 30 basis points reflects our organization again doing a nice job leveraging total operating expenses. 
If I look at the employee-related costs, they were up 9.3% in the quarter. Roughly 3/4 of this increase can be attributed to Mansco's headcount as well as incentive-related expenses stemming from our return to growth, such as profit sharing and even more significantly, as Dan alluded to, bonuses. Absent these impacts, we believe the subdued growth better reflects the fact that our headcount is down slightly year over year. We did add 352 new employees in the second quarter over the first quarter. And if demand remains strong, we would expect our headcount to rise. However, we're still committed to leveraging the employee-related cost line. 
Occupancy-related expenses were up 3.4%, reflecting the impact of 29 net branch closures, offset by growth in vending. And selling, transportation-related expenses were up 3.2%. That this line grew reflects growth in our business, while the tapering off of that growth rate from the first quarter reflects stabilization of fuel prices and easier year-over-year comparisons.  It all rolled into an incremental margin in the second quarter that was at 26.4%. If you exclude Mansco, the organic incremental margin would have been 27.5%. And we view this as being consistent with past statements we've made with respect to incremental margin potential. 
Shifting over to Slide 7. We generated $83 million in operating cash in the second quarter, which is 55.7% of net income for the period. Bear in mind, the second quarters are typically poor for cash generation as we typically have 2 tax payments in the period.  In the first half, in total, we generated $293 million, which represents 103.6% of net income, an improvement on the 98.4% that we had in the first half of 2016, primarily as a result of better earnings. 
Net CapEx in the second quarter was $33.7 million, down 41% due in large part to the absence of spending on vending machines related to the leased locker program that was ramping up in Q2 last year. We did increase our anticipated capital spending target for 2017 to $127 million, that's from $119 million last quarter, which reflects some investment we're opting to make on the IT and logistics sides of our business. Our free cash flow for the quarter and year-to-date, then, was $49 million and $249 million, up a healthy 43% and 64%, respectively.
In the second quarter, we spent $92.5 million in dividends. We also spent $56.7 million to repurchase 1.3 million shares of Fastenal's' stock, which closed out our most recent authorization. We had an announcement last night noting that our board approved the company to buy back up to 5 million in additional shares at our discretion. This spending in the quarter, combined with low seasonal free cash flow, pushed our debt up to $445 million as compared to $365 million in the first quarter and $430 million in the second quarter last year. But at 18.3% of total capital, we view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business and pay our dividend.
In terms of working capital, we were comfortable with where the numbers came out. Receivables growth excluding Mansco, was up 13% in the second quarter. That it grew faster than sales really just reflects the acceleration in growth that we experienced as the quarter advanced.
Inventory, excluding Mansco, was up 4.5% in the second quarter. And that reflects the ability of the field to leverage the heavy investment in branch inventory in 2016 and more energy enterprise-wide on this line.
Payables, excluding Mansco, were down 12.5%. Last year's high payables reflected the aggressive inventory investment we were making for CSP 16. 
That's all that we have for the formal presentation. So with that, we'll turn it over for questions."

So I think what we said in the past is if we continue to see demand get better and the environment remains somewhat inflationary, then a window would probably open for us to take advantage of a little bit of pricing that the market affords. And we sort of deemed the second quarter to be consistent with those themes. And so we saw the opportunity out to be a little bit more prudent with price, knowing that we were going to see costs coming down the pike in the latter half of the year and so we went forward with that. The environment remains consistent, I think, with that sort of take on it. And we would expect -- we've seen the pricing that has come into the market stick in the market at this point. I would expect that you'd probably see a little bit more incremental benefit in the third quarter before you get into the fourth quarter when some of the costs are starting to step up. I will tell you that, initially, I think that the market was more supportive on the non-fastener products. I think going forward, you'll see it become more supportive on the fastener products given what we've seen out of steel. But as I said, it's just the market opened up a little bit in the second quarter It should remain open a little in the third quarter. And by the time you get into the fourth quarter, you'll probably start to see the costs move through our supply chain to begin to catch up a little bit with the -- with what the market has allowed from pricing."

I mean, the mix elements that we've called out before are still very much there. I mean, to the extent that we are successful with our Onsites and safety and things of that nature, the mix elements you called out are still there. They're not going away if we're successful with our growth drivers. If you think about the second quarter, it's not unusual for there to be a little bit of seasonality, to keep margins flat, maybe slightly down. And frankly, I think this quarter, everything just kind of went our way. That's not necessarily the norm, if you will. So we'll just have to kind of see what Q3 and Q4 look like in that regard. But I mean, that said, I guess, there's 2 things that are working in our favor. And one is I do think in Q3, you might get a little bit of an incremental contribution from price that you didn't in Q2, again, before that begins to get worked off in Q4 from costs. But the other thing is there was really nothing unsustainable in the pieces that pushed up the gross margin, right? When you think about the shop leverage, when you think about the success that we're having with the CSP and the exclusive brands and things of that nature, there's nothing that's unsustainable in there. And so will they all move in the same direction in Q3 as they seem to in Q2? I mean, we'll have to wait and see. But we think that the fact that we have an opportunity to have a quarter like this, really reflects a lot of good things that we're doing in the field with a lot of initiatives. And we think that those things will certainly carry forward not just into the next quarter, but sort of beyond that. So that's how I'd characterize the gross margin environment."

And from what you know about Fastenal for the last 50 years or actually last 30 years that we've been public, gross margin's an important part of our business because it's the -- it funds our ability to do the things we do and to grow the business. And so it's very important. For that matter, during the start of April, even tweaked the way our regional leaders are paid to include a component for gross margin, dollar growth, not percentage, dollar growth, because it's about our growth drivers really center on helping us grow the business faster, knowing that some of the offshoot of that is the gross margin environment over time is challenging. So we'd look at it and say, ""Where do our cost structure need to be 2 and 5 years from now?"" and that's what we're obsessing about. But day-to-day, we're working on all the levers, and as Holden mentioned, those levers went in our direction. What makes me feel better about sustainability is the fact that we picked up 5 or 7 or 8 basis points from a bunch of different places and that makes it a little stickier. It's still a challenging environment, and our growth drivers are still going to have the drag on our gross margin that we've talked about for the last 1.5 years, 2 years, and that reality hasn't changed. As far as the last part where it starts with a number that I'm not going to mention out loud. Kind of like Voldemort in Harry Potter, I'm not going to mention it out loud because that's not where our head's at. Our head is at growing sales, growing earnings and thinking big."

S",474,"Yes, first off, on the underlying question of the 3,200 or 3,500 potential locations that we've talked about. That was always predicated on the fact that we saw a certain size of market. And that size of market changed as our product lines have changed. So if you'd have been looking at that company that went public back in 1987 that was basically in selling fasteners, we looked at our market as $15 billion, maybe a $20 billion opportunity. And someday, we'd have 500 Fastenal locations across North America selling nuts and bolts. As we moved into the mid-1990s, we were expanding our product lines, we were -- our decentralized nature, we had a chunk of business that was outside that fastener product line. And we looked at that and said, ""Boy, if we can really be successful in the non-fastener products."" The market's a lot bigger, and over time, that number grew to 1,000 potential and 2,000, and ultimately, about 3,500 locations in North America. And as I said, included U.S., Canada and Mexico. I'm not intelligent nor informed enough to give a comment on outside of North America at this time. That number is intact from the standpoint of there's this $150 billion, $160 billion market out there, and we think we can continue to enjoy an ever larger piece of that market. I think the 3,500 number is potentially overstated to our branch network, understated to our -- Holden's new term is in-market network. Because the Onsite strategy really changes that, so I believe, ultimately, we go well above that number. But it's not exclusively branches. Its branches and Onsites over time, and the vending. The wildcard on your second part of the question about occupancy, we categorize both our vending platform and our FMI, which is Fastenal Managed Inventory platform as part of occupancy. That's principally what's driving it to grow now. And that will continue to be the principal wildcard in there. And we're going to keep investing and growing our vending business.
The other thing I wanted to add to that is bear in mind that what you're seeing in terms of the public branches is those are really decisions that are being made in the field, right? Our people have the ability to decide if they want to open a store or a branch, then -- and there's a good economic reason to do so, then we've done some of that. If they decide that it's more prudent to close a branch either because they're pursuing other initiatives, then they can decide to do that as well. But the decisions with regards to the stores at this point or the branches are really much more -- much more being made in the field then they are any sort of corporate initiative, be aware of that as well."

And frankly, we think that over some period of time, that should probably approach 20%. So we think that there's significant opportunity still in exclusive brands. We've been very pleased with how CSP has played out for us. And that basically is taking product, putting it into the marketplace and making it available. It's one reason why construction is trending the way it is, and it's one reason why our margins are trending the way it is. So but what those really come down to is just us managing our supply chain really well. And I think that we'll continue to find ways to do that. And absolutely, exclusive brands are going to be a part of the equation. I think that we're going to do, not CSPs of the same size that we did last year, but there are ongoing CSPs to continue to tweak and improve the inventory in the field, to make it available. And I think that's going to continue to improve the market -- the market space as well as the margin. Those are sort of the 2 that come to mind, frankly, as being -- having tremendous opportunity going forward."

And so with regard to the 68, just a one correction, those are signings, those aren't necessarily openings in the quarter. Once you sign one of these things up, it does -- there is a process that you need to go down before it's sort of open for business, if you will. So that's a short period and a technicality perhaps, but just to sort of clarify that. But the idea that these will be dilutive forever, we don't believe that, right? We're in the early stage of expanding the signings, expanding the openings and growing this within our revenue base. It began in 2015, it picked up speed in '16, and it's picking up further speed in '17. You're certainly right to say that when you first open these things up, they tend to be a little bit less profitable. As they age, they become somewhat more profitable. And by the way, that speed to profitability is probably faster than people give credit for. But this is a business model that today, sits in sort of the high-teens in terms of an operating margin. And it'll be as I see it, as time goes on, as the pathway to profit perhaps applies to this as it has our branches in the past, can these margins exceed where they sit today. And that's -- we're working very hard to kind of go there. But I think in terms of this sort of emerging bump, if you will, right, I mean as we have a high concentration of very new sites today, I think in 2017 and 2018, you probably have -- you probably have the fact that the initiative is so new dampening the margin, by the time you get into 2019, 2020, 2021, these -- ones you are opening today begin to age, I think they begin to work against that. And so I think you're sort of -- you're going down into the valley of this initiative in '17 and perhaps a good part of '18, but by the time you get to '19 and '20, I think there's certainly the potential for the margins to stabilize and improve on this initiative."

We've talked about the Onsite model and the fact that operating margin-wise, it does have lower operating margins than our business today. And -- but when I look at the business and the regional business units within Fastenal that have the greatest concentration of Onsite business within their business unit, they also have the highest operating margins in the company. Because if you look at it in a static sense, if we just plopped a bunch of Onsites in our business today and our store network is static, in short, yes, it'd be dilutive to our operating margins. Our returns would be just fine because it requires less working capital to support, but it would be dilutive. But the pathway to profit that we talked about for the last decade is still intact, and our store network -- excuse me, our branch network is improving every day as the average store -- branch size increases. And so while it is dilutive, it's no less -- or no more dilutive than non-fasteners and National Accounts have been to our business over the last 20 years. You -- the business continues to evolve. Your average location revenue continues to go up. And that's probably the strongest anti-dilutive or profit-enhancing component we have within the model is that pathway to profit, it's still there."

To me, the biggest component, and Holden touched on it a second ago when he talked about the signings of the Onsites and what that means. So those 68 Onsites we signed in the quarter, those will largely turn on in the next 3 to 4 -- 3 to 5 months. And some of the signings from the first quarter have yet to turn on. And I think it's safe to say you're probably going to see, and I hope you see this because it tells me the Onsite is taking off, you're probably going to see in the short term, 1 to 3 employees. So let's just say it's a couple. That would imply we'd probably be adding 150 people, 140 people just from the impact of the Onsite. The remainder will be more of a function of what our business is doing from the standpoint of growth. And the improvement we saw in the last 30 days in the underlying economy, I believe can continue to enhance the revenue on a per location basis and will potentially cause that number to be higher possibly between 200 and 300. Beyond that, I probably wouldn't go too deep into it because a lot of it's going to depend on the needs. We manage that not centrally, we manage that locally. What we do centrally is we challenge folks with the facts. We point out our expense patterns. We point out the seasonal patterns of our business. It's really a reminder exercise. But just the fact that we have close to 70 Onsites that we'll be turning on, that's going to cause some headcount increase."

What you're going to be entering into in the second half of this year is you're going to be coming up against that sort of attrition in the back half of '16 even as we're adding now because of better heads. So I think that what we've been seeing is addition of heads all year. I think we'll continue to see that.

But I wi",1515,"Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings call.
Holden asked me to stay pretty tight to the script today, so I'm going to be going through the slide deck, first couple of slides of that. But I will preface my comments with just a few thoughts and this is as much as shout out to our Fastenal team as it is to our Fastenal shareholders. 
My first comment to the team is job well done on the quarter. For 9 consecutive months in 2017, we have exceeded our internal goals for sales growth. I'm proud of the team and I'm happy for the team.
Last December, I challenged them at our annual gathering of leadership of Fastenal with 3 simple messages as we approached 2017. One is let's just go -- grow our sales. Let's get the business growing. We have a lot of growth drivers. Let's execute and grow our sales. Secondly, let's manage the business while and grow earnings because long term, the rewards we can create for our customer, our employees, our shareholders and ourselves are centered on our ability to grow our earnings and our returns long term. And if we grow faster than other companies that you can choose to invest in, the market will reward us from the standpoint of valuation and our employees will benefit of that because a fair number of our employees are also shareholders of the company. Finally, I challenge them to think big about the business. We're going through a massive transformation in the business right now. We've talked about it in previous Investor Days. We've talked about it in our filings. In the last 10 years, we have grown a tremendously supportive business within Fastenal Holding. In the last 3 years, we've grown tremendously support to Fastenal and to our customers called Onsite. They're complementary to each other. There are also businesses that Fastenal is uniquely qualified to be successful in and to think big about our future and how the business is going to grow more. 
As you know, it's in the release, our sales growth accelerated in the third quarter '17. Year-to-date, our daily sales growth is 10.1%. That's the first double digits we have seen since 2014. And as I called out in the quote in release, we ended the quarter with 15.3% daily sales growth in the month of September. Again, very pleased with top line performance in the quarter.
Our growth drivers continue to gain traction. We have record signings in the third quarter as it relates to Onsite, putting us on track for a very aggressive goal of 275 to 300 signings. Recall, if you go back 4 years ago, 5 years ago, 6 years ago, on average, we were signing about 10 years. In 2015, we began to move the needle, and we began to challenge our team to sign more and we improved the number to about 75, about 175 the next year. And our goal this year was to add another 100 again and do at least 275. I feel very good about us being on pace to accomplish that. Year-to-date, we have signed 213, 64, 68, and now 81.
In all that, we've been investing behind the scenes in additional infrastructure to support the Onsite business. That includes IT infrastructure. That includes implementation infrastructure. Despite those investments, we've continued to obtain operating expense, leveraging our business. Our incremental margin was 21% in the quarter. 
And one thing about the quarter, it's a 63 day quarter versus a 64 last year. For us to lose a day in the quarter is kind of unusual. We do just over $18 million a day in business. If we would had a more normal quarter, 64 to 64, most of that incremental gross profit dollars would've gone to the bottom line and our incremental margins on that business would have been about 25%. So feel very good about the expense management we were exercising as we grow and invest in the future of our business.
Finally, if I look at it from the standpoint of how much of that converted into cash, our operating cash flow in the third quarter was a record for any third quarter in the history of Fastenal, both from the standpoint of absolute dollars and as relative to our earnings. Very pleased with the team. And that requires a big effort from both our supply chain folks as well as our branch and Onsite personnel of managing the inventory growth because that is of the biggest wildcard when it comes to our working capital needs.
Touching on the Onsites again, going to the second slide, 81 Onsites signed. We have 555 active sites. That's up almost 48% from a year ago. And again, I reiterate, our goal is 275 to 300 signings. 
A sidebar I'll throw in as it relates to Onsites. As we've ramped up our Onsites in the last several years, it's translated into our ability to grow and take market share faster.
In yesterday's meeting I had with our Board of Directors, I was walking through with them that concept of the growing sales component. Last year, in the second -- in the third quarter, excuse me, about 25% of our district leaders, so we have about 250 district leaders in our business. About 25% of them do their business double digit. It's no coincidence or it is a coincidence that in the prior year, in 2015, about 25% of our district managers signed an Onsite and that translated to 75 signings. Last year, and I've shared this on calls before, last year, we more than doubled our signings because roughly 54% of our district managers signed in Onsite in 2016. Interestingly enough, in the third quarter of 2017, 54% of our district managers grew their business double digit.
Year-to-date, in 2017 -- and our goal for the year in establishing the 275 to 300 Onsite signings, our goal was to keep improving the participation of our leaders in this growth of driver. And I challenged the team, can we get to 80%? So we've gone from 25% to just over 50%. Can we add another 30% and get to 80%? Year-to-date, 64% of our district managers have signed an Onsite. Success for us in vending 5 and 6 and 7 years ago came from more participation across the organization. Success for us in Onsite follows the same path, a greater portion of our business engaged with their customer and a manifestation for us is vending and Onsite signings, year-to-date at 64%. I don't if we'll accomplish 80% by year-end, but I'm really impressed with what we've done in the first 9 months of the year.
Total in market sites today, 2,973. A year ago, we were 2,921. So that continues to grow as we morph a piece of our business closer to our customer. As you see from our filings, we closed some branches in the last 12 months as we've done in the last 5 years. Think of it is not a closing, but think of it as a consolidation. We've consolidated 2 branches because part of the business of one have moved Onsite, but our local presence continues to grow.
We signed 4,771 vending devices, basically on par of what we did in the third quarter of last year. To me, the most meaningful thing is our business there continues to grow double digits, about just over 20% growth, 21% on a daily basis, just under 20% on an absolute basis because 1 less day. But our number of devices we're removing as we've gone through they year and as we going third quarter. So very pleased from the standpoint. It feels like our signings are better and our performance on the existing base is better. 
Finally, our National Accounts business grew about 17% in the quarter, which means our non-National business grew just over double digits for the first time in quite some quarters to give us our combined growth. So very pleased with the quarter. Our growth drivers are moving the needle. We're managing our operating expenses through that. And one thing you'll notice, I've been completely silent about our gross margin. Holden's going to touch on a few points of that. I'm sure there will be a question or 2 on gross margin, but I'll throw one piece out to the group for what it's growth category. If you look at Onsite, if you look at vending and if you look at our Mansco acquisition, add these 3 components of our business up and they account for about 2/3 of our growth from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year. We've previously said all 3 of these operated at a gross margin below our company average but have a very attractive operating margin and return characteristics. And at the end of the day, that's what you pay us for. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden"
270747,538934077,1311638,"Fastenal Company, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 11, 2017",2017-10-11,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good morning.

So before jumping back into the slide deck, I did want to call on a few items that may third quarter 2017 unique. 
The first is, I just want to call your attention to last page of the supplemental deck. This quarter, we we did take fresh look of the market exposure of our business and made certain adjustments of that affected our end-market mix and slightly altered the growth rate versus what we've reported in the past months and quarters, so please feel free to take a look at that page. 
Secondly, as Dan indicated, we did have 1 less selling day in the third quarter than was through the prior year. Based on our September daily sales rate, that cost us more than $18 million in sales during the period. That was known, of course, but keep in mind that many of our costs, notably the employee-related expenses, are not days dependent and that does affect leverage. 
Third, we estimate that the hurricane that hit the Gulf, the southeast and Puerto Rico shaved 20 to 30 basis points from revenue during the quarter. It's hard to estimate the impact of post storm on our volumes, but we do believe that some of that was present in September, particularly in the Gulf, though not at a level to magnitude -- not at a magnitude to offset the original lost sales. In addition to the top line impact, the hurricanes also were a very slight drag to gross margin due to write off of damage and an increase of sales of low-margin storm related products like generators.
Now with that said, let's look back at Slide 5. As Dan indicated, total sales were up 11.8% in the third quarter, but on a daily sales basis, they were up 13.6%, which is an acceleration or up 10.6% in the second quarter. Mansco contributed 130 basis points of this growth, which is consistent with the prior quarter. The third quarter finished strongly with September's daily sales growth coming in at up 15.3% or up 14%, excluding the impact of Mansco. 
In terms of end markets tone, the third quarter felt a lot like the second quarter. Macro data remain favorable with the PMI averaging a healthy 58.6 and industrial production continuing to grow at a low-single digit rate. As a result, we saw broad strength and further acceleration of our manufacturing markets while construction sustained a mid-single digit growth rate. From a product standpoint, we experienced acceleration in both fastener and non-fastener lines. And from a customer standpoint, National Accounts accelerated again, up 17.3% in the quarter with 71 of our top 100 accounts growing.
Growth to the smaller customers also accelerated in the quarter, and it's notable our non-National Accounts customers grew better than 10% in September. This contributed to 64% of our branches growing in the third quarter, which is up from 62% in the second quarter and 58% in the first. So based on sustained strength in most of our end markets and strong momentum in the growth drivers that Dan covered on Slide 4, we feel good about our top line momentum entering the 4Q. 
Now to Slide 6. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin was 49.1%, down 20 basis points versus the third quarter of '16. If I look at our organic fastener and non-fastener product categories, there really was very little change in the gross margin. The very driver the of annual decline was the effect of product and customer mix, with inclusion of Mansco, and the very slight drag afforded by the hurricanes. We think that these combined probably provided about 30 to 40 basis points of drag to the annual gross margin figure.
On a sequential basis, our gross margin was down about 70 basis points. Again, the organic margin for our fastener and non-fastener categories were mostly unchanged, and the price cost dynamic was mostly stable. Seasonality and storm affects did play a role, but the single largest cause of the sequential drop in the period was the behavior of what we call the organizational variables. In the quarter, this includes things such as more third party shipping, foreign exchange adjustments, lower vendor freight credits as a result of really good inventory control in the period and other items of that sort. Which of these variables move in which direction can be hard to predict in any single period, that in most quarters, it winds up being a series of pluses and minuses that even out. But in the second quarter, these skewed heavily in favor of gross margin. And in the third, that favorable skewing completely reversed. Given these movements over the last 2 quarters, frankly, we look at the best representation of our gross margin probably being the fact that our year-to-date 2017 gross margin of 49.4% is broadly comparable to our year-to-date 2016 level of 49.5%. So year-to-date, we're down about 10 basis points despite the mix effects, the acquisition and those sort of factors that we've talked about in the past.
Our operating margin was 20.2% in the third quarter, up 20 basis points year-over-year. The 20 basis points decline in gross margin was more than offset by the 40 basis point of leverage over operating expenses. Consistent with how our model works, we've leveraged operating expenses every quarter of 2017, and that's resulted in our year-to-date operating margin expanding to 20.5% from 20.3% in the third quarter -- I'm sorry, year-to-date in 2016.
Employee-related costs were up 12.3%. 130 basis points of this increase relates to Mansco's headcount plus the incremental expenses related to implementation of last rules. Having 1 fewer selling day also had a slight negative impact. The remaining increase is a function of the reset of incentive comp throughout the organization given our return to selling growth in 2017 and an increase in overall staffing. Total headcount growth remained modest, up 1.9% or up 3% on an FTE basis, but we have added personnel in 8 of 9 months this year. It does remain a goal of ours to leveraging the employee-related expenses over time.
Occupancy-related expenses were up 1.5%. Branch costs are slightly lower reflecting closures over the past 12 months, more than offset by growth in our vending installed base. 
Selling and transportation-related expenses were up 2.7%, reflecting our ability to leverage our vehicle moving activities even while we support the growth of our business.
Total incremental operating margin in the third quarter was 21.3%. If you exclude Mansco, that incremental margin was 22.1%. And frankly, we think that, that value was likely reduced by more than 200 basis points by having 1 fewer selling day in the period.
Turning to Slide 7. We generated $163 million in operating cash in the third quarter. That's a record amount for any third quarter and it's 114% of net income. Year-to-date, we've generated $456 million, which represents 107% of net income, an improvement of 100% in the first 9 months of 2016. These improvements are primarily a function of better earnings. 
Net CapEx in the third quarter was $24 million, down 67% due to large part in the absence of spending on vending machines related to the leased locker program. Our anticipated capital spending target for 2017 is unchanged at $127 million.
In the third quarter, we spent $92 million on dividends and $26 million to repurchase shares of stock. Our level of debt was mostly stable at $440 million. And at 17.8% of total capital, we view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business and pay our dividend.
In terms of working capital, we were particularly pleased with the inventories. If you exclude Mansco, our inventories were up 7%, which significantly trails the growth in sales. This reflected the ability of the field to leverage the heavy investment in branch inventory in 2016 and just more energy enterprise-wide on this line.
Receivables growth excluding Mansco is up 15% in the quarter. As in the second quarter, that it grew faster than sales reflects the acceleration in growth that we saw as the quarter progress as well as the relative growth of National Accounts.
Payables excluding Mansco were up 23%. Last year's third quarter was unusually low in the wake of high CSP 16 related purchases in the prior quarter, a dynamic that's likely to repeat in the fourth quarter this year.
That's all we have for our formal presentation. And with that, we'll turn over for questions"

This is part of the call that always drive Holden a little crazy, but he's getting used to it. If I think about the comments he made earlier and I think about our July call, there's quite a few questions that you were really were asking, what lifted gross margins? Because Holden's message over time has been one of, when you think about the growth drivers, the math of the growth drivers should lower our gross margin each year optimistically 20 basis points. Pessimistically, 25 to 30. And that's just the fact that the growth drivers, the vending, and in the case of this year, our acquisition, tend to weigh down. And then over time, the growth of our non-fasteners relative to fasteners, which are obviously influenced by the growth drivers weighted down a bit and organizationally, what can we do to work back, to grab back some margin in our sourcing, our logistics, our selection of products, everything. So in the second quarter, we stumbled upon ourselves a little bit trying to explain to you all in your questions why we weren't confident that gross margin was abnormal because we talked about a lot about the puts and takes and everything was a put. This quarter, as Holden mentioned, a lot of puts and takes lean towards takes, not puts. Our fastener gross margin was down about 10 basis points. Our non-fastener gross margin was completely unchanged from Q2 to Q3 and I think that's an important component. And so it was really the organizational, the other stuff all worked against us in this quarter. History has told me, and my history perspective is 20 years, 4 quarters a year, so that's about 80 quarters, history has told me that you don't get things that go on your way or mostly against your way typically in a quarter. So going into the fourth quarter, and I don't like making predictions, but going into the fourth quarter, I'm not looking for our gross margin to be below [ 49 ] from the standpoint of sequential weakening. We'll get a little bit benefit from the hurricane number. Now, in all honesty, there could be 5 basis points of hurricane in the fourth quarter because in Puerto Rico, we don't know all the answers. We do know that all of our employees are safe in the Gulf Coast, in Florida and in Puerto Rico. And in Houston, we had 2 store or 2 branches that were destroyed by the hurricane. What we know initially about Puerto Rico is we had no branches damaged. It sounds like we came through it reasonably well. Our business suffered, but our assets did not. And more importantly, our employees came through it safely."

But right now, we're anticipating Q4 branch level occupancy, by occupancy, I'm talking about rent. Utilities change with the season, but I'm talking about rent expenses. Right now, we're expecting Q4 will be lower than Q1, and I don't know if that's ever happened in the history of Fastenal. And so we're bring been very mindful of managing that expenses because we do believe we can get in the short term incremental margins in the mid-20s. I can't speak to 4 and 5 years from now if they're mid-20s or if they're closer to the lower 20s, but I know we'll be growing our returns and our cash flow handsomely at that time."

First, I don't think we ever said that we're confident that we backfill.

First, I don't think we ever said that we're confident that we backfill. I think what we've said is that we're going to have a 20 to 30 basis point headwind, just as you say, waking up in the morning at the beginning of the year, and that we'll certainly work very hard to try to back fill that. But over an extended period of time, we would not be surprised if our gross margins are lower, but that is on the back of significant growth in market share gains, right. So I never said confident, but we certainly do wake up everyday knowing we're at a hole and trying make an effort to try to fill it up. But there is certainly never any guarantee that we would do that year-after-year. With respect to the mix question, the mix is not different. When with talk about the 20 to 30 basis point drag, that really does fill in the product. It fills in the customer. That is really trying to take into account all the variables. And the reason it does that is because I look at that mixed relative to how our margins are performing across the products set, which would encompass everything we're doing from a growth standpoint. So no, I think that 20 to 30 basis points that we wake up to every year, I think that's the number. Now we talk about how 3 quarters of our revenues are fasteners and Onsites and National Accounts and vending, that we believe that we have a significant model and those also happen to be our growth drivers. They're going to become a bigger part of the mix, and they also have even lower gross margin. If in a year or 2, that 75% becomes it 80% or 85%, if that 20 to 30 become 30 to 40, maybe, but that's a function of very defensible revenue and market share gains. And we'll try to fill in that hole too, but we certainly would not guarantee it."

And that's the key to the business and that was done in an environment where, as you know, from reading our proxy or if you read through our proxy, you will see that our incentive comp is really centered on paying out a piece of our profit dollars growth, in the case of our leadership team and that's true of many of our support areas as well as our logistics costs, in the case of distribution, and gross profit dollar growth or sales in gross profit dollar growth at the branch and Onsite location. So in the current quarter, our incentive comp is up between 25% and 30% because we're reloading incentive comp. So in that environment, we picked up 40 basis points of expense leverage.

But I'm fairly comfortable at this point that we actually lost more in revenue in September from Irma and Maria than we gained in recovery in Houston. So the hurricanes were a net negative in both August and September. That's what I would say with regards to that. And then in terms of end markets, it really gets down to the manufacturing end markets, right. If you look at our heavy equipment, it accelerated, if you look heavy manufacturing. But honestly our manufacturing business as a whole accelerated across the board. And you talk to the RVPs and they still talk about oil and gas is still doing fairly well and all the flow through that comes with that. So the manufacturing complex in general, I think, continues to accelerate. The transportation complex for us, which doesn't include a lot of automotive, bear in mind, but that continues to expand for us. So it's -- there weren't a lot of areas that I could point that were soft or weren't getting better."

One thing that's a tremendous positive for me when I look at the layers of Onsites we're signing, we're actually seeing better performance out of the 2016 signings that we've been implementing in the latter half of '16 and early half of '17 than we saw in the 2015 signings that we're signing 12 months earlier. Now how much of that is a rising tide? As you all know, the ISM has continued [indiscernible] That's usually a leading indicator. So I'm optimistic that's a sign of things to come, but we're definitely seeing strength in our end markets but we're also seeing underlying better performance in the Onsites we have signed again in '16 versus what we did in '15, which is really positive from the standpoint of the quality versus our historical perspective.

questions, but I see we're at [ 9.5 margin ] because we're expanding our team. We're expanding our distribution capabilities. We're expanding the of the business. But generally speaking, a high piece of the gross profit dollars flow through. If I look at the expansion of incentive comp, and Holden will take us into broader brush when he was looking at his 25% number. If I look the expansion of the margin at the branch, support and leadership levels across the company, our expansion in incentive comp consumed about 11% of our incremental margin. History has shown that number's probably in a more typical year -- probably not at 5%, but probably in that 7% to 8% neighborhood. To Ryan Merkel's earlier question, there's probably about 3 points of incremental margin that are absent this year because of the expansion of incentive comp that wouldn't be there next year because it's already reloaded. I hope that it clarified that point.

But I w",1536,"Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings call.
Holden asked me to stay pretty tight to the script today, so I'm going to be going through the slide deck, first couple of slides of that. But I will preface the -- my comments with just a few thoughts, and this is as much a shout out to our Fastenal team as it is to our Fastenal shareholders.
My first comment to the team is job well done in the quarter. For 9 consecutive months in 2017, we have exceeded our internal goals for sales growth. I'm proud of the team, and I'm happy for the team.
Last December, I challenged them at our annual gathering of leadership of Fastenal with 3 simple messages as we approached 2017. One is let's just grow -- let's just go and grow our sales. Let's get the business growing. We have a lot of growth drivers. Let's execute and grow our sales. Secondly, let's manage the business well and grow our earnings because long term, the rewards we can create for our customer, our employees, our shareholders and ourselves are centered on our ability to grow our earnings and our returns long term. And if we grow it faster than other companies that you can choose to invest in, the market will reward us from the standpoint of valuation and our employees will benefit from that because a fair number of our employees are also shareholders of the company. Finally, I challenged them to think big about the business. We're going through a massive transformation in the business right now. We've talked about it in previous investor days. We've talked about it in our filings. In the last 10 years, we've grown a tremendously supportive business within Fastenal [indiscernible] vending. In the last 3 years, we've grown a tremendously supportive business to Fastenal and to our customers called Onsite. They're complementary to each other. There are also businesses that Fastenal is uniquely qualified to be successful in and to think big about our future and how the business is going to grow more.
As you know, it's in the release, our sales growth accelerated in the third quarter '17. Year-to-date, our daily sales growth is 10.1%. That's the first double digits we have seen since 2014. And as I called out in the quote in the release, we ended the quarter with 15.3% daily sales growth in the month of September. Again, very pleased with top line performance in the quarter.
Our growth drivers continue to gain traction. We have record signings in the third quarter as it relates to Onsite, putting us on track for a very aggressive goal of 275 to 300 signings. Recall, if you go back 4 years ago, 5 years ago, 6 years ago, on average, we were signing about 10 a year. In 2015, we began to move the needle and we began to challenge our team to sign more, and we improved the number to about 75 -- about 175 the next year. And our goal this year was to add another 100 again and do at least 275. I feel very good about us being on pace to accomplish that. Year-to-date, we have signed 213; 64, 68, and now 81.
In all that, we've been investing behind the scenes in additional infrastructure to support the Onsite business. That includes IT infrastructure. That includes implementation infrastructure. Despite those investments, we've continued to obtain operating expense, leveraging our business. Our incremental margin was 21% in the quarter. And one thing about the quarter, we -- it's a 63-day quarter versus a 64 last year. For us to lose a day in the quarter is kind of unusual. We do just over $18 million a day in business. If we would have a more normal quarter, 64 to 64, most of that incremental gross profit dollars would've gone to the bottom line and our incremental margins on that business would have been about 25%. So feel very good about the expense management we were exercising as we grow and invest in the future of our business.
Finally, if I look at it from the standpoint of how much of that converted into cash, our operating cash flow in the third quarter was a record for any third quarter in the history of Fastenal, both from the standpoint of absolute dollars and as -- relative to our earnings. Very pleased with the team. And that requires a big effort from both our supply chain folks as well as our branch and Onsite personnel of managing the inventory growth because that is the biggest wildcard when it comes to our working capital needs.
Touching on the Onsites again, going to the second slide. 81 Onsites signed. We have about 555 active sites. That's up almost 48% from a year ago. And again, I reiterate, our goal is 275 to 300 signings.
A sidebar I'll throw in as it relates to Onsite. As we've ramped up our Onsite in the last several years, it's translated into our ability to grow and take market share faster. In yesterday's meeting I had with our Board of Directors, I was walking through with them that concept of the growing sales component. Last year, in the second -- in the third quarter, excuse me, about 25% of our district leaders -- so we have about 250 district leaders in our business, about 25% of them grew their business double-digit. It's no coincidence -- or it is a coincidence that in the prior year, in 2015, about 25% of our district managers signed in Onsite, and that translated into 75 signings. Last year -- and I've shared this on calls before, last year, we more than doubled our signings because roughly 54% of our district managers signed in Onsite in 2016. Interestingly enough, in the third quarter of 2017, 54% of our district managers grew their business double-digit. Year-to-date, in 2017 -- and our goal for the year in establishing the 275 to 300 Onsite signings, our goal was to keep improving the participation of our leaders in this growth driver. And I challenged the team, can we get to 80%? So we've gone from 25% to just over 50%. Can we add another 30% and get to 80%? 
Year-to-date, 64% of our district managers have signed in Onsite. Success for us in vending 5 and 6 and 7 years ago came from more participation across the organization. Success for us in Onsite follows the same path, a greater portion of our business engaged with their customer, and a manifestation for us is vending and Onsite signings, year-to-date at 64%. I don't know if we'll accomplish 80% by year-end, but I'm really impressed with what we've done in the first 9 months of the year.
Total in-market sites today, 2,973. A year ago, we were at 2,921. So that continues to grow as we morph a piece of our business closer to the customer. As you see from our filings, we've closed some branches in the last 12 months as we've done in the last 5 years. Think of it as not a closing, but think of it as a consolidation. We've consolidated 2 branches because part of the business of one has moved Onsite, but our local presence continues to grow.
We signed 4,771 vending devices, basically on par with what we did in the third quarter of last year. To me, the most meaningful thing is our business there continues to grow double digits, about -- just over 20% growth, 21% on a daily basis, just under 20% on an absolute basis because 1 less day. But our number of devices we're removing is down as we've gone through the year and is down in the third quarter. So very pleased from the standpoint. It feels like our signings are better and our performance on the existing base is better.
Finally, our National Accounts business grew about 17% in the quarter, which means our non-National business grew just over double digits for the first time in quite some quarters to give us our combined growth.
So very pleased with the quarter. Our growth drivers are moving the needle. We're managing our operating expenses through that. And one thing you'll notice, I've been completely silent about our gross margin. Holden's going to touch on a few points of that. I'm sure there will be a question or 2 on gross margin, but I'll throw one piece out to the group in -- for what it's worth category. If you look at Onsite, if you look at vending and if you look at our Mansco acquisition, add these 3 components of our business up and they account for about 2/3 of our growth from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year. We've previously said all 3 of these operated at a gross margin below our company average but have very attractive operating margin and return characteristics. And at the end of the day, that's what you pay us for.
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

So before jumping back into the slide deck, I did want to call on a few items that made the third quarter 2017 unique.  The first is, I just want to call your attention to the last page of the supplemental deck. This quarter, we did take a fresh look at the market exposure of our business and made certain adjustments that affected our end-market mix and slightly altered the growth rates versus what we've reported in the past months and quarters. So please feel free to take a look at that last page.
Secondly, as Dan indicated, we did have 1 less selling day in the third quarter than was through the prior year. Based on our September daily sales rate, that cost us more than $18 million in sales during the period. That was known, of course, but keep in mind that many of our costs, notably the employee-related expenses, are not days dependent, and that does affect leverage.
Third, we estimate that the hurricane that hit the Gulf, the Southeast and Puerto Rico shaved 20 to 30 basis points from revenue during the quarter. It's hard to estimate the impact of post-storm recovery on our volumes, but we do believe that some of that was present in September, particularly in the Gulf, though not at a level to -- not at a magnitude to offset the original lost sales. In addition to the top line impact, the hurricanes also were a very slight drag to gross margin due to the write-off of damaged assets and an increase in sales of low-margin, storm-related products like water and generators.
Now with that said, let's look back at Slide 5. As Dan indicated, total sales were up 11.8% in the third quarter, but on a daily sales basis, they were up 13.6%, which is an acceleration from up 10.6% in the second quarter. Mansco contributed 130 basis points to this growth, which is consistent with the prior quarter. The third quarter finished strongly, with September's daily sales growth coming in at up 15.3% or up 14% excluding the impact of Mansco.
In terms of end market tone, the third quarter felt a lot like the second quarter. Macro data remained favorable, with the PMI averaging a healthy 58.6 and industrial production continuing to grow at a low single-digit rate. As a result, we saw broad strength and further acceleration in our manufacturing markets, while construction sustained a mid-single-digit growth rate. From a product standpoint, we experienced acceleration in both fastener and non-fastener lines. And from a customer standpoint, National Accounts accelerated again, up 17.3% in the quarter, with 71 of our top 100 accounts growing. Growth to the smaller customers also accelerated in the quarter, and it's notable that our non-National Account customers grew better than 10% in September. This contributed to 64% of our branches growing in the third quarter, which is up from 62% in the second quarter and 58% in the first. So based on sustained strength in most of our end markets and strong momentum in the growth drivers that Dan covered on Slide 4, we feel good about our top line momentum entering the fourth quarter.
Now to Slide 6. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin was 49.1%, down 20 basis points versus the third quarter of '16. If I look at our organic fastener and non-fastener product categories, there really was very little change in the gross margin. The very driver of the annual decline was the effect of product and customer mix, the inclusion of Mansco and the very slight drag afforded by the hurricanes. We think that these combined probably provided about 30 to 40 basis points of drag to the annual gross margin figure.
On a sequential basis, our gross margin was down about 70 basis points. Again, the organic margin for our fastener and non-fastener categories were mostly unchanged, and the price/cost dynamic was mostly stable. Seasonality and storm effects did play a role, but the single largest cause of the sequential drop in the period was the behavior of what we call the organizational variables. In the quarter, this includes things such as more third-party shipping, foreign exchange adjustments, lower vendor freight credits as a result of really good inventory control in the period and other items of that sort. Which of these variables move in which direction can be hard to predict in any single period, that in most quarters, it winds up being a series of pluses and minuses that even out. But in the second quarter, these skewed heavily in favor of gross margin. And in the third, that favorable skewing completely reversed. Given these movements over the last 2 quarters, frankly, we look at the best representation of our gross margin probably being the fact that our year-to-date 2017 gross margin of 49.4% is broadly comparable to our year-to-date 2016 level of 49.5%. So year-to-date, we're down about 10 basis points despite the mix effects, the acquisition and those sort of factors that we've talked about in the past.
Our operating margin was 20.2% in the third quarter, up 20 basis points year-over-year. The 20 basis point decline in gross margin was more than offset by the 40 basis point of leverage over operating expenses. Consistent with how our model works, we've leveraged operating expenses every quarter of 2017, and that's resulted in our year-to-date operating margin expanding to 20.5% from 20.3% in the third quarter -- I'm sorry, year-to-date in 2016.
Employee-related costs were up 12.3%. 130 basis points of this increase relates to Mansco's headcount plus the incremental expenses related to implementation of last year's DOL rules. Having 1 fewer selling day also had a slight negative impact. The remaining increase is a function of the reset of incentive comp throughout the organization given our return to selling growth in 2017 and an increase in overall staffing. Total headcount growth remained modest, up 1.9% or up 3% on an FTE basis, but we have added personnel in 8 of 9 months this year. It does remain a goal of ours to leverage the employee-related expenses over time.
Occupancy-related expenses were up 1.5%. Branch costs are slightly lower, reflecting closures over the past 12 months, more than offset by growth in our vending installed base.
Selling transportation-related expenses were up 2.7%, reflecting our ability to leverage our vehicle-moving activities even while we support the growth of our business.
Total incremental operating margin in the third quarter was 21.3%. If you exclude Mansco, that incremental margin was 22.1%. And frankly, we think that, that value was likely reduced by more than 200 basis points by having 1 fewer selling day in the period.
Turning to Slide 7. We generated $163 million in operating cash in the third quarter. That's a record amount for any third quarter, and it's 114% of net income. Year-to-date, we've generated $456 million, which represents 107% of net income, an improvement on the 100% in the first 9 months of 2016. These improvements are primarily a function of better earnings.
Net CapEx in the third quarter was $24 million, down 67% due in large part to the absence of spending on vending machines related to the leased locker program. Our anticipated capital spending target for 2017 is unchanged at $127 million.
In the third quarter, we spent $92 million on dividends and $26 million to repurchase shares of stock. Our level of debt was mostly stable at $440 million. And at 17.8% of total capital, we view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business and pay our dividend.
In terms of working capital, we were particularly pleased with the inventories. If you exclude Mansco, our inventories were up 7%, which significantly trails the growth in sales. This reflected the ability of the field to leverage the heavy investment in branch inventory in 2016 and just more energy enterprise-wide on this line.
Receivables growth excluding Mansco is up 15% in the quarter. As in the second quarter, that it grew faster than sales reflects the acceleration in growth that we saw as the quarter progressed as well as the relative growth of National Accounts.
Payables excluding Mansco were up 23%. Last year's third quarter was unusually low in the wake of high CSP 16-related purchases in the prior quarter, a dynamic that's likely to repeat in the fourth quarter this year.
That's all we have for our formal presentation. And with that, we'll turn over for questions."

We talked about that perhaps hitting in Q4, that will certainly be the case, but we saw some of that hit in Q3 as well to result in sort of a stability in that dynamic, if you will. There is still inflation. That hasn't changed. And I think I would probably answer the question of how we address that the same way I've answered in the past, which is that if at some point we determine that we can't protect our level of profitability without resorting to some sort of price action, then we will take that step, and we believe that we would be successful on that.

This is part of the call that always drives Holden a little crazy, but he's getting used to it. But if I think about the comments he made earlier and I think about our July call, there was quite a few questions that really we're asking. What lifted gross margin? Because Holden's message over time has been one of, when you think about the growth drivers, the math of the growth drivers should lower our gross margin each year, optimistically, 20 basis points; pessimistically, 25 to 30. And that's just the fact that the growth drivers, the vending, and in the case of this year, our acquisition, tend to weigh down. And then over time, the growth of our non-fasteners relative to fasteners, which are obviously influenced by the growth drivers, weighted down a little bit. And organizationally, what can we do to work back, to grab back some margin in our sourcing, our logistics, our selection of products, everything. So in the second quarter, we stumbled ourselves a little bit trying to explain to you all in your questions why we weren't confident that gross margin wasn't abnormal because we talked about a lot of the puts and takes, and everything was a put. This quarter, as Holden mentioned, a lot of the puts and takes leaned towards takes, not puts. Our fastener gross margin was down about 10 basis points. Our non-fastener gross margin was completely unchanged from Q2 to Q3, and I think that's an important component. And so it was really the organizational, the other stuff all worked against us this quarter. History has told me -- and my history perspective is 20 years, 4 quarters a year, so that's about 80 quarters. History has told me that you don't get things that go all your way, or mostly against your way, typically in a quarter. So going into the fourth quarter, and I don't like making predictions, but going into the fourth quarter, I'm not looking for our gross margin to be below 49% from the standpoint of sequential weakening. We'll get a little bit benefit from the hurricane number. Now, in all honesty, there could be 5 basis points of hurricane in the fourth quarter because in Puerto Rico, we don't know all the answers. We do know that all of our employees are safe in the Gulf Coast, in Florida and in Puerto Rico. And in Houston, we had 2 store -- 2 branches that were destroyed by the hurricane. What we know initially about Puerto Rico is we had no branches damaged. It sounds like we came through it reasonably well. Our business suffered, but our assets did not. And more importantly, our employees came through it safely."

We don't get a discount on our base salaries, which are a significant portion of our total employee-related expense, and there's other elements within the operating expense category that we don't get a discount on just because we have 1 fewer day.

And I don't know if Holden touched on this, sometimes the discussion at the board meeting yesterday and discussion on the conference call get muddy for me, but I don't know if he touched on it, so if I repeat, I apologize. But right now, we're anticipating Q4 branch-level occupancy -- by occupancy, I'm talking about rent. Utilities change with the season, but I'm talking about rent expenses. Right now, we're expecting Q4 will be lower than Q1, and I don't know if that's ever happened in the history of Fastenal. And so we're being very mindful of managing that expenses because we do believe we can get, in the short term, incremental margins in the mid-20s. I can't speak to 4 and 5 years from now if they're mid-20s or if they're closer to the lower 20s, but I know that we'll be growing our returns and our cash flow handsomely at that time."

And so whereas we are going to manage our expenses to be able to achieve a very healthy incremental margin, and we do think about that double-digit growth in that 25% type of incrementals.

It sounded to me, and maybe I'm just reading too deeply into this, but the growth drivers now do seem to be that 20 to 30 basis points, and that does not include what would seem to be product mix, which has been running negative.

First, I don't think we ever said we were confident that we backfill. I think what we've said is that we were going to have a 20 to 30 basis point headwind, just as you say, waking up in the morning at the beginning of the year",347,"Yes. So a couple of things. First, I don't think we ever said we were confident that we backfill. I think what we've said is that we were going to have a 20 to 30 basis point headwind, just as you say, waking up in the morning at the beginning of the year, and that we'll certainly work very hard to try to backfill that. But over an extended period of time, we would not be surprised if our gross margins are lower, but that is on the back of significant growth in market share gains, right? So I never said confident, but we certainly do wake up every day knowing we're at a hole and making an effort to try to fill it up. But there is certainly never any guarantee that we would do that year-after-year. With respect to the mix question, no, the mix is not different. When we talk about the 20 to 30 basis point drag, that really does fill in the product. It fills in the customer. That is really trying to take into account all the variables. And the reason it does that is because I look at that mix relative to how our margins are performing across the product set, which would encompass everything that we're doing from a growth standpoint. So no, I think that 20 to 30 basis points that we wake up to every year, I think that's the number. Now we talked about how 3 quarters of our revenues are fasteners and Onsites and National Accounts and vending, that we believe that we have a significant mode in, and those also happen to be our growth drivers. They're going to become a bigger part of the mix, and they also have even lower gross margin. If in a year or 2 that 75% becomes 80% or 85%, if that 20 to 30 become 30 to 40, maybe, but that's a function of very defensible revenue and market share gains. And we'll try to fill in that hole too, but we certainly would not guarantee it."

If your definition of backfill is at the gross margin line, the answer is different than if your definition of backfill is at the operating margin line or operating income line because in the last 12 months, if I look at Q3 to",310,"I'm going to just chime in. If your definition of backfill is at the gross margin line, the answer is different than if your definition of backfill is at the operating margin line or operating income line because in the last 12 months, if I look at Q3 to Q3, we gave up 20 basis points of gross margin. We picked up 20 basis points of operating income. And so I read that as we backfilled the 20 with 40 basis points of operating expense leverage from a backfill perspective because at the end of the day, the numbers that really matter on the income statement are further south than the gross margin line, and we backfilled that 2x over. And that's the key to the business. And that was done in an environment where -- as you know from reading our proxy or if you read through our proxy, you'd see that our incentive comp is really centered on paying out a piece of our profit dollar growth in the case of our leadership team, and that's true of many of our support areas as well as our logistics costs in the case of distribution and gross profit dollar growth or sales and gross profit dollar growth at the branch and Onsite location. So in the current quarter, our incentive comp is up between 25% and 30% because we're reloading incentive comp. So that -- in that environment, we picked up 40 basis points of expense leverage. When we get through 2016 -- 2017, excuse me, that reload is largely complete. We have a little bit of reload in the first quarter, but in the second quarter, our incentive comp had dramatically expanded. So we have the benefit of that when we get into the second quarter of 2018 and partially there, in the first quarter of 2018."

I will tell you, going forward, it's a difficult number for us to really understand, so we'll do our best, but it's a hard number to refine. But I'm fairly comfortable at this point that we actually lost more in revenue in September from Irma and Maria than we gained in recovery in Houston. So the hurricanes were a net negative in both August and September. That's what I would say with regards to that. And then in terms of end markets, it really -- it gets down to the manufacturing end markets, right? If you look at our heavy equipment, it accelerated. If you look at heavy manufacturing -- but honestly, our manufacturing business as a whole accelerated across the board. And you talk to the RVPs, and they still talk about oil and gas is still doing fairly well and all the flow-through that comes with that. So the manufacturing complex, in general, I think, continues to accelerate. The transportation complex for us, which doesn't include a lot of automotive, bear in mind, but that continues to expand for us.

But generally speaking, a high piece of the gross profit dollars flow through. The -- if I look at the expansion of incentive comp -- and Holden will take a little broader brush when he is looking at his 25% number. If I look at the expansion of incentive comp at the branch, support and leadership levels across the company, our expansion of incentive comp consumed about 11% of our incremental margin. History has shown that number is probably in a more typical year -- probably not at 5% but probably in that 7% to 8% neighborhood. So to Ryan Merkel's earlier question, there's probably about 3 points of incremental margin that are absent this year because of the expansion of incentive comp that wouldn't be there next year because it's already reloaded. I hope that it clarified that point.

But I w",1538,"Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings call.
Holden asked me to stay pretty tight to the script today, so I'm going to be going through the slide deck, first couple of slides of that. But I will preface the -- my comments with just a few thoughts, and this is as much a shout out to our Fastenal team as it is to our Fastenal shareholders.
My first comment to the team is job well done in the quarter. For 9 consecutive months in 2017, we have exceeded our internal goals for sales growth. I'm proud of the team, and I'm happy for the team.
Last December, I challenged them at our annual gathering of the leadership of Fastenal with 3 simple messages as we approached 2017. One is let's just grow -- let's just go out and grow our sales. Let's get the business growing. We have a lot of growth drivers. Let's execute and grow our sales. Secondly, let's manage the business well and grow our earnings because long term, the rewards we can create for our customer, our employees, our shareholders and ourselves are centered on our ability to grow our earnings and our returns long term. And if we grow it faster than other companies that you can choose to invest in, the market will reward us from the standpoint of valuation and our employees will benefit from that because a fair number of our employees are also shareholders of the company. Finally, I challenged them to think big about the business. We're going through a massive transformation in the business right now. We've talked about it in previous investor days. We've talked about it in our filings. In the last 10 years, we've grown a tremendously supportive business within Fastenal called vending. In the last 3 years, we've grown a tremendously supportive business to Fastenal and to our customers called Onsite. They're complementary to each other. There are also businesses that Fastenal is uniquely qualified to be successful in and to think big about our future and how the business is going to morph.
As you noticed in the release, our sales growth accelerated in the third quarter '17. Year-to-date, our daily sales growth is 10.1%. That's the first double digits we have seen since 2014. And as I called out in the quote in the release, we ended the quarter with 15.3% daily sales growth in the month of September. Again, very pleased with top line performance in the quarter.
Our growth drivers continue to gain traction. We have record signings in the third quarter as it relates to Onsite, putting us on track for a very aggressive goal of 275 to 300 signings. Recall, if you go back 4 years ago, 5 years ago, 6 years ago, on average, we were signing about 10 a year. In 2015, we began to move the needle and we began to challenge our team to sign more, and we improved the number to about 75 -- about 175 the next year. And our goal this year was to add another 100 again and do at least 275. I feel very good about us being on pace to accomplish that. Year-to-date, we have signed 213; 64, 68, and now 81.
In all that, we've been investing behind the scenes in additional infrastructure to support the Onsite business. That includes IT infrastructure. That includes implementation infrastructure. Despite those investments, we've continued to obtain operating expense, leveraging our business. Our incremental margin was 21% in the quarter. And one thing about the quarter, we -- it's a 63-day quarter versus a 64 last year. For us to lose a day in a quarter is kind of unusual. We do just over $18 million a day in business. If we would of had a more normal quarter, 64 to 64, most of that incremental gross profit dollars would've gone to the bottom line and our incremental margins on that business would have been about 25%. So feel very good about the expense management we were exercising as we grow and invest in the future of our business.
Finally, if I look at it from the standpoint of how much of that converted into cash, our operating cash flow in the third quarter was a record for any third quarter in the history of Fastenal, both from the standpoint of absolute dollars and as -- relative to our earnings. Very pleased with the team. And that requires a big effort from both our supply chain folks as well as our branch and Onsite personnel just of managing the inventory growth because that is the biggest wildcard when it comes to our working capital needs.
Touching on the Onsites again, going to the second slide. 81 Onsites signed. We have about 555 active sites. That's up almost 48% from a year ago. And again, I reiterate, our goal is 275 to 300 signings.
A sidebar I'll throw in as it relates to Onsite. As we've ramped up our Onsite in the last several years, it's translated into our ability to grow and take market share faster. In yesterday's meeting I had with our Board of Directors, I was walking through with them that concept of the growing sales component. Last year, in the second -- in the third quarter, excuse me, about 25% of our district leaders -- so we have about 250 district leaders in our business, about 25% of them grew their business double-digit. It's no coincidence -- or it is a coincidence that in the prior year, in 2015, about 25% of our district managers signed in Onsite, and that translated into 75 signings. Last year -- and I've shared this on calls before, last year, we more than doubled our signings because roughly 54% of our district managers signed in Onsite in 2016. Interestingly enough, in the third quarter of 2017, 54% of our district managers grew their business double-digit. Year-to-date, in 2017 -- and our goal for the year in establishing the 275 to 300 Onsite signings, our goal was to keep improving the participation of our leaders in this growth driver. And I challenged the team, can we get to 80%? So we've gone from 25% to just over 50%. Can we add another 30% and get to 80%? 
Year-to-date, 64% of our district managers have signed in Onsite. Success for us in vending 5 and 6 and 7 years ago came from more participation across the organization. Success for us in Onsite follows the same path, a greater portion of our business engaged with their customer, and a manifestation for us is vending and Onsite signings, year-to-date at 64%. I don't know if we'll accomplish 80% by year-end, but I'm really impressed with what we've done in the first 9 months of the year.
Total in-market sites today, 2,973. A year ago, we were at 2,921. So that continues to grow as we morph a piece of our business closer to the customer. As you see from our filings, we've closed some branches in the last 12 months as we've done in the last 5 years. Think of it as not a closing, but think of it as a consolidation. We've consolidated 2 branches because part of the business of one has moved Onsite, but our local presence continues to grow.
We signed 4,771 vending devices, basically on par with what we did in the third quarter of last year. To me, the most meaningful thing is our business there continues to grow double digits, about -- just over 20% growth, 21% on a daily basis, just under 20% on an absolute basis because 1 less day. But our number of devices we're removing is down as we've gone through the year and is down in the third quarter. So very pleased from the standpoint. It feels like our signings are better and our performance on the existing base is better.
Finally, our National Accounts business grew about 17% in the quarter, which means our non-National business grew just over double digits for the first time in quite some quarters to give us our combined growth.
So very pleased with the quarter. Our growth drivers are moving the needle. We're managing our operating expenses through that. And one thing you'll notice, I've been completely silent about our gross margin. Holden's going to touch on a few points of that. I'm sure there will be a question or 2 on gross margin, but I'll throw one piece out to the group in the for what it's worth category. If you look at Onsite, if you look at vending and if you look at our Mansco acquisition, add these 3 components of our business up and they account for about 2/3 of our growth from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year. We've previously said all 3 of these operated at a gross margin below our company average but have very attractive operating margin and return characteristics. And at the end of the day, that's what you pay us for.
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

So before jumping back into the slide deck, I did want to call on a few items that made the third quarter 2017 unique.  The first is, I just want to call your attention to the last page of the supplemental deck. This quarter, we did take a fresh look at the market exposure of our business and made certain adjustments that affected our end-market mix and slightly altered the growth rates versus what we've reported in the past months and quarters. So please feel free to take a look at that last page.
Secondly, as Dan indicated, we did have 1 less selling day in the third quarter than was through the prior year. Based on our September daily sales rate, that cost us more than $18 million in sales during the period. That was known, of course, but keep in mind that many of our costs, notably the employee-related expenses, are not days dependent, and that does affect leverage.
Third, we estimate that the hurricane that hit the Gulf, the Southeast and Puerto Rico shaved 20 to 30 basis points from revenue during the quarter. It's hard to estimate the impact of post-storm recovery on our volumes, but we do believe that some of that was present in September, particularly in the Gulf, though not at a level to -- not at a magnitude to offset the original lost sales. In addition to the top line impact, the hurricanes also were a very slight drag to gross margin due to the write-off of damaged assets and an increase in sales of low-margin, storm-related products like water and generators.
Now with that said, let's look back at Slide 5. As Dan indicated, total sales were up 11.8% in the third quarter, but on a daily sales basis, they were up 13.6%, which is an acceleration from up 10.6% in the second quarter. Mansco contributed 130 basis points to this growth, which is consistent with the prior quarter. The third quarter finished strongly, with September's daily sales growth coming in at up 15.3% or up 14% excluding the impact of Mansco.
In terms of end market tone, the third quarter felt a lot like the second quarter. Macro data remained favorable, with the PMI averaging a healthy 58.6 and industrial production continuing to grow at a low single-digit rate. As a result, we saw broad strength and further acceleration in our manufacturing markets, while construction sustained a mid-single-digit growth rate. From a product standpoint, we experienced acceleration in both fastener and non-fastener lines. And from a customer standpoint, National Accounts accelerated again, up 17.3% in the quarter, with 71 of our top 100 accounts growing. Growth to the smaller customers also accelerated in the quarter, and it's notable that our non-National Account customers grew better than 10% in September. This contributed to 64% of our branches growing in the third quarter, which is up from 62% in the second quarter and 58% in the first. So based on sustained strength in most of our end markets and strong momentum in the growth drivers that Dan covered on Slide 4, we feel good about our top line momentum entering the fourth quarter.
Now to Slide 6. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin was 49.1%, down 20 basis points versus the third quarter of '16. If I look at our organic fastener and non-fastener product categories, there really was very little change in the gross margin. The very driver of the annual decline was the effect of product and customer mix, the inclusion of Mansco and the very slight drag afforded by the hurricanes. We think that these combined probably provided about 30 to 40 basis points of drag to the annual gross margin figure.
On a sequential basis, our gross margin was down about 70 basis points. Again, the organic margin for our fastener and non-fastener categories were mostly unchanged, and the price/cost dynamic was mostly stable. Seasonality and storm effects did play a role, but the single largest cause of the sequential drop in the period was the behavior of what we call the organizational variables. In the quarter, this includes things such as more third-party shipping, foreign exchange adjustments, lower vendor freight credits as a result of really good inventory control in the period and other items of that sort. Which of these variables move in which direction can be hard to predict in any single period, that in most quarters, it winds up being a series of pluses and minuses that even out. But in the second quarter, these skewed heavily in favor of gross margin. And in the third, that favorable skewing completely reversed. Given these movements over the last 2 quarters, frankly, we look at the best representation of our gross margin probably being the fact that our year-to-date 2017 gross margin of 49.4% is broadly comparable to our year-to-date 2016 level of 49.5%. So year-to-date, we're down about 10 basis points despite the mix effects, the acquisition and those sort of factors that we've talked about in the past.
Our operating margin was 20.2% in the third quarter, up 20 basis points year-over-year. The 20 basis point decline in gross margin was more than offset by the 40 basis point of leverage over operating expenses. Consistent with how our model works, we've leveraged operating expenses every quarter of 2017, and that's resulted in our year-to-date operating margin expanding to 20.5% from 20.3% in the third quarter -- I'm sorry, year-to-date in 2016.
Employee-related costs were up 12.3%. 130 basis points of this increase relates to Mansco's headcount plus the incremental expenses related to implementation of last year's DOL rules. Having 1 fewer selling day also had a slight negative impact. The remaining increase is a function of the reset of incentive comp throughout the organization given our return to selling growth in 2017 and an increase in overall staffing. Total headcount growth remained modest, up 1.9% or up 3% on an FTE basis, but we have added personnel in 8 of 9 months this year. It does remain a goal of ours to leverage the employee-related expenses over time.
Occupancy-related expenses were up 1.5%. Branch costs are slightly lower, reflecting closures over the past 12 months, more than offset by growth in our vending installed base.
Selling transportation-related expenses were up 2.7%, reflecting our ability to leverage our vehicle-moving activities even while we support the growth of our business.
Total incremental operating margin in the third quarter was 21.3%. If you exclude Mansco, that incremental margin was 22.1%. And frankly, we think that, that value was likely reduced by more than 200 basis points by having 1 fewer selling day in the period.
Turning to Slide 7. We generated $163 million in operating cash in the third quarter. That's a record amount for any third quarter, and it's 114% of net income. Year-to-date, we've generated $456 million, which represents 107% of net income, an improvement on the 100% in the first 9 months of 2016. These improvements are primarily a function of better earnings.
Net CapEx in the third quarter was $24 million, down 67% due in large part to the absence of spending on vending machines related to the leased locker program. Our anticipated capital spending target for 2017 is unchanged at $127 million.
In the third quarter, we spent $92 million on dividends and $26 million to repurchase shares of stock. Our level of debt was mostly stable at $440 million. And at 17.8% of total capital, we view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business and pay our dividend.
In terms of working capital, we were particularly pleased with the inventories. If you exclude Mansco, our inventories were up 7%, which significantly trails the growth in sales. This reflected the ability of the field to leverage the heavy investment in branch inventory in 2016 and just more energy enterprise-wide on this line.
Receivables growth excluding Mansco was up 15% in the quarter. As in the second quarter, that it grew faster than sales reflects the acceleration in growth that we saw as the quarter progressed as well as the relative growth of National Accounts.
Payables excluding Mansco were up 23%. Last year's third quarter was unusually low in the wake of high CSP 16-related purchases in the prior quarter, a dynamic that's likely to repeat in the fourth quarter this year.
That's all we have for our formal presentation. And with that, we'll turn it over for questions."

There is still inflation. That hasn't changed. And I think I would probably answer the question of how we address that the same way I've answered in the past, which is that if at some point we determine that we can't protect our level of profitability without resorting to some sort of price action, then we will take that step, and we believe that we would be successful on that.

This is part of the call that always drives Holden probably a little crazy, but he's getting used to it. But if I think about the comments he made earlier and I think about our July call, there was quite a few questions that really we're asking. What lifted gross margin? Because Holden's message over time has been one of, when you think about the growth drivers, the math of the growth drivers should lower our gross margin each year, optimistically, 20 basis points; pessimistically, 25 to 30. And that's just the fact that the growth drivers, the vending, and in the case of this year, our acquisition, tend to weigh down. And then over time, the growth of our non-fasteners relative to fasteners, which are obviously influenced by the growth drivers, weigh it down a little bit. And organizationally, what can we do to work back, to grab back some margin in our sourcing, our logistics, our selection of products, everything. So in the second quarter, we stumbled over ourselves a little bit trying to explain to you all in your questions why we weren't confident that gross margin wasn't a new normal because we talked about a lot of the puts and takes, and everything was a put. This quarter, as Holden mentioned, a lot of the puts and takes leaned towards takes, not puts. Our fastener gross margin was down about 10 basis points. Our non-fastener gross margin was completely unchanged from Q2 to Q3, and I think that's an important component. And so it was really the organizational, the other stuff all worked against us this quarter. History has told me -- and my history perspective is 20 years, 4 quarters a year, so that's about 80 quarters. History has told me that you don't get things that go all your way, or mostly against your way, typically in a quarter. So going into the fourth quarter, and I don't like making predictions, but going into the fourth quarter, I'm not looking for our gross margin to be below 49% from the standpoint of sequential weakening. We'll get a little bit benefit from the hurricane number. Now, in all honesty, there could be 5 basis points of hurricane in the fourth quarter because in Puerto Rico, we don't know all the answers. We do know that all of our employees are safe in the Gulf Coast, in Florida and in Puerto Rico. And in Houston, we had 2 store -- 2 branches that were destroyed by the hurricane. What we know initially about Puerto Rico is we had no branches damaged. It sounds like we came through it reasonably well. Our business suffered, but our assets did not. And more importantly, our employees came through it safely."

We don't get a discount on our base salaries, which are a significant portion of our total employee-related expense, and there's other elements within the operating expense category that we don't get a discount on just because we have 1 fewer day.

And I don't know if Holden touched on this, sometimes the discussion at the board meeting yesterday and discussion on the conference call get muddy for me, but I don't know if he touched on it, so if I repeat, I apologize. But right now, we're anticipating Q4 branch-level occupancy -- by occupancy, I'm talking about rent. Utilities change with the season, but I'm talking about rent expenses. Right now, we're expecting Q4 will be lower than Q1, and I don't know if that's ever happened in the history of Fastenal. And so we're being very mindful of managing that expenses because we do believe we can get, in the short term, incremental margins in the mid-20s. I can't speak to 4 and 5 years from now if they're mid-20s or if they're closer to the lower 20s, but I know that we'll be growing our returns and our cash flow handsomely at that time."

And so whereas we are going to manage our expenses to be able to achieve a very healthy incremental margin, and we do think about that double-digit growth in that 25% type of incrementals. Sometimes we get questions of why it can't be more, why it can't be more. And the answer is because we not only manage our expenses, but we also manage our expenses to be able to grow.

It sounded to me, and maybe I'm just reading too deeply into this, but the growth drivers now do seem to be that 20 to 30 basis points, and that does not include what would seem to be product mix, which has been running negative.

First, I don't think we ever said we were confident that we backfill. I think what we've said is that we were going to have a 20 to 30 basis point headwind, just as you say, waking up in the morning at the beginning of the year",347,"Yes. So a couple of things. First, I don't think we ever said we were confident that we backfill. I think what we've said is that we were going to have a 20 to 30 basis point headwind, just as you say, waking up in the morning at the beginning of the year, and that we'll certainly work very hard to try to backfill that. But over an extended period of time, we would not be surprised if our gross margins are lower, but that is on the back of significant growth in market share gains, right? So I never said confident, but we certainly do wake up every day knowing we're in a hole and making an effort to try to fill it up. But there is certainly never any guarantee that we would do that year-after-year. With respect to the mix question, no, the mix is not different. When we talk about the 20 to 30 basis point drag, that really does fill in the product. It fills in the customer. That is really trying to take into account all the variables. And the reason it does that is because I look at that mix relative to how our margins are performing across the product set, which would encompass everything that we're doing from a growth standpoint. So no, I think that 20 to 30 basis points that we wake up to every year, I think that's the number. Now we talked about how 3 quarters of our revenues are fasteners and Onsites and National Accounts and vending, that we believe that we have a significant moat in, and those also happen to be our growth drivers. They're going to become a bigger part of the mix, and they also have even lower gross margin. If in a year or 2 that 75% becomes 80% or 85%, if that 20 to 30 become 30 to 40, maybe, but that's a function of very defensible revenue and market share gains. And we'll try to fill in that hole too, but we certainly would not guarantee it."

If your definition of backfill is at the gross margin line, the answer is different than if your definition of backfill is at the operating margin line or operating income line because in the last 12 months, if I look at Q3 to",310,"I'm going to just chime in. If your definition of backfill is at the gross margin line, the answer is different than if your definition of backfill is at the operating margin line or operating income line because in the last 12 months, if I look at Q3 to Q3, we gave up 20 basis points of gross margin. We picked up 20 basis points of operating income. And so I read that as we backfilled the 20 with 40 basis points of operating expense leverage from a backfill perspective because at the end of the day, the numbers that really matter on the income statement are further south than the gross margin line, and we backfilled that 2x over. And that's the key to the business. And that was done in an environment where -- as you know from reading our proxy or if you read through our proxy, you'd see that our incentive comp is really centered on paying out a piece of our profit dollar growth in the case of our leadership team, and that's true of many of our support areas as well as our logistics costs in the case of distribution and gross profit dollar growth or sales and gross profit dollar growth at the branch and Onsite location. So in the current quarter, our incentive comp is up between 25% and 30% because we're reloading incentive comp. So that -- in that environment, we picked up 40 basis points of expense leverage. When we get through 2016 -- 2017, excuse me, that reload is largely complete. We have a little bit of reload in the first quarter, but in the second quarter, our incentive comp had dramatically expanded. So we have the benefit of that when we get into the second quarter of 2018 and partially there, in the first quarter of 2018."

I will tell you, going forward, it's a difficult number for us to really understand, so we'll do our best, but it's a hard number to refine. But I'm fairly comfortable at this point that we actually lost more in revenue in September from Irma and Maria than we gained in recovery in Houston. So the hurricanes were a net negative in both August and September. That's what I would say with regards to that. And then in terms of end markets, it really -- it gets down to the manufacturing end markets, right? If you look at our heavy equipment, it accelerated. If you look at heavy manufacturing -- but honestly, our manufacturing business as a whole accelerated across the board. And you talk to the RVPs, and they still talk about oil and gas is still doing fairly well and all the flow-through that comes with that. So the manufacturing complex, in general, I think, continues to accelerate. The transportation complex for us, which doesn't include a lot of automotive, bear in mind, but that continues to expand for us.

But generally speaking, a high piece of the gross profit dollars flow through. The -- if I look at the expansion of incentive comp -- and Holden was taking a little broader brush when he is looking at his 25% number. If I look at the expansion of incentive comp at the branch, support and leadership levels across the company, our expansion of incentive comp consumed about 11% of our incremental margin. History has shown that number is probably in a more typical year -- probably not at 5% but probably in that 7% to 8% neighborhood. So to Ryan Merkel's earlier question, there's probably about 3 points of incremental margin that are absent this year because of the expansion of incentive comp that wouldn't be there next year because it's already reloaded. I hope that it clarified that point.

But I w",1538,"Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings call.
Holden asked me to stay pretty tight to the script today, so I'm going to be going through the slide deck, first couple of slides of that. But I will preface the -- my comments with just a few thoughts, and this is as much a shout out to our Fastenal team as it is to our Fastenal shareholders.
My first comment to the team is job well done in the quarter. For 9 consecutive months in 2017, we have exceeded our internal goals for sales growth. I'm proud of the team, and I'm happy for the team.
Last December, I challenged them at our annual gathering of the leadership of Fastenal with 3 simple messages as we approached 2017. One is let's just grow -- let's just go out and grow our sales. Let's get the business growing. We have a lot of growth drivers. Let's execute and grow our sales. Secondly, let's manage the business well and grow our earnings because long term, the rewards we can create for our customer, our employees, our shareholders and ourselves are centered on our ability to grow our earnings and our returns long term. And if we grow it faster than other companies that you can choose to invest in, the market will reward us from the standpoint of valuation and our employees will benefit from that because a fair number of our employees are also shareholders of the company. Finally, I challenged them to think big about the business. We're going through a massive transformation in the business right now. We've talked about it in previous investor days. We've talked about it in our filings. In the last 10 years, we've grown a tremendously supportive business within Fastenal called vending. In the last 3 years, we've grown a tremendously supportive business to Fastenal and to our customers called Onsite. They're complementary to each other. There are also businesses that Fastenal is uniquely qualified to be successful in and to think big about our future and how the business is going to morph.
As you noticed in the release, our sales growth accelerated in the third quarter '17. Year-to-date, our daily sales growth is 10.1%. That's the first double digits we have seen since 2014. And as I called out in the quote in the release, we ended the quarter with 15.3% daily sales growth in the month of September. Again, very pleased with top line performance in the quarter.
Our growth drivers continue to gain traction. We have record signings in the third quarter as it relates to Onsite, putting us on track for a very aggressive goal of 275 to 300 signings. Recall, if you go back 4 years ago, 5 years ago, 6 years ago, on average, we were signing about 10 a year. In 2015, we began to move the needle and we began to challenge our team to sign more, and we improved the number to about 75 -- about 175 the next year. And our goal this year was to add another 100 again and do at least 275. I feel very good about us being on pace to accomplish that. Year-to-date, we have signed 213; 64, 68, and now 81.
In all that, we've been investing behind the scenes in additional infrastructure to support the Onsite business. That includes IT infrastructure. That includes implementation infrastructure. Despite those investments, we've continued to obtain operating expense, leveraging our business. Our incremental margin was 21% in the quarter. And one thing about the quarter, we -- it's a 63-day quarter versus a 64 last year. For us to lose a day in a quarter is kind of unusual. We do just over $18 million a day in business. If we would of had a more normal quarter, 64 to 64, most of that incremental gross profit dollars would've gone to the bottom line and our incremental margins on that business would have been about 25%. So feel very good about the expense management we were exercising as we grow and invest in the future of our business.
Finally, if I look at it from the standpoint of how much of that converted into cash, our operating cash flow in the third quarter was a record for any third quarter in the history of Fastenal, both from the standpoint of absolute dollars and as -- relative to our earnings. Very pleased with the team. And that requires a big effort from both our supply chain folks as well as our branch and Onsite personnel just of managing the inventory growth because that is the biggest wildcard when it comes to our working capital needs.
Touching on the Onsites again, going to the second slide. 81 Onsites signed. We have about 555 active sites. That's up almost 48% from a year ago. And again, I reiterate, our goal is 275 to 300 signings.
A sidebar I'll throw in as it relates to Onsite. As we've ramped up our Onsite in the last several years, it's translated into our ability to grow and take market share faster. In yesterday's meeting I had with our Board of Directors, I was walking through with them that concept of the growing sales component. Last year, in the second -- in the third quarter, excuse me, about 25% of our district leaders -- so we have about 250 district leaders in our business, about 25% of them grew their business double-digit. It's no coincidence -- or it is a coincidence that in the prior year, in 2015, about 25% of our district managers signed in Onsite, and that translated into 75 signings. Last year -- and I've shared this on calls before, last year, we more than doubled our signings because roughly 54% of our district managers signed in Onsite in 2016. Interestingly enough, in the third quarter of 2017, 54% of our district managers grew their business double-digit. Year-to-date, in 2017 -- and our goal for the year in establishing the 275 to 300 Onsite signings, our goal was to keep improving the participation of our leaders in this growth driver. And I challenged the team, can we get to 80%? So we've gone from 25% to just over 50%. Can we add another 30% and get to 80%? 
Year-to-date, 64% of our district managers have signed in Onsite. Success for us in vending 5 and 6 and 7 years ago came from more participation across the organization. Success for us in Onsite follows the same path, a greater portion of our business engaged with their customer, and a manifestation for us is vending and Onsite signings, year-to-date at 64%. I don't know if we'll accomplish 80% by year-end, but I'm really impressed with what we've done in the first 9 months of the year.
Total in-market sites today, 2,973. A year ago, we were at 2,921. So that continues to grow as we morph a piece of our business closer to the customer. As you see from our filings, we've closed some branches in the last 12 months as we've done in the last 5 years. Think of it as not a closing, but think of it as a consolidation. We've consolidated 2 branches because part of the business of one has moved Onsite, but our local presence continues to grow.
We signed 4,771 vending devices, basically on par with what we did in the third quarter of last year. To me, the most meaningful thing is our business there continues to grow double digits, about -- just over 20% growth, 21% on a daily basis, just under 20% on an absolute basis because 1 less day. But our number of devices we're removing is down as we've gone through the year and is down in the third quarter. So very pleased from the standpoint. It feels like our signings are better and our performance on the existing base is better.
Finally, our National Accounts business grew about 17% in the quarter, which means our non-National business grew just over double digits for the first time in quite some quarters to give us our combined growth.
So very pleased with the quarter. Our growth drivers are moving the needle. We're managing our operating expenses through that. And one thing you'll notice, I've been completely silent about our gross margin. Holden's going to touch on a few points of that. I'm sure there will be a question or 2 on gross margin, but I'll throw one piece out to the group in the for what it's worth category. If you look at Onsite, if you look at vending and if you look at our Mansco acquisition, add these 3 components of our business up and they account for about 2/3 of our growth from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year. We've previously said all 3 of these operated at a gross margin below our company average but have very attractive operating margin and return characteristics. And at the end of the day, that's what you pay us for.
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

So before jumping back into the slide deck, I did want to call on a few items that made the third quarter 2017 unique.  The first is, I just want to call your attention to the last page of the supplemental deck. This quarter, we did take a fresh look at the market exposure of our business and made certain adjustments that affected our end-market mix and slightly altered the growth rates versus what we've reported in the past months and quarters. So please feel free to take a look at that last page.
Secondly, as Dan indicated, we did have 1 less selling day in the third quarter than was through the prior year. Based on our September daily sales rate, that cost us more than $18 million in sales during the period. That was known, of course, but keep in mind that many of our costs, notably the employee-related expenses, are not days dependent, and that does affect leverage.
Third, we estimate that the hurricane that hit the Gulf, the Southeast and Puerto Rico shaved 20 to 30 basis points from revenue during the quarter. It's hard to estimate the impact of post-storm recovery on our volumes, but we do believe that some of that was present in September, particularly in the Gulf, though not at a level to -- not at a magnitude to offset the original lost sales. In addition to the top line impact, the hurricanes also were a very slight drag to gross margin due to the write-off of damaged assets and an increase in sales of low-margin, storm-related products like water and generators.
Now with that said, let's look back at Slide 5. As Dan indicated, total sales were up 11.8% in the third quarter, but on a daily sales basis, they were up 13.6%, which is an acceleration from up 10.6% in the second quarter. Mansco contributed 130 basis points to this growth, which is consistent with the prior quarter. The third quarter finished strongly, with September's daily sales growth coming in at up 15.3% or up 14% excluding the impact of Mansco.
In terms of end market tone, the third quarter felt a lot like the second quarter. Macro data remained favorable, with the PMI averaging a healthy 58.6 and industrial production continuing to grow at a low single-digit rate. As a result, we saw broad strength and further acceleration in our manufacturing markets, while construction sustained a mid-single-digit growth rate. From a product standpoint, we experienced acceleration in both fastener and non-fastener lines. And from a customer standpoint, National Accounts accelerated again, up 17.3% in the quarter, with 71 of our top 100 accounts growing. Growth to the smaller customers also accelerated in the quarter, and it's notable that our non-National Account customers grew better than 10% in September. This contributed to 64% of our branches growing in the third quarter, which is up from 62% in the second quarter and 58% in the first. So based on sustained strength in most of our end markets and strong momentum in the growth drivers that Dan covered on Slide 4, we feel good about our top line momentum entering the fourth quarter.
Now to Slide 6. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin was 49.1%, down 20 basis points versus the third quarter of '16. If I look at our organic fastener and non-fastener product categories, there really was very little change in the gross margin. The very driver of the annual decline was the effect of product and customer mix, the inclusion of Mansco and the very slight drag afforded by the hurricanes. We think that these combined probably provided about 30 to 40 basis points of drag to the annual gross margin figure.
On a sequential basis, our gross margin was down about 70 basis points. Again, the organic margin for our fastener and non-fastener categories were mostly unchanged, and the price/cost dynamic was mostly stable. Seasonality and storm effects did play a role, but the single largest cause of the sequential drop in the period was the behavior of what we call the organizational variables. In the quarter, this includes things such as more third-party shipping, foreign exchange adjustments, lower vendor freight credits as a result of really good inventory control in the period and other items of that sort. Which of these variables move in which direction can be hard to predict in any single period, that in most quarters, it winds up being a series of pluses and minuses that even out. But in the second quarter, these skewed heavily in favor of gross margin. And in the third, that favorable skewing completely reversed. Given these movements over the last 2 quarters, frankly, we look at the best representation of our gross margin probably being the fact that our year-to-date 2017 gross margin of 49.4% is broadly comparable to our year-to-date 2016 level of 49.5%. So year-to-date, we're down about 10 basis points despite the mix effects, the acquisition and those sort of factors that we've talked about in the past.
Our operating margin was 20.2% in the third quarter, up 20 basis points year-over-year. The 20 basis point decline in gross margin was more than offset by the 40 basis point of leverage over operating expenses. Consistent with how our model works, we've leveraged operating expenses every quarter of 2017, and that's resulted in our year-to-date operating margin expanding to 20.5% from 20.3% in the third quarter -- I'm sorry, year-to-date in 2016.
Employee-related costs were up 12.3%. 130 basis points of this increase relates to Mansco's headcount plus the incremental expenses related to implementation of last year's DOL rules. Having 1 fewer selling day also had a slight negative impact. The remaining increase is a function of the reset of incentive comp throughout the organization given our return to selling growth in 2017 and an increase in overall staffing. Total headcount growth remained modest, up 1.9% or up 3% on an FTE basis, but we have added personnel in 8 of 9 months this year. It does remain a goal of ours to leverage the employee-related expenses over time.
Occupancy-related expenses were up 1.5%. Branch costs are slightly lower, reflecting closures over the past 12 months, more than offset by growth in our vending installed base.
Selling transportation-related expenses were up 2.7%, reflecting our ability to leverage our vehicle-moving activities even while we support the growth of our business.
Total incremental operating margin in the third quarter was 21.3%. If you exclude Mansco, that incremental margin was 22.1%. And frankly, we think that, that value was likely reduced by more than 200 basis points by having 1 fewer selling day in the period.
Turning to Slide 7. We generated $163 million in operating cash in the third quarter. That's a record amount for any third quarter, and it's 114% of net income. Year-to-date, we've generated $456 million, which represents 107% of net income, an improvement on the 100% in the first 9 months of 2016. These improvements are primarily a function of better earnings.
Net CapEx in the third quarter was $24 million, down 67% due in large part to the absence of spending on vending machines related to the leased locker program. Our anticipated capital spending target for 2017 is unchanged at $127 million.
In the third quarter, we spent $92 million on dividends and $26 million to repurchase shares of stock. Our level of debt was mostly stable at $440 million. And at 17.8% of total capital, we view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business and pay our dividend.
In terms of working capital, we were particularly pleased with the inventories. If you exclude Mansco, our inventories were up 7%, which significantly trails the growth in sales. This reflected the ability of the field to leverage the heavy investment in branch inventory in 2016 and just more energy enterprise-wide on this line.
Receivables growth excluding Mansco was up 15% in the quarter. As in the second quarter, that it grew faster than sales reflects the acceleration in growth that we saw as the quarter progressed as well as the relative growth of National Accounts.
Payables excluding Mansco were up 23%. Last year's third quarter was unusually low in the wake of high CSP 16-related purchases in the prior quarter, a dynamic that's likely to repeat in the fourth quarter this year.
That's all we have for our formal presentation. And with that, we'll turn it over for questions."

We talked about that perhaps hitting in Q4, that will certainly be the case, but we saw some of that hit in Q3 as well to result in sort of a stability in that dynamic, if you will. There is still inflation. That hasn't changed. And I think I would probably answer the question of how we address that the same way I've answered in the past, which is that if at some point we determine that we can't protect our level of profitability without resorting to some sort of price action, then we will take that step, and we believe that we would be successful on that.

This is part of the call that always drives Holden probably a little crazy, but he's getting used to it. But if I think about the comments he made earlier and I think about our July call, there was quite a few questions that really we're asking. What lifted gross margin? Because Holden's message over time has been one of, when you think about the growth drivers, the math of the growth drivers should lower our gross margin each year, optimistically, 20 basis points; pessimistically, 25 to 30. And that's just the fact that the growth drivers, the vending, and in the case of this year, our acquisition, tend to weigh down. And then over time, the growth of our non-fasteners relative to fasteners, which are obviously influenced by the growth drivers, weigh it down a little bit. And organizationally, what can we do to work back, to grab back some margin in our sourcing, our logistics, our selection of products, everything. So in the second quarter, we stumbled over ourselves a little bit trying to explain to you all in your questions why we weren't confident that gross margin wasn't a new normal because we talked about a lot of the puts and takes, and everything was a put. This quarter, as Holden mentioned, a lot of the puts and takes leaned towards takes, not puts. Our fastener gross margin was down about 10 basis points. Our non-fastener gross margin was completely unchanged from Q2 to Q3, and I think that's an important component. And so it was really the organizational, the other stuff all worked against us this quarter. History has told me -- and my history perspective is 20 years, 4 quarters a year, so that's about 80 quarters. History has told me that you don't get things that go all your way, or mostly against your way, typically in a quarter. So going into the fourth quarter, and I don't like making predictions, but going into the fourth quarter, I'm not looking for our gross margin to be below 49% from the standpoint of sequential weakening. We'll get a little bit benefit from the hurricane number. Now, in all honesty, there could be 5 basis points of hurricane in the fourth quarter because in Puerto Rico, we don't know all the answers. We do know that all of our employees are safe in the Gulf Coast, in Florida and in Puerto Rico. And in Houston, we had 2 store -- 2 branches that were destroyed by the hurricane. What we know initially about Puerto Rico is we had no branches damaged. It sounds like we came through it reasonably well. Our business suffered, but our assets did not. And more importantly, our employees came through it safely."

And I don't know if Holden touched on this, sometimes the discussion at the board meeting yesterday and discussion on the conference call get muddy for me, but I don't know if he touched on it, so if I repeat, I apologize. But right now, we're anticipating Q4 branch-level occupancy -- by occupancy, I'm talking about rent. Utilities change with the season, but I'm talking about rent expenses. Right now, we're expecting Q4 will be lower than Q1, and I don't know if that's ever happened in the history of Fastenal. And so we're being very mindful of managing that expenses because we do believe we can get, in the short term, incremental margins in the mid-20s. I can't speak to 4 and 5 years from now if they're mid-20s or if they're closer to the lower 20s, but I know that we'll be growing our returns and our cash flow handsomely at that time."

We're doing a fairly successful job of it given where our revenue growth rates are compared to the marketplace and things of that nature. And we are going to continue to grow and outgrow the market and gain market share. And so whereas we are going to manage our expenses to be able to achieve a very healthy incremental margin, and we do think about that double-digit growth in that 25% type of incrementals. Sometimes we get questions of why it can't be more, why it can't be more. And the answer is because we not only manage our expenses, but we also manage our expenses to be able to grow.

It sounded to me, and maybe I'm just reading too deeply into this, but the growth drivers now do seem to be that 20 to 30 basis points, and that does not include what would seem to be product mix, which has been running negative.

First, I don't think we ever said we were confident that we backfill. I think what we've said is that we were going to have a 20 to 30 basis point headwind, just as you say, waking up in the morning at the beginning of the year",347,"Yes. So a couple of things. First, I don't think we ever said we were confident that we backfill. I think what we've said is that we were going to have a 20 to 30 basis point headwind, just as you say, waking up in the morning at the beginning of the year, and that we'll certainly work very hard to try to backfill that. But over an extended period of time, we would not be surprised if our gross margins are lower, but that is on the back of significant growth in market share gains, right? So I never said confident, but we certainly do wake up every day knowing we're in a hole and making an effort to try to fill it up. But there is certainly never any guarantee that we would do that year-after-year. With respect to the mix question, no, the mix is not different. When we talk about the 20 to 30 basis point drag, that really does fill in the product. It fills in the customer. That is really trying to take into account all the variables. And the reason it does that is because I look at that mix relative to how our margins are performing across the product set, which would encompass everything that we're doing from a growth standpoint. So no, I think that 20 to 30 basis points that we wake up to every year, I think that's the number. Now we talked about how 3 quarters of our revenues are fasteners and Onsites and National Accounts and vending, that we believe that we have a significant moat in, and those also happen to be our growth drivers. They're going to become a bigger part of the mix, and they also have even lower gross margin. If in a year or 2 that 75% becomes 80% or 85%, if that 20 to 30 become 30 to 40, maybe, but that's a function of very defensible revenue and market share gains. And we'll try to fill in that hole too, but we certainly would not guarantee it."

If your definition of backfill is at the gross margin line, the answer is different than if your definition of backfill is at the operating margin line or operating income line because in the last 12 months, if I look at Q3 to",310,"I'm going to just chime in. If your definition of backfill is at the gross margin line, the answer is different than if your definition of backfill is at the operating margin line or operating income line because in the last 12 months, if I look at Q3 to Q3, we gave up 20 basis points of gross margin. We picked up 20 basis points of operating income. And so I read that as we backfilled the 20 with 40 basis points of operating expense leverage from a backfill perspective because at the end of the day, the numbers that really matter on the income statement are further south than the gross margin line, and we backfilled that 2x over. And that's the key to the business. And that was done in an environment where -- as you know from reading our proxy or if you read through our proxy, you'd see that our incentive comp is really centered on paying out a piece of our profit dollar growth in the case of our leadership team, and that's true of many of our support areas as well as our logistics costs in the case of distribution and gross profit dollar growth or sales and gross profit dollar growth at the branch and Onsite location. So in the current quarter, our incentive comp is up between 25% and 30% because we're reloading incentive comp. So that -- in that environment, we picked up 40 basis points of expense leverage. When we get through 2016 -- 2017, excuse me, that reload is largely complete. We have a little bit of reload in the first quarter, but in the second quarter, our incentive comp had dramatically expanded. So we have the benefit of that when we get into the second quarter of 2018 and partially there, in the first quarter of 2018."

I will tell you, going forward, it's a difficult number for us to really understand, so we'll do our best, but it's a hard number to refine. But I'm fairly comfortable at this point that we actually lost more in revenue in September from Irma and Maria than we gained in recovery in Houston. So the hurricanes were a net negative in both August and September. That's what I would say with regards to that. And then in terms of end markets, it really -- it gets down to the manufacturing end markets, right? If you look at our heavy equipment, it accelerated. If you look at heavy manufacturing -- but honestly, our manufacturing business as a whole accelerated across the board. And you talk to the RVPs, and they still talk about oil and gas is still doing fairly well and all the flow-through that comes with that. So the manufacturing complex, in general, I think, continues to accelerate. The transportation complex for us, which doesn't include a lot of automotive, bear in mind, but that continues to expand for us.

Dan, you already touched on this to some extent, but I just wondering if you could put a finer point on the benefit to your growth and pretax income as growth in the incentive comp normalizes to get into the second quarter next year and beyond. I think in the past you've maybe put this in terms of how much pretax earnings growth that the growth incentive comp is consuming, say, right now, where we're in this adjustment period versus a period next year where that's going to normalize to some extent."

When you get into the second year, that can perhaps get cut close to in half in terms of how much of your pretax it consumes.
I'll take Dan's silence to mean I got it right."

The -- and effectively, a decision on whether or not to enact those sort of tariffs continue to get punted, and I think at this point, the expectation is maybe a decision comes next year, early next year. What I would tell you is I think that if the costs to procure steel products and fasteners go up because of an act like that, then they would go up for everybody, Fastenal as well as our competitors, and given that it's difficult to procure a lot of product domestically at this point. And so the typical response would be to try to pass that through the customers, and we expect that the industry would probably take that action if something like that were to occur. But we're watching it. Nothing has been decided on it, to our knowledge. And if something is, then we'll react appropriately."

the incremental margin because we're expanding our team, we're expanding our distribution capabilities, we're expanding the expenses of the business. But generally speaking, a high piece of the gross profit dollars flow through. The -- if I look at the expansion of incentive comp -- and Holden was taking a little broader brush when he is looking at his 25% number. If I look at the expansion of incentive comp at the branch, support and leadership levels across the company, our expansion of incentive comp consumed about 11% of our incremental margin. History has shown that number is probably in a more typical year -- probably not at 5% but probably in that 7% to 8% neighborhood. So to Ryan Merkel's earlier question, there's probably about 3 points of incremental margin that are absent this year because of the expansion of incentive comp that wouldn't be there next year because it's already reloaded. I hope that it clarified that point.
I see we're at 9:45. So again, I want to thank everybody for participating in the call today. I hope you find this exchange useful in your understanding of Fastenal business. And again, to the Fastenal team, nice quarter, everybody. Thanks."
