In our Life Insurance operations, premium revenue grew 6% to $550 million, while life underwriting margin was at $143 million, down 1% from a year ago. The decline in underwriting margin was due primarily to the decline in the Direct Response margin. In 2017, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 1% to 3%. Net life sales were $99 million, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter. 
On the health side, premium revenue grew 1% to $238 million, and health underwriting margin was up 4% to $53 million. In 2017, we expect health underwriting income to remain relatively flat.

Looking at international, wide premiums were $67 million, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter, our life underwriting margin was $19 million, down 4%. Net life sales increased to 15% to $10 million, while net health sales were $5 million, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter. The life sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,781, up 16% from a year-ago and down 1% compared to the third quarter. The producing agent count of Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,758. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 1,800 to 2,000 at the end of 2017.
Life net sales for the full year 2016, grew 12%. Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 8% to 12% for the full year, 2017. Health net sales for the full year 2016, grew 8%, health net sales growth in 2017, is expected to be in the range of 5% to 9%. We are enthusiastic about Liberty National's prospects, life premiums grew on a year-over-year basis, and both the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016. Last time, we had year-over-year growth for quarter was in 2004, for the fourth quarter growth was, it is an indicator of the positive effect of the changes that we made for this agency. We expect to seek assistance life premium growth of liberty national going forward. I would like to make one more comment regarding American at Liberty National. Roger Smith who oversees both of these agencies announced, he will retire at the end of the year, Roger has contributed greatly to the growth at American Income and the turnaround of Liberty National. Over the past several years, Roger has developed talented leaders at both at American Income and Liberty National. Steve, the President of American Income agency division will succeed Rogers at American Income. Steve has served in it's current capacity over 8 years was an SGA from a American Income for 12 years prior to that. Steve Turturro, President of the Liberty National agency division will succeed Roger at Liberty National, Steve has served his capacity for over 5 years was SGA in American Income before that. Roger will serve in an advisory capacity for both agencies after his retirement. Now Direct Response, in our direct operation worldwide, life premiums were up 4% to $192 million. Life underwriting margin declined 21% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 7% to $34 million. For the full year, 2016, life sales declined 9% due primarily to decreases in circulation design to improve profitability at certain segments.

First, talk about excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest or policy liabilities and debt were $58 million, an 8% increase",527,"The few minutes of discussing our investment operations. First, talk about excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest or policy liabilities and debt were $58 million, an 8% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase programs, excess investment in income was up 12%.
In 2017, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 6% to 8%. However, on a per share basis, we should see, an increase of about 9% to 11%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Investment assets were $14.8 billion, including $14.2 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. The fixed maturities, $13.4 billion our investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds are $751 million compared to $640 million the year ago. The percentage of the below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities 5.3% compared to 4.8% a year ago. The increase in below investment-grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades of securities in the energy and metals and mining sectors that occurred early in 2016. However, due to increase in the underlying commodity prices, the current market value of these securities are significantly higher at the time of the downgrades.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.7x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains or fixed maturities is 19%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated high BBB+ just while the end of A- a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains of a fixed maturity portfolio of $1.1 billion, approximately $550 million higher than a year ago.
Regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $607 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.58%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, fourth quarter yield was 5.75%, down 6 basis points from the 5.81% yield in the fourth quarter of 2015. At December 31, the portfolio of yield was approximately 5.74%.
For 2017, the midpoint of our current guidance, assumes an increasing new money yield throughout the year averaging 4.80% for the full year. We are encouraged by the prospect of our interest rates, higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are now concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven, since we not expect to realize them. We had the intent, and one ability to hold our investments and maturity. However, if rates don't rise, the continued low interest rate environment will impact the income statement, and not the balance sheet. As we primarily sell noninterest, protecting account for 560, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off of DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. 
In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. While we would benefit from a higher interest rates, Torchmark will continue substantial excess and income in an extended low interest rate environment. Now turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minute discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $71 million to buy $1.0 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $68.60. For the full year, we spent $311 milli",925,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minute discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $71 million to buy $1.0 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $68.60. For the full year, we spent $311 million of parent company cash to acquire 5.2 million shares at an average price of $59.78. So far in 2017, we have spent $19 million to purchase 257,000 shares. The parent end of the year with liquid assets of about $45 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional free cash flow in 2017. The parent company's free cash flow, as we define it results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries plus the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2016 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect free cash flow in 2017, to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. Thus included in the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $370 million to $380 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. This level of free cash flow in 2017 is slightly higher than 2016, primarily due to the net proceeds received in 2016, from the sale of our Medicare Part D business. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible, if market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, absence in need any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. 
Now regarding RBC, at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around, in NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
Although, we have not finalized our 2016 statutory financial statements. We expect that our consolidated RBC ratio, RBC percentage at December 31, 2016 will be around 325%. We do not anticipate any changes to our targeted RBC level in 2017. Next, the few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. During 2016, the growth in total life underwriting income like behind the growth in premium, due to higher-than-expected policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. As discussed on previous calls, this is attributable to a higher than originally expected clients relating to policies issued in calendar year 2007, and 2011 through 2015. 
During the fourth quarter, claims emerged as anticipated and policy obligations were in the range, we expected for the fourth quarter and consistent with those reported for the third quarter. In addition, at 16.5% of premiums, the underwriting margin for the full year, 2016 fell within the 16% to 17% range we expected. Looking forward, and as I indicated on last call, we anticipate that the underwriting margin for 2017 will decline slightly, and be in the range of 14% to 16% premium for the full year. 
Now with regard to the recognition of tax benefits on equity compensation. As we previously discussed, in the first quarter of 2016, the company adopted a new accounting standard relating to the treatment of excess tax benefits on a prospective basis. This new accounting standards primarily causes excess tax benefits to be recognized through earnings, and effects Torchmark's computations of net income and diluted shares outstanding and earnings per share. In the fourth quarter, the reduction in expense related to the adoption of the standard cause earnings per share from continuing operations to increase $0.04. During the full year 2016, earnings per share increased $0.13. While several factors influence the amount of excess tax benefits, we anticipate that the excess tax benefits recognized in 2017, will be slightly less than 2016, and stock option expense as reflected in net operating income will be in the range of $2 million to $4 million for the year, compared to a benefit of $1.5 million in 2016, a negative swing of $3.5 million to $5.5 million. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2017, we're projecting net operating income from continuing operations per share to be in the range of $4.57 to $4.77. The $4.67 midpoint of this range reflects $0.03 decrease from the midpoint of our previous guidance. This decrease is due to a $0.05 reduction resulting from the higher current share price, which is helping the number of shares expected to be repurchased in 2017, to be lower-than-anticipated at the time of our last call. The negative effect of the higher share price is offset somewhat, by a slightly improved outlook for underwriting and investment income. Much speculation exits at Congress some type of tax reform in 2017. At this time, few details are known after the direction that Congress will ultimately date, including what the statutory rate and what if any changes to the tax base might occur. As such, we have not reflected any possible changes in the tax law in our 2017 earnings guidance, and our calculations an existing tax law will stay in effect through 2017. Those are my comments, I'll now turn the call back to Larry."

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 6% to $550 million, while life underwriting margin was $143 million, down 1% from a year ago. The decline in underwriting margin was due primarily to the decline in the Direct Response margins. In 2017, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 1% to 3%. Net life sales were $99 million, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter. 
On the health side, premium revenue grew 1% to $238 million and health underwriting margin was up 4% to $53 million. In 2017, we expect health underwriting income to remain relatively flat.

The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 6,870. We expect the producing agent count to be in the range of 7,100 to 7,400 at the end of 2017. Life sales for the full year 2016 grew 6%. We expect 6% to 10% life sales growth in 2017. 
At Liberty National, life premiums were $67 million, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter, while life underwriting margin was $19 million, down 4%. Net life sales increased 15% to $10 million, while net health sales were $5 million, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter. The life sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,781, up 16% from a year-ago and down 1% compared to the third quarter. The producing agent count of Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,758. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 1,800 to 2,000 at the end of 2017.
Life net sales for the full year 2016 grew 12%. Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 8% to 12% for the full year 2017. Health net sales for the full year 2016 grew 8%. Health net sales growth in 2017 is expected to be within the range of 5% to 9%. 
We are enthusiastic about Liberty National's prospects. Life premiums grew on a year-over-year basis in both the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016. The last time we had year-over-year growth for a quarter was in 2004. While the fourth quarter growth was slight [ph], it is an indicator of the positive effect of the changes that we made at this agency. We expect to see consistent life premium growth at Liberty National going forward. 
I would like to make one more comment regarding American Income and at Liberty National. Roger Smith, who oversees both of these agencies, announced he will retire at the end of the year. Roger has contributed greatly to the growth of American Income and the turnaround of Liberty National. Over the past several years, Roger has developed talented leaders at both American Income and Liberty National. Steve Greer, the President of American Income Agency division, will succeed Rogers at American Income. Steve has served in his current capacity for over a year and was an SGA for American Income for 12 years prior to that. 
Steve DiChiaro, President of the Liberty National Agency division will succeed Roger at Liberty National. Steve has served in his current capacity for over 5 years and was an SGA at American Income before that. Roger will serve in an advisory capacity for both agencies after his retirement. 
Now Direct Response. In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $192 million. Life underwriting margin declined 21% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 7% to $34 million. For the full year 2016, life sales declined 9% due primarily to decreases in circulation designed to improve profitability at certain segments. We expect life sales to be down 4.5% to 9.5% in 2017 as we continue those efforts. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $61 million. Our health underwriting margin increased 26% to $14 million. Health net sales grew 8% to $13 million. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 947, up 8% from a year ago and down 40% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 909. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 950 to 1,050 at the end of 2017. Health sales for the full year 2016 grew 2%. We expect health sales growth to be in a range of 3% to 7% in 2017. 
At United American General Agency, health premiums declined 2% to $89 million. Net health sales were $24 million, down 38% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales for the full year of 2016 declined 3%. In 2017, we expect growth in individual Medicare supplement sales to be approximately 5%.

308916,417540236,1122726,"Torchmark Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2017",2017-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I'll spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, let's talk about excess investment income.

First, let's talk about excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on policy liabilities and debt, were $58 million, an 8% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase programs, excess investment income was up 12%. In 2017, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 6% to 8%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 9% to 11%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Investment assets were $14.8 billion, including $14.2 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. At the fixed maturities, $13.4 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below-investment grade bonds are $751 million compared to $640 million a year ago. The percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 5.3% compared to 4.8% a year ago. The increase in below-investment-grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades of securities in the energy and metals and mining sectors that occurred early in 2016. However, due to the increases in the underlying commodity prices, the current market value of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of the downgrades.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.7x, the percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 19%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated high BBB+, just slightly under the A- a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.1 billion, approximately $550 million higher than a year ago.
Regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $607 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.58%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, fourth quarter yield was 5.75%, down 6 basis points from the 5.81% yield in the fourth quarter of 2015. At December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.74%.
For 2017, the midpoint of our current guidance assumes an increasing new money yield throughout the year averaging 4.80% for the full year. We are encouraged by the prospect of our interest rates. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, the continued low interest rate environment will impact the income statement but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protecting products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off of DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. 
In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $71 million to buy 1.0 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $68.60. For the full year, we spent $311 milli",941,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $71 million to buy 1.0 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $68.60. For the full year, we spent $311 million of parent company cash to acquire 5.2 million shares at an average price of $59.78. So far in 2017, we have spent $19 million to purchase 257,000 shares. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of about $45 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional free cash flow in 2017. The parent company's free cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2016 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect free cash flow in 2017 to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. Thus, included in the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $370 million to $380 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. This level of free cash flow in 2017 is slightly higher than 2016, primarily due to the net proceeds received in 2016, from the sale of our Medicare Part D business. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, absence a need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. 
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
Although we have not finalized our 2016 statutory financial statements. We expect that our consolidated RBC ratio -- RBC percentage at December 31, 2016, will be around 325%. We do not anticipate any changes to our target RBC levels in 2017. 
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. During 2016, the growth in total life underwriting income lagged behind the growth in premium due to higher-than-expected policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. As discussed on previous calls, this is attributable to higher-than-originally-expected claims related to policies issued in calendar year -- for 2007 and 2011 through 2015. 
During the fourth quarter, claims emerged as anticipated, and policy obligations were in the range we expected for the fourth quarter and consistent with those reported for the third quarter. In addition, at 16.5% of premiums, the underwriting margin for the full year 2016 fell within the 16% to 17% range we expected. Looking forward, and as indicated on the last call, we anticipate that the underwriting margin for 2017 will decline slightly and be in the range of 14% to 16% of premium for the full year. 
Now with regard to the recognition of excess tax benefits on equity compensation. As we've previously discussed, in the first quarter of 2016, the company adopted the new accounting standard relating to the treatment of excess tax benefits on a prospective basis. This new accounting standard primarily causes excess tax benefits to be recognized through earnings and affects Torchmark's computations of net income, diluted shares outstanding and earnings per share. In the fourth quarter, the reduction in expense related to the adoption of the standard caused earnings per share from continuing operations to increase $0.04. During the full year 2016, earnings per share increased $0.13. While several factors influence the amount of excess tax benefits, we anticipate that the excess tax benefits recognized in 2017 will be slightly less than 2016, and our stock option expense as reflected in net operating income will be in the range of $2 million to $4 million for the year compared to a benefit of $1.5 million in 2016, a negative swing of $3.5 million to $5.5 million. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2017, we are projecting net operating income from continuing operations per share to be in the range of $4.57 to $4.77. The $4.67 midpoint of this range reflects a $0.03 decrease from the midpoint of our previous guidance. This decrease is due to a $0.05 reduction resulting from the higher current share price, which is causing the number of shares expected to be repurchased in 2017 to be lower than anticipated at the time of our last call. The negative effect of the higher share price is offset somewhat by a slightly improved outlook for underwriting and investment income. 
Much speculation exists that Congress will enact some type of tax reform in 2017. At this time, few details are known as to the direction that Congress will ultimately take, including what statutory rate might be agreed to and what, if any, changes to the tax base might occur. As such, we have not reflected any possible changes in the tax law in our 2017 earnings guidance, and our calculation suit [ph] on an existing tax law will stay in effect through 2017.

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 6% to $550 million, while life underwriting margin was $143 million, down 1% from a year ago. The decline in underwriting margin was due primarily to the decline in the Direct Response margins. In 2017, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 1% to 3%. Net life sales were $99 million, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter. 
On the health side, premium revenue grew 1% to $238 million and health underwriting margin was up 4% to $53 million. In 2017, we expect health underwriting income to remain relatively flat. Health sales in total were $47 million, down 21% from a year ago. Individual health sales were $37 million, down 4%.
Administrative expenses were $50 million for the quarter, up 6% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing corporations, administrative expenses were 6.4% compared to 6.3% a year ago.

We expect to see consistent life premium growth at Liberty National going forward. 
I would like to make one more comment regarding American Income at Liberty National. Roger Smith, who oversees both of these agencies, announced he will retire at the end of the year. Roger has contributed greatly to the growth of American Income and the turnaround of Liberty National. Over the past several years, Roger has developed talented leaders at both American Income and Liberty National. Steve Greer, the President of American Income Agency division, will succeed Rogers at American Income. Steve has served in his current capacity for over a year and was an SGA for American Income for 12 years prior to that. 
Steve DiChiaro, President of the Liberty National Agency division will succeed Roger at Liberty National. Steve has served in his current capacity for over 5 years and was an SGA at American Income before that. Roger will serve in an advisory capacity for both agencies after his retirement. 
Now Direct Response. In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $192 million. Life underwriting margin declined 21% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 7% to $34 million. For the full year 2016, life sales declined 9% due primarily to decreases in circulation designed to improve profitability at certain segments. We expect life sales to be down 4.5% to 9.5% in 2017 as we continue those efforts. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $61 million. Our health underwriting margin increased 26% to $14 million. Health net sales grew 8% to $13 million. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 947, up 8% from a year ago and down 40% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 909. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 950 to 1,050 at the end of 2017. Health sales for the full year 2016 grew 2%. We expect health sales growth to be in a range of 3% to 7% in 2017. 
At United American General Agency, health premiums declined 2% to $89 million. Net health sales were $24 million, down 38% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales for the full year of 2016 declined 3%. In 2017, we expect growth in individual Medicare supplement sales to be approximately 5%. 
I will now turn the call back to Gary."
308916,417540236,1122924,"Torchmark Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2017",2017-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I'll spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, let's talk about excess investment income.

First, let's talk about excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on policy liabilities and debt, were $58 million, an 8% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase programs, excess investment income was up 12%. In 2017, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 6% to 8%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 9% to 11%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Investment assets were $14.8 billion, including $14.2 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. At the fixed maturities, $13.4 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below-investment grade bonds are $751 million compared to $640 million a year ago. The percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 5.3% compared to 4.8% a year ago. The increase in below-investment-grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades of securities in the energy and metals and mining sectors that occurred early in 2016. However, due to the increases in the underlying commodity prices, the current market value of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of the downgrades.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.7x, the percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 19%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated high BBB+, just slightly under the A- a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.1 billion, approximately $550 million higher than a year ago.
Regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $607 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.58%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, fourth quarter yield was 5.75%, down 6 basis points from the 5.81% yield in the fourth quarter of 2015. At December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.74%.
For 2017, the midpoint of our current guidance assumes an increasing new money yield throughout the year averaging 4.80% for the full year. We are encouraged by the prospect of our interest rates. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, the continued low interest rate environment will impact the income statement but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protecting products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off of DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. 
In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."
308916,417540236,1122924,"Torchmark Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2017",2017-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $71 million to buy 1.0 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $68.60. For the full year, we spent $311 milli",941,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $71 million to buy 1.0 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $68.60. For the full year, we spent $311 million of parent company cash to acquire 5.2 million shares at an average price of $59.78. So far in 2017, we have spent $19 million to purchase 257,000 shares. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of about $45 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional free cash flow in 2017. The parent company's free cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2016 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect free cash flow in 2017 to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. Thus, included in the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $370 million to $380 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. This level of free cash flow in 2017 is slightly higher than 2016, primarily due to the net proceeds received in 2016, from the sale of our Medicare Part D business. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. 
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
Although we have not finalized our 2016 statutory financial statements. We expect that our consolidated RBC ratio -- RBC percentage at December 31, 2016, will be around 325%. We do not anticipate any changes to our target RBC levels in 2017. 
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. During 2016, the growth in total life underwriting income lagged behind the growth in premium due to higher-than-expected policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. As discussed on previous calls, this is attributable to higher-than-originally-expected claims related to policies issued in calendar year -- for 2007 and 2011 through 2015. 
During the fourth quarter, claims emerged as anticipated, and policy obligations were in the range we expected for the fourth quarter and consistent with those reported for the third quarter. In addition, at 16.5% of premiums, the underwriting margin for the full year 2016 fell within the 16% to 17% range we expected. Looking forward, and as indicated on the last call, we anticipate that the underwriting margin for 2017 will decline slightly and be in the range of 14% to 16% of premium for the full year. 
Now with regard to the recognition of excess tax benefits on equity compensation. As we've previously discussed, in the first quarter of 2016, the company adopted the new accounting standard relating to the treatment of excess tax benefits on a prospective basis. This new accounting standard primarily causes excess tax benefits to be recognized through earnings and affects Torchmark's computations of net income, diluted shares outstanding and earnings per share. In the fourth quarter, the reduction in expense related to the adoption of the standard caused earnings per share from continuing operations to increase $0.04. During the full year 2016, earnings per share increased $0.13. While several factors influence the amount of excess tax benefits, we anticipate that the excess tax benefits recognized in 2017 will be slightly less than 2016, and our stock option expense as reflected in net operating income will be in the range of $2 million to $4 million for the year compared to a benefit of $1.5 million in 2016, a negative swing of $3.5 million to $5.5 million. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2017, we are projecting net operating income from continuing operations per share to be in the range of $4.57 to $4.77. The $4.67 midpoint of this range reflects a $0.03 decrease from the midpoint of our previous guidance. This decrease is due to a $0.05 reduction resulting from the higher current share price, which is causing the number of shares expected to be repurchased in 2017 to be lower than anticipated at the time of our last call. The negative effect of the higher share price is offset somewhat by a slightly improved outlook for underwriting and investment income. 
Much speculation exists that Congress will enact some type of tax reform in 2017. At this time, few details are known as to the direction that Congress will ultimately take, including what statutory rate might be agreed to and what, if any, changes to the tax base might occur. As such, we have not reflected any possible changes in the tax law in our 2017 earnings guidance, and our calculation suit [ph] on an existing tax law will stay in effect through 2017.

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 6% to $550 million, while life underwriting margin was $143 million, down 1% from a year ago. The decline in underwriting margin was due primarily to the decline in the Direct Response margins. In 2017, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 1% to 3%. Net life sales were $99 million, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter. 
On the health side, premium revenue grew 1% to $238 million and health underwriting margin was up 4% to $53 million. In 2017, we expect health underwriting income to remain relatively flat. Health sales in total were $47 million, down 21% from a year ago. Individual health sales were $37 million, down 4%.
Administrative expenses were $50 million for the quarter, up 6% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing corporations, administrative expenses were 6.4% compared to 6.3% a year ago.

Net life sales were $52 million, up 3%, due primarily to increased agent count. The average agent count for the fourth quarter was 6,874, up 4% from a year ago and down 2% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 6,870. We expect the producing agent count to be in the range of 7,100 to 7,400 at the end of 2017. Life sales for the full year 2016 grew 6%. We expect 6% to 10% life sales growth in 2017. 
At Liberty National, life premiums were $67 million, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter, while life underwriting margin was $19 million, down 4%. Net life sales increased 15% to $10 million, while net health sales were $5 million, approximately the same as the year-ago quarter. The life sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,781, up 16% from a year-ago and down 1% compared to the third quarter. The producing agent count of Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,758. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 1,800 to 2,000 at the end of 2017.
Life net sales for the full year 2016 grew 12%. Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 8% to 12% for the full year 2017. Health net sales for the full year 2016 grew 8%. Health net sales growth in 2017 is expected to be within the range of 5% to 9%. 
We are enthusiastic about Liberty National's prospects. Life premiums grew on a year-over-year basis in both the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016. The last time we had year-over-year growth for a quarter was in 2004. While the fourth quarter growth was slight [ph], it is an indicator of the positive effect of the changes that we made at this agency. We expect to see consistent life premium growth at Liberty National going forward. 
I would like to make one more comment regarding American Income at Liberty National. Roger Smith, who oversees both of these agencies, announced he will retire at the end of the year. Roger has contributed greatly to the growth of American Income and the turnaround of Liberty National. Over the past several years, Roger has developed talented leaders at both American Income and Liberty National. Steve Greer, the President of American Income Agency division, will succeed Rogers at American Income. Steve has served in his current capacity for over a year and was an SGA for American Income for 12 years prior to that. 
Steve DiChiaro, President of the Liberty National Agency division will succeed Roger at Liberty National. Steve has served in his current capacity for over 5 years and was an SGA at American Income before that. Roger will serve in an advisory capacity for both agencies after his retirement. 
Now Direct Response. In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $192 million. Life underwriting margin declined 21% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 7% to $34 million. For the full year 2016, life sales declined 9% due primarily to decreases in circulation designed to improve profitability at certain segments. We expect life sales to be down 4.5% to 9.5% in 2017 as we continue those efforts. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $61 million. Our health underwriting margin increased 26% to $14 million. Health net sales grew 8% to $13 million. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 947, up 8% from a year ago and down 40% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 909. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 950 to 1,050 at the end of 2017. Health sales for the full year 2016 grew 2%. We expect health sales growth to be in a range of 3% to 7% in 2017. 
At United American General Agency, health premiums declined 2% to $89 million. Net health sales were $24 million, down 38% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales for the full year of 2016 declined 3%. In 2017, we expect growth in individual Medicare supplement sales to be approximately 5%. 
I will now turn the call back to Gary."
308916,417540236,1123341,"Torchmark Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2017",2017-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I'll spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, let's talk about excess investment income.

First, let's talk about excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on policy liabilities and debt, were $58 million, an 8% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase programs, excess investment income was up 12%. In 2017, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 6% to 8%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 9% to 11%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Investment assets were $14.8 billion, including $14.2 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. At the fixed maturities, $13.4 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below-investment grade bonds are $751 million compared to $640 million a year ago. The percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 5.3% compared to 4.8% a year ago. The increase in below-investment-grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades of securities in the energy and metals and mining sectors that occurred early in 2016. However, due to the increases in the underlying commodity prices, the current market value of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of the downgrades.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.7x, the percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 19%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated high BBB+, just slightly under the A- a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.1 billion, approximately $550 million higher than a year ago.
Regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $607 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.58%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio, fourth quarter yield was 5.75%, down 6 basis points from the 5.81% yield in the fourth quarter of 2015. At December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.74%.
For 2017, the midpoint of our current guidance assumes an increasing new money yield throughout the year averaging 4.80% for the full year. We are encouraged by the prospect of our interest rates. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, the continued low interest rate environment will impact the income statement but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protecting products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off of DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. 
In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $71 million to buy 1.0 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $68.60. For the full year, we spent $311 milli",941,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $71 million to buy 1.0 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $68.60. For the full year, we spent $311 million of parent company cash to acquire 5.2 million shares at an average price of $59.78. So far in 2017, we have spent $19 million to purchase 257,000 shares. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of about $45 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional free cash flow in 2017. The parent company's free cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2016 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect free cash flow in 2017 to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. Thus, included in the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $370 million to $380 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. This level of free cash flow in 2017 is slightly higher than 2016, primarily due to the net proceeds received in 2016, from the sale of our Medicare Part D business. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. 
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
Although we have not finalized our 2016 statutory financial statements. We expect that our consolidated RBC ratio -- RBC percentage at December 31, 2016, will be around 325%. We do not anticipate any changes to our target RBC levels in 2017. 
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. During 2016, the growth in total life underwriting income lagged behind the growth in premium due to higher-than-expected policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. As discussed on previous calls, this is attributable to higher-than-originally-expected claims related to policies issued in calendar year -- for 2007 and 2011 through 2015. 
During the fourth quarter, claims emerged as anticipated, and policy obligations were in the range we expected for the fourth quarter and consistent with those reported for the third quarter. In addition, at 16.5% of premiums, the underwriting margin for the full year 2016 fell within the 16% to 17% range we expected. Looking forward, and as indicated on the last call, we anticipate that the underwriting margin for 2017 will decline slightly and be in the range of 14% to 16% of premium for the full year. 
Now with regard to the recognition of excess tax benefits on equity compensation. As we've previously discussed, in the first quarter of 2016, the company adopted the new accounting standard relating to the treatment of excess tax benefits on a prospective basis. This new accounting standard primarily causes excess tax benefits to be recognized through earnings and affects Torchmark's computations of net income, diluted shares outstanding and earnings per share. In the fourth quarter, the reduction in expense related to the adoption of the standard caused earnings per share from continuing operations to increase $0.04. During the full year 2016, earnings per share increased $0.13. While several factors influence the amount of excess tax benefits, we anticipate that the excess tax benefits recognized in 2017 will be slightly less than 2016, and our stock option expense as reflected in net operating income will be in the range of $2 million to $4 million for the year compared to a benefit of $1.5 million in 2016, a negative swing of $3.5 million to $5.5 million. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2017, we are projecting net operating income from continuing operations per share to be in the range of $4.57 to $4.77. The $4.67 midpoint of this range reflects a $0.03 decrease from the midpoint of our previous guidance. This decrease is due to a $0.05 reduction resulting from the higher current share price, which is causing the number of shares expected to be repurchased in 2017 to be lower than anticipated at the time of our last call. The negative effect of the higher share price is offset somewhat by a slightly improved outlook for underwriting and investment income. 
Much speculation exists that Congress will enact some type of tax reform in 2017. At this time, few details are known as to the direction that Congress will ultimately take, including what statutory rate might be agreed to and what, if any, changes to the tax base might occur. As such, we have not reflected any possible changes in the tax law in our 2017 earnings guidance, and our calculation suit [ph] on an existing tax law will stay in effect through 2017.

As of the end of 2016, we still have around $100 million of net receivables from that business. We expect to probably get around $80 million of that in 2017. And that will be fairly a pro rata over the course of the year. And then there are -- it looks like there'll be a little bit of a tail on the final $20-or-so million dollars that we don't anticipate to receive from CMS until probably the end of 2018. Just there are some review processes that take a couple of years since we've exited the business."

Net life sales were $53 million, up 6%, due primarily to increased agent count. The average agent count for the first quarter was 6,713, up 8% from a year ago, but down 2% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 6,758. We expect 7% to 11% life sales growth for the full year 2017. At Liberty National, life premiums were $69 million, and life underwriting margin was $19 million, both up 1%. 
Net life sales increased 16% to $11 million, net health sales were $4 million, down 8% from the year-ago quarter. The life sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,820, up 18% from a year ago, and up 2% compared to the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,953. 
Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 14% to 18% for the full year 2017. Health net sales are expected to be flat to down 4% for the full year 2017. We continue to be encouraged with the progress of Liberty National. Due to increased sales, growth in life premium. Only 1% over the prior year and marks a significant turning point given the size of the in-force and liberties history of flat or decline in premiums. We expect continued life premium growth going forward. 
And our Direct Response operation Global Life, life premiums were up 5% to $210 million. Life underwriting margin declined 21% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 6% to $39 million. This sales decline was by design, we have decreased circulation in order to improve profitability at certain segments. Our primary marketing focus is to grow overall new business profits by maximizing margin dollars within an emphasizing sales levels or margins as a percentage of premium. We anticipate that life sales will be down 4% to 9% for the full year 2017.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $62 million. Our health underwriting margin increased 7% to $13 million. Health net sales grew 26% to $13 million. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 894, up 8% from a year ago, and down 6% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 980. We expect health sales growth to be in a range of 7% to 10% for the full year, 2017. We are pleased with Family Heritage's performance and we believe we're in a good track going forward.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 5% to $92 million. Net health sales were $11 million, down 5% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales were flat while group sales decline 19% to $3 million. For the full year 2017, we expect growth in individual Medicare supplement sales to be approximately 4%.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $59 million, an 8% increase",478,"I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $59 million, an 8% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase programs, excess investment income was up 11%. For the full year, we expect similar results, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 7% to 8% and excess investment income per share to grow around 10% to 11%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Investment assets are $15.3 billion, including $14.6 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Out of the fixed maturities, $13.9 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-,and below investment-grade bonds are $711 million compared to $771 million a year-ago. The percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.9% compared to 5.7% a year ago. And with a portfolio leverage of 3.7x the percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding unrealized gains from fixed maturities is 18%. Overall, the total portfolio is right at BBB+, which is slightly under the A- a year ago. 
In addition, we have net unrealized gains and the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.3 billion approximately $302 million higher than a year ago.
As to investment yield. In the first quarter, we invested $522 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily, in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.93%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 23 years. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.70%, down from the 5.83% yield in the first quarter of 2016. At March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.70%.
For 2017, the midpoint of our guidance assumes that average new money yield of around 5% for the full year. We are still hoping to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven, since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, the continued low interest rate environment will impact the income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protecting products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. 
In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. Certainly, while we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low rate environment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

In the first quarter, we spent $82 million to buy $1.1 million Torchmark shares at average price of $76.18. So far in April, we've used $20 million to purchase 263,000 shares. Thus for the full year, through today, we have spent $102 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1.3 million shares at an average price of $76.15. These purchases are being made from the parent company excess cash flow. The parent company's excess cash flow as we define it, results primarily from dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect the parent company's excess cash flow in 2017 to be in a range of $325 million to $335 million. After including the $45 million available from assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $370 million to $380 million of cash and other assets available to the parent during the year. As previously mentioned, to date, we have used $102 million of this cash to buy 1.3 million Torchmark shares.  Leaving approximately $270 million to $280 million of cash in other assets available for the remainder of the year. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible, if market conditions are favorable, we expect the share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
At December 31, 2016, our consolidated RBC ratio of 324%. We are targeting a 2017 consolidated RBC ratio of 325%. At this time, and was discussed on prior calls, it is likely that the capital freed up from the sale of Part D operations will be retained within the insurance companies.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. During the first quarter of 2017, the growth in total life underwriting income lagged behind the growth in premium income due to higher policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. As discussed on prior calls, this is mostly attributable to higher-than-originally-expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2011 through 2015. 
On our last call, we noted that we anticipated the margin as a percent of premium. For the full year of 2017 to range between 14% to 16%. For the first quarter, the margin was 14%, at the low end of this range, fully in line with our expectations for the quarter due to normal seasonality. We still anticipate the margin percentage for the full year, to range between 14% to 16%.
Now with respect to our guidance for 2017. We're projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.63 to $4.77 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $4.70 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.03 increase over our previous guidance. The increase is primarily attributed to an improved outlook for underwriting and investment income and a slightly lower projected stock option expense. As noted on the last call, we had not reflected in possible changes in the tax laws in our 2017 earnings guidance, and our calculations assume that existing tax laws stays in effect through 2017. Those are my comments. I'll now turn the call back to Larry."

At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $241 million and life underwriting margin was up 10% to $76 million. Net life sales were $53 million, up 6%, due primarily to increased agent count. The average agent count for the first quarter was 6,713, up 8% from a year ago, but down 2% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 6,768. We expect 7% to 11% life sales growth for the full year 2017. At Liberty National, life premiums were $69 million, and life underwriting margin was $19 million, both up 1%. 
Net life sales increased 16% to $11 million, while net health sales were $4 million, down 8% from the year-ago quarter. The life sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,820, up 18% from a year ago and up 2% compared to the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,953. 
Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 14% to 18% for the full year 2017. Health net sales are expected to be flat to down 4% for the full year 2017. We continue to be encouraged with the progress of Liberty National. Due to increased sales, we are seeing growth in life premium of only 1% over the prior year. It marks a significant turning point given the size of the in-force block and Liberty's history of flat or decline in premiums. We expect continued life premium growth going forward. 
In our Direct Response operation at Global Life, life premiums were up 5% to $210 million. Life underwriting margin declined 21% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 6% to $39 million. This sales decline is by design. We have decreased circulation in order to improve profitability in certain segments. Our primary marketing focus is to grow overall new business profits by maximizing margin dollars within an emphasizing sales levels or margins as a percentage of premium. We anticipate that life sales will be down 4% to 9% for the full year 2017.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $62 million. The health underwriting margin increased 7% to $13 million. Health net sales grew 26% to $13 million. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 894, up 8% from a year ago, but down 6% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 980. We expect health sales growth to be in a range from 7% to 10% for the full year 2017. We are pleased with Family Heritage's performance and believe we're on a good track going forward.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 5% to $92 million. Net health sales were $11 million, down 5% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales were flat while group sales declined 19% to $3 million. For the full year 2017, we expect growth in individual Medicare supplement sales to be approximately 4%. 
I will now turn the call back to Gary."
308916,427409550,1173688,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2017",2017-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $59 million, an 8% increa",480,"I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $59 million, an 8% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 11%. For the full year, we expect similar results. We expect excess investment income to grow around 7% to 8% and excess investment income per share to grow around 10% to 11%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Investment assets are $15.3 billion, including $14.6 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Out of the fixed maturities, $13.9 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $711 million compared to $771 million a year ago. The percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.9% compared to 5.7% a year ago. And with a portfolio leverage of 3.7x the percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains from fixed maturities, is 18%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, just slightly under the A- a year ago. 
In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.3 billion, approximately $302 million higher than a year ago.
As to the investment yield. In the first quarter, we invested $522 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.93%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 23 years. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.70%, down from the 5.83% yield in the first quarter of 2016. At March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.70%.
For 2017, the midpoint of our guidance assumes that average new money yield of around 5% for the full year. We are still hoping to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven, since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, the continued low interest rate environment will impact the income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. 
In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. Certainly, while we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low rate environment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter, we spent $82 million to buy $1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $76.18. So far in April, we have used $20 mill",673,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter, we spent $82 million to buy $1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $76.18. So far in April, we have used $20 million to purchase 263,000 shares. Thus for the full year, through today, we have spent $102 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1.3 million shares at an average price of $76.15. These purchases are being made from the parent company excess cash flow. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect the parent company's excess cash flow in 2017 to be in a range of $325 million to $335 million. After including the $45 million available from assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $370 million to $380 million of cash and other assets available to the parent during the year. As previously mentioned, to date, we have used $102 million of this cash to buy 1.3 million Torchmark shares, leaving approximately $270 million to $280 million of cash and other assets available for the remainder of the year. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
At December 31, 2016, our consolidated RBC ratio was 324%. We are targeting a 2017 consolidated RBC ratio of 325%. At this time, and as was discussed on prior calls, it is likely that the capital freed up from the sale of our Part D operations will be retained within the insurance companies.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. During the first quarter of 2017, the growth in total life underwriting income lagged behind the growth in premium income due to higher policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. As discussed on prior calls, this is mostly attributable to higher-than-originally-expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2011 through 2015. 
On our last call, we noted that we anticipated the margin as a percent of premium for the full year of 2017 to range between 14% to 16%. For the first quarter, the margin was 14%, at the low end of this range, but fully in line with our expectations for the quarter due to normal seasonality. We still anticipate the margin percentage for the full year to range between 14% to 16%.
Now with respect to our guidance for 2017. We're projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.63 to $4.77 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $4.70 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.03 increase over our previous guidance. The increase is primarily attributed to an improved outlook for underwriting and investment income and a slightly lower projected stock option expense. As noted on the last call, we have not reflected any possible changes in the tax laws in our 2017 earnings guidance, and our calculations assume that existing tax laws stays in effect through 2017. Those are my comments. I'll now turn the call back to Larry."

Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.2% and book value per share was $32.77, a 7% increase from a year ago.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 6% to $576 million, while life underwriting margin was $144 million, approximately the same as a year ago. Underwriting margin was flat due to the decline in the Direct Response margins. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 1% to 3%. Net life sales were $106 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 4% to $245 million and health underwriting margin was up 4% to $53 million. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to remain relatively flat. Health sales were $34 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter. Individual health sales were $30 million, up 10%.
Administrative expenses were $52 million for the quarter, up 7% from a year ago, and in line with our expectations.

At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $241 million and life underwriting margin was up 10% to $76 million. Net life sales were $53 million, up 6%, due primarily to increased agent count. The average agent count for the first quarter was 6,713, up 8% from a year ago, but down 2% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 6,768. We expect 7% to 11% life sales growth for the full year 2017. At Liberty National, life premiums were $69 million, and life underwriting margin was $19 million, both up 1%. 
Net life sales increased 16% to $11 million, while net health sales were $4 million, down 8% from the year-ago quarter. The life sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,820, up 18% from a year ago and up 2% compared to the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,953. 
Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 14% to 18% for the full year 2017. Health net sales are expected to be flat to down 4% for the full year 2017. We continue to be encouraged with the progress of Liberty National. Due to increased sales, we are seeing growth in life premium of only 1% over the prior year. It marks a significant turning point given the size of the in-force block and Liberty's history of flat or declining premiums. We expect continued life premium growth going forward. 
In our Direct Response operation at Global Life, life premiums were up 5% to $210 million. Life underwriting margin declined 21% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 6% to $39 million. This sales decline is by design. We have decreased circulation in order to improve profitability in certain segments. Our primary marketing focus is to grow overall new business profits by maximizing margin dollars rather than emphasizing sales levels or margins as a percentage of premium. We anticipate that life sales will be down 4% to 9% for the full year 2017.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $62 million. The health underwriting margin increased 7% to $13 million. Health net sales grew 26% to $13 million. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 894, up 8% from a year ago, but down 6% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 980. We expect health sales growth to be in a range from 7% to 10% for the full year 2017. We are pleased with Family Heritage's performance and believe we're on a good track going forward.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 5% to $92 million. Net health sales were $11 million, down 5% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales were flat while group sales declined 19% to $3 million. For the full year 2017, we expect growth in individual Medicare supplement sales to be approximately 4%. 
I will now turn the call back to Gary."
308916,427409550,1173728,"Torchmark Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2017",2017-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $59 million, an 8% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 11%. For the full year, we expect similar results. We expect excess investment income to grow around 7% to 8% and excess investment income per share to grow around 10% to 11%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Investment assets are $15.3 billion, including $14.6 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Out of the fixed maturities, $13.9 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $711 million compared to $771 million a year ago. The percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.9% compared to 5.7% a year ago. And with a portfolio leverage of 3.7x the percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains from fixed maturities, is 18%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, just slightly under the A- a year ago. 
In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.3 billion, approximately $302 million higher than a year ago.
As to the investment yield. In the first quarter, we invested $522 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.93%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 23 years. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.70%, down from the 5.83% yield in the first quarter of 2016. At March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.70%.
For 2017, the midpoint of our guidance assumes an average new money yield of around 5% for the full year. We are still hoping to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven, since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, the continued low interest rate environment will impact the income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. 
In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. Certainly, while we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low rate environment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter, we spent $82 million to buy $1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $76.18. So far in April, we have used $20 mill",674,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter, we spent $82 million to buy $1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $76.18. So far in April, we have used $20 million to purchase 263,000 shares. Thus for the full year, through today, we have spent $102 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1.3 million shares at an average price of $76.15. These purchases are being made from the parent company excess cash flow. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect the parent company's excess cash flow in 2017 to be in a range of $325 million to $335 million. After including the $45 million available from assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $370 million to $380 million of cash and other assets available to the parent during the year. As previously mentioned, to date, we have used $102 million of this cash to buy 1.3 million Torchmark shares, leaving approximately $270 million to $280 million of cash and other assets available for the remainder of the year. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
At December 31, 2016, our consolidated RBC ratio was 324%. We are targeting a 2017 consolidated RBC ratio of 325%. At this time, and as was discussed on prior calls, it is likely that the capital freed up from the sale of our Part D operations will be retained within the insurance companies.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. During the first quarter of 2017, the growth in total life underwriting income lagged behind the growth in premium income due to higher policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. As discussed on prior calls, this is mostly attributable to higher-than-originally-expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2011 through 2015. 
On our last call, we noted that we anticipated the margin as a percent of premium for the full year of 2017 to range between 14% to 16%. For the first quarter, the margin was 14%, at the low end of this range, but fully in line with our expectations for the quarter due to normal seasonality. We still anticipate the margin percentage for the full year to range between 14% to 16%.
Now with respect to our guidance for 2017. We are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.63 to $4.77 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $4.70 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.03 increase over our previous guidance. The increase is primarily attributed to an improved outlook for underwriting and investment income and a slightly lower projected stock option expense. As noted on the last call, we have not reflected any possible changes in the tax laws in our 2017 earnings guidance, and our calculations assume that existing tax laws stays in effect through 2017. Those are my comments. I'll now turn the call back to Larry."

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 6% to $576 million, while life underwriting margin was $144 million, approximately the same as a year ago.

At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $241 million and life underwriting margin was up 10% to $76 million. Net life sales were $53 million, up 6%, due primarily to increased agent count. The average agent count for the first quarter was 6,713, up 8% from a year ago, but down 2% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 6,768. We expect 7% to 11% life sales growth for the full year 2017. At Liberty National, life premiums were $69 million, and life underwriting margin was $19 million, both up 1%. 
Net life sales increased 16% to $11 million, while net health sales were $4 million, down 8% from the year-ago quarter. The life sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,820, up 18% from a year ago and up 2% compared to the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,953. 
Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 14% to 18% for the full year 2017. Health net sales are expected to be flat to down 4% for the full year 2017. We continue to be encouraged with the progress of Liberty National. Due to increased sales, we are seeing growth in life premium of only 1% over the prior year. It marks a significant turning point given the size of the in-force block and Liberty's history of flat or declining premiums. We expect continued life premium growth going forward. 
In our Direct Response operation at Global Life, life premiums were up 5% to $210 million. Life underwriting margin declined 21% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 6% to $39 million. This sales decline is by design. We have decreased circulation in order to improve profitability in certain segments. Our primary marketing focus is to grow overall new business profits by maximizing margin dollars rather than emphasizing sales levels or margins as a percentage of premium. We anticipate that life sales will be down 4% to 9% for the full year 2017.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $62 million. The health underwriting margin increased 7% to $13 million. Health net sales grew 26% to $13 million. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 894, up 8% from a year ago, but down 6% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 980. We expect health sales growth to be in a range from 7% to 10% for the full year 2017. We are pleased with Family Heritage's performance and believe we're on a good track going forward.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 5% to $92 million. Net health sales were $11 million, down 5% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales were flat while group sales declined 19% to $3 million. For the full year 2017, we expect growth in individual Medicare supplement sales to be approximately 4%.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $59 million, an 8% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 11%. For the full year, we expect similar results. We expect excess investment income to grow around 7% to 8% and excess investment income per share to grow around 10% to 11%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio. Investment assets are $15.3 billion, including $14.6 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Out of the fixed maturities, $13.9 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $711 million compared to $771 million a year ago. The percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.9% compared to 5.7% a year ago. And with a portfolio leverage of 3.7x the percentage of below-investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains from fixed maturities, is 18%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, just slightly under the A- a year ago. 
In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.3 billion, approximately $302 million higher than a year ago.
As to the investment yield. In the first quarter, we invested $522 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.93%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 23 years. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.70%, down from the 5.83% yield in the first quarter of 2016. At March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.70%.
For 2017, the midpoint of our guidance assumes an average new money yield of around 5% for the full year. We are still hoping to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven, since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, the continued low interest rate environment will impact the income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. 
In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. Certainly, while we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low rate environment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter, we spent $82 million to buy $1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $76.18. So far in April, we have used $20 mill",674,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter, we spent $82 million to buy $1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $76.18. So far in April, we have used $20 million to purchase 263,000 shares. Thus for the full year, through today, we have spent $102 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1.3 million shares at an average price of $76.15. These purchases are being made from the parent company excess cash flow. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect the parent company's excess cash flow in 2017 to be in a range of $325 million to $335 million. After including the $45 million available from assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $370 million to $380 million of cash and other assets available to the parent during the year. As previously mentioned, to date, we have used $102 million of this cash to buy 1.3 million Torchmark shares, leaving approximately $270 million to $280 million of cash and other assets available for the remainder of the year. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
At December 31, 2016, our consolidated RBC ratio was 324%. We are targeting a 2017 consolidated RBC ratio of 325%. At this time, and as was discussed on prior calls, it is likely that the capital freed up from the sale of our Part D operations will be retained within the insurance companies.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. During the first quarter of 2017, the growth in total life underwriting income lagged behind the growth in premium income due to higher policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. As discussed on prior calls, this is mostly attributable to higher-than-originally-expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2011 through 2015. 
On our last call, we noted that we anticipated the margin as a percent of premium for the full year of 2017 to range between 14% to 16%. For the first quarter, the margin was 14%, at the low end of this range, but fully in line with our expectations for the quarter due to normal seasonality. We still anticipate the margin percentage for the full year to range between 14% to 16%.
Now with respect to our guidance for 2017. We are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.63 to $4.77 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $4.70 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.03 increase over our previous guidance. The increase is primarily attributed to an improved outlook for underwriting and investment income and a slightly lower projected stock option expense. As noted on the last call, we have not reflected any possible changes in the tax laws in our 2017 earnings guidance, and our calculations assume that existing tax laws stays in effect through 2017. Those are my comments. I'll now turn the call back to Larry."

At Liberty National, life premiums were up 1% to $68 million, while life underwriting margin was down 3% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 13% to $4 million, while net health sales were $5 million, down 3% from the year-ago quarter. The life sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count.
The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 2,004, up 15% from a year ago and up 10% compared to the first quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,106. Once again, we are very pleased with the results of Liberty National.
Our direct response operation at global life, life premiums were up 2% to $203 million. Life underwriting margin declined 12% to $30 million. Net life sales were down 9% to $37 million. As we've discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is by design. We have decreased circulation in order to improve profitability in certain segments. Our primary marketing focus is to grow overall new business profits by maximizing margin dollars rather than emphasizing sales levels or margins as a percentage of premium.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $63 million and health underwriting margin increased 11% to $14 million. Health net sales grew 4% to $14 million. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,035, up 11% from a year ago, and up 16% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,030. We continue to be enthusiastic about the positive performance at Family Heritage.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 1% to $91 million. Net health sales were $13 million, up 26% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales were up 4%, and group sales increased from $2 million to $5 million.
To complete my discussion on the market operations, I will now provide some forwarded information. We expect to producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2017 to be in the following ranges: American Income, 7,100 to 7,500; liberty national, 2,000 to 2,200; Family Heritage, 970 to 1,070.
Life net sales trends for the full year 2017 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 6% to 10% growth; Liberty National, 14% to 18% growth; Direct Response, 6% to 9% decline.
Health net sales transfer the full year 2017 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, flat to 4% decline; family Heritage, 7% to 11% growth; United American individual metric supplement, flat to 5% growth.
I will now turn the call back to Gary."

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as a net investment income less required interest on net liabilities and debt was $62 million, a 13% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 18%.
In the higher-than-normal increase is do primary to the following factors. First, interest expense was higher in the second quarter of 2016 due to debt issued earlier in the quarter to refinance and notes that do not, which are until late in the quarter. And also investment income in 2017 is higher because the negative impact from the lace receiving party reimbursements has declined. For the second half of the year, we expect excess investment income to grow around 5% and excess investment income per share to grow allowed 9% to 10%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets as were $15.3 million, including $14.7 billion of fixed maturities at amortized costs. Other fixed maturities, $14 billion on investment grade with an average rating of A minus, and below investment-grade bonds were $672 million compared to $763 million a year ago. The percentage of the low investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.6% compared to 5.5% a year ago.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.7x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net realized gains of fixed maturities is 17%.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, just [indiscernible] A minus over a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains to the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.7 billion, approximately the same with the year ago. As investment yield in the second quarter, we invested $154 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.90% and average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 20 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.68%, down 12 basis points from the 5.80% yield in the second quarter of 2016. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.68%. In the midpoint of our guidance, we're assuming an average new rate of 4.80% for the remainder of the year.
We are still hoping to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and more importantly, the building in all our investments and maturity. However, if rates don't rise, the continued low interest rate department will impact our income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact for our balance sheet.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Those are my comments within business. I will now turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the second quarter, we spent $81 million to buy 1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $75.89. So far, in July, we have used $5 million to purchase 65,000 shares at an average price of $77.45. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $168 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 2.2 million shares at an average price of $76.08. These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow.
The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parents from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the interest paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect the parent company's excess cash flow in 2017 to be in the range of $325 million to $330 million. With $168 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have $157 million to $162 million available for the remainder of the year from our excess cash flow plus other access available to the parent. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC and our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. The past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
At December 31, 2016, our consolidated RBC was 324%. Although we do not calculate RBC on of a quarterly basis, we're still planning to target a 2017 consolidated RBC ratio of 325%.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. During the second quarter of 2017, the growth in total life underwriting income continue to lag behind the growth in premium due to higher policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. As discussed on previous calls, this is mostly attributable to higher obligations related to policies issued in calendar years 2011 through 2015.
On our last call, we noted that we anticipated the margin for the full year of 2017 to range between 14% to 16%. For the second quarter, the margin was 15%, fully in line with our expectations for the quarter. We still anticipate the margin for the full year to range between 14% to 16%.
Now with respect to our guidance for 2017. We are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.70 to $4.80 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $4.75 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.05 increase over our previous guidance. The increase is primarily attributed to an improved outlook for underwriting income as well as an increase in investment income.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Those are my comments within business. I will now turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the second quarter, we spent $81 million to buy 1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $75.89. So far, in July, we have used $5 million to purchase 65,000 shares at an average price of $77.45. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $168 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 2.2 million shares at an average price of $76.08. These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow.
The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parents from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the interest paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect the parent company's excess cash flow in 2017 to be in the range of $325 million to $330 million. With $168 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have $157 million to $162 million available for the remainder of the year from our excess cash flow plus other assets available to the parent. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC and our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our company in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
At December 31, 2016, our consolidated RBC was 324%. Although we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis, we are still planning to target a 2017 consolidated RBC ratio of 325%.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. During the second quarter of 2017, the growth in total life underwriting income continue to lag behind the growth in premium due to higher policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. As discussed on previous calls, this is mostly attributable to higher obligations related to policies issued in calendar years 2011 through 2015.
On our last call, we noted that we anticipated the margin for the full year of 2017 to range between 14% to 16%. For the second quarter, the margin was 15%, fully in line with our expectations for the quarter. We still anticipate the margin for the full year to range between 14% to 16%.
Now with respect to our guidance for 2017. We are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.70 to $4.80 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $4.75 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.05 increase over our previous guidance. The increase is primarily attributed to an improved outlook for underwriting income as well as an increase in investment income.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $574 million and life underwriting margin was $147 million, up 3% from a year ago.

For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 2% to 4%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 2% to $243 million, while health underwriting margin was up 5% to $55 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due primarily to favorable claims experience. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow 1% to 3%.

Net life sales increased 13% to $12 million, while net health sales were $5 million, down 3% from the year-ago quarter. The life sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count.
The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 2,004, up 15% from a year ago and up 10% compared to the first quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,106. Once again, we are very pleased with the results at Liberty National.
Our Direct Response operation at Global Life, life premiums were up 2% to $203 million. Life underwriting margin declined 12% to $30 million. Net life sales were down 9% to $37 million. As we have discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is by design. We have decreased circulation in order to improve profitability in certain segments. Our primary marketing focus is to grow overall new business profits by maximizing margin dollars rather than emphasizing sales levels or margins as a percentage of premium.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $63 million and health underwriting margin increased 11% to $14 million. Health net sales grew 4% to $14 million. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,035, up 11% from a year ago, and up 16% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,030.

First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as a net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $62 million, a 13% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 18%.
The higher-than-normal increase is due primarily to the following factors. First, interest expense was higher in the second quarter of 2016 due to debt issued earlier in that quarter to refinance a note that did not mature until late in the quarter. And also, investment income in 2017 is higher because the negative impact from the lengthy delays in receiving Part D reimbursements has declined. For the second half of the year, we expect excess investment income to grow around 5% and excess investment income per share to grow around 9% to 10%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $15.3 million, including $14.7 billion of fixed maturities at amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $14 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds were $672 million compared to $763 million a year ago. The percentage of low investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.6% compared to 5.5% a year ago.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.7x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net realized gains on fixed maturities is 17%.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, just slightly under A- of a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains to the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.7 billion, approximately the same to the year ago. As investment yield in the second quarter, we invested $154 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.90%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 20 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.68%, down 12 basis points from the 5.80% yield in the second quarter of 2016. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.68%. In the midpoint of our guidance, we're assuming an average new money rate of 4.80% for the remainder of the year.
We are still hoping to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments in maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the second quarter, we spent $81 million to buy 1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $75.89. So far, in July, we have used $5 million to purchase 65,000 shares at an average price of $77.45. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $168 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 2.2 million shares at an average price of $76.08. These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow.
The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parents from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the interest paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect the parent company's excess cash flow in 2017 to be in the range of $325 million to $330 million. With $168 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have $157 million to $162 million available for the remainder of the year from our excess cash flow plus other assets available to the parent. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC and our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our company in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
At December 31, 2016, our consolidated RBC was 324%. Although we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis, we are still planning to target a 2017 consolidated RBC ratio of 325%.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. During the second quarter of 2017, the growth in total life underwriting income continue to lag behind the growth in premium due to higher policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. As discussed on previous calls, this is mostly attributable to higher obligations related to policies issued in calendar years 2011 through 2015.
On our last call, we noted that we anticipated the margin for the full year of 2017 to range between 14% to 16%. For the second quarter, the margin was 15%, fully in line with our expectations for the quarter. We still anticipate the margin for the full year to range between 14% to 16%.
Now with respect to our guidance for 2017. We are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.70 to $4.80 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $4.75 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.05 increase over our previous guidance. The increase is primarily attributed to an improved outlook for underwriting income as well as an increase in investment income.

On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of June 30, was 11.4%, and book value per share was $42.55. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.3% and book value per share was $33.49, an 8% increase from a year ago.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $574 million and life underwriting margin was $147 million, up 3% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin continues the life premium growth due primarily to the Direct Response segment as we have discussed in previous calls. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 2% to 4%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 2% to $243 million, while health underwriting margin was up 5% to $55 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due primarily to favorable claims experience. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow 1% to 3%.
Administrative expenses were $51 million for the quarter, up 6% from a year ago, and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.3% compared to 6.2% a year ago.

Net life sales were $57 million, up 3%, due primarily to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 7,009, up 6% from a year ago, and up 4% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 7,170.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 1% to $68 million, while life underwriting margin was down 3% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 13% to $12 million, while net health sales were $5 million, down 3% from the year-ago quarter. The life sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count.
The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 2,004, up 15% from a year ago and up 10% compared to the first quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,106. Once again, we are very pleased with the results at Liberty National.
Our Direct Response operation at Global Life, life premiums were up 2% to $203 million. Life underwriting margin declined 12% to $30 million. Net life sales were down 9% to $37 million. As we have discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is by design. We have decreased circulation in order to improve profitability in certain segments. Our primary marketing focus is to grow overall new business profits by maximizing margin dollars rather than emphasizing sales levels or margins as a percentage of premium.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $63 million and health underwriting margin increased 11% to $14 million. Health net sales grew 4% to $14 million. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,035, up 11% from a year ago, and up 16% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,030. We continue to be enthusiastic about the positive performance at Family Heritage.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 1% to $91 million. Net health sales were $13 million, up 26% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales were up 4%, and group sales increased from $2 million to $5 million.
To complete my discussion on the market operations, I will now provide some forwarded-looking information. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2017 to be in the following ranges: American Income, 7,100 to 7,500; Liberty National, 2,000 to 2,200; Family Heritage, 970 to 1,070.
Life net sales trends for the full year 2017 are expected to be as follows: American Income, 6% to 10% growth; Liberty National, 14% to 18% growth; Direct Response, 6% to 9% decline.
Health net sales trends for the full year 2017 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, flat to a 4% decline; Family Heritage, 7% to 11% growth; United American individual Medicare supplement, flat to 5% growth.

308916,531053482,1262265,"Torchmark Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as a net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $62 million, a 13% increas",551,"I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as a net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $62 million, a 13% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 18%.
The higher-than-normal increase is due primarily to the following factors. First, interest expense was higher in the second quarter of 2016 due to debt issued earlier in that quarter to refinance a note that did not mature until late in the quarter. And also, investment income in 2017 is higher because the negative impact from the lengthy delays in receiving Part D reimbursements has declined. For the second half of the year, we expect excess investment income to grow around 5% and excess investment income per share to grow around 9% to 10%.
Now regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $15.3 million, including $14.7 billion of fixed maturities at amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $14 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds were $672 million compared to $763 million a year ago. The percentage of low investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.6% compared to 5.5% a year ago.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.7x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net realized gains on fixed maturities is 17%.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, just slightly under A- of a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains to the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.7 billion, approximately the same to the year ago. As investment yield in the second quarter, we invested $154 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.90%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 20 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.68%, down 12 basis points from the 5.80% yield in the second quarter of 2016. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.68%. In the midpoint of our guidance, we're assuming an average new money rate of 4.80% for the remainder of the year.
We are still hoping to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments in maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest-sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Those are my comments on the investments. I will now turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the second quarter, we spent $81 million to buy 1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $75.89. So far, in July, we have used $5 million to purchase 65,000 shares at an average price of $77.45. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $168 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 2.2 million shares at an average price of $76.08. These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow.
The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parents from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the interest paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect the parent company's excess cash flow in 2017 to be in the range of $325 million to $330 million. With $168 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have $157 million to $162 million available for the remainder of the year from our excess cash flow plus other assets available to the parent. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.
Now regarding RBC and our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our company in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.
At December 31, 2016, our consolidated RBC was 324%. Although we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis, we are still planning to target a 2017 consolidated RBC ratio of 325%.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. During the second quarter of 2017, the growth in total life underwriting income continue to lag behind the growth in premium due to higher policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. As discussed on previous calls, this is mostly attributable to higher obligations related to policies issued in calendar years 2011 through 2015.
On our last call, we noted that we anticipated the margin for the full year of 2017 to range between 14% to 16%. For the second quarter, the margin was 15%, fully in line with our expectations for the quarter. We still anticipate the margin for the full year to range between 14% to 16%.
Now with respect to our guidance for 2017. We are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.70 to $4.80 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $4.75 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.05 increase over our previous guidance. The increase is primarily attributed to an improved outlook for underwriting income as well as an increase in investment income.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

In insurance operations, -- in the life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $576 million and life underwriting margin was $153 million, up 7% from a year ago.

For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $243 million, while health underwriting margin was up 5% to $56 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due primarily to favorable claims experience. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3% to 5%.

At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $69 million, while life underwriting margin was down 6% to $19 million. Net life sales increased 19% to $12 million, while net health sales were $5 million, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth in agent count. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 2,132, up 19% from a year ago and up 6% compared to the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,123. We continue to be encouraged by the positive results at Liberty National.
In our Direct Response operation at global life, life premiums were up 4% to $200 million. Although net life sales were down 11% to $31 million, life underwriting margin increased 7% to $31 million.

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, let's talk about excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income, less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $61 million, a 7% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 9%. The higher-than-normal increase is due primarily to higher investment income resulting from the decline in the negative impact of the lengthy delays in receiving Part D reimbursements. For the full year of 2017, we expect excess investment income to grow approximately 8% and excess investment income per share to grow around the 11%. 
Regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $15.6 billion, including $14.9 billion of fixed maturities at [ph] amortized cost. Now the fixed maturity's [ph] $14.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds or $661 million compared to $753 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to [ph] fixed maturities is 4.4%, down from 5.4% a year ago. The decline is due primarily to upgrades of bonds that were previously classified as below investment grade.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.7x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 16%, down from 20% a year ago. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, just slightly under the A- of a year ago.
Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter, we invested $376 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.43%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 26 years.
For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.64%, down 13 basis points from the 5.77% yield in the third quarter of 2016. As of September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.63%.
The midpoint of our guidance assumes an average new money yield of 4.6% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 4.9% in 2018. 
We are still hoping to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low rate environment will impact our income statement but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, [ph] we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. 
In the third quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1 million [ph] Torchmark shares at an average price of $77.34. So far on October, we have used $12 million to purchase 144,000 shares at an average price of $80.91. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $255 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.3 million shares at an average price of $76.65. These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. 
The parent company's excess cash flow as we define it results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect the parent company's excess cash flow in 2017 to be around $325 million. With $255 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have approximately $70 million available for the remainder of the year from our excess cash flow plus other assets available to the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, access [ph] the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. For 2018, we preliminarily estimate that the excess cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $310 million to $320 million.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around at NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our company in line of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively low risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. We intend to target a consolidated RBC of 325% for 2017 and 2018.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. As Gary noted earlier, during the third quarter, we saw growth in the Direct Response underwriting margin for the first time in several quarters. The margin, as a percent of premium, was 15.6%, up from 15.2% in the year-ago quarter. While higher claims [ph] will cause underwriting margin to be lower for the full year 2017 versus 2016, the increase in the quarter was fully in line with our expectations.
On previous calls, we noted that we anticipated the margin for the full year of 2017 to range between 14% to 16%. We still anticipate the margin for the full year to be near the midpoint of this range or 15%. While it's still very early, we currently, estimate the margin percentage for Direct Response will remain in the 14% to 16% range in 2018.
Now with respect to our guidance for 2017 and '18. We are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.77 to $4.83 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $4.80 midpoint of this guidance reflects a 7% increase over 2016. The increase in the midpoint of our guidance is primarily attributable to the continued positive outlook for life underwriting income at American Income, and in our various health insurance businesses. For 2018, we estimate that our net operating income per share will be in the range of $5 per share to $5.25 per share, a 7% increase at the midpoint from 2017.

That is kind of the pattern that we were really expecting to see over the course of the year. And I think again, it's largely due to the some seasonality.

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, let's talk about excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income, less required interest on net policy liabilities and",513,"Thanks, Larry. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, let's talk about excess investment income. 
Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income, less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $61 million, a 7% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 9%. The higher-than-normal increase is due primarily to higher investment income resulting from the decline in the negative impact of the lengthy delays in receiving Part D reimbursements. For the full year of 2017, we expect excess investment income to grow approximately 8% and excess investment income per share to grow around 11%. 
Regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $15.6 billion, including $14.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Now the fixed maturities at $14.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $661 million compared to $753 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.4%, down from 5.4% a year ago. The decline is due primarily to upgrades of bonds that were previously classified as below investment grade.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.7x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 16%, down from 20% a year ago. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, just slightly under the A- of a year ago.
Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter, we invested $376 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.43%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 26 years.
For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.64%, down 13 basis points from the 5.77% yield in the third quarter of 2016. As of September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.63%.
The midpoint of our guidance assumes an average new money yield of 4.6% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 4.9% in 2018. 
We are still hoping to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low rate environment will impact our income statement but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $77.34. So far on October, we have used $12 mil",634,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. 
In the third quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $77.34. So far on October, we have used $12 million to purchase 144,000 shares at an average price of $80.91. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $255 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.3 million shares at an average price of $76.65. These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. 
The parent company's excess cash flow as we define it results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect the parent company's excess cash flow in 2017 to be around $325 million. With $255 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have approximately $70 million available for the remainder of the year from our excess cash flow plus other assets available to the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017 absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. For 2018, we preliminarily estimate that the excess cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $310 million to $320 million.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around at NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our company in line of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively low risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. We intend to target a consolidated RBC of 325% for 2017 and 2018.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. As Gary noted earlier, during the third quarter, we saw growth in the Direct Response underwriting margin for the first time in several quarters. The margin, as a percent of premium, was 15.6%, up from 15.2% in the year-ago quarter. While higher claims will cause underwriting margin to be lower for the full year 2017 versus 2016, the increase in the quarter was fully in line with our expectations.
On previous calls, we noted that we anticipated the margin for the full year of 2017 to range between 14% to 16%. We still anticipate the margin for the full year to be near the midpoint of this range or 15%. While it's still very early, we currently, estimate the margin percentage for Direct Response will remain in the 14% to 16% range in 2018.
Now with respect to our guidance for 2017 and '18. We are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.77 to $4.83 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $4.80 midpoint of this guidance reflects a 7% increase over 2016. The increase in the midpoint of our guidance is primarily attributable to the continued positive outlook for life underwriting income at American Income, and in our various health insurance businesses. For 2018, we estimate that our net operating income per share will be in the range of $5 per share to $5.25 per share, a 7% increase at the midpoint from 2017.

So if you could give us some insight on what's driving this. And then your 2018 margin guidance is consistent with '17 and I recognize it's a pretty wide range. Do expect to see improvement as you go through 2018? Or should they -- should margins be roughly flat over the next year? And then I had a question on sales, on whether you have seen an impact from the hurricanes, or do you expect an impact on the hurricane -- from the hurricanes especially in Florida, Texas in the fourth quarter on sales?"

They were more closer at the bottom end of that range. And then here, from second half of the year, we're really just -- we are seeing the policy obligation percentage being more at the top end. That is kind of the pattern that we were really expecting to see over the course of the year. And I think, again, it's largely due to some seasonality. As we look into 2018, it could be, especially on a quarterly basis, fluctuating anywhere of that 14% to 16% range, but we really just kind of see it flattening out here for the next year. And as we move forward from that, too early to really see where we go on beyond '18, but probably following somewhat of the same pattern again with a little seasonality in 2018."

Overall, the hurricanes slowed THE sales and recruiting in the 3 exclusive agencies during September. We think recruiting and the sales should return to normal levels during the fourth quarter. Before the hurricane caused United American sales to be lower-than-expected in the third quarter, direct Response sales were not affected by hurricanes during the third quarter, but we think sales will be down about 1% to 2% in the fourth quarter.

In insurance operations -- in the life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $576 million and life underwriting margin was $153 million, up 7% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due primarily to favorable results at American Income, and to a lesser extent, Direct Response. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $243 million, while health underwriting margin was up 5% to $56 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due primarily to favorable claims experience. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3% to 5%.

At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $253 million, and life underwriting margin was up 13% to $83 million. Net life sales were $57 million, up 10%, primarily because we have a higher concentration of veteran agents than a year ago. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 7,165, up 2% from a year ago and up 2% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 6,981.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $69 million, while life underwriting margin was down 6% to $19 million. Net life sales increased 19% to $12 million, while net health sales were $5 million, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth in agent count. 
The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 2,132, up 19% from a year ago and up 6% compared to the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,123. We continue to be encouraged by the positive results at Liberty National.
In our Direct Response operation at Global Life, life premiums were up 4% to $200 million. Although net life sales were down 11% to $31 million, life underwriting margin increased 7% to $31 million. The actions that have been taken that have resulted in reduced sales have increased margins in total dollars.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $64 million, and health underwriting margin increased 11% to $15 million. Health net sales grew 2% to $14 million. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,024, up 4% from a year ago, and down 1% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,030.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 1% to $89 million. Net health sales were $9 million, down 8% compared to the year-ago quarter.
To complete my discussion of the marketing operations, I will now provide some forward-looking information. We expect the producing agent count for each agency to be in the following ranges: At American Income, for the full year 2017, 7,000 to 7,200; for 2018, 7,200 to 7,500. At Liberty National, for the full year 2017, 2,050 to 2,150; for 2018, 2,100 to 2,300. At Family Heritage, for the full year 2017, 1,020 to 1,060; for 2018, 1,090 to 1,150.
Approximate life net sales are expected to be as follows: At American Income, for the full year 2017, 7% growth; for 2018, 6% to 10% growth. At Liberty National, for the full year 2017, 16% growth; for 2018, 10% to 14% growth. In Direct Response, for the full year 2017, 10% decline; for 2018, 2% to 6% decline.
Health net sales are expected to be as follows: At Liberty National, for the full year 2017, flat; for 2018, flat to 3% growth. At Family Heritage, for the full year 2017, 8% growth; for 2018, 4% to 8% growth. At United American individual Medicare supplement, for the full year 2017, flat; for 2018, 3% to 7% growth.

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, let's talk about excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income, less required interest on net policy liabilities and",512,"Thanks, Larry. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, let's talk about excess investment income. 
Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income, less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $61 million, a 7% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 9%. The higher-than-normal increase is due primarily to higher investment income resulting from the decline in the negative impact of the lengthy delays in receiving Part D reimbursements. For the full year of 2017, we expect excess investment income to grow approximately 8% and excess investment income per share to grow around 11%. 
Regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $15.6 billion, including $14.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $14.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $661 million compared to $753 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.4%, down from 5.4% a year ago. The decline is due primarily to upgrades of bonds that were previously classified as below investment grade.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.7x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 16%, down from 20% a year ago. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, just slightly under the A- of a year ago.
Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter, we invested $376 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.43%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 26 years.
For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.64%, down 13 basis points from the 5.77% yield in the third quarter of 2016. As of September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.63%.
The midpoint of our guidance assumes an average new money yield of 4.6% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 4.9% in 2018. 
We are still hoping to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low rate environment will impact our income statement but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $77.34. So far in October, we have used $12 mil",635,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. 
In the third quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $77.34. So far in October, we have used $12 million to purchase 144,000 shares at an average price of $80.91. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $255 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.3 million shares at an average price of $76.65. These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. 
The parent company's excess cash flow as we define it results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect the parent company's excess cash flow in 2017 to be around $325 million. With $255 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have approximately $70 million available for the remainder of the year from our excess cash flow plus other assets available to the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017 absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. For 2018, we preliminarily estimate that the excess cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $310 million to $320 million.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our company in line of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively low risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. We intend to target a consolidated RBC of 325% for 2017 and 2018.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. As Gary noted earlier, during the third quarter, we saw growth in the Direct Response underwriting margin for the first time in several quarters. The margin, as a percent of premium, was 15.6%, up from 15.2% in the year-ago quarter. While higher claims will cause the underwriting margin to be lower for the full year 2017 versus 2016, the increase in the quarter was fully in line with our expectations.
On previous calls, we noted that we anticipated the margin for the full year of 2017 to range between 14% to 16%. We still anticipate the margin for the full year to be near the midpoint of this range or 15%. While it's still very early, we currently estimate the margin percentage for Direct Response will remain in the 14% to 16% range in 2018.
Now with respect to our guidance for 2017 and '18. We are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.77 to $4.83 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $4.80 midpoint of this guidance reflects a 7% increase over 2016. The increase in the midpoint of our guidance is primarily attributable to the continued positive outlook for life underwriting income at American Income, and in our various health insurance businesses. For 2018, we estimate that our net operating income per share will be in the range of $5 per share to $5.25 per share, a 7% increase at the midpoint from 2017.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

They were more closer at the bottom end of that range. And then here, for second half of the year, we're really just -- we are seeing the policy obligation percentage being at more the top end. That is kind of the pattern that we were really expecting to see over the course of the year. And I think, again, it's largely due to some seasonality. As we look into 2018, it could be, especially on a quarterly basis, fluctuating anywhere in that 14% to 16% range, but we really just kind of see it flattening out here for the next year. And as we move forward from that, too early to really see where we go on beyond '18, but probably following somewhat of the same pattern again with a little seasonality in 2018."

Right now, it looks like the 31% is going to hold. But we'll know more when we get to February after we've had another quarter's experience."

In insurance operations -- in the life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $576 million and life underwriting margin was $153 million, up 7% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due primarily to favorable results at American Income, and to a lesser extent, Direct Response. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%.
On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $243 million, while health underwriting margin was up 5% to $56 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due primarily to favorable claims experience. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3% to 5%.

Net life sales increased 19% to $12 million, while net health sales were $5 million, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth in agent count. 
The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 2,132, up 19% from a year ago and up 6% compared to the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,123. We continue to be encouraged by the positive results at Liberty National.
In our Direct Response operation at Global Life, life premiums were up 4% to $200 million. Although net life sales were down 11% to $31 million, life underwriting margin increased 7% to $31 million. The actions that have been taken that have resulted in reduced sales have increased margins in total dollars.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $64 million, and health underwriting margin increased 11% to $15 million. Health net sales grew 2% to $14 million.

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, let's talk about excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income, less required interest on net policy liabilities and",512,"Thanks, Larry. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, let's talk about excess investment income. 
Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income, less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $61 million, a 7% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 9%. The higher-than-normal increase is due primarily to higher investment income resulting from the decline in the negative impact of the lengthy delays in receiving Part D reimbursements. For the full year of 2017, we expect excess investment income to grow approximately 8% and excess investment income per share to grow around 11%. 
Regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $15.6 billion, including $14.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $14.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $661 million compared to $753 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.4%, down from 5.4% a year ago. The decline is due primarily to upgrades of bonds that were previously classified as below investment grade.
With a portfolio leverage of 3.7x, the percentage of below investment-grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 16%, down from 20% a year ago. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, just slightly under the A- of a year ago.
Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter, we invested $376 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.43%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 26 years.
For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.64%, down 13 basis points from the 5.77% yield in the third quarter of 2016. As of September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.63%.
The midpoint of our guidance assumes an average new money yield of 4.6% in the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of 4.9% in 2018. 
We are still hoping to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low rate environment will impact our income statement but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.
While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $77.34. So far in October, we have used $12 mil",635,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. 
In the third quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $77.34. So far in October, we have used $12 million to purchase 144,000 shares at an average price of $80.91. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $255 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.3 million shares at an average price of $76.65. These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. 
The parent company's excess cash flow as we define it results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect the parent company's excess cash flow in 2017 to be around $325 million. With $255 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have approximately $70 million available for the remainder of the year from our excess cash flow plus other assets available to the parent.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017 absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations. For 2018, we preliminarily estimate that the excess cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $310 million to $320 million.
Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our company in line of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively low risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. We intend to target a consolidated RBC of 325% for 2017 and 2018.
Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. As Gary noted earlier, during the third quarter, we saw growth in the Direct Response underwriting margin for the first time in several quarters. The margin, as a percent of premium, was 15.6%, up from 15.2% in the year-ago quarter. While higher claims will cause the underwriting margin to be lower for the full year 2017 versus 2016, the increase in the quarter was fully in line with our expectations.
On previous calls, we noted that we anticipated the margin for the full year of 2017 to range between 14% to 16%. We still anticipate the margin for the full year to be near the midpoint of this range or 15%. While it's still very early, we currently estimate the margin percentage for Direct Response will remain in the 14% to 16% range in 2018.
Now with respect to our guidance for 2017 and '18. We are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.77 to $4.83 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $4.80 midpoint of this guidance reflects a 7% increase over 2016. The increase in the midpoint of our guidance is primarily attributable to the continued positive outlook for life underwriting income at American Income, and in our various health insurance businesses. For 2018, we estimate that our net operating income per share will be in the range of $5 per share to $5.25 per share, a 7% increase at the midpoint from 2017.

That is kind of the pattern that we were really expecting to see over the course of the year. And I think, again, it's largely due to some seasonality. As we look into 2018, it could be, especially on a quarterly basis, fluctuating anywhere in that 14% to 16% range, but we really just kind of see it flattening out here for the next year. And as we move forward from that, too early to really see where we go on beyond '18, but probably following somewhat of the same pattern again with a little seasonality in 2018."

The 2016 statutory earnings had some Part D operations still in them. That has fallen off, and of course, we don't have the Part D income in our 2017 statutory income. The after-tax earnings that we had in '16 with the sale was a little over $20 million, so that's really coming off the books that we're not seeing again. I think looking forward, then we should be at a kind of a low point, if you will, and we should be able to move forward after that, after 2018."

So clearly, we would end up having some reduction in our RBC percentage from that. We've estimated that if the tax rates were to go down from about 35% to 25%, there probably would be an RBC reduction of around 50 basis points. And at this point of time, it's really difficult to determine how the regulators and rating agencies will react to that and what may be an appropriate RBC percentage really should be targeted going forward with that. But at this point in time, we are comfortable that we can fund whatever additional capital might be required either through the issuance of additional debt or the excess cash flow that's necessary. But at this point in time, we would think that we don't see that we would need to -- or at least we're not anticipating that we would need to reduce our use of excess cash flows to fund any shortfall.
