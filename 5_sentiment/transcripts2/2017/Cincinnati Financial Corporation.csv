Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. While our 96.2% fourth quarter combined ratio was higher than we like, weather FX are inherently variable, and",1114,"Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. While our 96.2% fourth quarter combined ratio was higher than we like, weather FX are inherently variable, and we are comfortable with taking a more prudent position on loss reserves for various parts of our business. We find it satisfying that the full year 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved compared to 2015 while we steadily improved our premium growth.
On a calendar year basis, our 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.1 percentage points to 87.3%. On a current accident year basis, our 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.5 percentage points to 90.8%. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain our 2017 combined ratio in the low to mid-90% range, and maintain or slightly improve on the 2016 result before catastrophe effects. We also believe our 2017 property casualty premium growth rate can be within 1 percentage point of 2016.
Our full year 2016 catastrophe loss ratio was 1.6 percentage points, above the average of the previous 10 years. We recognize that weather, the significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report.
While our reserve development on catastrophe losses during the fourth quarter of 2016 was favorable, the quarter was unusual in a sense that we experienced loss effects from significant catastrophe events so late in the year. 
Early in the quarter, we announced a preliminary estimate of Hurricane Matthew losses with the range midpoint at $52.5 million. Our year-end 2016 estimate was $48 million, including $3 million for Cincinnati Re. 
Our fourth quarter results also included $9 million of favorable development in total for 2 large second quarter 2016 events and $4 million for events prior to 2016.
It was great to see another quarter of good overall investment performance. And Mike will be adding comments regarding investment income growth and portfolio valuation gains. As usual, I'll highlight several important areas of our insurance operations. 
Each of our insurance segments experienced another quarter and year of what we consider to be healthy premium growth. Ongoing efforts toward greater pricing precision allow us to underwrite each individual policy with confidence. Property casualty new business written premiums for the fourth quarter of 2016 were down 4% from a year ago, when we reported a strong growth of 15%. We believe it's more meaningful to look at longer time periods. And on a full year basis, new business written premiums were up 4%.
Policy retention rates for commercial and personalized were fairly consistent with the year ago. For commercial lines, our policy retention continued near the high end of the mid-80% range, and for personal lines, we continue in a low to mid-90% range.
Pricing in the fourth quarter was generally in line with the third quarter. Consistent with where loss ratios for us and the industry indicate the most need for higher premium rates, our commercial auto and personal auto policies experienced fourth quarter average renewal price increases that were the highest among our major lines of business. Both had average percentage increases in the mid-single-digit range with personal auto near the high end of that range.
Cincinnati Re continue to grow as planned, and made a nice contribution to property casualty underwriting profit with combined ratios of 84.7% for the fourth quarter and 82.5% for full year 2016. Our seasoned team of reinsurance underwriting and analytics professionals produced $71 million of well-diversified net written premiums in 2016. Nearly half of the 2016 premiums are for property exposures that do include risk of loss from natural catastrophes. The remainder is primarily for casualty exposures from various liability risks.
Our personalized segment continues to be fundamentally made up of middle-market accounts that represent nearly 90% of our personalized premium, with both the homeowner and other personalized book producing a healthy underwriting profit. Our personalized operation also continue to perform as planned, and its expansion of personalized products and services offered to our agencies higher net worth clients. 
In 2016, we improved our high net worth offerings in nearly all of the states where agencies have actively marketed our personal lines products for many years by introducing endorsements which provide agents the option to add coverages similar to our Executive Capstone product suite.
In addition, we successfully launched the full Capstone product to agents in New Jersey, California and Colorado. The reception by California agencies was particularly enthusiastic. They produced $2 million in 2016 premiums written in aggregate for us in just 5 months. We'll continue our steady progress in 2017, bringing the Capstone product to agents in Texas, Massachusetts, Washington State and Washington D.C.
Performance was again quite good for our commercial line segment with full year combined ratio below 95%, and our excess and surplus line segment had another excellent year with a combined ratio below 70%. 
For our life insurance subsidiary, full year 2016 earned premiums grew 9% and net income grew by 17%.
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed all of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our progress treaties and our property catastrophe treaties, terms and conditions as well as rates for 2017 are similar to 2016.
During January, we replaced our existing catastrophe bond program with the new collateralized reinsurance structure providing $200 million of earthquake coverage and $80 million of severe convected storm coverage. The coverage period is for 3 years and expires December 31, 2019. The earthquake coverage applies to all states except California, and the severe convective storm coverage applies to all states except Florida. The storm aggregate coverage provides loss recovery with storm losses for all events in aggregate exceed $190 million after an $8 million deductible prevent.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio, was 14.5% for full year 2016. Contributions included 7.9 percentage points from operating income, 6.8 points from our stock portfolio and negative 0.2 points from our bond portfolio. For 2017 and beyond, we'll continue to diligently manage insurance profitability and drive premium growth. We think our insurance business is in excellent shape, and we remain quite confident that the steady efforts of our outstanding associates working with what we believe are the best independent agencies in the business will continue to produce excellent financial performance that benefit shareholders and all other stakeholders. 
With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments with a few fourth quarter investment highlights. Fourth quarter 2016 was our 14th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 2% on a pretax basis",829,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments with a few fourth quarter investment highlights. 
Fourth quarter 2016 was our 14th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 2% on a pretax basis and bringing full year growth to 4%. That growth continues to reflect an increase in both interest and dividend income. Our equity portfolio experienced 10% growth and unrealized gains and offset about 2/3 of the $314 million decrease in the bond portfolio's pretax unrealized gains. In total, we ended 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.6 billion before taxes, including more than $2.3 billion in our equity portfolio.
The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.52% for the fourth quarter was below the 4.66% from last year's fourth quarter.
During the last half of 2016, we experienced an uptick in dispositions of higher-yielding bonds that were called by issuers, contributing to that decline in average yield. Taxable bonds purchased during 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.11%, 37 basis points lower than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.04%, 30 basis points lower than a year ago. And our bond portfolio's effective duration at December 31 was 5 years, up slightly from 4.9 years at the end of September. Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for full year 2016 rose 4% compared with the year ago and helped generate $442 million of net purchases of securities.
As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses, at the same time, strategically investing in our business. Our full year 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.1 percentage points compared with a year ago.
Now for some comments on reserves for losses and loss expenses. 2016 was our 28th consecutive year of reporting favorable development as we continue our consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For full year 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.7 percentage points, down slightly from full year 2015. Favorable reserve development for full year 2016 occurred in all major lines of businesses except for auto. And by accident year, included 55% for accident year 2015, 24% for accident year 2014, 16% for accident year 2013 and 5% for 2012 and prior accident years. 
Overall, reserves at the end of December, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance ceded rose 8% from last year with IBNR representing more than 60% of that increase.
Various past disclosures described of historical paid loss patterns are a key assumption use to make projections necessary for estimating IBNR reserves. As we reported earlier, paid losses for commercial casualty emerged at levels higher than we previously expected. That included paid losses or reestimates of case reserves for a large 2007 umbrella claim, and a large 2012 general liability claim that in recent months increased in aggregate by over $6 million. Considering updated loss of data, during the fourth quarter, we estimated commercial casualty IBNR reserves for several accident years at levels more likely to be adequate compared with recent quarters. You can see in our financial supplement on Page 17 that we recorded an increase of $56 million in commercial casualty total loss and loss expense reserves during the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in that $56 million was $45 million for IBNR, nearly as much as the $58 million we recorded for the first 9 months of 2016.
Despite those increases in reserves, our full year 2016 loss and loss expense ratio for our commercial casualty line of business was 57.5%, adding an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 31-or-so indicates an estimated commercial casualty combined ratio of under 90%.
Our assessment of the company's capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility is that they remain at healthy levels. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a total of 522,428 shares at an average price per share of $70.13. Capital management objectives continue to support the future profitable growth of our insurance operations plus other areas such as returning capital to shareholders.
I'll conclude my remark with a summary of contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.18. Life insurance operations added $0.09. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.50. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $1.21. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.63. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.29 during the fourth quarter to $42.95 per share.
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

With all major areas of the company performing well, we remain confident that we can deliver long-term shareholder value for years to come.

There's no question about the fact that the persistence of that business is improved when you write everything in together in a package. So we've taken some -- we think some good actions in the auto side, put through some fairly significant rate increases throughout 2016 that are currently earning their way into the book of business. In some cases, double-digit increases. So in terms of private passenger auto, we're feeling pretty good that as 2017 earns in, that, that will improve.

Josh, it's not that price-sensitive in the middle-market personal lines, a huge percentage of the business that gets quoted for us is in comparative raters. And there's a bit of a tendency on the part of the agencies. Though we do get the nod in terms of the quality we bring to them and their policyholders, that tends to be a bit more of a price is the only object kind of circumstance whereas in high net worth, it's more consultative.

I think a lot of carriers tend to put a full-court press on towards the end of the year to meet a goal. We try to resist doing that because we just don't want to ask our people to underprice business to hit a top line target. Last year's fourth quarter was a pretty big tougher comparison. I think as -- and we kind of look at the new business and how it went last year and looking forward, a few -- there are no one thing affected it. The 4% increase was good, I would've like it to be slightly better. We're optimistic about this year the submission rates right now in CSU and in commercial lines are all up, so we're seeing more accounts. We're getting that basket of more accounts, so that's positive because the competition and because of our desire to be more disciplined, our hit ratio's down a little bit but once again, we're pleased with how things are going. CSU, in terms of what they're facing, particularly in some of their larger accounts and keeping in mind that ours is a relatively conservative appetite for E&S business, but our excess and surplus lines company is losing some of the larger accounts to the standard side of the business. And so once it gets quoted on the standard side, we just don't compete with it. Our opinion would be that some of the business is going to the standard side should stay in the E&S side of the business. If we think an account has reached the point where it probably does deserve standard market treatment, then Cincinnati Insurance Company will quote on it, will retain it in our standard side. On the personal line side as far as new growth will be concerned, we did put through some very healthy rate increases in auto in 2016 and in the middle-market segment of our business that had a depressing effect on the new business there. High net worth more than made up for that. We're very, very pleased about how things went last year in terms of the high net worth new business, not only in New York, but as was mentioned earlier, in California, which obviously is a significant state in high net worth, the reception by our agents there was just terrific. We wrote a good bit of new business, even though we really did not have all that many agencies appointed for the 5 months that was referred to earlier. And then a few other things. Last year, we had maybe slightly more turnover than normal in our field underwriting and commercial lines skilled reps that were retiring or moving to different territories that has a slightly disrupting effect. We started the year out this year basically with all territories staffed. And so we think that, that will create a little bit of momentum relative to new business. So as Steve mentioned earlier, and I'm sorry to be so long-winded about this, but we're feeling pretty good right now about the prospects for growing. We will continue to appoint more agencies. We could always appoint more than we do, that's a balance as well but we are confident about our ability to grow the company."

And then people here in headquarters that are reviewing those, that I think was a significant area of improvement for us on the loss control side. We have protocols now that we didn't have 6 years ago-or-so when we really went full board to working on this line of business where policyholders are visited and scored. We provide consultative services to a greater degree than we had in the past. So we've been able to reduce loss cost in workers' comp when natural and medical inflation would've taken it up for others. So we're -- we think we still have a little runway to go in terms of improving all that. We'll expand our matrix in the loss control area to include even more accounts, smaller accounts where we can feel like we can improve the margins there. So it's encouraging. We still view that as a class of business we should be very cautious about. It has the potential for turning pretty sour. So we approach a conservative despite the fact that it's such a profitable line for us, we continued to approach it very conservatively.

So of course, it's hard to say what else would change if corporate rates went down. Do they go to 20%? Do they go to 15%? Where would they go? What happens? But then when you take a look at that, what else might change other than corporate rates because it might not be just the rates. Would the dividends receive deduction remain the same? Would the change or would there be any change in the tax-exempt interest that we currently exclude from income? What would happen to a potential border tax? And what's the effect on issues related to that? So it's probably a little tougher issue than just a reduction in rates and these are just a few items that actually would have a major impact to us when it comes to tax reform. But let's just see if there was a lowering of the overall effective tax rate and nothing else, it would seem that we would have more net income to invest and grow our business. But then we'd also be able to compete on a more level playing field with internationally-based companies since their tax rates are lower currently than ours. So allowing our capital really to compete more on a level playing field with the pouring capital, seems to me to be a good thing. As of now, it's just too early to know, what may change under the new administration. Our industry has experienced many administrations and has adapted over time to remain healthy for our insureds and our shareholders. So right now, I would see we're kind of -- we're waiting to -- let's wait and see what some actual guidance comes out with we're there specifically headed."

On a calendar year basis, our 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.1 percentage points to 87.3%. On a current accident year basis, our 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.5 percentage points to 90.8%. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain our 2017 combined ratio in the low to mid-90% range, and maintain or slightly improve on the 2016 result before catastrophe effects. We also believe our 2017 property casualty premium growth rate can be within 1 percentage point of 2016.
Our full year 2016 catastrophe loss ratio was 1.6 percentage points above the average of the previous 10 years. We recognize that weather, the significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report.
While our reserve development on catastrophe losses during the fourth quarter of 2016 was favorable, the quarter was unusual in the sense that we experienced loss effects from significant catastrophe events so late in the year. 
Early in the quarter, we announced a preliminary estimate of Hurricane Matthew losses with the range midpoint at $52.5 million. Our year-end 2016 estimate was $48 million, including $3 million for Cincinnati Re. 
Our fourth quarter results also included $9 million of favorable development in total for 2 large second quarter 2016 events and $4 million for events prior to 2016.
It was great to see another quarter of good overall investment performance. And Mike will be adding comments regarding investment income growth and portfolio valuation gains. As usual, I'll highlight several important areas of our insurance operations. 
Each of our insurance segments experienced another quarter and year of what we consider to be healthy premium growth. Ongoing efforts toward greater pricing precision allow us to underwrite each individual policy with confidence. Property casualty new business written premiums for the fourth quarter of 2016 were down 4% from a year ago, when we reported a strong growth of 15%. We believe it's more meaningful to look at longer time periods. And on a full year basis, new business written premiums were up 4%.
Policy retention rates for commercial and personalized were fairly consistent with the year ago. For commercial lines, our policy retention continued near the high end of the mid-80% range, and for personal lines, it continued in a low to mid-90% range.
Pricing in the fourth quarter was generally in line with the third quarter. Consistent with where loss ratios for us and the industry indicate the most need for higher premium rates, our commercial auto and personal auto policies experienced fourth quarter average renewal price increases that were the highest among our major lines of business. Both had average percentage increases in the mid-single-digit range, with personal auto near the high end of that range.
Cincinnati Re continue to grow as planned and made a nice contribution to property casualty underwriting profit, with combined ratios of 84.7% for the fourth quarter and 82.5% for full year 2016. Our seasoned team of reinsurance underwriting and analytics professionals produced $71 million of well-diversified net written premiums in 2016. Nearly half of the 2016 premiums are for property exposures that do include risk of loss from natural catastrophes. The remainder is primarily for casualty exposures from various liability risks.
Our personal lines segment continues to be fundamentally made up of middle-market accounts that represent nearly 90% of our personal lines premium, with both the homeowner and other personal lines book producing a healthy underwriting profit. Our personal lines operation also continued to perform as planned, and its expansion of personal lines products and services offered to our agencies higher net worth clients.
In 2016, we improved our high net worth offerings in nearly all of the states where agencies have actively marketed our personal lines products for many years by introducing endorsements which provide agents the option to add coverages similar to our Executive Capstone product suite.
In addition, we successfully launched the full Capstone product to agents in New Jersey, California and Colorado. The reception by California agencies was particularly enthusiastic. They produced $2 million in 2016 premiums written in aggregate for us in just 5 months. We'll continue our steady progress in 2017, bringing the Capstone product to agents in Texas, Massachusetts, Washington State and Washington D.C.
Performance was again quite good for our commercial lines segment, with full year combined ratio below 95%, and our excess and surplus line segment had another excellent year with a combined ratio below 70%. 
For our life insurance subsidiary, full year 2016 earned premiums grew 9%, and net income grew by 17%.
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed all of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions as well as rates for 2017 are similar to 2016.
During January, we replaced our existing catastrophe bond program with the new collateralized reinsurance structure providing $200 million of earthquake coverage and $80 million of severe convected storm coverage. The coverage period is for 3 years and expires December 31, 2019. The earthquake coverage applies to all states except California, and the severe convective storm coverage applies to all states except Florida. The storm aggregate coverage provides loss recovery when storm losses for all events in aggregate exceed $190 million after an $8 million deductible per event.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio, was 14.5% for full year 2016. Contributions included 7.9 percentage points from operating income, 6.8 points from our stock portfolio and negative 0.2 points from our bond portfolio. For 2017 and beyond, we'll continue to diligently manage insurance profitability and drive premium growth. We think our insurance business is in excellent shape, and we remain quite confident that the steady efforts of our outstanding associates working with what we believe are the best independent agencies in the business will continue to produce excellent financial performance to benefit shareholders and all other stakeholders. 
With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments with a few fourth quarter investment highlights. Fourth quarter 2016 was our 14th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 2% on a pretax basis",831,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments with a few fourth quarter investment highlights. 
Fourth quarter 2016 was our 14th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 2% on a pretax basis and bringing full year growth to 4%. That growth continues to reflect an increase in both interest and dividend income. Our equity portfolio experienced 10% growth in unrealized gains and offset about 2/3 of the $314 million decrease in the bond portfolio's pretax unrealized gains. In total, we ended 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.6 billion before taxes, including more than $2.3 billion in our equity portfolio.
The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.52% for the fourth quarter was below the 4.66% from last year's fourth quarter.
During the last half of 2016, we experienced an uptick in dispositions of higher-yielding bonds that were called by issuers, contributing to that decline in average yield. Taxable bonds purchased during 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.11%, 37 basis points lower than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.04%, 30 basis points lower than a year ago. And our bond portfolio's effective duration at December 31 was 5 years, up slightly from 4.9 years at the end of September. Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for full year 2016 rose 4% compared with a year ago and helped generate $442 million of net purchases of securities.
As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses, at the same time, strategically investing in our business. Our full year 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.1 percentage points compared with a year ago.
Now for some comments on reserves for losses and loss expenses. 2016 was our 28th consecutive year of reporting favorable development as we continue our consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For full year 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.7 percentage points, down slightly from full year 2015. Favorable reserve development for full year 2016 occurred in all major lines of businesses except for auto and, by accident year, included 55% for accident year 2015, 24% for accident year 2014, 16% for accident year 2013 and 5% for 2012 and prior accident years. 
Overall, reserves at the end of December, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance ceded rose 8% from last year, with IBNR representing more than 60% of that increase.
Various past disclosures described how historical paid loss patterns are a key assumption used to make projections necessary for estimating IBNR reserves. As we reported earlier, paid losses for commercial casualty emerged at levels higher than we previously expected. That included paid losses or reestimates of case reserves for a large 2007 umbrella claim and a large 2012 general liability claim that in recent months increased in aggregate by over $6 million. Considering updated loss of data, during the fourth quarter, we estimated commercial casualty IBNR reserves for several accident years at levels more likely to be adequate compared with recent quarters. You can see in our financial supplement on Page 17 that we recorded an increase of $56 million in commercial casualty total loss and loss expense reserves during the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in that $56 million was $45 million for IBNR, nearly as much as the $58 million we recorded for the first 9 months of 2016.
Despite those increases in reserves, our full year 2016 loss and loss expense ratio for our commercial casualty line of business was 57.5%. Adding an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 31% or so indicates an estimated commercial casualty combined ratio of under 90%.
Our assessment of the company's capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility is that they remain at healthy levels. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a total of 522,428 shares at an average price per share of $70.13. Capital management objectives continue to support the future profitable growth of our insurance operations plus other areas, such as returning capital to shareholders.
I'll conclude my remarks with a summary of contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.18. Life insurance operations added $0.09. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.50. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $1.21. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.63. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.29 during the fourth quarter to $42.95 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

But we've always been a package-writing company throughout our history, and policyholders and agents alike would prefer that it all be part of a package. There's no question about the fact that the persistence of that business is improved when you write everything together in a package. So we've taken some, we think, some good actions in the auto side, put through some fairly significant rate increases throughout 2016 that are currently earning their way into the book of business, in some cases, double-digit increases. So in terms of private passenger auto, we're feeling pretty good that as 2017 earns in, that, that will improve. But it's a pretty unusual circumstance that we're submitted an account that doesn't include the entire package."

Josh, it's just not that price-sensitive. In the middle-market personal lines, a huge percentage of the business that gets quoted for us is in comparative raters. And there's a bit of a tendency on the part of the agencies. Though we do get the knot [ph] in terms of the quality we bring to them and their policyholders, that tends to be a bit more of a ""price is the only object"" kind of a circumstance, whereas in high net worth, it's more consultative.

I think a lot of carriers tend to put a full-court press on towards the end of the year to meet a goal. We try to resist doing that, because we just don't want to ask our people to underprice business to hit a top line target. Last year's fourth quarter was a pretty big, tougher comparison. I think as we kind of look at the new business and how it went last year and looking forward, a few -- there -- no one thing affected it. The 4% increase was good, I would've like it to have been slightly better. We're optimistic about this year. The submission rates right now in CSU and in commercial lines are all up, so we're seeing more accounts. We're getting at-bats at more accounts. So that's positive. Because of the competition and because of our desire to be more disciplined, our hit ratio is down a little bit. But once again, we're pleased with how things are going. CSU, in terms of what they're facing, particularly on some of their larger accounts, and keeping in mind that ours is a relatively conservative appetite for E&S business. But our excess and surplus lines company is losing some of the larger accounts to the standard side of the business. And so once it gets quoted on the standard side, there's -- we just -- we don't compete with it. Our opinion would be that some of the business that's going to the standard side should stay in the E&S side of the business. If we think an account has reached a point where it probably does deserve standard market treatment, then Cincinnati Insurance Company will quote on it. We'll retain it in our standard side. On the personal lines side, as far as new growth would be concerned, we did put through some very healthy rate increases in auto in 2016. And in the middle-market segment of our business that had a depressing effect on the new business there. High net worth more than made up for that. We're very, very pleased about how things went last year in terms of high net worth new business, not only in New York, but as was mentioned earlier, in California, which, obviously, is a significant state in high net worth. The reception by our agents there was just terrific. We wrote a good bit of new business, even though we really did not have all that many agencies appointed for the 5 months that was referred to earlier. So -- and then a few other things. Last year, we had maybe slightly more turnover than normal in our field underwriting and commercial lines, field reps that were retiring or moving to different territories. That has a slightly disrupting effect. We started the year out this year basically with all territories staffed. And so we think that, that will create a little bit of momentum relative to new business. So as Steve mentioned earlier, and sorry to be so long-winded about this, we're feeling pretty good right now about the prospects for growing. We'll continue to appoint more agencies. We could always appoint more than we do. That's a balance as well, but we're confident about our ability to grow the company."

We put together a tremendous amount of specialization in workers comp and claims handling, both in the form of specialists out in the field and then people here in headquarters that are reviewing bills. That, I think, was a significant area of improvement for us. On the loss control side, we have protocols now that we didn't have 6 years ago or so when we really went full board to working on this line of business, where policyholders are visited and scored. We provide consultative services to a greater degree than we had in the past. So we've been able to reduce loss cost in workers' comp when natural and medical inflation would've taken it up for others. So we're -- we think we still have a little runway to go in terms of improving all that. We'll expand our matrix in the loss control area to include even more accounts, smaller accounts, where we can feel like we can improve the margins there. So it's encouraging. We still view that as a class of business you have to be very cautious about. It has the potential for turning pretty sour. So we approach it -- despite the fact that it's such a profitable line for us, we continued to approach it very conservatively. We do not write monoline workers' comp.

So of course, it's hard to say what else would change if corporate rates went down. Do they go to 20%? Do they go to 15%? Where do they go? What happens? But then when you take a look at that, what else might change, other than corporate rates? Because it may not just be the rates. Would the dividends received deduction remain the same? Would the change -- or would there be any change in the tax-exempt interest that we currently exclude from income? What would happen to a potential border tax? And what's the effect on issues related to that? So it's probably a little tougher issue than just a reduction in rates, and these are just a few items that actually would have a major impact to us when it comes to tax reform. But let's just say if there was a lowering of the overall effective tax rate and nothing else, it would seem that we would have more net income to invest and grow our business. But then we'd also be able to compete on a more level playing field with internationally based companies, since their tax rates are lower currently than ours. So allowing our capital really to compete more on a level playing field with the foreign capital, it seems to me to be a good thing. As of now, it's just too early to know what may change under the new administration. Our industry has experienced many administrations and has adapted over time to remain healthy for our insureds and our shareholders.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. While our 96.2% fourth quarter combined ratio was higher than we like, weather effects are inherently variable,",1122,"Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. While our 96.2% fourth quarter combined ratio was higher than we like, weather effects are inherently variable, and we are comfortable with taking a more prudent position on loss reserves for various parts of our business. We find it satisfying that the full year 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved compared to 2015 while we steadily improved our premium growth.
On a calendar year basis, our 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.1 percentage points to 87.3%. On a current accident year basis, our 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.5 percentage points to 90.8%. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain our 2017 combined ratio in the low to mid-90% range, and maintain or slightly improve on the 2016 result before catastrophe effects. We also believe our 2017 property casualty premium growth rate can be within 1 percentage point of 2016.
Our full year 2016 catastrophe loss ratio was 1.6 percentage points above the average of the previous 10 years. We recognize that weather, the significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report.
While our reserve development on catastrophe losses during the fourth quarter of 2016 was favorable, the quarter was unusual in the sense that we experienced loss effects from significant catastrophe events so late in the year. 
Early in the quarter, we announced a preliminary estimate of Hurricane Matthew losses with the range midpoint at $52.5 million. Our year-end 2016 estimate was $48 million, including $3 million for Cincinnati Re. 
Our fourth quarter results also included $9 million of favorable development in total for 2 large second quarter 2016 events and $4 million for events prior to 2016.
It was great to see another quarter of good overall investment performance. And Mike will be adding comments regarding investment income growth and portfolio valuation gains. As usual, I'll highlight several important areas of our insurance operations. 
Each of our insurance segments experienced another quarter and year of what we consider to be healthy premium growth. Ongoing efforts toward greater pricing precision allow us to underwrite each individual policy with confidence. Property casualty new business written premiums for the fourth quarter of 2016 were down 4% from a year ago, when we reported a strong growth of 15%. We believe it's more meaningful to look at longer time periods. And on a full year basis, new business written premiums were up 4%.
Policy retention rates for commercial and personal  lines were fairly consistent with a year ago. For commercial lines, our policy retention continued near the high end of the mid-80% range, and for personal lines, it continued in a low to mid-90% range.
Pricing in the fourth quarter was generally in line with the third quarter. Consistent with where loss ratios for us and the industry indicate the most need for higher premium rates, our commercial auto and personal auto policies experienced fourth quarter average renewal price increases that were the highest among our major lines of business. Both had average percentage increases in the mid-single-digit range, with personal auto near the high end of that range.
Cincinnati Re continue to grow as planned and made a nice contribution to property casualty underwriting profit, with combined ratios of 84.7% for the fourth quarter and 82.5% for full year 2016. Our seasoned team of reinsurance underwriting and analytics professionals produced $71 million of well-diversified net written premiums in 2016. Nearly half of the 2016 premiums are for property exposures that do include risk of loss from natural catastrophes. The remainder is primarily for casualty exposures from various liability risks.
Our personal lines segment continues to be fundamentally made up of middle-market accounts that represent nearly 90% of our personal lines premium, with both the homeowner and other personal lines book producing a healthy underwriting profit. Our personal lines operation also continued to perform as planned in its expansion of personal lines products and services offered to our agencies higher net worth clients.
In 2016, we improved our high net worth offerings in nearly all of the states where agencies have actively marketed our personal lines products for many years by introducing endorsements which provide agents the option to add coverages similar to our Executive Capstone product suite.
In addition, we successfully launched the full Capstone product to agents in New Jersey, California and Colorado. The reception by California agencies was particularly enthusiastic. They produced $2 million in 2016 premiums written in aggregate for us in just 5 months. We'll continue our steady progress in 2017, bringing the Capstone product to agents in Texas, Massachusetts, Washington State and Washington D.C.
Performance was again quite good for our commercial lines segment, with full year combined ratio below 95%, and our excess and surplus line segment had another excellent year with a combined ratio below 70%. 
For our life insurance subsidiary, full year 2016 earned premiums grew 9%, and net income grew by 17%.
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed all of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions as well as rates for 2017 are similar to 2016.
During January, we replaced our existing catastrophe bond program with the new collateralized reinsurance structure providing $200 million of earthquake coverage and $80 million of severe convected storm coverage. The coverage period is for 3 years and expires December 31, 2019. The earthquake coverage applies to all states except California, and the severe convective storm coverage applies to all states except Florida. The storm aggregate coverage provides loss recovery when storm losses for all events in aggregate exceed $190 million after an $8 million deductible per event.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio, was 14.5% for full year 2016. Contributions included 7.9 percentage points from operating income, 6.8 points from our stock portfolio and negative 0.2 points from our bond portfolio. For 2017 and beyond, we'll continue to diligently manage insurance profitability and drive premium growth. We think our insurance business is in excellent shape, and we remain quite confident that the steady efforts of our outstanding associates working with what we believe are the best independent agencies in the business will continue to produce excellent financial performance to benefit shareholders and all other stakeholders. 
With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments with a few fourth quarter investment highlights. Fourth quarter 2016 was our 14th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 2% on a pretax basis",831,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments with a few fourth quarter investment highlights. 
Fourth quarter 2016 was our 14th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 2% on a pretax basis and bringing full year growth to 4%. That growth continues to reflect an increase in both interest and dividend income. Our equity portfolio experienced 10% growth in unrealized gains and offset about 2/3 of the $314 million decrease in the bond portfolio's pretax unrealized gains. In total, we ended 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.6 billion before taxes, including more than $2.3 billion in our equity portfolio.
The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.52% for the fourth quarter was below the 4.66% from last year's fourth quarter.
During the last half of 2016, we experienced an uptick in dispositions of higher-yielding bonds that were called by issuers, contributing to that decline in average yield. Taxable bonds purchased during 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.11%, 37 basis points lower than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.04%, 30 basis points lower than a year ago. And our bond portfolio's effective duration at December 31 was 5 years, up slightly from 4.9 years at the end of September. Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for full year 2016 rose 4% compared with a year ago and helped generate $442 million of net purchases of securities.
As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses, at the same time, strategically investing in our business. Our full year 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.1 percentage points compared with a year ago.
Now for some comments on reserves for losses and loss expenses. 2016 was our 28th consecutive year of reporting favorable development as we continue our consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For full year 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.7 percentage points, down slightly from full year 2015. Favorable reserve development for full year 2016 occurred in all major lines of businesses except for auto and, by accident year, included 55% for accident year 2015, 24% for accident year 2014, 16% for accident year 2013 and 5% for 2012 and prior accident years. 
Overall, reserves at the end of December, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance ceded rose 8% from last year, with IBNR representing more than 60% of that increase.
Various past disclosures described how historical paid loss patterns are a key assumption use to make projections necessary for estimating IBNR reserves. As we reported earlier, paid losses for commercial casualty emerged at levels higher than we previously expected. That included paid losses or reestimates of case reserves for a large 2007 umbrella claim and a large 2012 general liability claim that in recent months increased in aggregate by over $6 million. Considering updated loss of data, during the fourth quarter, we estimated commercial casualty IBNR reserves for several accident years at levels more likely to be adequate compared with recent quarters. You can see in our financial supplement on Page 17 that we recorded an increase of $56 million in commercial casualty total loss and loss expense reserves during the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in that $56 million was $45 million for IBNR, nearly as much as the $58 million we recorded for the first 9 months of 2016.
Despite those increases in reserves, our full year 2016 loss and loss expense ratio for our commercial casualty line of business was 57.5%. Adding an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 31% or so indicates an estimated commercial casualty combined ratio of under 90%.
Our assessment of the company's capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility is that they remain at healthy levels. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a total of 522,428 shares at an average price per share of $70.13. Capital management objectives continue to support the future profitable growth of our insurance operations plus other areas, such as returning capital to shareholders.
I'll conclude my remarks with a summary of contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.18. Life insurance operations added $0.09. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.50. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $1.21. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.63. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.29 during the fourth quarter to $42.95 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

During the fourth quarter, we also received affirmation of our financial strength ratings from both A.M. Best company and Fitch Ratings services. With all major areas of the company performing well, we remain confident that we can deliver long-term shareholder value for years to come. The Board of Directors demonstrated that they share that confidence by recently increasing the quarterly cash dividend to $0.50 per share, setting the stage for 57 consecutive years of shareholder dividend increases by your company.

That would be one of them, how it is doing in relationship to the profit on earned premium. We're also looking at investments, the balance sheet, the economy, our forecast to future. As we look back to the financial crisis when there were a lot of companies cutting their dividend or not raising their dividend for sure, at that point, we felt comfortable to continue to increase the dividend because of what we saw in terms of our forecast and our estimates of where we were going in the future. And so I think it's hard to describe the discussion that goes on about our capital management as a ratio for 1 particular item.

I think a lot of carriers tend to put a full-court press on towards the end of the year to meet a goal. We try to resist doing that, because we just don't want to ask our people to underprice business to hit a top line target. Last year's fourth quarter was a pretty big -- a tougher comparison. I think as we kind of look at the new business and how it went last year and looking forward, a few -- there -- no one thing affected it. The 4% increase was good, I would've like it to have been slightly better. We're optimistic about this year. The submission rates right now in CSU and in commercial lines are all up, so we're seeing more accounts. We're getting at-bats at more accounts. So that's positive. Because of the competition and because of our desire to be more disciplined, our hit ratio is down a little bit. But once again, we're pleased with how things are going. CSU, in terms of what they're facing, particularly on some of their larger accounts, and keeping in mind that ours is a relatively conservative appetite for E&S business. But our excess and surplus lines company is losing some of the larger accounts to the standard side of the business. And so once it gets quoted on the standard side, there's -- we just -- we don't compete with it. Our opinion would be that some of the business that's going to the standard side should stay in the E&S side of the business. If we think an account has reached a point where it probably does deserve standard market treatment, then Cincinnati Insurance Company will quote on it. We'll retain it in our standard side. On the personal lines side, as far as new growth would be concerned, we did put through some very healthy rate increases in auto in 2016. And in the middle-market segment of our business that had a depressing effect on the new business there. High net worth more than made up for that. We're very, very pleased about how things went last year in terms of high net worth new business, not only in New York, but as was mentioned earlier, in California, which, obviously, is a significant state in high net worth. The reception by our agents there was just terrific. We wrote a good bit of new business, even though we really did not have all that many agencies appointed for the 5 months that was referred to earlier. So -- and then a few other things. Last year, we had maybe slightly more turnover than normal in our field underwriting and commercial lines, field reps that were retiring or moving to different territories. That has a slightly disrupting effect. We started the year out this year basically with all territories staffed. And so we think that, that will create a little bit of momentum relative to new business. So as Steve mentioned earlier, and sorry to be so long-winded about this, we're feeling pretty good right now about the prospects for growing. We'll continue to appoint more agencies. We could always appoint more than we do. That's a balance as well, but we're confident about our ability to grow the company."

We put together a tremendous amount of specialization in workers comp and claims handling, both in the form of specialists out in the field and then people here in headquarters that are reviewing bills. That, I think, was a significant area of improvement for us. On the loss control side, we have protocols now that we didn't have 6 years ago or so when we really went full board to working on this line of business, where policyholders are visited and scored. We provide consultative services to a greater degree than we had in the past. So we've been able to reduce loss cost in workers' comp when natural and medical inflation would've taken it up for others. So we're -- we think we still have a little runway to go in terms of improving all that. We'll expand our matrix in the loss control area to include even more accounts, smaller accounts, where we can feel like we can improve the margins there. So it's encouraging. We still view that as a class of business you have to be very cautious about. It has the potential for turning pretty sour. So we approach it -- despite the fact that it's such a profitable line for us, we continued to approach it very conservatively. We do not write monoline workers' comp. Not unlike the question a little earlier about package business in personal lines, we don't write the comp unless we're writing the package in the umbrella and the auto."

So of course, it's hard to say what else would change if corporate rates went down. Do they go to 20%? Do they go to 15%? Where do they go? What happens? But then when you take a look at that, what else might change, other than corporate rates? Because it may not just be the rates. Would the dividends received deduction remain the same? Would the change -- or would there be any change in the tax-exempt interest that we currently exclude from income? What would happen to a potential border tax? And what's the effect on issues related to that? So it's probably a little tougher issue than just a reduction in rates, and these are just a few items that actually would have a major impact to us when it comes to tax reform. But let's just say if there was a lowering of the overall effective tax rate and nothing else, it would seem that we would have more net income to invest and grow our business. But then we'd also be able to compete on a more level playing field with internationally based companies, since their tax rates are lower currently than ours. So allowing our capital really to compete more on a level playing field with the foreign capital, it seems to me to be a good thing. As of now, it's just too early to know what may change under the new administration. Our industry has experienced many administrations and has adapted over time to remain healthy for our insureds and our shareholders.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. While our 96.2% fourth quarter combined ratio was higher than we like, weather effects are inherently variable,",1122,"Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. While our 96.2% fourth quarter combined ratio was higher than we like, weather effects are inherently variable, and we are comfortable with taking a more prudent position on loss reserves for various parts of our business. We find it satisfying that the full year 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved compared to 2015 while we steadily improved our premium growth.
On a calendar year basis, our 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.1 percentage points to 87.3%. On a current accident year basis, our 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.5 percentage points to 90.8%. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain our 2017 combined ratio in the low to mid-90% range, and maintain or slightly improve on the 2016 result before catastrophe effects. We also believe our 2017 property casualty premium growth rate can be within 1 percentage point of 2016.
Our full year 2016 catastrophe loss ratio was 1.6 percentage points above the average of the previous 10 years. We recognize that weather, the significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report.
While our reserve development on catastrophe losses during the fourth quarter of 2016 was favorable, the quarter was unusual in the sense that we experienced loss effects from significant catastrophe events so late in the year. 
Early in the quarter, we announced a preliminary estimate of Hurricane Matthew losses with the range midpoint at $52.5 million. Our year-end 2016 estimate was $48 million, including $3 million for Cincinnati Re. 
Our fourth quarter results also included $9 million of favorable development in total for 2 large second quarter 2016 events and $4 million for events prior to 2016.
It was great to see another quarter of good overall investment performance. And Mike will be adding comments regarding investment income growth and portfolio valuation gains. As usual, I'll highlight several important areas of our insurance operations. 
Each of our insurance segments experienced another quarter and year of what we consider to be healthy premium growth. Ongoing efforts toward greater pricing precision allow us to underwrite each individual policy with confidence. Property casualty new business written premiums for the fourth quarter of 2016 were down 4% from a year ago, when we reported a strong growth of 15%. We believe it's more meaningful to look at longer time periods. And on a full year basis, new business written premiums were up 4%.
Policy retention rates for commercial and personal  lines were fairly consistent with a year ago. For commercial lines, our policy retention continued near the high end of the mid-80% range, and for personal lines, it continued in a low to mid-90% range.
Pricing in the fourth quarter was generally in line with the third quarter. Consistent with where loss ratios for us and the industry indicate the most need for higher premium rates, our commercial auto and personal auto policies experienced fourth quarter average renewal price increases that were the highest among our major lines of business. Both had average percentage increases in the mid-single-digit range, with personal auto near the high end of that range.
Cincinnati Re continue to grow as planned and made a nice contribution to property casualty underwriting profit, with combined ratios of 84.7% for the fourth quarter and 82.5% for full year 2016. Our seasoned team of reinsurance underwriting and analytics professionals produced $71 million of well-diversified net written premiums in 2016. Nearly half of the 2016 premiums are for property exposures that do include risk of loss from natural catastrophes. The remainder is primarily for casualty exposures from various liability risks.
Our personal lines segment continues to be fundamentally made up of middle-market accounts that represent nearly 90% of our personal lines premium, with both the homeowner and other personal lines book producing a healthy underwriting profit. Our personal lines operation also continued to perform as planned in its expansion of personal lines products and services offered to our agencies higher net worth clients.
In 2016, we improved our high net worth offerings in nearly all of the states where agencies have actively marketed our personal lines products for many years by introducing endorsements which provide agents the option to add coverages similar to our Executive Capstone product suite.
In addition, we successfully launched the full Capstone product to agents in New Jersey, California and Colorado. The reception by California agencies was particularly enthusiastic. They produced $2 million in 2016 premiums written in aggregate for us in just 5 months. We'll continue our steady progress in 2017, bringing the Capstone product to agents in Texas, Massachusetts, Washington State and Washington D.C.
Performance was again quite good for our commercial lines segment, with full year combined ratio below 95%, and our excess and surplus line segment had another excellent year with a combined ratio below 70%. 
For our life insurance subsidiary, full year 2016 earned premiums grew 9%, and net income grew by 17%.
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed all of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions as well as rates for 2017 are similar to 2016.
During January, we replaced our existing catastrophe bond program with the new collateralized reinsurance structure providing $200 million of earthquake coverage and $80 million of severe convected storm coverage. The coverage period is for 3 years and expires December 31, 2019. The earthquake coverage applies to all states except California, and the severe convective storm coverage applies to all states except Florida. The storm aggregate coverage provides loss recovery when storm losses for all events in aggregate exceed $190 million after an $8 million deductible per event.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio, was 14.5% for full year 2016. Contributions included 7.9 percentage points from operating income, 6.8 points from our stock portfolio and negative 0.2 points from our bond portfolio. For 2017 and beyond, we'll continue to diligently manage insurance profitability and drive premium growth. We think our insurance business is in excellent shape, and we remain quite confident that the steady efforts of our outstanding associates working with what we believe are the best independent agencies in the business will continue to produce excellent financial performance to benefit shareholders and all other stakeholders. 
With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments with a few fourth quarter investment highlights. Fourth quarter 2016 was our 14th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 2% on a pretax basis",831,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments with a few fourth quarter investment highlights. 
Fourth quarter 2016 was our 14th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 2% on a pretax basis and bringing full year growth to 4%. That growth continues to reflect an increase in both interest and dividend income. Our equity portfolio experienced 10% growth in unrealized gains and offset about 2/3 of the $314 million decrease in the bond portfolio's pretax unrealized gains. In total, we ended 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.6 billion before taxes, including more than $2.3 billion in our equity portfolio.
The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.52% for the fourth quarter was below the 4.66% from last year's fourth quarter.
During the last half of 2016, we experienced an uptick in dispositions of higher-yielding bonds that were called by issuers, contributing to that decline in average yield. Taxable bonds purchased during 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.11%, 37 basis points lower than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.04%, 30 basis points lower than a year ago. And our bond portfolio's effective duration at December 31 was 5 years, up slightly from 4.9 years at the end of September. Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for full year 2016 rose 4% compared with a year ago and helped generate $442 million of net purchases of securities.
As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses, at the same time, strategically investing in our business. Our full year 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.1 percentage points compared with a year ago.
Now for some comments on reserves for losses and loss expenses. 2016 was our 28th consecutive year of reporting favorable development as we continue our consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For full year 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.7 percentage points, down slightly from full year 2015. Favorable reserve development for full year 2016 occurred in all major lines of businesses except for auto and, by accident year, included 55% for accident year 2015, 24% for accident year 2014, 16% for accident year 2013 and 5% for 2012 and prior accident years. 
Overall, reserves at the end of December, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance ceded rose 8% from last year, with IBNR representing more than 60% of that increase.
Various past disclosures described how historical paid loss patterns are a key assumption use to make projections necessary for estimating IBNR reserves. As we reported earlier, paid losses for commercial casualty emerged at levels higher than we previously expected. That included paid losses or reestimates of case reserves for a large 2007 umbrella claim and a large 2012 general liability claim that in recent months increased in aggregate by over $6 million. Considering updated loss of data, during the fourth quarter, we estimated commercial casualty IBNR reserves for several accident years at levels more likely to be adequate compared with recent quarters. You can see in our financial supplement on Page 17 that we recorded an increase of $56 million in commercial casualty total loss and loss expense reserves during the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in that $56 million was $45 million for IBNR, nearly as much as the $58 million we recorded for the first 9 months of 2016.
Despite those increases in reserves, our full year 2016 loss and loss expense ratio for our commercial casualty line of business was 57.5%. Adding an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 31% or so indicates an estimated commercial casualty combined ratio of under 90%.
Our assessment of the company's capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility is that they remain at healthy levels. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a total of 522,428 shares at an average price per share of $70.13. Capital management objectives continue to support the future profitable growth of our insurance operations plus other areas, such as returning capital to shareholders.
I'll conclude my remarks with a summary of contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.18. Life insurance operations added $0.09. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.50. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $1.21. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.63. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.29 during the fourth quarter to $42.95 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

During the fourth quarter, we also received affirmation of our financial strength ratings from both A.M. Best company and Fitch Ratings services. With all major areas of the company performing well, we remain confident that we can deliver long-term shareholder value for years to come. The Board of Directors demonstrated that they share that confidence by recently increasing the quarterly cash dividend to $0.50 per share, setting the stage for 57 consecutive years of shareholder dividend increases by your company.
We appreciate this opportunity to respond to you questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year.

Is it something that we should just ignore?

We",568,"Scott, I think throughout the year, competition has ratcheted up somewhat, so fourth quarter would've been, I would say, slightly more competitive. I think a lot of carriers tend to put a full-court press on towards the end of the year to meet a goal. We try to resist doing that, because we just don't want to ask our people to underprice business to hit a top line target. Last year's fourth quarter was a pretty big -- a tougher comparison. I think as we kind of look at the new business and how it went last year and looking forward, a few -- there -- no one thing affected it. The 4% increase was good, I would've like it to have been slightly better. We're optimistic about this year. The submission rates right now in CSU and in commercial lines are all up, so we're seeing more accounts. We're getting at-bats at more accounts. So that's positive. Because of the competition and because of our desire to be more disciplined, our hit ratio is down a little bit. But once again, we're pleased with how things are going. CSU, in terms of what they're facing, particularly on some of their larger accounts, and keeping in mind that ours is a relatively conservative appetite for E&S business. But our excess and surplus lines company is losing some of the larger accounts to the standard side of the business. And so once it gets quoted on the standard side, there's -- we just -- we don't compete with it. Our opinion would be that some of the business that's going to the standard side should stay in the E&S side of the business. If we think an account has reached a point where it probably does deserve standard market treatment, then Cincinnati Insurance Company will quote on it. We'll retain it in our standard side. On the personal lines side, as far as new growth would be concerned, we did put through some very healthy rate increases in auto in 2016. And in the middle-market segment of our business that had a depressing effect on the new business there. High net worth more than made up for that. We're very, very pleased about how things went last year in terms of high net worth new business, not only in New York, but as was mentioned earlier, in California, which, obviously, is a significant state in high net worth. The reception by our agents there was just terrific. We wrote a good bit of new business, even though we really did not have all that many agencies appointed for the 5 months that was referred to earlier. So -- and then a few other things. Last year, we had maybe slightly more turnover than normal in our field underwriting and commercial lines, field reps that were retiring or moving to different territories. That has a slightly disrupting effect. We started the year out this year basically with all territories staffed. And so we think that, that will create a little bit of momentum relative to new business. So as Steve mentioned earlier, and sorry to be so long-winded about this, we're feeling pretty good right now about the prospects for growing. We'll continue to appoint more agencies. We could always appoint more than we do. That's a balance as well, but we're confident about our ability to grow the company."

We put together a tremendous amount of specialization in workers comp and claims handling, both in the form of specialists out in the field and then people here in headquarters that are reviewing bills. That, I think, was a significant area of improvement for us. On the loss control side, we have protocols now that we didn't have 6 years ago or so when we really went full board to working on this line of business, where policyholders are visited and scored. We provide consultative services to a greater degree than we had in the past. So we've been able to reduce loss cost in workers' comp when natural and medical inflation would've taken it up for others. So we're -- we think we still have a little runway to go in terms of improving all that. We'll expand our matrix in the loss control area to include even more accounts, smaller accounts, where we can feel like we can improve the margins there. So it's encouraging. We still view that as a class of business you have to be very cautious about. It has the potential for turning pretty sour. So we approach it -- despite the fact that it's such a profitable line for us, we continued to approach it very conservatively. We do not write monoline workers' comp. Not unlike the question a little earlier about package business in personal lines, we don't write the comp unless we're writing the package in the umbrella and the auto."

So of course, it's hard to say what else would change if corporate rates went down. Do they go to 20%? Do they go to 15%? Where do they go? What happens? But then when you take a look at that, what else might change, other than corporate rates? Because it may not just be the rates. Would the dividends received deduction remain the same? Would the change -- or would there be any change in the tax-exempt interest that we currently exclude from income? What would happen to a potential border tax? And what's the effect on issues related to that? So it's probably a little tougher issue than just a reduction in rates, and these are just a few items that actually would have a major impact to us when it comes to tax reform. But let's just say if there was a lowering of the overall effective tax rate and nothing else, it would seem that we would have more net income to invest and grow our business. But then we'd also be able to compete on a more level playing field with internationally based companies, since their tax rates are lower currently than ours. So allowing our capital really to compete more on a level playing field with the foreign capital, it seems to me to be a good thing. As of now, it's just too early to know what may change under the new administration. Our industry has experienced many administrations and has adapted over time to remain healthy for our insureds and our shareholders. So right now, I would say we're kind of -- we're waiting to -- let's wait and see what some actual guidance comes out with we're they're specifically headed."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. While our 96.2% fourth quarter combined ratio was higher than we like, weather effects are inherently variable,",1122,"Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. While our 96.2% fourth quarter combined ratio was higher than we like, weather effects are inherently variable, and we are comfortable with taking a more prudent position on loss reserves for various parts of our business. We find it satisfying that the full year 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved compared to 2015 while we steadily improved our premium growth.
On a calendar year basis, our 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.1 percentage points to 87.3%. On a current accident year basis, our 2016 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.5 percentage points to 90.8%. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain our 2017 combined ratio in the low to mid-90% range, and maintain or slightly improve on the 2016 result before catastrophe effects. We also believe our 2017 property casualty premium growth rate can be within 1 percentage point of 2016.
Our full year 2016 catastrophe loss ratio was 1.6 percentage points above the average of the previous 10 years. We recognize that weather, the significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report.
While our reserve development on catastrophe losses during the fourth quarter of 2016 was favorable, the quarter was unusual in the sense that we experienced loss effects from significant catastrophe events so late in the year. 
Early in the quarter, we announced a preliminary estimate of Hurricane Matthew losses with the range midpoint at $52.5 million. Our year-end 2016 estimate was $48 million, including $3 million for Cincinnati Re. 
Our fourth quarter results also included $9 million of favorable development in total for 2 large second quarter 2016 events and $4 million for events prior to 2016.
It was great to see another quarter of good overall investment performance. And Mike will be adding comments regarding investment income growth and portfolio valuation gains. As usual, I'll highlight several important areas of our insurance operations. 
Each of our insurance segments experienced another quarter and year of what we consider to be healthy premium growth. Ongoing efforts toward greater pricing precision allow us to underwrite each individual policy with confidence. Property casualty new business written premiums for the fourth quarter of 2016 were down 4% from a year ago, when we reported a strong growth of 15%. We believe it's more meaningful to look at longer time periods. And on a full year basis, new business written premiums were up 4%.
Policy retention rates for commercial and personal lines were fairly consistent with a year ago. For commercial lines, our policy retention continued near the high end of the mid-80% range, and for personal lines, it continued in a low to mid-90% range.
Pricing in the fourth quarter was generally in line with the third quarter. Consistent with where loss ratios for us and the industry indicate the most need for higher premium rates, our commercial auto and personal auto policies experienced fourth quarter average renewal price increases that were the highest among our major lines of business. Both had average percentage increases in the mid-single-digit range, with personal auto near the high end of that range.
Cincinnati Re continue to grow as planned and made a nice contribution to property casualty underwriting profit, with combined ratios of 84.7% for the fourth quarter and 82.5% for full year 2016. Our seasoned team of reinsurance underwriting and analytics professionals produced $71 million of well-diversified net written premiums in 2016. Nearly half of the 2016 premiums are for property exposures that do include risk of loss from natural catastrophes. The remainder is primarily for casualty exposures from various liability risks.
Our personal lines segment continues to be fundamentally made up of middle-market accounts that represent nearly 90% of our personal lines premium, with both the homeowner and other personal lines book producing a healthy underwriting profit. Our personal lines operation also continued to perform as planned in its expansion of personal lines products and services offered to our agencies higher net worth clients.
In 2016, we improved our high net worth offerings in nearly all of the states where agencies have actively marketed our personal lines products for many years by introducing endorsements which provide agents the option to add coverages similar to our Executive Capstone product suite.
In addition, we successfully launched the full Capstone product to agents in New Jersey, California and Colorado. The reception by California agencies was particularly enthusiastic. They produced $2 million in 2016 premiums written in aggregate for us in just 5 months. We'll continue our steady progress in 2017, bringing the Capstone product to agents in Texas, Massachusetts, Washington State and Washington D.C.
Performance was again quite good for our commercial lines segment, with full year combined ratio below 95%, and our excess and surplus line segment had another excellent year with a combined ratio below 70%. 
For our life insurance subsidiary, full year 2016 earned premiums grew 9%, and net income grew by 17%.
On January 1 of this year, we again renewed all of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For both our per risk treaties and our property catastrophe treaty, terms and conditions as well as rates for 2017 are similar to 2016.
During January, we replaced our existing catastrophe bond program with the new collateralized reinsurance structure providing $200 million of earthquake coverage and $80 million of severe convective storm coverage. The coverage period is for 3 years and expires December 31, 2019. The earthquake coverage applies to all states except California, and the severe convective storm coverage applies to all states except Florida. The storm aggregate coverage provides loss recovery when storm losses for all events in aggregate exceed $190 million after an $8 million deductible per event.
In conclusion, our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio, was 14.5% for full year 2016. Contributions included 7.9 percentage points from operating income, 6.8 points from our stock portfolio and negative 0.2 points from our bond portfolio. For 2017 and beyond, we'll continue to diligently manage insurance profitability and drive premium growth. We think our insurance business is in excellent shape, and we remain quite confident that the steady efforts of our outstanding associates working with what we believe are the best independent agencies in the business will continue to produce excellent financial performance to benefit shareholders and all other stakeholders. 
With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments with a few fourth quarter investment highlights. Fourth quarter 2016 was our 14th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 2% on a pretax basis",831,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments with a few fourth quarter investment highlights. 
Fourth quarter 2016 was our 14th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 2% on a pretax basis and bringing full year growth to 4%. That growth continues to reflect an increase in both interest and dividend income. Our equity portfolio experienced 10% growth in unrealized gains and offset about 2/3 of the $314 million decrease in the bond portfolio's pretax unrealized gains. In total, we ended 2016 with a net unrealized gain of more than $2.6 billion before taxes, including more than $2.3 billion in our equity portfolio.
The bond portfolio's pretax average yield reported at 4.52% for the fourth quarter was below the 4.66% from last year's fourth quarter.
During the last half of 2016, we experienced an uptick in dispositions of higher-yielding bonds that were called by issuers, contributing to that decline in average yield. Taxable bonds purchased during 2016 had an average pretax yield of 4.11%, 37 basis points lower than we experienced a year ago. Tax-exempt bonds purchased averaged 3.04%, 30 basis points lower than a year ago. And our bond portfolio's effective duration at December 31 was 5 years, up slightly from 4.9 years at the end of September. Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for full year 2016 rose 4% compared with a year ago and helped generate $442 million of net purchases of securities.
As always, we work to carefully manage our expenses, at the same time, strategically investing in our business. Our full year 2016 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.1 percentage points compared with a year ago.
Now for some comments on reserves for losses and loss expenses. 2016 was our 28th consecutive year of reporting favorable development as we continue our consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For full year 2016, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.7 percentage points, down slightly from full year 2015. Favorable reserve development for full year 2016 occurred in all major lines of businesses except for auto and, by accident year, included 55% for accident year 2015, 24% for accident year 2014, 16% for accident year 2013 and 5% for 2012 and prior accident years. 
Overall, reserves at the end of December, including accident year 2016 and net of reinsurance ceded rose 8% from last year, with IBNR representing more than 60% of that increase.
Various past disclosures described how historical paid loss patterns are a key assumption use to make projections necessary for estimating IBNR reserves. As we reported earlier, paid losses for commercial casualty emerged at levels higher than we previously expected. That included paid losses or reestimates of case reserves for a large 2007 umbrella claim and a large 2012 general liability claim that in recent months increased in aggregate by over $6 million. Considering updated loss of data, during the fourth quarter, we estimated commercial casualty IBNR reserves for several accident years at levels more likely to be adequate compared with recent quarters. You can see in our financial supplement on Page 17 that we recorded an increase of $56 million in commercial casualty total loss and loss expense reserves during the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in that $56 million was $45 million for IBNR, nearly as much as the $58 million we recorded for the first 9 months of 2016.
Despite those increases in reserves, our full year 2016 loss and loss expense ratio for our commercial casualty line of business was 57.5%. Adding an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 31% or so indicates an estimated commercial casualty combined ratio of under 90%.
Our assessment of the company's capital strength, liquidity and financial flexibility is that they remain at healthy levels. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a total of 522,428 shares at an average price per share of $70.13. Capital management objectives continue to support the future profitable growth of our insurance operations plus other areas, such as returning capital to shareholders.
I'll conclude my remarks with a summary of contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.18. Life insurance operations added $0.09. Investment income, other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items, contributed $0.50. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, decreased book value per share by $1.21. The change in unrealized gains at December 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.63. And we declared $0.48 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.29 during the fourth quarter to $42.95 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

During the fourth quarter, we also received affirmation of our financial strength ratings from both A.M. Best company and Fitch Ratings services. With all major areas of the company performing well, we remain confident that we can deliver long-term shareholder value for years to come. The Board of Directors demonstrated that they share that confidence by recently increasing the quarterly cash dividend to $0.50 per share, setting the stage for 57 consecutive years of shareholder dividend increases by your company.
We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year.

And so once it gets quoted on the standard side, there's -- we just -- we don't compete with it. Our opinion would be that some of the business that's going to the standard side should stay in the E&S side of the business. If we think an account has reached a point where it probably does deserve standard market treatment, then Cincinnati Insurance Company will quote on it. We'll retain it in our standard side. On the personal lines side, as far as new growth would be concerned, we did put through some very healthy rate increases in auto in 2016. And in the middle-market segment of our business that had a depressing effect on the new business there. High net worth more than made up for that. We're very, very pleased about how things went last year in terms of high net worth new business, not only in New York, but as was mentioned earlier, in California, which, obviously, is a significant state in high net worth. The reception by our agents there was just terrific. We wrote a good bit of new business, even though we really did not have all that many agencies appointed for the 5 months that was referred to earlier. So -- and then a few other things. Last year, we had maybe slightly more turnover than normal in our field underwriting and commercial lines, field reps that were retiring or moving to different territories. That has a slightly disrupting effect. We started the year out this year basically with all territories staffed. And so we think that, that will create a little bit of momentum relative to new business. So as Steve mentioned earlier, and sorry to be so long-winded about this, we're feeling pretty good right now about the prospects for growing. We'll continue to appoint more agencies. We could always appoint more than we do. That's a balance as well, but we're confident about our ability to grow the company."

We put together a tremendous amount of specialization in workers comp and claims handling, both in the form of specialists out in the field and then people here in headquarters that are reviewing bills. That, I think, was a significant area of improvement for us. On the loss control side, we have protocols now that we didn't have 6 years ago or so when we really went full board to working on this line of business, where policyholders are visited and scored. We provide consultative services to a greater degree than we had in the past. So we've been able to reduce loss cost in workers' comp when natural and medical inflation would've taken it up for others. So we're -- we think we still have a little runway to go in terms of improving all that. We'll expand our matrix in the loss control area to include even more accounts, smaller accounts, where we can feel like we can improve the margins there. So it's encouraging. We still view that as a class of business you have to be very cautious about. It has the potential for turning pretty sour. So we approach it -- despite the fact that it's such a profitable line for us, we continued to approach it very conservatively. We do not write monoline workers' comp. Not unlike the question a little earlier about package business in personal lines, we don't write the comp unless we're writing the package in the umbrella and the auto."

So of course, it's hard to say what else would change if corporate rates went down. Do they go to 20%? Do they go to 15%? Where do they go? What happens? But then when you take a look at that, what else might change, other than corporate rates? Because it may not just be the rates. Would the dividends received deduction remain the same? Would the change -- or would there be any change in the tax-exempt interest that we currently exclude from income? What would happen to a potential border tax? And what's the effect on issues related to that? So it's probably a little tougher issue than just a reduction in rates, and these are just a few items that actually would have a major impact to us when it comes to tax reform. But let's just say if there was a lowering of the overall effective tax rate and nothing else, it would seem that we would have more net income to invest and grow our business. But then we'd also be able to compete on a more level playing field with internationally based companies, since their tax rates are lower currently than ours. So allowing our capital really to compete more on a level playing field with the foreign capital, it seems to me to be a good thing. As of now, it's just too early to know what may change under the new administration. Our industry has experienced many administrations and has adapted over time to remain healthy for our insureds and our shareholders. So right now, I would say we're kind of -- we're waiting to -- let's wait and see what some actual guidance comes out with we're they're specifically headed."

Operating profit for the quarter was well below our expectations primarily due to severe weather as we previously reported. Starting the year with a 99.7% combined ratio means we have worked to do, and we remain confident that he has expertise and agency partners that will lead to better results as the year progresses. We reported another quarter of strong investment performance. And Mike will highlight key items in a moment. Before that, I'll note a few more important things regarding our insurance operations.
We believe the rate of premium growth we reported for each of our insurance segments is healthy. Best effort by underwriters in executing pricing position for each policy is imperative and their efforts also strengthen our confidence in selecting and pricing new business from our agencies.
Pricing was generally consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016, a little stronger for some lines of business and a little weaker for others. As loss ratios for us in the industry indicate, higher premium rates are most needed for commercial and personal auto policies. Our first quarter average renewal price increases for those 2 lines were the highest among our major lines of business. As I mentioned earlier, elevated weather-related catastrophe losses challenged both our commercial lines and personal lines segments in the first quarter. However, our commercial lines segment improved its current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe losses. We're also satisfied with first quarter premium trends and the opportunities that our agencies continue to invest for profitable growth. Our personal lines segment also continued to see good growth in both middle market and high net worth premiums, and we continued to see success in getting needed rate increases. Our excess and surplus line segment continued to report outstanding results with the first quarter 2017 combined ratio of 62.3% in study premium growth. Underwriting results for Cincinnati Re were also outstanding with another quarter of nice premium growth and a combined ratio below 80%. For our life insurance to generate, while operating revenues were flat for the first quarter of 2017, both segment profit and net income continued to rise. Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, was 3.8% for the first quarter, a good start for the year.
It was nice to see another quarter of rising investment portfolio valuations augment the 1.4% contribution from operating performance.
Every associate remains focused on executing our strategy and delivering excellent personalized service to each stakeholder every day. As a result, we believe the shareholders will be rewarded over time. With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance and financial condition."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. My comments begin with some first quarter investment highlights. First quarter 2017 was our 15th consecutive quarter of investment income growth as there was 3% on a pretax basis and",711,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. My comments begin with some first quarter investment highlights. First quarter 2017 was our 15th consecutive quarter of investment income growth as there was 3% on a pretax basis and 4% on an after-tax basis.
Similar to recent quarters, both interest and dividend income contributed to growth. Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of growth and unrealized gains, up 4% to $2.4 billion despite harvesting $149 million of appreciated stocks.
The bonds portfolio pretax average yield was 4.49% for the first quarter of 2017, down 16 basis points from last year's first quarter.
Taxable bonds purchased during the first 3 months of 2017 had an average pretax yield of 4.38% and purchased tax exempt bonds averaged 3.46% for a blended yield of 3.93%. Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 3 months of 2017 were $136 million, about half as much as the first quarter of last year.
Much of that decrease was due to higher-than-usual catastrophe losses in recent months. We continue to wisely manage the company's discretionary expenses, including strategic investments in our business that will enhance future success. Our first quarter 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.2 percentage points compared with a year ago. Transitioning to loss reserves, we continue to experience favorable development as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves.
For the first 3 months of 2017, favorable reserve development benefited the combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points. While that was a little lighter than a year ago, it's very similar to the 3.5 points we averaged over the past 3 calendar years.
Favorable reserve development for the first quarter was again spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 53% for accident year 2016, 21% for accident year 2015 and 26% for 2014 and prior accident years.
One item I'd like to note regarding first quarter reserves was an increase in prior accident year your reserves for our commercial casualty line of business. That development was heavily influenced by an increase in commercial casualty large losses of $1 million or more per client, split about evenly between accident year 2017 and prior accident years.
We decided it was prudent to increase management's best estimate of commercial casualty reserves even though large losses are inherently variable. As we've disclosed in our critical accounting estimates section of our 10-K, large loss activity in trends are important factors to consider. Despite the large losses and reserve increases, adding an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32 points or so to the 66.3% loss and loss expense ratio we reported indicates a first quarter estimated commercial casualty combined ratio of under 100%.
As more data becomes available for those large losses, we'll adjust estimates reserves up or down as appropriate. Large losses also increased for some other lines of business as the total for our commercial lines insurance segment rose 103%. We study those claims routinely and determine that the 5 largest ones were generally from well-established agencies and accounts that we've insured for many years.
Regarding capital management, our approach and financial strength remain stable. During the first quarter, we did repurchase 200,000 shares at an average price per share of $73.35.
As usual, I'll wrap up with a summary of contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.02. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.39. The change in unrealized gains of March 31 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value per share by $0.18. The change in unrealized gains of March 31 for the equity portfolio net of realized gains and losses increased book value by $0.97. And we declared $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.12 during the first quarter to a record $44.07 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

And the biggest claim we had have been insured with us for 21 years, and we found that, that was the case on all of those claims. The agencies once again, long-tenured agencies, in fact, one of them was an agency that started with the company in 1951, so we're not seeing anything emerged from more newly appointed agencies. And of those 5 big claims, several of them have very good subrogation possibilities, so there wasn't really anything going on with our particular policyholders so much is that they were the victim, if you will, of some bad exposures surrounding them. So we really did take a look at a lot of things. We've appointed a good number of agencies over the last several years, so we're playing close attention to make certain quality of the business that we're getting from those agencies. It's consistent with what we've been used to. Certainly, we're paying attention a lot of the pricing we're seeing on new business coming in. So from our standpoint, at least at this point, we're going to continue to pay close attention to it. The number of larger claims we had this quarter was random.

There are aren't any special deals that are commission-driven. We -- it's just been good solid opportunities. I will say that in the marketplace right now that particularly driven by commercial auto, there is a lot of fairly sizable rate increases that are being requested by carriers, and that's, I think, driving a little bit more shopping, if you will. Agencies taking against the market perhaps then there would've been the same time last year. So we're getting a decent add backs there. So but no, good very good.

Operating profit for the quarter was well below our expectations primarily due to severe weather as we previously reported. Starting the year with a 99.7% combined ratio means we have work to do, and we remain confident that we have the expertise and agency partners that will lead to better results as the year progresses. We reported another quarter of strong investment performance. And Mike will highlight key items in a moment. Before that, I'll note a few more important things regarding our insurance operations.
We believe the rate of premium growth we reported for each of our insurance segments is healthy. Steadfast effort by underwriters in executing pricing position for each policy is imperative, and their efforts also strengthen our confidence in selecting and pricing new business from our agencies.
Pricing was generally consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016, a little stronger for some lines of business and a little weaker for others. As loss ratios for us in the industry indicate, higher premium rates are most needed for commercial and personal auto policies. Our first quarter average renewal price increases for those 2 lines were the highest among our major lines of business. As I mentioned earlier, elevated weather-related catastrophe losses challenged both our commercial lines and personal line segments in the first quarter. However, our commercial line segment improved its current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe losses. We're also satisfied with first quarter premium trends and the opportunities that our agencies continue to give us for profitable growth. Our personal lines segment also continued to see good growth in both middle market and high net worth premiums, and we continued to see success in getting needed rate increases. Our excess and surplus line segment continued to report outstanding results with a first quarter 2017 combined ratio of 62.3% and steady premium growth. Underwriting results for Cincinnati Re were also outstanding with another quarter of nice premium growth and a combined ratio below 80%. For our life insurance subsidiary, while operating revenues were flat for the first quarter of 2017, both segment profit and net income continued to rise. Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, was 3.8% for the first quarter, a good start for the year.
It was nice to see another quarter of rising investment portfolio valuations augment the 1.4% contribution from operating performance.
Every associate remains focused on executing our strategy and delivering excellent personalized service to each stakeholder every day. As a result, we believe that shareholders will be rewarded over time. With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance and financial condition."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. My comments begin with some first quarter investment highlights. First quarter 2017 was our 15th consecutive quarter of investment income growth as it rose 3% on a pretax basis and 4%",711,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. My comments begin with some first quarter investment highlights. First quarter 2017 was our 15th consecutive quarter of investment income growth as it rose 3% on a pretax basis and 4% on an after-tax basis.
Similar to recent quarters, both interest and dividend income contributed to growth. Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of growth and unrealized gains, up 4% to $2.4 billion despite harvesting $149 million of appreciated stocks.
The bond portfolio pretax average yield was 4.49% for the first quarter of 2017, down 16 basis points from last year's first quarter.
Taxable bonds purchased during the first 3 months of 2017 had an average pretax yield of 4.38% and purchased tax exempt bonds averaged 3.46% for a blended yield of 3.93%. Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 3 months of 2017 [indiscernible] $136 million, about half as much as the first quarter of last year.
Much of that decrease was due to higher-than-usual catastrophe losses in recent months. We continue to wisely manage the company's discretionary expenses, including strategic investments in our business that will enhance future success. Our first quarter 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.2 percentage points compared with a year ago. Transitioning to loss reserves, we continue to experience favorable development as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves.
For the first 3 months of 2017, favorable reserve development benefited the combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points. While that was a little lighter than a year ago, it's very similar to the 3.5 points we averaged over the past 3 calendar years.
Favorable reserve development for the first quarter was again spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 53% for accident year 2016, 21% for accident year 2015 and 26% for 2014 and prior accident years.
One item I'd like to note regarding first quarter reserves was an increase in prior accident year your reserves for our commercial casualty line of business. That development was heavily influenced by an increase in commercial casualty large losses of $1 million or more per client, split about evenly between accident year 2017 and prior accident years.
We decided it was prudent to increase management's best estimate of commercial casualty reserves even though large losses are inherently variable. As we've disclosed in our critical accounting estimate section of our 10-K, large loss activity and trends are important factors to consider. Despite the large losses and reserve increases, adding an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32 points or so to the 66.3% loss and loss expense ratio we reported indicates a first quarter estimated commercial casualty combined ratio of under 100%.
As more data becomes available for those large losses, we'll adjust estimate reserves up or down as appropriate. Large losses also increased for some other lines of business as the total for our commercial lines insurance segment rose 103%. We study those claims routinely and determined that the 5 largest ones were generally from well-established agencies and accounts that we've insured for many years.
Regarding capital management, our approach and financial strength remain stable. During the first quarter, we did repurchase 200,000 shares at an average price per share of $73.35.
As usual, I'll wrap up with a summary of contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.02. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.39. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.18. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.97. And we declared $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.12 during the first quarter to a record $44.07 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

While we have concentration of our premiums in the Midwest and we are growing in other states to diversify both things like our excess and surplus lines company, things we do in management liability, surety help to diversify our income stream, and then also we see that from what we're doing with our small reinsurance operation. Strategically, what we tried to do is hire a small team of very talented people and use an allocated capital approach where, as you point out, it is tough in the reinsurance business, but we think as a startup with very talented, experienced people, a low expense ratio, we can look to the part of the reinsurance distribution that we feel confident that we can make a profit in, where we can understand the risk, quantitatively and qualitatively without pressure to grow. We didn't set up a separate company or anything like that or give them any targets that they had to meet in terms of growth. We just said use your experience, your contacts, get a wide look at what's out there and do your best to just pick the most profitable ones.

And we took a look at the, particularly, the 5 largest claims we had in this quarter. And as was mentioned in the prepared remarks, really no trends emerged there. And the biggest claim we had, had been insured with us for 21 years, and we found that, that was the case on all of those claims. The agencies, once again, long-tenured agencies, in fact, one of them was an agency that started with the company in 1951, so we're not seeing anything emerged from more newly appointed agencies. And of those 5 big claims, several of them have very good subrogation possibilities, so there wasn't really anything going on with our particular policyholders so much as that they were the victim, if you will, of some bad exposures surrounding them. So we really do take a look at a lot of things. We've appointed a good number of agencies over the last several years, so we're playing close attention to make certain that quality of the business that we're getting from those agencies is consistent with what we've been used to. Certainly, we're paying attention to a lot of the pricing we're seeing on new business coming in. So from our standpoint, at least at this point, and we're going to continue to pay close attention to it, the number of larger claims we had this quarter were random. It just so happened that they occurred in this quarter. If you go back several quarters, particularly in the greater than $5 million category, we really hadn't had any. So nothing that we've found.

We've got a great model. And we have a lot of field people out in the field. We're adding field people on the E&S side, that helps with new business. And but beyond that, no. Actually, we've got no incentives out there. There are aren't any special deals that are commission driven. We -- it's just been good solid opportunities. I will say that in the marketplace right now that, particularly driven by commercial auto, there's a lot of fairly sizable rate increases that are being requested by carriers, and that's, I think, driving a little bit more shopping, if you will. Agencies taking accounts to market, perhaps, than it would've been the same time last year. So we're getting decent at-bats there. So but no, good very good. We're pleased with the new business.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. Operating profit for the quarter was well below our expectations primarily due to severe weather as we previously reported. Starting the year with a 99.7% combined ratio means we have work to do, and we remain confident that we have the expertise and agency partners that will lead to better results as the year progresses. We reported another quarter of strong investment performance. And Mike will highlight key items in a moment. Before that, I'll note a few more important things regarding our insurance operations.
We believe the rate of premium growth we reported for each of our insurance segments is healthy. Steadfast effort by underwriters in executing pricing precision for each policy is imperative, and their efforts also strengthen our confidence in selecting and pricing new business from our agencies.
Pricing was generally consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016, a little stronger for some lines of business and a little weaker for others. As loss ratios for us in the industry indicate, higher premium rates are most needed for commercial and personal auto policies. Our first quarter average renewal price increases for those 2 lines were the highest among our major lines of business. As I mentioned earlier, elevated weather-related catastrophe losses challenged both our commercial lines and personal line segments in the first quarter. However, our commercial line segment improved its current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe losses. We're also satisfied with first quarter premium trends and the opportunities that our agencies continue to give us for profitable growth. Our personal lines segment also continued to see good growth in both middle market and high net worth premiums, and we continued to see success in getting needed rate increases. Our excess and surplus line segment continued to report outstanding results with a first quarter 2017 combined ratio of 62.3% and steady premium growth. Underwriting results for Cincinnati Re were also outstanding with another quarter of nice premium growth and a combined ratio below 80%. For our life insurance subsidiary, while operating revenues were flat for the first quarter of 2017, both segment profit and net income continued to rise. Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, was 3.8% for the first quarter, a good start for the year.
It was nice to see another quarter of rising investment portfolio valuations augment the 1.4% contribution from operating performance.
Every associate remains focused on executing our strategy and delivering excellent personalized service to each stakeholder every day. As a result, we believe that shareholders will be rewarded over time. With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance and financial condition."

Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. My comments begin with some first quarter investment highlights. First quarter 2017 was our 15th consecutive quarter of investment income growth as it rose 3% on a pretax basis and 4% on an after-tax basis.
Similar to recent quarters, both interest and dividend income contributed to growth. Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of growth in unrealized gains, up 4% to $2.4 billion despite harvesting $149 million of appreciated stocks.
The bond portfolio pretax average yield was 4.49% for the first quarter of 2017, down 16 basis points from last year's first quarter.
Taxable bonds purchased during the first 3 months of 2017 had an average pretax yield of 4.38% and purchased tax exempt bonds averaged 3.46% for a blended yield of 3.93%. Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 3 months of 2017 [ totaled ] $136 million, about half as much as the first quarter of last year.
Much of that decrease was due to higher-than-usual catastrophe losses in recent months. We continue to wisely manage the company's discretionary expenses, including strategic investments in our business that will enhance future success. Our first quarter 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.2 percentage points compared with a year ago. Transitioning to loss reserves, we continue to experience favorable development as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves.
For the first 3 months of 2017, favorable reserve development benefited the combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points. While that was a little lighter than a year ago, it's very similar to the 3.5 points we averaged over the past 3 calendar years.
Favorable reserve development for the first quarter was again spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 53% for accident year 2016, 21% for accident year 2015 and 26% for 2014 and prior accident years.
One item I'd like to note regarding first quarter reserves was an increase in prior accident year reserves for our commercial casualty line of business. That development was heavily influenced by an increase in commercial casualty large losses of $1 million or more per client, split about evenly between accident year 2017 and prior accident years.
We decided it was prudent to increase management's best estimate of commercial casualty reserves even though large losses are inherently variable. As we've disclosed in our critical accounting estimate section of our 10-K, large loss activity and trends are important factors to consider. Despite the large losses and reserve increases, adding an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32 points or so to the 66.3% loss and loss expense ratio we reported indicates a first quarter estimated commercial casualty combined ratio of under 100%.
As more data becomes available for those large losses, we'll adjust estimate reserves up or down as appropriate. Large losses also increased for some other lines of business as the total for our commercial lines insurance segment rose 103%. We study those claims routinely and determined that the 5 largest ones were generally from well-established agencies and accounts that we've insured for many years.
Regarding capital management, our approach and financial strength remain stable. During the first quarter, we did repurchase 200,000 shares at an average price per share of $73.35.
As usual, I'll wrap up with a summary of contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.02. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.39. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.18. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.97. And we declared $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.12 during the first quarter to a record $44.07 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Thanks, Josh. Yes, with the reinsurance, as we're seeing, we seek a diversified stream of revenue and a diversified stream of income. It paid off this quarter. While we have concentration of our premiums in the Midwest and we are growing in other states to diversify both things like our excess and surplus lines company, things we do in management liability, surety help to diversify our income stream, and then also we see that from what we're doing with our small reinsurance operation. Strategically, what we tried to do is hire a small team of very talented people and use an allocated capital approach where, as you point out, it is tough in the reinsurance business, but we think as a startup with very talented, experienced people, a low expense ratio, we can look to the part of the reinsurance distribution that we feel confident that we can make a profit in, where we can understand the risk, quantitatively and qualitatively without pressure to grow. We didn't set up a separate company or anything like that or give them any targets that they had to meet in terms of growth. We just said use your experience, your contacts, get a wide look at what's out there and do your best to just pick the most profitable ones. And as you can see, just in -- I'd say it's about 7 quarters, they've built up a bank of about $15 million in profit just going about their business in a very selective way."

And we took a look at the, particularly, the 5 largest claims we had in this quarter. And as was mentioned in the prepared remarks, really no trends emerged there. And the biggest claim we had, had been insured with us for 21 years, and we found that, that was the case on all of those claims. The agencies, once again, long-tenured agencies, in fact, one of them was an agency that started with the company in 1951, so we're not seeing anything emerged from more newly appointed agencies. And of those 5 big claims, several of them have very good subrogation possibilities, so there wasn't really anything going on with our particular policyholders so much as that they were the victim, if you will, of some bad exposures surrounding them. So we really do take a look at a lot of things. We've appointed a good number of agencies over the last several years, so we're playing close attention to make certain that quality of the business that we're getting from those agencies is consistent with what we've been used to. Certainly, we're paying attention to a lot of the pricing we're seeing on new business coming in. So from our standpoint, at least at this point, and we're going to continue to pay close attention to it, the number of larger claims we had this quarter were random. It just so happened that they occurred in this quarter. If you go back several quarters, particularly in the greater than $5 million category, we really hadn't had any. So nothing that we've found. We keep a close look on it, though."

High net worth had a -- is really having a very positive effect. As Steve mentioned, CSU continues to do very well. And I think a lot of agencies just continued to embrace the strategy we have there. We've got a great model. And we have a lot of field people out in the field. We're adding field people on the E&S side, that helps with new business. And but beyond that, no. Actually, we've got no incentives out there. There are aren't any special deals that are commission driven. We -- it's just been good solid opportunities. I will say that in the marketplace right now that, particularly driven by commercial auto, there's a lot of fairly sizable rate increases that are being requested by carriers, and that's, I think, driving a little bit more shopping, if you will. Agencies taking accounts to market, perhaps, than it would've been the same time last year. So we're getting decent at-bats there. So but no, good very good. We're pleased with the new business. The pricing on it looks strong. Loss control continues to be an even larger part of what we do in terms of profiling accounts, so we're very comfortable with the rate of growth of new business."

Operating profit for the quarter was well below our expectations primarily due to severe weather as we previously reported. Starting the year with a 99.7% combined ratio means we have work to do, and we remain confident that we have the expertise and agency partners that will lead to better results as the year progresses. We reported another quarter of strong investment performance. And Mike will highlight key items in a moment. Before that, I'll note a few more important things regarding our insurance operations.
We believe the rate of premium growth we reported for each of our insurance segments is healthy. Steadfast effort by underwriters in executing pricing precision for each policy is imperative, and their efforts also strengthen our confidence in selecting and pricing new business from our agencies.
Pricing was generally consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016, a little stronger for some lines of business and a little weaker for others. As loss ratios for us in the industry indicate, higher premium rates are most needed for commercial and personal auto policies. Our first quarter average renewal price increases for those 2 lines were the highest among our major lines of business. As I mentioned earlier, elevated weather-related catastrophe losses challenged both our commercial lines and personal line segments in the first quarter. However, our commercial line segment improved its current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe losses. We're also satisfied with first quarter premium trends and the opportunities that our agencies continue to give us for profitable growth. Our personal lines segment also continued to see good growth in both middle market and high net worth premiums, and we continued to see success in getting needed rate increases. Our excess and surplus line segment continued to report outstanding results with a first quarter 2017 combined ratio of 62.3% and steady premium growth. Underwriting results for Cincinnati Re were also outstanding with another quarter of nice premium growth and a combined ratio below 80%. For our life insurance subsidiary, while operating revenues were flat for the first quarter of 2017, both segment profit and net income continued to rise. Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, was 3.8% for the first quarter, a good start for the year.
It was nice to see another quarter of rising investment portfolio valuations augment the 1.4% contribution from operating performance.
Every associate remains focused on executing our strategy and delivering excellent personalized service to each stakeholder every day. As a result, we believe that shareholders will be rewarded over time. With that, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other areas of our financial performance and financial condition."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. My comments begin with some first quarter investment highlights. First quarter 2017 was our 15th consecutive quarter of investment income growth as it rose 3% on a pretax basis and 4%",711,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. My comments begin with some first quarter investment highlights. First quarter 2017 was our 15th consecutive quarter of investment income growth as it rose 3% on a pretax basis and 4% on an after-tax basis.
Similar to recent quarters, both interest and dividend income contributed to growth. Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of growth in unrealized gains, up 4% to $2.4 billion despite harvesting $149 million of appreciated stocks.
The bond portfolio pretax average yield was 4.49% for the first quarter of 2017, down 16 basis points from last year's first quarter.
Taxable bonds purchased during the first 3 months of 2017 had an average pretax yield of 4.38% and purchased tax-exempt bonds averaged 3.46% for a blended yield of 3.93%. Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 3 months of 2017 [ totaled ] $136 million, about half as much as the first quarter of last year.
Much of that decrease was due to higher-than-usual catastrophe losses in recent months. We continue to wisely manage the company's discretionary expenses, including strategic investments in our business that will enhance future success. Our first quarter 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratio rose slightly, up 0.2 percentage points compared with a year ago. Transitioning to loss reserves, we continue to experience favorable development as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves.
For the first 3 months of 2017, favorable reserve development benefited the combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points. While that was a little lighter than a year ago, it's very similar to the 3.5 points we averaged over the past 3 calendar years.
Favorable reserve development for the first quarter was again spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 53% for accident year 2016, 21% for accident year 2015 and 26% for 2014 and prior accident years.
One item I'd like to note regarding first quarter reserves was an increase in prior accident year reserves for our commercial casualty line of business. That development was heavily influenced by an increase in commercial casualty large losses of $1 million or more per client, split about evenly between accident year 2017 and prior accident years.
We decided it was prudent to increase management's best estimate of commercial casualty reserves even though large losses are inherently variable. As we've disclosed in our critical accounting estimate section of our 10-K, large loss activity and trends are important factors to consider. Despite the large losses and reserve increases, adding an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32 points or so to the 66.3% loss and loss expense ratio we reported indicates a first quarter estimated commercial casualty combined ratio of under 100%.
As more data becomes available for those large losses, we'll adjust estimate reserves up or down as appropriate. Large losses also increased for some other lines of business as the total for our commercial lines insurance segment rose 103%. We study those claims routinely and determined that the 5 largest ones were generally from well-established agencies and accounts that we've insured for many years.
Regarding capital management, our approach and financial strength remain stable. During the first quarter, we did repurchase 200,000 shares at an average price per share of $73.35.
As usual, I'll wrap up with a summary of contributions during the first quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.02. Life insurance operations added $0.06. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.39. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.18. The change in unrealized gains at March 31 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.97. And we declared $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.12 during the first quarter to a record $44.07 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

While we have concentration of our premiums in the Midwest and we are growing in other states to diversify both things like our excess and surplus lines company, things we do in management liability, surety help to diversify our income stream, and then also we see that from what we're doing with our small reinsurance operation. Strategically, what we tried to do is hire a small team of very talented people and use an allocated capital approach where, as you point out, it is tough in the reinsurance business, but we think as a startup with very talented, experienced people, a low expense ratio, we can look to the part of the reinsurance distribution that we feel confident that we can make a profit in, where we can understand the risk, quantitatively and qualitatively without pressure to grow. We didn't set up a separate company or anything like that or give them any targets that they had to meet in terms of growth. We just said use your experience, your contacts, get a wide look at what's out there and do your best to just pick the most profitable ones.

And the biggest claim we had, had been insured with us for 21 years, and we found that, that was the case on all of those claims. The agencies, once again, long-tenured agencies, in fact, one of them was an agency that started with the company in 1951, so we're not seeing anything emerged from more newly appointed agencies. And of those 5 big claims, several of them have very good subrogation possibilities, so there wasn't really anything going on with our particular policyholders so much as that they were the victim, if you will, of some bad exposures surrounding them.

We keep a close look on it, though."

We did process, probably a little more than normal, business that was written in the fourth quarter but got processed in the first quarter. So it was a little bit of that, that helped with the growth rate in the first quarter. Other than that, maturing of agencies that we've appointed over the last several years. High net worth had a -- is really having a very positive effect. As Steve mentioned, CSU continues to do very well. And I think a lot of agencies just continued to embrace the strategy we have there. We've got a great model. And we have a lot of field people out in the field. We're adding field people on the E&S side, that helps with new business. And but beyond that, no. Actually, we've got no incentives out there. There are aren't any special deals that are commission driven. We -- it's just been good solid opportunities. I will say that in the marketplace right now that, particularly driven by commercial auto, there's a lot of fairly sizable rate increases that are being requested by carriers, and that's, I think, driving a little bit more shopping, if you will. Agencies taking accounts to market, perhaps, than it would've been the same time last year. So we're getting decent at-bats there. So but no, good very good. We're pleased with the new business. The pricing on it looks strong. Loss control continues to be an even larger part of what we do in terms of profiling accounts, so we're very comfortable with the rate of growth of new business."

We are pleased to report second quarter of 2017 operating results that outperformed last year's second quarter. Our 98.3% property casualty combined ratio for",556,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. We are pleased to report second quarter of 2017 operating results that outperformed last year's second quarter. Our 98.3% property casualty combined ratio for the second quarter of this year was 1 full point better than a year ago.
It's also important to note that 98.3% was an improvement from the first quarter of 2017 despite an unfavorable effect from higher catastrophe losses. On the basis before catastrophe effects, our second quarter 2017 combined ratio was better than both the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. We believe these improving trends bode well for the second half of 2017.
Other good news for the second quarter of 2017 includes another solid quarter for our investment results and premium growth that continues to outpace the industry. Our associates continued their steady efforts to support the outstanding local independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance as they carefully underwrite each policy and provide personal service to agents and their clients. We believe we'll continue to see benefits over the long-term from our various initiatives designed to support profitable growth in each of our insurance segments.
Our commercialized segment grew net written premiums 2% and returned to producing an underwriting profit in the second quarter and for the first half of the year. Overall, commercial lines' estimated average pricing improved slightly from the first quarter of 2017, most notably for commercial auto. As Mike will explain further, our commercial casualty line of business returned to a more typical level of profitability.
Although a high level of catastrophe losses continues to challenge our personalized segment, they reported another quarter of nice growth for both middle-market and high net worth premiums. Estimated average pricing for personal lines in total was in line with the first quarter of 2017, again with significant personal auto rate increases where needed.
Our excess and surplus line segment reported another second excellent quarter, including a combined ratio of 66.2% and premium growth of 20%. Cincinnati Re logged another quarter with strong underwriting results with steady premium growth in the combined ratio just another 80%. 
The third quarter of 2017 marks 2 years since Cincinnati Re begin assuming risks and generating premiums. Through the second quarter of this year, this cumulative underwriting profit totaled $20 million on $183 million of net written premiums and an estimated combined ratio of 81%.
Our life insurance subsidiary continued its steady contrition to net income while growing second quarter 2017 term life insurance earned premiums by 8%. The steady growth of our life company, our E&S company and our reinsurance assumed division diversifies our business, helping to smooth results over time.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio was 3.2% for the second quarter and 7.0% for the first half of the year. 
We are on pace for another year that reaches our long-term target of 10% to 13% annual average. Each day brings new challenges to insurance companies. We see them as opportunities for our associates to compete and to deliver value to agencies and policyholders. We know that can translate into long-term shareholder value.
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight of the key areas of our financial performance and financial condition."

Thank you Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start my remarks with some highlights of our investment results. Second quarter 2017 was our 16th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 1% for the quarter, and 2",620,"Great. Thank you Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start my remarks with some highlights of our investment results. Second quarter 2017 was our 16th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 1% for the quarter, and 2% for the first 6 months. As in recent quarters, both interest and dividend income growth contributed or contributed to grow.
Our equity portfolio again reported growth in unrealized gains, up 6% for the quarter to nearly $2.6 billion. The bond portfolio use pretax average yield was 4.2% for the second quarter of 2017, down 22 basis points from last year's second quarter.
Taxable bonds purchased during the second quarter of 2017 had an average pretax yield of 3.75%, and purchased tax-exempt bonds averaged 3.33% for a blended yield of 3.53%. 
Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30 was 5.2 years, matching March 31, and up slightly from 5 years at the end of December.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 6 months of 2017 totaled $445 million, down $54 million or 11% for the first half of last year. An  $85 million increase in catastrophe losses paid this year was a key contributor to the decrease.
Careful management of expenses continues to be a priority, including the investing strategically in our business. Our second quarter 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratio improved slightly and the 6 months ratio was in line with the year ago.
Next, I'll comment on the reserves. We can experience net favorable development on prior accident years as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the second quarter of 2017, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.2 percentage points. That was down 1.2 points from a year ago but fairly close to the 3.5 points we averaged over the past 3 calendar years.
Our largest line of business, commercial casualty, returning -- returned to experiencing favorable reserve development for the second quarter of 2017. With the ratio of 2.5%, that line was similar to its longer-term ratios, which averaged 2.6 points over the past 3 calendar years.
Our commercial casualty second quarter 2017 loss and loss expense ratio of 57.7%, combined with an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32%-or-so, indicates an estimated combined ratio of just under 90%. 
Favorable reserve development for the first 6 months of 2017 continued to be spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 51% for accident year 2016, 12% for accident year 2015, 15% for accident year 2014 and 22% for 2013 and prior accident years.
Touching briefly on capital management. Our approach and financial strength remains stable. During the second quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares at an average price per share of $69.73. As usual, I'll conclude with a summary contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio.
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.09. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.41. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.29. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.54, and we declared $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.90 during the second quarter to a record $44.97 per share. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Yes, the submission flows are up this year, and we're pleased about that. To tag on Steve's comment a little bit earlier, comment a little bit earlier, I guess the classification, if you will, of the business that we're writing is kind of reflective of a generalist approach that our adjacencies take. We don't really have a strategy of going after a line of business or an industry classification. We're pleased that 44% of what we write in the E&S is attached to a P&C account. But our agencies are right on closing now on $3 billion in E&S business and their agencies in total. And so what we're trying to do, just with the model we have is just to continue to compete for primarily, that book of business that they already have. We think we've got a pretty good value proposition on E&S side, and do what we can to write that seasoned business just within those agencies right now. So we're very pleased with the submission flow. There's a lot of competition, particularly larger accounts in E&S where carriers are taking accounts out of the E&S business into the standard market. We've got a pretty conservative appetite in this. I guess in some respects, we play on the fringe of E&S versus standard. So it's not surprising that some of our accounts would go back into the standard market during the softer market the way that it is right now, but notwithstanding the fact we're losing some of that business to the standard market, we're -- submission flow obviously has been very good which has allowed us to grow nicely."

On a basis before catastrophe effects, our second quarter 2017 combined ratio was better than both the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year.

Our commercial line segment grew net written premiums 2% and returned to producing an underwriting profit in the second quarter and for the first half of the year. Overall, commercial line's estimated average pricing improved slightly from the first quarter of 2017, most notably for commercial auto. As Mike will explain further, our commercial casualty line of business returned to a more typical level of profitability.
Although a high level of catastrophe losses continues to challenge our personal line segment, they reported another quarter of nice growth for both middle-market and high net worth premiums. Estimated average pricing for personal lines in total was in line with the first quarter of 2017, again with significant personal auto rate increases where needed.
Our excess and surplus lines segment reported another excellent quarter, including a combined ratio of 66.2% and premium growth of 20%. Cincinnati Re logged another quarter of strong underwriting results with steady premium growth in the combined ratio just under 80%.
The third quarter of 2017 marks 2 years since Cincinnati Re began assuming risks and generating premiums. Through the second quarter of this year, this cumulative net underwriting profit totaled $20 million on $183 million of net written premiums and an estimated combined ratio of 81%.
Our life insurance subsidiary continued its steady contribution to net income while growing second quarter 2017 term life insurance earned premiums by 8%. The steady growth of our life company, our E&S company and our reinsurance assumed division diversifies our business, helping to smooth results over time.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio was 3.2% for the second quarter and 7.0% for the first half of the year.
We are on pace for another year that reaches our long-term target of 10% to 13% annual average. Each day brings new challenges to insurance companies. We see them as opportunities for our associates to compete and to deliver value to agencies and policyholders. We know that can translate into long-term shareholder value.
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight other key areas of our financial performance and financial condition."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start my remarks with some highlights of our investment results.Second quarter 2017 was our 16th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 1% for the quarter, and",618,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start my remarks with some highlights of our investment results.
Second quarter 2017 was our 16th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 1% for the quarter, and 2% for the first 6 months. As in recent quarters, both interest and dividend income growth contributed or contributed to growth.
Our equity portfolio again reported growth in unrealized gains, up 6% for the quarter to nearly $2.6 billion. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield was 4.42% for the second quarter of 2017, down 22 basis points from last year's second quarter.
Taxable bonds purchased during the second quarter of 2017 had an average pretax yield of 3.75%, and purchased tax-exempt bonds averaged 3.33% for a blended yield of 3.53%.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30 was 5.2 years, matching March 31, and up slightly from 5 years at the end of December.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 6 months of 2017 totaled $445 million, down $54 million or 11% from the first half of last year. An $85 million increase in catastrophe losses paid this year was a key contributor to the decrease.
Careful management of expenses continues to be a priority, including investing strategically in our business. Our second quarter 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratio improved slightly, and the 6 month ratio was in line with a year ago.
Next, I'll comment on reserves. We can experience net favorable development on prior accident years as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the second quarter of 2017, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.2 percentage points. That was down 1.2 points from a year ago but fairly close to the 3.5 points we averaged over the past 3 calendar years.
Our largest line of business, commercial casualty, returning -- returned to experiencing favorable reserve development for the second quarter of 2017. With the ratio of 2.5%, that line was similar to its longer-term ratios, which averaged 2.6 points over the past 3 calendar years.
Our commercial casualty second quarter 2017 loss and loss expense ratio of 57.7%, combined with an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32-or-so, indicates an estimated combined ratio of just under 90%. 
Favorable reserve development for the first 6 months of 2017 continued to be spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 51% for accident year 2016, 12% for accident year 2015, 15% for accident year 2014 and 22% for 2013 and prior accident years.
Touching briefly on capital management. Our approach and financial strength remains stable. During the second quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares at an average price per share of $69.73. As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio.
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.09. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.41. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.29. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.54, and we declared $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.90 during the second quarter to a record $44.97 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Yes, the submission flows are up this year, and we're pleased about that. To tag on Steve's comments a little bit earlier, the -- I guess, the classification, if you will, of the business we're writing is kind of reflective of a generalist approach that our agencies take. We don't really have a strategy of going after a line of business or an industry classification. We're pleased that 44% of what we write in the E&S is attached to a P&C account. But our agencies right closing now on $3 billion in E&S business in their agencies in total. And so what we're trying to do, just with the model we have is just to continue to compete for primarily, that book of business that they already have. We think we've got a pretty good value proposition on the E&S side, and do what we can to write that seasoned business just within those agencies right now. So we're very pleased with the submission flow. There's a lot of competition, particularly in larger accounts in E&S where carriers are taking accounts out of the E&S business into the standard market. We've got a pretty conservative appetite in this. I mean, what we're -- I guess, in some respects, we play on the fringe of E&S versus standards. So it's not surprising that some of our accounts would go back into the standard market during the softer market the way that it is right now, but notwithstanding the fact we're losing some of that business to the standard market, we're -- submission flow obviously has been very good which has allowed us to grow nicely."

We are pleased to report second quarter 2017 operating results that outperformed last year's second quarter. Our 98.3% property casualty combined ratio for the second quarter of this year was 1 full point better than a year ago.
It's also important to note that 98.3% was an improvement from the first quarter of 2017 despite an unfavorable effect from higher catastrophe losses. On a basis before catastrophe effects, our second quarter 2017 combined ratio was better than both the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. We believe these improving trends bode well for the second half of 2017.
Other good news for the second quarter of 2017 includes another solid quarter for our investment results and premium growth that continues to outpace the industry. Our associates continue their steady efforts to support the outstanding local independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance as they carefully underwrite each policy and provide personal service to agents and their clients. We believe we'll continue to see benefits over the long term from our various initiatives designed to support profitable growth in each of our insurance segments.
Our commercial line segment grew net written premiums 2% and returned to producing an underwriting profit in the second quarter and for the first half of the year. Overall, commercial line's estimated average pricing improved slightly from the first quarter of 2017, most notably for commercial auto. As Mike will explain further, our commercial casualty line of business returned to a more typical level of profitability.
Although a high level of catastrophe losses continues to challenge our personal line segment, it reported another quarter of nice growth for both middle-market and high net worth premiums. Estimated average pricing for personal lines in total was in line with the first quarter of 2017, again with significant personal auto rate increases where needed.
Our excess and surplus lines segment reported another excellent quarter, including a combined ratio of 66.2% and premium growth of 20%. Cincinnati Re logged another quarter of strong underwriting results with steady premium growth in the combined ratio just under 80%.
The third quarter of 2017 marks 2 years since Cincinnati Re began assuming risks and generating premiums. Through the second quarter of this year, its cumulative net underwriting profit totaled $20 million on $183 million of net written premiums and an estimated combined ratio of 81%.
Our life insurance subsidiary continued its steady contribution to net income while growing second quarter 2017 term life insurance earned premiums by 8%. The steady growth of our life company, our E&S company and our reinsurance assumed division diversifies our business, helping to smooth results over time.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio was 3.2% for the second quarter and 7.0% for the first half of the year.
We are on pace for another year that reaches our long-term target of 10% to 13% annual average. Each day brings new challenges to insurance companies. We see them as opportunities for our associates to compete and to deliver value to agencies and policyholders. We know that can translate into long-term shareholder value.
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight other key areas of our financial performance and financial condition."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start my remarks with some highlights of our investment results.Second quarter 2017 was our 16th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 1% for the quarter, and",618,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start my remarks with some highlights of our investment results.
Second quarter 2017 was our 16th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 1% for the quarter, and 2% for the first 6 months. As in recent quarters, both interest and dividend income growth contributed or contributed to growth.
Our equity portfolio again reported growth in unrealized gains, up 6% for the quarter to nearly $2.6 billion. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield was 4.42% for the second quarter of 2017, down 22 basis points from last year's second quarter.
Taxable bonds purchased during the second quarter of 2017 had an average pretax yield of 3.75%, and purchased tax-exempt bonds averaged 3.33% for a blended yield of 3.53%.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30 was 5.2 years, matching March 31, and up slightly from 5 years at the end of December.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 6 months of 2017 totaled $445 million, down $54 million or 11% from the first half of last year. An $85 million increase in catastrophe losses paid this year was a key contributor to the decrease.
Careful management of expenses continues to be a priority, including investing strategically in our business. Our second quarter 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratio improved slightly, and the 6 month ratio was in line with a year ago.
Next, I'll comment on reserves. We again experience net favorable development on prior accident years as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the second quarter of 2017, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.2 percentage points. That was down 1.2 points from a year ago but fairly close to the 3.5 points we averaged over the past 3 calendar years.
Our largest line of business, commercial casualty, returning -- returned to experiencing favorable reserve development for the second quarter of 2017. With a ratio of 2.5%, that line was similar to its longer-term ratios, which averaged 2.6 points over the past 3 calendar years.
Our commercial casualty second quarter 2017 loss and loss expense ratio of 57.7%, combined with an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32-or-so, indicates an estimated combined ratio of just under 90%. 
Favorable reserve development for the first 6 months of 2017 continued to be spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 51% for accident year 2016, 12% for accident year 2015, 15% for accident year 2014 and 22% for 2013 and prior accident years.
Touching briefly on capital management. Our approach and financial strength remains stable. During the second quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares at an average price per share of $69.73. As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio.
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.09. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.41. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.29. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.54, and we declared $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.90 during the second quarter to a record $44.97 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Yes, the submission flow is up this year, we're pleased about that. To tag on to Steve's comments a little bit earlier, the -- I guess, the classification, if you will, of the business we're writing is kind of reflective of a generalist approach that our agencies take. We don't really have a strategy of going after a line of business or an industry classification. We're pleased that 44% of what we write in the E&S is attached to a P&C account. But our agencies write closing in on $3 billion in E&S business in their agencies in total. And so what we're trying to do, just with the model we have is just to continue to compete for primarily, that book of business that they already have. We think we've got a pretty good value proposition on the E&S side, and do what we can to write that seasoned business just within those agencies right now. So we're very pleased with the submission flow. There's a lot of competition, particularly in larger accounts in the E&S where carriers are taking accounts out of the E&S business into the standard market. We've got a pretty conservative appetite in this. I mean, what we're -- I guess, in some respects, we play on the fringe of E&S versus standard. So it's not surprising that some of our accounts would go back into the standard market during a softer market the way that it is right now, but notwithstanding the fact we're losing some of that business to the standard market, we're -- the submission flow obviously has been very good which has allowed us to grow nicely."

We are pleased to report second quarter 2017 operating results that outperformed last year's second quarter. Our 98.3% property casualty combined ratio for the second quarter of this year was 1 full point better than a year ago.
It's also important to note that 98.3% was an improvement from the first quarter of 2017 despite an unfavorable effect from higher catastrophe losses. On a basis before catastrophe effects, our second quarter 2017 combined ratio was better than both the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. We believe these improving trends bode well for the second half of 2017.
Other good news for the second quarter of 2017 includes another solid quarter for our investment results and premium growth that continues to outpace the industry. Our associates continue their steady efforts to support the outstanding local independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance as they carefully underwrite each policy and provide personal service to agents and their clients. We believe we'll continue to see benefits over the long term from our various initiatives designed to support profitable growth in each of our insurance segments.
Our commercial line segment grew net written premiums 2% and returned to producing an underwriting profit in the second quarter and for the first half of the year. Overall, commercial line's estimated average pricing improved slightly from the first quarter of 2017, most notably for commercial auto. As Mike will explain further, our commercial casualty line of business returned to a more typical level of profitability.
Although a high level of catastrophe losses continues to challenge our personal line segment, it reported another quarter of nice growth for both middle-market and high net worth premiums. Estimated average pricing for personal lines in total was in line with the first quarter of 2017, again with significant personal auto rate increases where needed.
Our excess and surplus lines segment reported another excellent quarter, including a combined ratio of 66.2% and premium growth of 20%. Cincinnati Re logged another quarter of strong underwriting results with steady premium growth in the combined ratio just under 80%.
The third quarter of 2017 marks 2 years since Cincinnati Re began assuming risks and generating premiums. Through the second quarter of this year, its cumulative net underwriting profit totaled $20 million on $183 million of net written premiums and an estimated combined ratio of 81%.
Our life insurance subsidiary continued its steady contribution to net income while growing second quarter 2017 term life insurance earned premiums by 8%. The steady growth of our life company, our E&S company and our reinsurance assumed division diversifies our business, helping to smooth results over time.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio was 3.2% for the second quarter and 7.0% for the first half of the year.
We are on pace for another year that reaches our long-term target of 10% to 13% annual average. Each day brings new challenges to insurance companies. We see them as opportunities for our associates to compete and to deliver value to agencies and policyholders. We know that can translate into long-term shareholder value.
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight other key areas of our financial performance and financial condition."

I'll start my remarks with some highlights of our investment results.Second quarter 2017 was our 16th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 1% for the quarter, and",618,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll start my remarks with some highlights of our investment results.
Second quarter 2017 was our 16th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 1% for the quarter, and 2% for the first 6 months. As in recent quarters, both interest and dividend income growth contributed or contributed to growth.
Our equity portfolio again reported growth in unrealized gains, up 6% for the quarter to nearly $2.6 billion. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield was 4.42% for the second quarter of 2017, down 22 basis points from last year's second quarter.
Taxable bonds purchased during the second quarter of 2017 had an average pretax yield of 3.75%, and purchased tax-exempt bonds averaged 3.33% for a blended yield of 3.53%.
Our bond portfolio's effective duration at June 30 was 5.2 years, matching March 31, and up slightly from 5 years at the end of December.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 6 months of 2017 totaled $445 million, down $54 million or 11% from the first half of last year. An $85 million increase in catastrophe losses paid this year was a key contributor to the decrease.
Careful management of expenses continues to be a priority, including investing strategically in our business. Our second quarter 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratio improved slightly, and the 6 month ratio was in line with a year ago.
Next, I'll comment on reserves. We again experience net favorable development on prior accident years as we apply a consistent approach to setting overall reserves. For the second quarter of 2017, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 3.2 percentage points. That was down 1.2 points from a year ago but fairly close to the 3.5 points we averaged over the past 3 calendar years.
Our largest line of business, commercial casualty, returning -- returned to experiencing favorable reserve development for the second quarter of 2017. With a ratio of 2.5%, that line was similar to its longer-term ratios, which averaged 2.6 points over the past 3 calendar years.
Our commercial casualty second quarter 2017 loss and loss expense ratio of 57.7%, combined with an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32-or-so, indicates an estimated combined ratio of just under 90%. 
Favorable reserve development for the first 6 months of 2017 continued to be spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 51% for accident year 2016, 12% for accident year 2015, 15% for accident year 2014 and 22% for 2013 and prior accident years.
Touching briefly on capital management. Our approach and financial strength remains stable. During the second quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares at an average price per share of $69.73. As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of contributions during the second quarter to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio.
Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.09. Life insurance operations added $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.41. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the fixed income portfolio net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.29. The change in unrealized gains at June 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.54, and we declared $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.90 during the second quarter to a record $44.97 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Yes, the submission flow is up this year, we're pleased about that. To tag on to Steve's comments a little bit earlier, the -- I guess, the classification, if you will, of the business we're writing is kind of reflective of a generalist approach that our agencies take. We don't really have a strategy of going after a line of business or an industry classification. We're pleased that 44% of what we write in the E&S is attached to a P&C account. But our agencies write closing in on $3 billion in E&S business in their agencies in total. And so what we're trying to do, just with the model we have is just to continue to compete for primarily, that book of business that they already have. We think we've got a pretty good value proposition on the E&S side, and do what we can to write that seasoned business just within those agencies right now. So we're very pleased with the submission flow. There's a lot of competition, particularly in larger accounts in the E&S where carriers are taking accounts out of the E&S business into the standard market. We've got a pretty conservative appetite in this. I mean, what we're -- I guess, in some respects, we play on the fringe of E&S versus standard. So it's not surprising that some of our accounts would go back into the standard market during a softer market the way that it is right now, but notwithstanding the fact we're losing some of that business to the standard market, we're -- the submission flow obviously has been very good which has allowed us to grow nicely."

I think I'd also like to make the point that if we just look at the ex cat accident year for the quarter, vis–à–vis longer-term trends, including each of the full last 3 years, it's very much in line."

Thank you for getting us today to hear more about our third quarter 2017 results. While the past quarter presents -- presented challenges, we see several positives regarding future prospects for improved operating performance. First, our third quarter and 9 months 2017 property casualty combined ratios stayed just under 100%, putting us in a good position to earn an underwriting profit for the sixth consecutive year, consistent with one of our primary long-term objectives.
Second, we reported a 9-month current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe losses of 91.9%. While that was 0.7 higher than accident year 2016 at 9 months, the high erasure of losses of $1 million or more for claim largely contributed to that variance. And we know large losses tend to vary particularly over relatively short-term periods.
We also gained confidence from internal reports and observations that our underwriters continue to obtain relatively higher renewal pricing on expiring policies that our models and judgment indicate have relatively weaker pricing. That's an ongoing results of segmenting our portfolio of accounts through careful underwriting of risks covered by individual policies.
I'll take a moment to comment on Cincinnati Re, our reinsurance assumed operation. Following a very favorable contribution to profit during the first 2 years since its inception, Cincinnati Re experienced a quarter of sizeable catastrophe loss effects which happen from time to time in the reinsurance industry. That loss experience was consistent with our models and projections for significant depressive events. 
Our underwriters and analysts are experienced subject matter experts who knows how to balance qualitative and quantitative aspects of reinsurance decision-making. So far in 2017, we've assessed nearly 500 potential reinsurance transactions, declining approximately 80% of them, very consistent with the prior 2 years. 
History shows that the tendency for affirming reinsurance premium rates, following period similar to the recent spike in the industry losses translated into near-term opportunity and we are well prepared to take advantage of it. We recognize the long-term benefits of risk diversification, and Cincinnati Re should continue to help diversify our business and smooth results over time.
Turning to premium growth. We continue to grow premiums in a disciplined fashion for each of our insurance segments. While overall premium growth for our commercial line segment slowed during the third quarter 2017, renewal written premiums continue to rise, and we reported a combined ratio of 95.2%.
Overall, commercial line's estimated average price increases were similar to the second quarter with higher pricing for commercial auto with notable exception.
For our personal line segment, third quarter premium growth continued at a nice pace. The personal lines 2017 combined ratio before catastrophe effects improved for both the third quarter and first 9 months, partially offsetting the higher level of catastrophe losses for both periods.
Estimated average premium rate increases for personal lines in total were slightly higher than in the second quarter of 2017 with personal auto average rate increases reaching the high single-digit range. 
Our excess of surplus lines segment reported another strong quarter of underlying profit and premium growth, and has a 9-month 2017 combined ratio of under 70%. 
Our life insurance subsidiary again made a good contribution to net income, growing third quarter 2017 term life insurance and premiums by 5% and helping to diversify our earning sources.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio was 3.1% for the third quarter and 10.3% for the first 9 months of the year. We're still on pace for another year that reaches our long-term target of a 10% to 13% annual average. 
Despite the third quarter being a challenging one in terms of operating results for us and the P&C industry, we continue to embrace opportunities every day to deliver long-term value to shareholders and outstanding service to the agencies that represent the company and their clients.
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight investment results, reserve development and other key areas of our financial performance and financial condition."

Dividend income was up 10% for the quarter, and interest income was up 1%. The double-digit growth in dividend income will make a tough comparison in 2018.
Since the beginning of 2014, we have reported quarterly dividend growth ranging from 2% to 19%. Such a variability can result from irregular patterns for dividend payments such as a special dividends that can occur any time. For our portfolio, they tend to occur in the fourth quarter.
Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of growth in unrealized gains, up 7% for the quarter to more than $2.7 billion. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield was 4.43% for the third quarter of 2017, down 20 basis points from last year's third quarter.  That yield decline reflects the effect of higher-yielding bonds that continue to be called or that mature. While we reported another quarter of interest income growth, the third quarter 1% growth rate is well below the recent peak of 4% we reported for each of the first 2 quarters of last year.
Taxable bonds purchased during the third quarter 2017 had an average pretax yield of 3.81%, and purchased tax-exempt bonds averaged 3.15% for a blended yield of 3.55%, while bond portfolio effective duration did not change.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 9 months of 2017 totaled $746 million, down $89 million or 11% for the same period a year ago. A $103 million increase in catastrophe losses and loss expenses paid this year was a key contributor to the decrease.
Once again, we carefully managed expenses during the quarter while at the same time investing strategically in our business. Our third quarter and 9-month 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratios improved somewhat from comparable 2016 periods.
Moving to loss reserves. Our consistent approach of setting overall reserves again resulted on net favorable development on prior accident years. For the third quarter 2017, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 1.16 percentage points, somewhat lower than a typical quarter in recent years.
Development for each of our major lines of business was favorable with the exception of auto and also commercial casualty, which is our largest line of business. 
Reserve development for commercial casualty was essentially flat for the third quarter of 2017 as we reported a net unfavorable amount of less than $1 million. Paid losses and loss expenses were higher than in any quarters since the beginning of 2015 and part due to an increase in large losses.
On a case-incurred basis, the ratio losses and loss expenses was approximately 2 percentage points better than the first half of 2017, but it remains approximately 4 points worse than the average for the prior 2 years. After considering these trends for commercial casualty, we maintained our consistent with prudent approach of setting reserves, including IBNR reserves that resulted in basically no favorable or unfavorable prior accident-year development for the quarter in a 9-month current accident-year loss, and loss expense ratio approximately 2 percentage points higher than the full year 2016.
Our commercial casualty third quarter 2017 loss and loss expense ratio of 63.2% combined with an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32 points or so, indicates an estimated combined ratio of approximately 95%.  In total, favorable reserve development for the first 9 months of 2017 continued to be spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 53% for accident year 2016, 7% for accident year 2015, 19% for accident year 2014, and 21% for 2013 and prior accident years.
Regarding capital management, our approach and financial strength remains stable. We have excellent financial flexibility, including September 30 holding company cash and marketable securities that rose 16% from the year-end 2016. 
To conclude, I'll summarize third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers to our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.04. Life insurance operations also added $0.04. Investment income other than in life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.54. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.05. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.72, and we declared a $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.89 during the third quarter to a record $45.86 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

They worked relentlessly to respond to our agents and policyholders affected by our hurricanes RV and Irma. With our claims team leading the way, associates from on all across the company jumped into action to help whatever they could. Storms of this magnitude leave widespread damage in the community, and widespread concern about how to get back to normal. This is one of our associates shine, calming those fears, upholding the repetition of our agents, and delivering on the value of Cincinnati Insurance policy.
The start of the fourth quarter didn't bring much relief to our country as community continued to experience devastating loss from both Hurricane Nate and the California wildfires. Our hearts go out to the families and businesses, including our own policyhorders affected by these events.
In terms of losses, we estimate insured losses for our company will be less than $1 million for each of these fourth quarter events. We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting them in person with many of you during the remainder of the year.
As a reminder, with Mike and me today, are Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Martin Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer. James, please open the call for questions."

We tried to look at each risk individually on the merits. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we've been very disciplined in the ones that we accept. And a number of measures are looked at and will continue to be looked at obviously what we estimate the expected combined ratio would be. We do look at, as we're looking at lack of correlation with our regular business, we will look and try to estimate what you think the change in the T bar, the [ 1 and 250 ] year -- will be in a combination with our already existing book in terms of the capital needed -- what type of return we can get on that. We look at rate on lines from a judgment factor. So -- and to me, it really always comes down to the people, and we have a very experienced team there that been hired -- and are very confident in their ability going forward to be, even in a stronger position than we are now. I think exception to date -- was probably the worst quarter in memory in terms of reinsurance losses. We're maybe about $13 million in the whole, inception to date, and that's something that really, with a good fourth quarter, we could bring it back to breakeven or near breakeven by the end of the year and perfectly positioned, I think, as we move forward into next year."

Things  have changed there over that period of time in terms of what we're seeing with the assignment the benefits of the recognition of what that can bring, -- different players settling claims, and maybe a better appreciation of the degree of adjusters that are available to settle the claims and what that means. So I think that there is a kind of a wake-up call in terms of everybody understanding or being reminded of the type of risks that's out there. But I do say, in terms of our approach, it's going to be very consistent to what we have done. But we will recognize these factors."

I am confident that there will be firming. I think we're -- it'll be interesting to see as how broad is the firming relative to contracts that had losses versus contracts that didn't.

Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter 2017 results. While the past quarter presented challenges, we see several positives regarding future prospects for improved operating performance. First, our third quarter and 9 month 2017 property casualty combined ratios stayed just under 100%, putting us in a good position to earn an underwriting profit for the sixth consecutive year, consistent with one of our primary long-term objectives.
Second, we reported a 9-month current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe losses of 91.9%. While that was 0.7 point higher than accident year 2016 at 9 months, the higher ratio for losses of $1 million or more for claim largely contributed to that variance. And we know large losses tend to vary particularly over relatively short-term periods.
We also gained confidence from internal reports and observations that our underwriters continue to obtain relatively higher renewal pricing on expiring policies that our models and judgment indicate have relatively weaker pricing. That's an ongoing result of segmenting our portfolio of accounts through careful underwriting of risks covered by individual policies.
I'll take a moment to comment on Cincinnati Re, our reinsurance-assumed operation. Following a very favorable contribution to profit during the first 2 years since its inception, Cincinnati Re experienced a quarter of sizeable catastrophe loss effects which happen from time to time in the reinsurance industry. That loss experience was consistent with our models and projections for significant catastrophe events. 
Our underwriters and analysts are experienced subject matter experts who understand how to balance qualitative and quantitative aspects of reinsurance decision-making. So far in 2017, we've assessed nearly 500 potential reinsurance transactions, declining approximately 80% of them, a rate consistent with the prior 2 years. 
History shows that the tendency for affirming reinsurance premium rates, following period similar to the recent spike in industry losses translates into near-term opportunity and we are well prepared to take advantage of it. We recognize the long-term benefits of risk diversification, and Cincinnati Re should continue to help diversify our business and smooth results over time.
Turning to premium growth. We continue to grow premiums in a disciplined fashion for each of our insurance segments. While overall premium growth for our commercial line segment slowed during the third quarter of 2017, renewal-written premiums continue to rise, and we reported a combined ratio of 95.2%.
Overall, commercial line's estimated average price increases were similar to the second quarter with higher pricing for commercial auto, the notable exception.
For our personal lines segment, third quarter premium growth continued at a nice pace. The personal lines 2017 combined ratio before catastrophe effects improved for both the third quarter and first 9 months, partially offsetting the higher level of catastrophe losses for both periods.
Estimated average premium rate increases for personal lines in total were slightly higher than in the second quarter of 2017, with personal auto average rate increases reaching the high single-digit range. 
Our excess and surplus lines segment reported another strong quarter of underwriting profit and premium growth, and has a 9-month 2017 combined ratio of under 70%. 
Our life insurance subsidiary again made a good contribution to net income, growing third quarter 2017 term life insurance earned premiums by 5% and helping to diversify our earning sources.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio was 3.1% for the third quarter and 10.3% for the first 9 months of the year. We're still on pace for another year that reaches our long-term target of a 10% to 13% annual average. 
Despite the third quarter being a challenging one in terms of operating results for us and the P&C industry, we continue to embrace opportunities every day to deliver long-term value to shareholders and outstanding service to the agencies that represent the company and their clients.
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight investment results, reserve development and other key areas of our financial performance and financial condition."

Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. The third quarter 2017 was our 17th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 3% for the quarter and 2% for the first 9 months of the year. Dividend income was up 10% fo",821,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. The third quarter 2017 was our 17th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 3% for the quarter and 2% for the first 9 months of the year. Dividend income was up 10% for the quarter, and interest income was up 1%. The double-digit growth in dividend income will make a tough comparison in 2018.
Since the beginning of 2014, we have reported quarterly dividend growth ranging from 2% to 19%. Such a variability can result from irregular patterns for dividend payments such as a special dividends that can occur any time. For our portfolio, they tend to occur in the fourth quarter.
Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of growth in unrealized gains, up 7% for the quarter to more than $2.7 billion. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield was 4.43% for the third quarter of 2017, down 20 basis points from last year's third quarter. That yield decline reflects the effect of higher-yielding bonds that continue to be called or that mature. While we reported another quarter of interest income growth, the third quarter 1% growth rate is well below the recent peak of 4% we reported for each of the first 2 quarters of last year.
Taxable bonds purchased during the third quarter 2017 had an average pretax yield of 3.81%, and purchased tax-exempt bonds averaged 3.15% for a blended yield of 3.55%, while bond portfolio effective duration did not change.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 9 months of 2017 totaled $746 million, down $89 million or 11% for the same period a year ago. A $103 million increase in catastrophe losses and loss expenses paid this year was a key contributor to the decrease.
Once again, we carefully managed expenses during the quarter while at the same time investing strategically in our business. Our third quarter and 9-month 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratios improved somewhat from comparable 2016 periods.
Moving to loss reserves. Our consistent approach of setting overall reserves again resulted in net favorable development on prior accident years. For the third quarter of 2017, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 1.16 percentage points, somewhat lower than a typical quarter in recent years.
Development for each of our major lines of business was favorable with the exception of auto and also commercial casualty, which is our largest line of business. 
Reserve development for commercial casualty was essentially flat for the third quarter of 2017 as we reported a net unfavorable amount of less than $1 million. Paid losses and loss expenses were higher than in any quarters since the beginning of 2015 and part due to an increase in large losses.
On a case-incurred basis, the ratio of losses and loss expenses was approximately 2 percentage points better than the first half of 2017, but it remains approximately 4 points worse than the average for the prior 2 years. After considering these trends for commercial casualty, we maintained our consistently prudent approach of setting reserves, including IBNR reserves that resulted in basically no favorable or unfavorable prior accident year development for the quarter in a 9-month current accident year loss, and loss expense ratio approximately 2 percentage points higher than the full year 2016.
Our commercial casualty third quarter 2017 loss and loss expense ratio of 63.2%, combined with an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32 points or so, indicates an estimated combined ratio of approximately 95%. In total, favorable reserve development for the first 9 months of 2017 continued to be spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 53% for accident year 2016, 7% for accident year 2015, 19% for accident year 2014, and 21% for 2013 and prior accident years.
Regarding capital management, our approach and financial strength remains stable. We have excellent financial flexibility, including September 30 holding company cash and marketable securities that rose 16% from the year-end 2016. 
To conclude, I'll summarize third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers to our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.04. Life insurance operations also added $0.04. Investment income other than in life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.54. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.05. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.72, and we declared a $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.89 during the third quarter to a record $45.86 per share.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

They worked relentlessly to respond to our agents and policyholders affected by our hurricanes Harvey and Irma. With our claims team leading the way, associates from all across the company jumped into action to help wherever they could. Storms of this magnitude leave widespread damage in the community, and widespread concern about how to get back to normal. This is when our associates shine, calming those fears, upholding the reputation of our agents, and delivering on the value of Cincinnati Insurance policy.
The start of the fourth quarter didn't bring much relief to our country as communities continued to experience devastating loss from both Hurricane Nate and the California wildfires. Our hearts go out to the families and businesses, including our own policyholders affected by these events.
In terms of losses, we estimate insured losses for our company will be less than $1 million for each of these fourth quarter events. We appreciate this opportunity to respond to your questions and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you during the remainder of the year.
As a reminder, with Mike and me today, are Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer. James, please open the call for questions."

From the beginning, we've been very consistent and not focusing on growth but to try to focus on profitability, to focus on returns with each contract that if, for example, we did not set up a specific company for Cincinnati Re with capital that had to be used for a return, we tried to look at each risk individually on the merits. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we've been very disciplined in the ones that we accept. And a number of measures are looked at and will continue to be looked at, obviously, what we estimate the expected combined ratio would be. We do look at, as we're looking at lack of correlation with our regular business, we will look and try to estimate what you think the change in the TVAR, the 1-and-250 year will be in combination with our already existing book in terms of the capital needed -- what type of return we can get on that. We look at rate on lines from a judgment factor. So -- and to me, it really always comes down to the people, and we have a very experienced team there that has been hired and are very confident in their ability going forward to be even in a stronger position than we are now. I think inception to date was probably the worst quarter in memory in terms of reinsurance losses. We're maybe about $13 million in the whole inception to date, and that's something that really, with a good fourth quarter, we could bring it back to breakeven or near breakeven by the end of the year and perfectly positioned, I think, as we move forward into next year."

Things have changed there over that period of time in terms of what we're seeing with assignment of benefits and the recognition of what that can bring, different players settling claims, and maybe a better appreciation of the degree of adjusters that are available to settle the claims and what that means.

I am confident that there will be firming. I think we're -- it'll be interesting to see as how broad is the firming relative to contracts that had losses versus contracts that didn't. How long might that firming last with the capital that is out there, how might it move from the property to the casualty. I think there are a lot of unknowns.

In personal lines, we were up 34% new business this year, for example. High net worth was up, not surprisingly a big percentage, almost 90%. California's up and running very nicely. We're pleased with the reception we got out there. Massachusetts just went live. And Washington state, in August, went live. So we're now it all of the parts of the country that are centers of high net worth: Long Island, New York; Westchester County, New Jersey; Massachusetts; Texas; and California. We'll continue to open other states that would be the kinds of states were secondary residences will be located, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, places of that nature -- Hawaii. So I think in terms of setting the infrastructure up, we're in good shape. Out west, for example, you heard Steve mentioned that we did not suffer many wildfire losses. We had some exposure in those areas but we've also established our wildfire defense services that will go out and protect individual homes with a specific care. So we're pleased with the work that we've done there. So I think between our reputation as a company with agencies and [indiscernible] reputation in the industry, we've been able to get into all the agencies that we would like to get into. We're consistent approach there relative to a relatively few number of appointments. And we have a fairly, thankfully, a fairly long list of agencies that do want to do business with us but we're committed to the initial appointments. So I think we're obviously pleased, the premiums come in well. We're pleased with the quality of the business that we were writing there. So I'd say it's been a great start."

Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter 2017 results. While the past quarter presented challenges, we see several positives regarding future prospects for improved operating performance. First, our third quarter and 9-month 2017 property casualty combined ratios stayed just under 100%, putting us in a good position to earn an underwriting profit for the sixth consecutive year, consistent with one of our primary long-term objectives.
Second, we reported a 9-month current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe losses of 91.9%. While that was 0.7 point higher than accident year 2016 at 9 months, the higher ratio for losses of $1 million or more for claim largely contributed to that variance. And we know large losses tend to vary particularly over relatively short-term periods.
We also gained confidence from internal reports and observations that our underwriters continue to obtain relatively higher renewal pricing on expiring policies that our models and judgment indicate have relatively weaker pricing. That's an ongoing result of segmenting our portfolio of accounts through careful underwriting of risks covered by individual policies.
I'll take a moment to comment on Cincinnati Re, our reinsurance-assumed operation. Following a very favorable contribution to profit during the first 2 years since its inception, Cincinnati Re experienced a quarter of sizeable catastrophe loss effects, which happen from time to time in the reinsurance industry. That loss experience was consistent with our models and projections for significant catastrophe events. 
Our underwriters and analysts are experienced subject matter experts who understand how to balance qualitative and quantitative aspects of reinsurance decision-making. So far in 2017, we've assessed nearly 500 potential reinsurance transactions, declining approximately 80% of them, a rate consistent with the prior 2 years. 
History shows that the tendency for affirming reinsurance premium rates, following periods similar to the recent spike in industry losses, translates into near-term opportunity and we are well prepared to take advantage of it. We recognize the long-term benefits of risk diversification, and Cincinnati Re should continue to help diversify our business and smooth results over time.
Turning to premium growth. We continue to grow premiums in a disciplined fashion for each of our insurance segments. While overall premium growth for our commercial line segment slowed during the third quarter of 2017, renewal-written premiums continue to rise, and we reported a combined ratio of 95.2%.
Overall, commercial line's estimated average price increases were similar to the second quarter with higher pricing for commercial auto, the notable exception.
For our personal lines segment, third quarter premium growth continued at a nice pace. The personal lines 2017 combined ratio before catastrophe effects improved for both the third quarter and first 9 months, partially offsetting the higher level of catastrophe losses for both periods.
Estimated average premium rate increases for personal lines in total were slightly higher than in the second quarter of 2017, with personal auto average rate increases reaching the high single-digit range. 
Our excess and surplus lines segment reported another strong quarter of underwriting profit and premium growth, and has a 9-month 2017 combined ratio of under 70%. 
Our life insurance subsidiary again made a good contribution to net income, growing third quarter 2017 term life insurance earned premiums by 5% and helping to diversify our earning sources.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, was 3.1% for the third quarter and 10.3% for the first 9 months of the year. We're still on pace for another year that reaches our long-term target of a 10% to 13% annual average. 
Despite the third quarter being a challenging one in terms of operating results for us and the P&C industry, we continue to embrace opportunities every day to deliver long-term value to shareholders and outstanding service to the agencies that represent the company and their clients.
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight investment results, reserve development and other key areas of our financial performance and financial condition."
260681,539414031,1323555,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2017",2017-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Third quarter 2017 was our 17th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 3% for the quarter and 2% for the first 9 months of the year. Dividend income was up 10% for th",817,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Third quarter 2017 was our 17th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 3% for the quarter and 2% for the first 9 months of the year. Dividend income was up 10% for the quarter, and interest income was up 1%. The double-digit growth in dividend income will make a tough comparison in 2018.
Since the beginning of 2014, we have reported quarterly dividend growth ranging from 2% to 19%. Such variability can result from irregular patterns for dividend payments such as special dividends that can occur any time. For our portfolio, they tend to occur in the fourth quarter.
Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of growth in unrealized gains, up 7% for the quarter to more than $2.7 billion. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield was 4.43% for the third quarter of 2017, down 20 basis points from last year's third quarter. That yield decline reflects the effect of higher-yielding bonds that continue to be called or that mature. While we reported another quarter of interest income growth, the third quarter 1% growth rate is well below the recent peak of 4% we reported for each of the first 2 quarters of last year.
Taxable bonds purchased during the third quarter 2017 had an average pretax yield of 3.81%, and purchased tax-exempt bonds averaged 3.15% for a blended yield of 3.55%, while bond portfolio effective duration did not change.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 9 months of 2017 totaled $746 million, down $89 million or 11% for the same period a year ago. A $103 million increase in catastrophe losses and loss expenses paid this year was a key contributor to the decrease.
Once again, we carefully managed expenses during the quarter while at the same time investing strategically in our business. Our third quarter and 9-month 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratios improved somewhat from comparable 2016 periods.
Moving to loss reserves. Our consistent approach of setting overall reserves again resulted in net favorable development on prior accident years. For the third quarter of 2017, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 1.6 percentage points, somewhat lower than a typical quarter in recent years.
Development for each of our major lines of business was favorable with the exception of auto and also commercial casualty, which is our largest line of business. 
Reserve development for commercial casualty was essentially flat for the third quarter of 2017 as we reported a net unfavorable amount of less than $1 million. Paid losses and loss expenses were higher than in any quarters since the beginning of 2015 and part due to an increase in large losses.
On a case-incurred basis, the ratio of losses and loss expenses was approximately 2 percentage points better than the first half of 2017, but it remains approximately 4 points worse than the average for the prior 2 years. After considering these trends for commercial casualty, we maintained our consistently prudent approach of setting reserves, including IBNR reserves that resulted in basically no favorable or unfavorable prior accident year development for the quarter in a 9-month current accident year loss, and loss expense ratio approximately 2 percentage points higher than the full year 2016.
Our commercial casualty third quarter 2017 loss and loss expense ratio of 63.2%, combined with an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32 points or so, indicates an estimated combined ratio of approximately 95%. In total, favorable reserve development for the first 9 months of 2017 continued to be spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 53% for accident year 2016, 7% for accident year 2015, 19% for accident year 2014, and 21% for 2013 and prior accident years.
Regarding capital management, our approach and financial strength remains stable. We have excellent financial flexibility, including September 30 holding company cash and marketable securities that rose 16% from the year-end 2016. 
To conclude, I'll summarize third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers to our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.04. Life insurance operations also added $0.04. Investment income other than in life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.54. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.05. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.72, and we declared $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.89 during the third quarter to a record $45.86 per share.
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

I think inception to date was probably the worst quarter in memory in terms of reinsurance losses. We're maybe about $13 million in the whole inception to date, and that's something that really, with a good fourth quarter, we could bring it back to breakeven or near breakeven by the end of the year and perfectly positioned, I think, as we move forward into next year."

And I think also, it's been a long time since there was an event in Florida. Things have changed there over that period of time in terms of what we're seeing with assignment of benefits and a recognition of what that can bring, different players settling claims, and maybe a better appreciation of the degree of adjusters that are available to settle the claims and what that means. So I think that there is a kind of a wake-up call in terms of everybody understanding or being reminded of the type of risks that's out there.

So we're now in all of the parts of the country that are centers of high net worth: Long Island, New York; Westchester County; New Jersey; Massachusetts; Texas; and California. We'll continue to open other states that would be the kinds of states where secondary residences would be located: Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, places of that nature -- Hawaii. So I think in terms of setting the infrastructure up, we're in good shape. Out west, for example, you heard Steve mentioned that we did not suffer many wildfire losses. We had some exposure in those areas, but we've also established our wildfire defense services that will go out and protect individual homes with specific care. So we're pleased with the work that we've done there. So I think between our reputation as a company with agencies and Will Van Den Heuvel's reputation in the industry, we've been able to get into all the agencies that we would like to get into. We're consistent approach there relative to a relatively few number of appointments. And we have a fairly, thankfully, a fairly long list of agencies that do want to do business with us, but we're committed to the initial appointments. So I think we're obviously pleased. The premiums coming in well. We're pleased with the quality of the business that we -- we're writing there. So I'd say it's been a great start."

While the past quarter presented challenges, we see several positives regarding future prospects for improved operating performance. Fir",664,"Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter 2017 results. While the past quarter presented challenges, we see several positives regarding future prospects for improved operating performance. First, our third quarter and 9-month 2017 property casualty combined ratios stayed just under 100%, putting us in a good position to earn an underwriting profit for the sixth consecutive year, consistent with one of our primary long-term objectives.
Second, we reported a 9-month current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe losses of 91.9%. While that was 0.7 point higher than accident year 2016 at 9 months, the higher ratio for losses of $1 million or more for claim largely contributed to that variance. And we know large losses tend to vary particularly over relatively short-term periods.
We also gained confidence from internal reports and observations that our underwriters continue to obtain relatively higher renewal pricing on expiring policies that our models and judgment indicate have relatively weaker pricing. That's an ongoing result of segmenting our portfolio of accounts through careful underwriting of risks covered by individual policies.
I'll take a moment to comment on Cincinnati Re, our reinsurance-assumed operation. Following a very favorable contribution to profit during the first 2 years since its inception, Cincinnati Re experienced a quarter of sizeable catastrophe loss effects, which happen from time to time in the reinsurance industry. That loss experience was consistent with our models and projections for significant catastrophe events. 
Our underwriters and analysts are experienced subject matter experts who understand how to balance qualitative and quantitative aspects of reinsurance decision-making. So far in 2017, we've assessed nearly 500 potential reinsurance transactions, declining approximately 80% of them, a rate consistent with the prior 2 years. 
History shows that the tendency for affirming reinsurance premium rates, following periods similar to the recent spike in industry losses, translates into near-term opportunity and we are well prepared to take advantage of it. We recognize the long-term benefits of risk diversification, and Cincinnati Re should continue to help diversify our business and smooth results over time.
Turning to premium growth. We continue to grow premiums in a disciplined fashion for each of our insurance segments. While overall premium growth for our commercial line segment slowed during the third quarter of 2017, renewal-written premiums continue to rise, and we reported a combined ratio of 95.2%.
Overall, commercial line's estimated average price increases were similar to the second quarter with higher pricing for commercial auto, the notable exception.
For our personal lines segment, third quarter premium growth continued at a nice pace. The personal lines 2017 combined ratio before catastrophe effects improved for both the third quarter and first 9 months, partially offsetting the higher level of catastrophe losses for both periods.
Estimated average premium rate increases for personal lines in total were slightly higher than in the second quarter of 2017, with personal auto average rate increases reaching the high single-digit range. 
Our excess and surplus lines segment reported another strong quarter of underwriting profit and premium growth, and has a 9-month 2017 combined ratio of under 70%. 
Our life insurance subsidiary again made a good contribution to net income, growing third quarter 2017 term life insurance earned premiums by 5% and helping to diversify our earning sources.
Our primary measure of financial performance, the value creation ratio, was 3.1% for the third quarter and 10.3% for the first 9 months of the year. We're still on pace for another year that reaches our long-term target of a 10% to 13% annual average. 
Despite the third quarter being a challenging one in terms of operating results for us and the P&C industry, we continue to embrace opportunities every day to deliver long-term value to shareholders and outstanding service to the agencies that represent the company and their clients.
Next, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight investment results, reserve development and other key areas of our financial performance and financial condition."
260681,539414031,1325850,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2017",2017-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Cincinnati Financial Corporation","Executives","Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Third quarter 2017 was our 17th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 3% for the quarter and 2% for the first 9 months of the year. Dividend income was up 10% for th",817,"Great. Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Third quarter 2017 was our 17th consecutive quarter of investment income growth, rising 3% for the quarter and 2% for the first 9 months of the year. Dividend income was up 10% for the quarter, and interest income was up 1%. The double-digit growth in dividend income will make a tough comparison in 2018.
Since the beginning of 2014, we have reported quarterly dividend growth ranging from 2% to 19%. Such variability can result from irregular patterns for dividend payments such as special dividends that can occur any time. For our portfolio, they tend to occur in the fourth quarter.
Our equity portfolio experienced another quarter of growth in unrealized gains, up 7% for the quarter to more than $2.7 billion. The bond portfolio's pretax average yield was 4.43% for the third quarter of 2017, down 20 basis points from last year's third quarter. That yield decline reflects the effect of higher-yielding bonds that continue to be called or that mature. While we reported another quarter of interest income growth, the third quarter 1% growth rate is well below the recent peak of 4% we reported for each of the first 2 quarters of last year.
Taxable bonds purchased during the third quarter 2017 had an average pretax yield of 3.81%, and purchased tax-exempt bonds averaged 3.15% for a blended yield of 3.55%, while bond portfolio effective duration did not change.
Cash flow from operating activities continued to provide funds for our investment portfolio. Funds generated from net operating cash flows for the first 9 months of 2017 totaled $746 million, down $89 million or 11% for the same period a year ago. A $103 million increase in catastrophe losses and loss expenses paid this year was a key contributor to the decrease.
Once again, we carefully managed expenses during the quarter while at the same time investing strategically in our business. Our third quarter and 9-month 2017 property casualty underwriting expense ratios improved somewhat from comparable 2016 periods.
Moving to loss reserves. Our consistent approach of setting overall reserves again resulted in net favorable development on prior accident years. For the third quarter of 2017, favorable reserve development benefited our combined ratio by 1.6 percentage points, somewhat lower than a typical quarter in recent years.
Development for each of our major lines of business was favorable with the exception of auto and also commercial casualty, which is our largest line of business. 
Reserve development for commercial casualty was essentially flat for the third quarter of 2017 as we reported a net unfavorable amount of less than $1 million. Paid losses and loss expenses were higher than in any quarters since the beginning of 2015 and part due to an increase in large losses.
On a case-incurred basis, the ratio of losses and loss expenses was approximately 2 percentage points better than the first half of 2017, but it remains approximately 4 points worse than the average for the prior 2 years. After considering these trends for commercial casualty, we maintained our consistently prudent approach of setting reserves, including IBNR reserves that resulted in basically no favorable or unfavorable prior accident year development for the quarter in a 9-month current accident year loss, and loss expense ratio approximately 2 percentage points higher than the full year 2016.
Our commercial casualty third quarter 2017 loss and loss expense ratio of 63.2%, combined with an estimated underwriting expense ratio of 32 points or so, indicates an estimated combined ratio of approximately 95%. In total, favorable reserve development for the first 9 months of 2017 continued to be spread over most of our major lines of business and over several accident years, including 53% for accident year 2016, 7% for accident year 2015, 19% for accident year 2014, and 21% for 2013 and prior accident years.
Regarding capital management, our approach and financial strength remains stable. We have excellent financial flexibility, including September 30 holding company cash and marketable securities that rose 16% from the year-end 2016. 
To conclude, I'll summarize third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers to our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.04. Life insurance operations also added $0.04. Investment income other than in life insurance and reduced by noninsurance items contributed $0.54. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value per share by $0.05. The change in unrealized gains at September 30 for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses, increased book value by $0.72, and we declared $0.50 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.89 during the third quarter to a record $45.86 per share.
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

But if you look at our loss -- loss expense ratio that's in our supplementary on Page 13, looking at the last so many quarters, it's ranging from a low, kind of in the low 50s, up to the 60 -- up to 63.2. But let's wait and see. It's a long-term line. Let's -- we're going to follow what our actuaries say."

No, it will be a consistent approach. From the beginning, we've been very consistent and not focusing on growth but to try to focus on profitability, to focus on returns with each contract that if, for example, we did not set up a specific company for Cincinnati Re with capital that had to be used for a return, we try to look at each risk individually on the merits. As I've mentioned in my opening comments, we've been very disciplined in the ones that we accept. And a number of measures are looked at and will continue to be looked at, obviously, what we estimate the expected combined ratio would be. We do look at, as we're looking at lack of correlation with our regular business, we will look and try to estimate what you think the change in TVaR, the 1-in-250 year will be in combination with our already existing book in terms of the capital needed -- what type of return we can get on that. We look at rate on lines from a judgment factor. So -- and to me, it really always comes down to the people, and we have a very experienced team there that has been hired and are very confident in their ability going forward to be even in a stronger position than we are now. I think inception to date was probably the worst quarter in memory in terms of reinsurance losses. We're maybe about $13 million in the whole inception to date, and that's something that really, with a good fourth quarter, we could bring it back to breakeven or near breakeven by the end of the year and perfectly positioned, I think, as we move forward into next year."

Is there anything on the horizon, from your perspective that would make you change as how you think about your underwriting? And if so, doesn't that mean that there won't be a hard market? If not -- if they're not going to change underwriting standards, wouldn't that preclude a hard market?"

I do think it has been a wake-up call in terms of appreciation of risk. We had 3 hurricanes, 2 earthquakes. Now we've had a fourth storm in May, we got wildfires and there -- I think there is just a little bit of a renewed appreciation of what can happen all at the same time. And I think also, it's been a long time since there was an event in Florida. Things have changed there over that period of time in terms of what we're seeing with assignment of benefits and a recognition of what that can bring, different players settling claims, and maybe a better appreciation of the degree of adjusters that are available to settle the claims and what that means. So I think that there is a kind of a wake-up call in terms of everybody understanding or being reminded of the type of risks that's out there. But I do say, in terms of our approach, it's going to be very consistent to what we have done. But we will recognize these factors."

So again, I think we'll look in terms of -- does it diversify, how correlated it is. We'll run through everything we can to understand the risk quantitatively and qualitatively and really be a no pressure to grow. It will be interesting to see how the firming takes place. I am confident that there will be firming. I think we're -- it'll be interesting to see as how broad is the firming relative to contracts that had losses versus contracts that didn't. How long might that firming last with the capital that is out there, how might it move from the property to the casualty. I think there are a lot of unknowns. But I do think and agree with the kind of the consensus that we will be in a firming market here, certainly for the short to midterm."

In personal lines, we were up 34% new business this year, for example. High net worth was up, not surprisingly a big percentage, almost 90%. California's up and running very nicely. We're pleased with the reception we got out there. Massachusetts just went live. And Washington state, in August, went live. So we're now in all of the parts of the country that are centers of high net worth: Long Island, New York; Westchester County; New Jersey; Massachusetts; Texas; and California. We'll continue to open other states that would be the kinds of states where secondary residences would be located: Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, places of that nature -- Hawaii. So I think in terms of setting the infrastructure up, we're in good shape. Out west, for example, you heard Steve mentioned that we did not suffer many wildfire losses. We had some exposure in those areas, but we've also established our wildfire defense services that will go out and protect individual homes with specific care. So we're pleased with the work that we've done there. So I think between our reputation as a company with agencies and Will Van Den Heuvel's reputation in the industry, we've been able to get into all the agencies that we would like to get into. We're consistent approach there relative to a relatively few number of appointments. And we have a fairly, thankfully, a fairly long list of agencies that do want to do business with us, but we're committed to the initial appointments. So I think we're obviously pleased. The premiums coming in well. We're pleased with the quality of the business that we -- we're writing there. So I'd say it's been a great start."
