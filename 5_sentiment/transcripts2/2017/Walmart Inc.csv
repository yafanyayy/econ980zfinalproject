As you saw in our earnings materials this morning, we delivered a very solid quarter and it's great to see continued momentum in the business. Total revenue grew 3% in the quarter and increased 3.1% for the year, both in constant currency. Comp sales growth of 1.8% in the Walmart U.S. business this quarter was better than expected, and I'm particularly pleased with the traffic in our stores. U.S. GMV grew 36% in the quarter, so we're headed in the right direction with this important part of our business too.
Our international business again delivered solid sales growth in constant currency last quarter and Sam's Club delivered its best comp sales growth of the year. I'm excited about what's happening at our company. We're moving with speed to better serve our customers every day and progressing against our 4 key objectives, which are: make every day easier for busy families, change how we work by becoming a more digital enterprise, deliver results and operate with discipline and be the most trusted retailer.
Brett's going to take you through the financials. But before he does, I'd like to highlight some of our accomplishments from this past year that are positioning us to win in the future.
Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. It all starts with our associates, and I'm pleased that in addition to increased wages, we've deployed more sophisticated tools to assist our associates to meet the needs of customers. New technology and apps are providing real-time information to provide our in-stock levels and better managed inventory, which is down 7% this quarter versus last year on a comp store basis. We've also invested in training academies for associates to further develop the skills they need to better serve customers and succeed in today's retail environment. We expect to train more than 225,000 department managers and hourly supervisors by this fall. In fact, I recently visited store in Mooresville, North Carolina, where they had reduced inventory so significantly that the back room was empty enough for them to build a training academy there. These initiatives are paying off our customers through cleaner stores, friendlier services and faster checkout times.
Greg Foran and the team continued to innovate to improve the customer experience. In the last month, we opened 2 new supercenters in Florida and Texas, with features like Scan & Go, touchscreens where customers can access more items on walmart.com, virtual item displays and an integrated health and wellness section. We've got quite a few experiments going on in the company these days and we're learning at a faster rate. We've also been investing in price and customers are responding. We're confident that the continued execution of our strategy will drive sustainable growth in traffic and sales.
Shifting gears to our international segment. I'm pleased to see the business delivering consistently solid sales results. While Walmex led the way this year, our performance was broad-based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year and 7 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 4%.
At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was over 7% this year and 14% on a 2-year stack.
In China, we announced an alliance with and investment in JD.com  last summer, improving our e-commerce proposition and extending the reach of Walmart and Sam's Club brands to millions of new customers. We subsequently announced an increased ownership of JD.com  to approximately 10%, and we recently furthered this relationship with the launch of an exclusive Walmart Global import store on JD.Com Worldwide, which provides Chinese customers access to thousands of products imported from Walmart stores from around the world. We also announced an investment in last mile delivery company, New Dada, enabling 2-hour delivery service from nearly 70 Walmart locations. China is a key growth market for our company and we are proud of how we position the business to win.
In the U.K., we faced some challenges this past year and we're addressing these with urgency. We're encouraged comp store sales improved during the fourth quarter. I visited stores in the market a few weeks ago and the team has us pointed in the right direction.
We spent considerable time looking at our international portfolio last year, and we took some decisive action along the way. For example, our decisions to divest noncore businesses such as an apparel chain in Mexico and shopping malls in Chile were based not on the merits of their performance, rather their relevance to the portfolio. We must ensure that we focus on businesses that are core to what we do.
Overall, I'm pleased with the consistently solid sales results in international. We have a strong business with good momentum.
Moving to Sam's Club. I'd like to start by thanking Roz Brewer for her leadership. Sam's Club comps improved each quarter during the year last year and she's positioned the business for further progress.
With Roz's departure, we promoted John Furner to CEO of Sam's Club. John's been with the business since 1993, working in Walmart U.S., international and most recently as Sam's Chief Merchandising Officer. He brings a unique set of experiences and a deep understanding of our company. He's going to be a great leader for Sam's.
We're pleased with our progress in technology at Sam's including the national launch of Scan & Go. E-commerce continues to grow with direct to home and Club Pickup. While we have more work to do to deliver the results we expect to achieve, we believe we're on the right track to win with members and accelerate growth.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our progress in e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. We continue to invest in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We're gaining traction and moving faster. We're the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top 3 online retailers by traffic and our Walmart app is among the top 3 apps in retail. We acquired jet.com in the second half of last year and welcomed Marc Lore, the CEO of our U.S. e-commerce business. Marc is moving quickly. From a marketplace perspective, we now over 35 million SKUs, more than quadrupling the number available at the beginning of the year. We recently announced free 2-day shipping on millions of items with a minimum order of $35. And as you might expect, we've seen a nice uptick in our e-commerce business since this launch. The acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw, in addition to hay needle, give us immediate expertise and capabilities in new, more upscale categories and merchandise. We're also leveraging the strengths of Walmart and jet to make both platforms better. I'm excited about what's to come.
I'm really pleased by how Greg Foran and his team are working in tandem with Marc Lore and his team to deliver the convenient shopping our customers desire no matter how they choose to shop. They will continue to partner closely to serve our customers seamlessly across our app, site and stores. Over the holidays, wait times were down for pickup and we're adding more items to pick up today. Customers love being able to order an item with an app and get it that day.
In conclusion, as I step back and look at the retail landscape, customer expectations continue to change rapidly. They will increasingly expect even more personalization and convenience in their shopping experience. We're moving quickly to respond to the current opportunities as well as to innovate and transform the shopping experience for our customers in the future. According to Bain, Black Friday weekend sales mark the first time the number of people shopping online surpassed people shopping in stores, and over half did so through mobile devices. And more than 70% of traffic to walmart.com  during Black Friday and Cyber Monday was driven by mobile. While e-commerce is growing rapidly, customers continue to rely on brick-and-mortar formats. The supercenter remains the best retail format in the world, and going forward, we will continue to leverage these unique assets, even more with initiatives like online grocery, in-store pickup and others. Rapid advances in technology mean we need to become more of a digital enterprise and that's what we're doing.
So in summary. We have a clear strategy we're executing against. We're uniquely positioned to deliver value unlike any other retailer through both physical and digital assets. We have momentum across the business which positions us well for the new fiscal year. And while we must do more, we believe we're on the right track as we work to be the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders.
Now I'll give you to Brett."

As Doug mentioned, this has been an exciting year of transformation at Walmart.

As Doug mentioned, this has been an exciting year of transformation at Walmart. We've made strategic decisions revolving around the customer that will reposition the business for sustainable growth to win long term. We're moving with speed to provide customers with a better offer through stores, mobile and e-commerce. And we're confident this will drive value for shareholders. And while going through this transformation, our financial strength serves as a great competitive advantage.
For fiscal year 2017, there were a number of accomplishments. I'll highlight just a few. Constant currency net sales were up nearly 3%, a growth of $13.7 billion. Operating cash flow reads $31.5 billion, an all-time record for Walmart. E-commerce GMV growth accelerated throughout the year. Adjusted EPS of $4.32 exceeded our initial full year guidance. GAAP EPS was $4.38. It has been a very successful year in a number of ways.
Now let's discuss the results in more detail starting with the fourth quarter. Total revenue excluding an unfavorable $2.6 billion currency impact increased 3% to $133.6 billion. On a constant currency basis, we added $3.7 billion in net sales. It's important to note that currency impacts on net sales during the quarter were about $600 million higher than anticipated versus when we began the quarter, driven primarily by the depreciation of the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar. Walmart U.S. delivered strong top line performance with comp sales of 1.8% exceeding guidance. International continued its steady constant currency top line performance with another solid quarter, and Sam's Club comp sales of 2.4% were better than expected with continued strength in e-commerce and omni-channel initiatives. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.30, which was near the upper end of our guidance range.
Walmart's consolidated gross profit margin increased 5 basis points in the quarter with expansion in both international and Sam's Club. Walmart U.S. gross margin declined in the quarter. I'll get into more detail on this in a moment. Total operating expenses increased 58 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology. In both this year and last year's fourth quarter, we adjusted for discrete items. These included $939 million in charges for store closures across all segments last year as well as $370 million for discontinued real estate projects and severance in the U.S. this year. For comparison purposes, excluding these great items for both years, operating expenses increased 97 basis points in the quarter. Now that we'll be lapping the U.S. wage increases from fiscal year 2017, we would expect slightly lower expenses in fiscal year 2018.
I'll provide more details about operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce where we're changing rapidly and remaining laser focused on our customers. Globally, on a constant-currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 15.5% and 17.5%, respectively. Excluding Yihaodian, GMV increased 29.7%.
Going forward, we plan to discuss e-commerce results a little differently from the past in order to give you a clear view of our performance particularly in the important U.S. market. Given the organizational framework changes over the past few months, we will no longer be discussing global e-commerce as we have in the past. Sam's Club e-commerce and the various international e-commerce initiatives will be discussed as appropriate within those segment discussions.
As we discuss Walmart U.S. e-commerce, which is led by Marc Lore and represents the largest portion of our e-commerce effort, note that it includes all web-initiated transactions including those through walmart.com  such as ship to home, ship to store, Pick Up Today and online grocery as well as transactions through jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.
We saw strong growth this quarter in the Walmart U.S. e-commerce business with GMV and sales growth of 36% and 29%, respectively. Our integrated offering means customers are shopping with us through multiple channels. In fact, over the holidays, Pick Up Today, which is available in Walmart U.S. stores, grew by 27% over last year.
We're seeing the benefits of our e-commerce investments. During the holiday period, the e-commerce fulfillment network performed very well, supporting record volumes with on-time delivery rates that far exceeded last year. This network is also the backbone of the new free 2-day shopping promise with a $35 minimum order available at Walmart.com. Customers are responding well to this year offer, and e-commerce sales have strengthen since its launch on January 31. Looking ahead, we'll continue to see us make investments in e-commerce to drive traffic and improve the customer value proposition. We're excited about the things we're doing, the speed at which we're doing them and the work we still have to do.
In the fourth quarter, we continue to make excellent progress on working capital, with $11.9 billion in operating cash flow and $8.7 billion in free cash flow. Working capital has been a focus for us all year, and I'm really pleased with our discipline, particularly in managing inventory and payables. For the year, we generated $31.5 billion in operating cash flow and $20.9 billion of free cash flow. This was an increase in free cash flow of nearly $5 billion or more than 30% versus last year. This is a great testament to Walmart's financial strength. When you consider that we were able to reduce our net debt levels this year while also making strategic decisions to grow the business both organically and through M&A including investments in stores, logistics, people and technology, it's a fantastic achievement.
We accomplished this while also returning a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. In fact, over the past year, we returned $14.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. As of the end of the fiscal year, we had used approximately $10.8 billion of the current $20 billion share repurchase authorization. Additionally, today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend from $2 per share to $2.04 per share in the fiscal 2018. We've now increased our dividend for 44 consecutive years. We're proud of our track record of returning significant cash to shareholders while investing in future growth.
Let's now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. We're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. with steady improvement in stores, strong growth from e-commerce and growing contributions from the rollout of online grocery. We've now seen 9 consecutive quarters of traffic growth in our stores. Clearly, we're gaining traction and it's exciting to see how customers are responding to our focus on saving them time and money.
For the quarter, strong comp sales growth of 1.8% was driven by a 1.4% increase in customer traffic. All store formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment. We were particularly pleased with the positive comp in grocery despite ongoing market deflation in food which negatively impacted the food comp by approximately 90 basis points. Throughout the 6-week holiday season, customers responded well to the consistent everyday low prices and a simplified integrated multichannel experience that enabled last-minute shopping so they could find the perfect item.
Gross margin decreased 8 basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise as well as lower logistics costs benefited the margin rate but were more than offset by the continued execution of our price investment strategy and the timing of post-holiday markdowns. We're entering the new year in a very solid inventory position. For the year, Walmart U.S. gross margin increased 24 basis points. As a reminder, both fourth quarter and full year comparisons included a $56 million impact last year related to store closures.
Operating expenses increased 4.6% this quarter and 8.1% for the year primarily due to the associate wage rate increases as well as investments in technology and e-commerce. As I mentioned previously, in both this year and last year, we adjusted for discrete items. This year's fourth quarter included a $249 million charge related to discontinued real estate projects. Last year's fourth quarter included $670 million in charges related to the impact of store closures. Excluding these adjustments, operating expenses would have increased 7.3% in the fourth quarter and 8.8% for the year.
Walmart U.S. operating income declined 2.5% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the discrete items discussed earlier, Walmart U.S. operating income declined 10.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.2% for the year.
The Walmart U.S. team continues to do a great job with inventory while maintaining high in-stock levels. Inventory declined 3.1% with comp store inventory down 7.2%, despite strong sales growth.
To wrap up Walmart U.S., we made a lot of progress this year in providing customers value and convenience. While sales have been slower than expected to start the year, which we believe is due in part to the delay in tax refunds versus last year, we expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017 to increase between 1% and 1.5%.
Now let's move to Walmart international.
Walmart international continued its solid sales performance this quarter. While Walmex results where the strongest with comp sales growth of 7%, the solid international performance was fairly broad-based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 6 of those markets grew comps by more than 4%.
For the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant-currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.1%, impacted by a $2.6 billion currency headwind. For the year, net sales grew 3% on a constant-currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.9%, impacted by an $11 billion currency headwind.
From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income increased 3.8% on a constant-currency basis. I'd like to point out that there were a few items in the quarter that collectively had a negative impact to operating profit of approximately $100 million, primarily because of adjustments to useful lives of certain assets and impairments in certain markets, which were partially offset by the gain from the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile, as mentioned last quarter.
Operating income for the year increased 19.7% on a constant-currency basis and increased 7.7% on a reported basis. As a reminder, these results include the gain associated with the sale of Yihaodian and the items mentioned above.
Let's now turn to some brief highlights of the key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 5 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant-currency basis.
Let's begin with Walmex. Strong sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions and countries with total sales growing nearly 9% in the quarter. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased approximately 8% and outpaced all divisions of ANTAD including self-service, specialty and department stores.
In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 0.2%. According to Nielsen, we continue to gain market share in traffic-driving categories like food and consumables and health and wellness.
Turning to the U.K. Net sales declined 0.6% and comp sales declined 2.9% in the quarter. We have a lot of work to do in this market, but we're encouraged by some of the early signs of traction with improvements in the customer value proposition.
In China, net sales grew 5.4% and comp sales increased 2.3%. Sales were solid across hypermarkets and Sam's Club. We're excited about the future of e-commerce in China. The strategic alliance of JD.com  will continue to expand our presence throughout the country and offer customers new and exciting products through our flagship sites of JD's platform.
So overall we're pleased with the consistent performance from our international portfolio and excited about the new fiscal year.
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. At Sam's Club, we're pleased with the efforts underway to transform the business. We're making progress in a number of areas, and we know we have to move faster to provide the value that members expect.
During the quarter, top line performance was driven by an increase in comp sales excluding fuel of 2.4%. SamsClub.com GMV was strong increasing by 25% and Club Pickup also performed well. Operating income  excluding fuel declined 5.1% for the quarter. Investments in associate wages pressured expenses, along with a charges related to the impairment of clubs. In addition, this year's fourth quarter included a $10 million discrete charge for discontinued real estate projects, while last year's fourth quarter included a $57 million discrete charge related to the impact of club closures. Excluding these discrete items, operating income would have declined 14.6% this quarter.
For the year, net sales excluding fuel increased 1.8% to $53.3 billion. Operating income excluding fuel declined 7.3%. Looking ahead for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%.
With that, let's discuss guidance for the total company. At our October investor meeting, we guided that fiscal 2018 full year EPS based on currency rates at that time would be relatively flat to adjusted full year fiscal 2017 EPS, and we still expect that to be generally be the case. However, since then, the U.S. dollar has strengthened, in particular versus the Mexican peso, which negatively impacts our Walmex projections on a U.S. dollar basis. We also expect our tax rate next year to be higher than the rate for fiscal year 2017, which was positively impacted by transactions such as Yihaodian during the year. We expect fiscal 2018's tax rate to be around 32%, assuming no major changes to the tax environment in our major markets. As always, there can be variability from quarter to quarter. Certainly, we are aware of and engaged with the discussions are and tax reform in the U S. As more information comes to life, we will continue to provide updates if any of our assumptions were to materially change.
When taking all this into consideration, we expect fiscal 2018 EPS to be in a range of $4.20 to $4.40 compared to fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS of $4.32. This assumes an expected currency impact to about $0.05 per share. As stated in October, we expect operating income to decline slightly in fiscal 2018, driven in part by continued strategic price investments, partially offset by a more disciplined approach to expenses. We would anticipate that EPS in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.90 to $1, which includes an expected currency impact of about $0.02 per share.
Net sales on a constant-currency basis are anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%. We expect the underlying stores business in most parts of the world to continue to deliver solid top line results along with increased growth in our e-commerce business. We're focused on driving strong efficient growth by opening fewer new stores overall, particularly in the U.S. while prioritizing comp sales and accelerating e-commerce growth including the third-party marketplace. Based on current exchange rates, we'd anticipate a currency impact on net sales of approximately $3 billion for the year. On a reported basis, we expect net sales growth of between 2% and 3%.
There are a number of additional assumptions in this guidance today including that economic conditions on the tax and regulatory landscape in our largest markets remain generally consistent. Also, as indicated at our October investor meeting, we expect capital expenditures exceeding acquisitions to be approximately $11 billion for fiscal year 2018.
So in closing, I want to thank all of our great Associates around the world for the progress we made as a company this past year. As a team, we'll win with customers by serving them in new and exciting ways and deliver for our shareholders in this new fiscal year."

Before we get started, I'd like to remind you of a few upcoming dates. Our first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release will be on Thursday, May 18, 2017; and our annual shareholder meeting will be held Friday, June 2, on University of Arkansas campus here in Fayetteville.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon."

As you saw in our earnings materials this morning, we delivered a very solid quarter and it's great to see continued momentum in the business. Total revenue grew 3% in the quarter and increased 3.1% for the year, both in constant currency. Comp sales growth of 1.8% in the Walmart U.S. business this quarter was better than expected, and I'm particularly pleased with the traffic in our stores. U.S. GMV grew 36% in the quarter, so we're headed in the right direction with this important part of our business too.
Our international business again delivered solid sales growth in constant currency last quarter and Sam's Club delivered its best comp sales growth of the year. I'm excited about what's happening at our company. We're moving with speed to better serve our customers every day and progressing against our 4 key objectives, which are: make every day easier for busy families, change how we work by becoming a more digital enterprise, deliver results and operate with discipline, and be the most trusted retailer.
Brett's going to take you through the financials. But before he does, I'd like to highlight some of our accomplishments from this past year that are positioning us to win in the future.
Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. It all starts with our associates, and I'm pleased that in addition to increased wages, we've deployed more sophisticated tools to assist our associates to meet the needs of customers. New technology and apps are providing real-time information to improve our in-stock levels and better manage inventory, which is down 7% this quarter versus last year on a comp store basis. We've also invested in training academies for associates to further develop the skills they need to better serve customers and succeed in today's retail environment. We expect to train more than 225,000 department managers and hourly supervisors by this fall. In fact, I recently visited a store in Mooresville, North Carolina, where they had reduced inventory so significantly that the back room was empty enough for them to build a training academy there. These initiatives are paying off for our customers through cleaner stores, friendlier service and faster checkout times.
Greg Foran and the team continued to innovate to improve the customer experience. In the last month, we opened 2 new supercenters in Florida and Texas, with features like Scan & Go, touchscreens where customers can access more items on walmart.com, virtual item displays, and an integrated health and wellness section. We've got quite a few experiments going on in the company these days, and we're learning at a faster rate. We've also been investing in price and customers are responding. We're confident that continued execution of our strategy will drive sustainable growth in traffic and sales.
Shifting gears to our international segment. I'm pleased to see the business delivering consistently solid sales results. While Walmex led the way this year, our performance was broad-based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year and 7 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 4%.
At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was over 7% this year and 14% on a 2-year stack.
In China, we announced an alliance with and investment in JD.com last summer, improving our e-commerce proposition and extending the reach of Walmart and Sam's Club brands to millions of new customers. We subsequently announced an increased ownership of JD.com to approximately 10%, and we recently furthered this relationship with the launch of an exclusive Walmart Global import store on JD.com Worldwide (sic) [JD Worldwide], which provides Chinese customers access to thousands of products imported from Walmart stores from around the world. We also announced an investment in last mile delivery company, New Dada, enabling 2-hour delivery service from nearly 70 Walmart locations. China is a key growth market for our company, and we are proud of how we positioned the business to win.
In the U.K., we faced some challenges this past year, and we're addressing these with urgency. We're encouraged comp store sales improved during the fourth quarter. I visited stores in the market a few weeks ago and the team has us pointed in the right direction.
We spent considerable time looking at our international portfolio last year, and we took some decisive action along the way. For example, our decisions to divest noncore businesses, such as an apparel chain in Mexico and shopping malls in Chile, were based not on the merits of their performance, rather their relevance to the portfolio. We must ensure that we focus on businesses that are core to what we do.
Overall, I'm pleased with the consistently solid sales results in international. We have a strong business with good momentum.
Moving to Sam's Club. I'd like to start by thanking Roz Brewer for her leadership. Sam's Club comps improved each quarter during the year last year and she's positioned the business for further progress.
With Roz's departure, we promoted John Furner to CEO of Sam's Club. John's been with the business since 1993, working in Walmart U.S., international and most recently as Sam's Chief Merchandising Officer. He brings a unique set of experiences and a deep understanding of our company. He's going to be a great leader for Sam's.
We're pleased with our progress in technology at Sam's including the national launch of Scan & Go. E-commerce continues to grow with direct to home and Club Pickup. While we have more work to do to deliver the results we expect to achieve, we believe we're on the right track to win with members and accelerate growth.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our progress in e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. We continued to invest in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We're gaining traction and moving faster. We're the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top 3 online retailers by traffic and our Walmart app is among the top 3 apps in retail. We acquired Jet.com in the second half of last year and welcomed Marc Lore, the CEO of our U.S. e-commerce business. Marc is moving quickly. From a marketplace perspective, we now have over 35 million SKUs, more than quadrupling the number available at the beginning of the year. We recently announced free 2-day shipping on millions of items with a minimum order of $35. And as you might expect, we've seen a nice uptick in our e-commerce business since this launch. The acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw, in addition to Hayneedle, give us immediate expertise and capabilities in new, more upscale categories of merchandise. We're also leveraging the strengths of Walmart and Jet to make both platforms better. I'm excited about what's to come.
I'm really pleased by how Greg Foran and his team are working in tandem with Marc Lore and his team to deliver the convenient shopping our customers desire, no matter how they choose to shop. They will continue to partner closely to serve our customers seamlessly across our app, site and stores. Over the holidays, wait times were down for pickup, and we're adding more items to Pick Up Today. Customers love being able to order an item with an app and get it that day.
In conclusion, as I step back and look at the retail landscape, customer expectations continue to change rapidly. They will increasingly expect even more personalization and convenience in their shopping experience. We're moving quickly to respond to the current opportunities as well as to innovate and transform the shopping experience for our customers in the future. According to Bain, Black Friday weekend sales marked the first time the number of people shopping online surpassed people shopping in stores, and over half did so through mobile devices. And more than 70% of traffic to walmart.com during Black Friday and Cyber Monday was driven by mobile. While e-commerce is growing rapidly, customers continue to rely on brick-and-mortar formats. The supercenter remains the best retail format in the world and, going forward, we will continue to leverage these unique assets, even more with initiatives like online grocery, in-store pickup and others. Rapid advances in technology mean we need to become more of a digital enterprise and that's what we're doing.
So in summary: We have a clear strategy we're executing against; we're uniquely positioned to deliver value unlike any other retailer through both physical and digital assets; we have momentum across the business, which positions us well for the new fiscal year; and while we must do more, we believe we're on the right track as we work to be the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders.
Now I'll give you to Brett."

As Doug mentioned, this has been an exciting year of transformation at Walmart.

As Doug mentioned, this has been an exciting year of transformation at Walmart. We've made strategic decisions revolving around the customer that will reposition the business for sustainable growth to win long term. We're moving with speed to provide customers with a better offer through stores, mobile and e-commerce. And we're confident this will drive value for shareholders. And while going through this transformation, our financial strength serves as a great competitive advantage.
For fiscal year 2017, there were a number of accomplishments. I'll highlight just a few. Constant currency net sales were up nearly 3%, a growth of $13.7 billion. Operating cash flow reached $31.5 billion, an all-time record for Walmart. E-commerce GMV growth accelerated throughout the year. Adjusted EPS of $4.32 exceeded our initial full year guidance. GAAP EPS was $4.38. It has been a very successful year in a number of ways.
Now let's discuss the results in more detail starting with the fourth quarter. Total revenue excluding an unfavorable $2.6 billion currency impact increased 3% to $133.6 billion. On a constant currency basis, we added $3.7 billion in net sales. It's important to note that currency impacts on net sales during the quarter were about $600 million higher than anticipated versus when we began the quarter, driven primarily by the depreciation of the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar. Walmart U.S. delivered strong top line performance with comp sales of 1.8% exceeding guidance. International continued its steady constant currency top line performance with another solid quarter, and Sam's Club comp sales of 2.4% were better than expected with continued strength in e-commerce and omni-channel initiatives. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.30, which was near the upper end of our guidance range.
Walmart's consolidated gross profit margin increased 5 basis points in the quarter with expansion in both international and Sam's Club. Walmart U.S. gross margin declined in the quarter. I'll get into more detail on this in a moment. Total operating expenses increased 58 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology. In both this year and last year's fourth quarter, we adjusted for discrete items. These included $939 million in charges for store closures across all segments last year as well as $370 million for discontinued real estate projects and severance in the U.S. this year. For comparison purposes, excluding these discrete items for both years, operating expenses increased 97 basis points in the quarter. Now that we'll be lapping the U.S. wage increases from fiscal year 2017, we would expect slightly lower expenses in fiscal year 2018.
I'll provide more details about operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce where we're changing rapidly and remaining laser-focused on our customers. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 15.5% and 17.5%, respectively. Excluding Yihaodian, GMV increased 29.7%.
Going forward, we plan to discuss e-commerce results a little differently from the past in order to give you a clear view of our performance particularly in the important U.S. market. Given the organizational framework changes over the past few months, we will no longer be discussing global e-commerce as we have in the past. Sam's Club e-commerce and the various international e-commerce initiatives will be discussed as appropriate within those segment discussions.
As we discuss Walmart U.S. e-commerce, which is led by Marc Lore and represents the largest portion of our e-commerce effort, note that it includes all web-initiated transactions including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship to Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.
We saw strong growth this quarter in the Walmart U.S. e-commerce business with GMV and sales growth of 36% and 29%, respectively. Our integrated offering means customers are shopping with us through multiple channels. In fact, over the holidays, Pick Up Today, which is available in Walmart U.S. stores, grew by 27% over last year.
We're seeing the benefits of our e-commerce investments. During the holiday period, the e-commerce fulfillment network performed very well, supporting record volumes with on-time delivery rates that far exceeded last year. This network is also the backbone of the new free 2-day shopping promise with a $35 minimum order available at Walmart.com. Customers are responding well to this new offer and e-commerce sales have strengthened since this launch on January 31. Looking ahead, you'll continue to see us make investments in e-commerce to drive traffic and improve the customer value proposition. We're excited about the things we're doing, the speed at which we're doing them and the work we still have to do.
In the fourth quarter, we continued to make excellent progress on working capital, with $11.9 billion in operating cash flow and $8.7 billion in free cash flow. Working capital has been a focus for us all year, and I'm really pleased with our discipline, particularly in managing inventory and payables. For the year, we generated $31.5 billion in operating cash flow and $20.9 billion of free cash flow. This was an increase in free cash flow of nearly $5 billion or more than 30% versus last year. This is a great testament to Walmart's financial strength. When you consider that we're able to reduce our net debt levels this year while also making strategic decisions to grow the business both organically and through M&A, including investments in stores, logistics, people and technology, it's a fantastic achievement.
We accomplished this while also returning a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. In fact, over the past year, we returned $14.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. As of the end of the fiscal year, we had used approximately $10.8 billion of the current $20 billion share repurchase authorization. Additionally, today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend from $2 per share to $2.04 per share in fiscal 2018. We've now increased our dividend for 44 consecutive years. We're proud of our track record of returning significant cash to shareholders while investing in future growth.
Let's now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. We're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. with steady improvement in stores, strong growth from e-commerce and growing contributions from the rollout of Online Grocery. We've now seen 9 consecutive quarters of traffic growth in our stores. Clearly, we're gaining traction and it's exciting to see how customers are responding to our focus on saving them time and money.
For the quarter, strong comp sales growth of 1.8% was driven by a 1.4% increase in customer traffic. All store formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment. We were particularly pleased with the positive comp in grocery, despite ongoing market deflation in food which negatively impacted the food comp by approximately 90 basis points. Throughout the 6-week holiday season, customers responded well to consistent everyday low prices and a simplified integrated multichannel experience that enabled last-minute shopping so they could find the perfect item.
Gross margin decreased 8 basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise as well as lower logistics costs benefited the margin rate, but were more than offset by the continued execution of our price investment strategy and the timing of post-holiday markdowns. We're entering the new year in a very solid inventory position. For the year, Walmart U.S. gross margin increased 24 basis points. As a reminder, both fourth quarter and full year comparisons included a $56 million impact last year related to store closures.
Operating expenses increased 4.6% this quarter and 8.1% for the year, primarily due to the associate wage rate increases as well as investments in technology and e-commerce. As I mentioned previously, in both this year and last year, we adjusted for discrete items. This year's fourth quarter included a $249 million charge related to discontinued real estate projects. Last year's fourth quarter included $670 million in charges related to the impact of store closures. Excluding these adjustments, operating expenses would have increased 7.3% in the fourth quarter and 8.8% for the year.
Walmart U.S. operating income declined 2.5% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the discrete items discussed earlier, Walmart U.S. operating income declined 10.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.2% for the year.
The Walmart U.S. team continues to do a great job with inventory, while maintaining high in-stock levels. Inventory declined 3.1% with comp store inventory down 7.2%, despite strong sales growth.
To wrap up Walmart U.S., we made a lot of progress this year in providing customers value and convenience. While sales have been slower than expected to start the year, which we believe is due in part to the delay in tax refunds versus last year, we expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017 to increase between 1% and 1.5%.
Now let's move to Walmart international.
Walmart international continued its solid sales performance this quarter. While Walmex results where the strongest with comp sales growth of 7%, the solid international performance was fairly broad-based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 6 of those markets grew comps by more than 4%.
For the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.1%, impacted by a $2.6 billion currency headwind. For the year, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.9%, impacted by an $11 billion currency headwind.
From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income increased 3.8% on a constant currency basis. I'd like to point out that there were a few items in the quarter that collectively had a negative impact to operating profit of approximately $100 million, primarily because of adjustments to useful lives of certain assets and impairments in certain markets, which were partially offset by the gain from the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile, as mentioned last quarter.
Operating income for the year increased 19.7% on a constant currency basis and increased 7.7% on a reported basis. As a reminder, these results include the gain associated with the sale of Yihaodian and the items mentioned above.
Let's now turn to some brief highlights of the key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 5 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.
Let's begin with Walmex. Strong sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions and countries with total sales growing nearly 9% in the quarter. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased approximately 8% and outpaced all divisions of ANTAD, including self-service, specialty and department stores.
In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 0.2%. According to Nielsen, we continued to gain market share in traffic-driving categories, like food and consumables and health and wellness.
Turning to the U.K. Net sales declined 0.6% and comp sales declined 2.9% in the quarter. We have a lot of work to do in this market, but we're encouraged by some of the early signs of traction with improvements in the customer value proposition.
In China, net sales grew 5.4% and comp sales increased 2.3%. Sales were solid across hypermarkets and Sam's Club. We're excited about the future of e-commerce in China. The strategic alliance of JD.com will continue to expand our presence throughout the country and offer customers new and exciting products through our flagship sites of JD's platform.
So overall we're pleased with the consistent performance from our international portfolio and excited about the new fiscal year.
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. At Sam's Club, we're pleased with the efforts underway to transform the business. We're making progress in a number of areas, and we know we have to move faster to provide the value that members expect.
During the quarter, top line performance was driven by an increase in comp sales excluding fuel of 2.4%. SamsClub.com GMV was strong increasing by 25% and Club Pickup also performed well. Operating income excluding fuel declined 5.1% for the quarter. Investments in associate wages pressured expenses, along with charges related to the impairment of clubs. In addition, this year's fourth quarter included a $10 million discrete charge for discontinued real estate projects, while last year's fourth quarter included a $57 million discrete charge related to the impact of club closures. Excluding these discrete items, operating income would have declined 14.6% this quarter.
For the year, net sales excluding fuel increased 1.8% to $53.3 billion. Operating income excluding fuel declined 7.3%. Looking ahead for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%.
With that, let's discuss guidance for the total company. At our October investor meeting, we guided the fiscal 2018 full year EPS based on currency rates at that time would be relatively flat to adjusted full year fiscal 2017 EPS, and we still expect that to generally be the case. However, since then, the U.S. dollar has strengthened, in particular versus the Mexican peso, which negatively impacts our Walmex projections on a U.S. dollar basis. We also expect our tax rate next year to be higher than the rate for fiscal year 2017, which was positively impacted by transactions, such as Yihaodian during the year. We expect fiscal 2018's tax rate to be around 32%, assuming no major changes to the tax environment in our major markets. As always, there can be variability from quarter to quarter. Certainly, we are aware of and engaged in the discussions around tax reform in the U S. As more information comes to light, we will continue to provide updates if any of our assumptions were to materially change.
When taking all this into consideration, we expect fiscal 2018 EPS to be in a range of $4.20 to $4.40 compared to fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS of $4.32. This assumes an expected currency impact of about $0.05 per share. As stated in October, we expect operating income to decline slightly in fiscal 2018, driven in part by continued strategic price investments, partially offset by a more disciplined approach to expenses. We would anticipate that EPS in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.90 to $1, which includes an expected currency impact of about $0.02 per share.
Net sales on a constant currency basis are anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%. We expect the underlying stores business in most parts of the world to continue to deliver solid top line results along with increased growth in our e-commerce business. We're focused on driving strong efficient growth by opening fewer new stores overall, particularly in the U.S., while prioritizing comp sales and accelerating e-commerce growth including the third-party marketplace. Based on current exchange rates, we'd anticipate a currency impact on net sales of approximately $3 billion for the year. On a reported basis, we expect net sales growth of between 2% and 3%.
There are a number of additional assumptions in this guidance today including the economic conditions on the tax and regulatory landscape in our largest markets remain generally consistent. Also, as indicated at our October investor meeting, we expect capital expenditures excluding acquisitions to be approximately $11 billion for fiscal year 2018.
So in closing, I want to thank all of our great associates around the world for the progress we made as a company this past year. As a team, we'll win with customers by serving them in new and exciting ways and deliver for our shareholders in this new fiscal year."

We're moving with speed to better serve our customers every day and progressing against our 4 key objectives, which are: make every day easier for busy families, change how we work by becoming a more digital enterprise, deliver results and operate with discipline, and be the most trusted retailer.
Brett's going to take you through the financials. But before he does, I'd like to highlight some of our accomplishments from this past year that are positioning us to win in the future.
Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. It all starts with our associates, and I'm pleased that in addition to increased wages, we've deployed more sophisticated tools to assist our associates to meet the needs of customers. New technology and apps are providing real-time information to improve our in-stock levels and better manage inventory, which is down 7% this quarter versus last year on a comp store basis. We've also invested in training academies for associates to further develop the skills they need to better serve customers and succeed in today's retail environment. We expect to train more than 225,000 department managers and hourly supervisors by this fall. In fact, I recently visited a store in Mooresville, North Carolina, where they had reduced inventory so significantly that the back room was empty enough for them to build a training academy there. These initiatives are paying off for our customers through cleaner stores, friendlier service and faster checkout times.
Greg Foran and the team continued to innovate to improve the customer experience. In the last month, we opened 2 new supercenters in Florida and Texas, with features like Scan & Go, touchscreens where customers can access more items on walmart.com, virtual item displays, and an integrated health and wellness section. We've got quite a few experiments going on in the company these days, and we're learning at a faster rate. We've also been investing in price and customers are responding. We're confident that continued execution of our strategy will drive sustainable growth in traffic and sales.
Shifting gears to our international segment. I'm pleased to see the business delivering consistently solid sales results. While Walmex led the way this year, our performance was broad-based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year and 7 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 4%.
At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was over 7% this year and 14% on a 2-year stack.
In China, we announced an alliance with and investment in JD.com last summer, improving our e-commerce proposition and extending the reach of Walmart and Sam's Club brands to millions of new customers. We subsequently announced an increased ownership of JD.com to approximately 10%, and we recently furthered this relationship with the launch of an exclusive Walmart Global import store on JD.com Worldwide, which provides Chinese customers access to thousands of products imported from Walmart stores from around the world. We also announced an investment in last-mile delivery company, New Dada, enabling 2-hour delivery service from nearly 70 Walmart locations. China is a key growth market for our company, and we are proud of how we positioned the business to win.
In the U.K., we faced some challenges this past year, and we're addressing these with urgency. We're encouraged comp store sales improved during the fourth quarter. I visited stores in the market a few weeks ago and the team has us pointed in the right direction.
We spent considerable time looking at our international portfolio last year, and we took some decisive action along the way. For example, our decisions to divest noncore businesses, such as an apparel chain in Mexico and shopping malls in Chile, were based not on the merits of their performance, rather their relevance to the portfolio. We must ensure that we focus on businesses that are core to what we do.
Overall, I'm pleased with the consistently solid sales results in international. We have a strong business with good momentum.
Moving to Sam's Club. I'd like to start by thanking Roz Brewer for her leadership. Sam's Club comps improved each quarter during the year last year and she's positioned the business for further progress.
With Roz's departure, we promoted John Furner to CEO of Sam's Club. John's been with the business since 1993, working in Walmart U.S., international and most recently as Sam's Chief Merchandising Officer. He brings a unique set of experiences and a deep understanding of our company. He's going to be a great leader for Sam's.
We're pleased with our progress in technology at Sam's including the national launch of Scan & Go. E-commerce continues to grow with direct to home and Club pick-up. While we have more work to do to deliver the results we expect to achieve, we believe we're on the right track to win with members and accelerate growth.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our progress in e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. We continue to invest in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We're gaining traction and moving faster. We're the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top 3 online retailers by traffic and our Walmart app is among the top 3 apps in retail. We acquired Jet.com in the second half of last year and welcomed Marc Lore, the CEO of our U.S. e-commerce business. Marc is moving quickly. From a marketplace perspective, we now have over 35 million SKUs, more than quadrupling the number available at the beginning of the year. We recently announced free 2-day shipping on millions of items with a minimum order of $35. And as you might expect, we've seen a nice uptick in our e-commerce business since this launch. The acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw, in addition to Hayneedle, gave us immediate expertise and capabilities in new, more upscale categories of merchandise. We're also leveraging the strengths of Walmart and Jet to make both platforms better. I'm excited about what's to come.
I'm really pleased by how Greg Foran and his team are working in tandem with Marc Lore and his team to deliver the convenient shopping our customers desire, no matter how they choose to shop. They will continue to partner closely to serve our customers seamlessly across our app, site and stores. Over the holidays, wait times were down for pickup, and we're adding more items to Pick Up Today. Customers love being able to order an item with an app and get it that day.
In conclusion, as I step back and look at the retail landscape, customer expectations continue to change rapidly. They will increasingly expect even more personalization and convenience in their shopping experience. We're moving quickly to respond to the current opportunities as well as to innovate and transform the shopping experience for our customers in the future. According to Bain, Black Friday weekend sales marked the first time the number of people shopping online surpassed people shopping in stores, and over half did so through mobile devices. And more than 70% of traffic to walmart.com during Black Friday and Cyber Monday was driven by mobile. While e-commerce is growing rapidly, customers continue to rely on brick-and-mortar formats. The supercenter remains the best retail format in the world and, going forward, we will continue to leverage these unique assets, even more with initiatives like online grocery, in-store pickup and others. Rapid advances in technology mean we need to become more of a digital enterprise and that's what we're doing.
So in summary: We have a clear strategy we're executing against; we're uniquely positioned to deliver value unlike any other retailer through both physical and digital assets; we have momentum across the business, which positions us well for the new fiscal year; and while we must do more, we believe we're on the right track as we work to be the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders.
Now I'll give you to Brett."

As Doug mentioned, this has been an exciting year of transformation at Walmart.

As Doug mentioned, this has been an exciting year of transformation at Walmart. We've made strategic decisions revolving around the customer that will reposition the business for sustainable growth to win long term. We're moving with speed to provide customers with a better offer through stores, mobile and e-commerce. And we're confident this will drive value for shareholders. And while going through this transformation, our financial strength serves as a great competitive advantage.
For fiscal year 2017, there were a number of accomplishments. I'll highlight just a few. Constant currency net sales were up nearly 3%, a growth of $13.7 billion. Operating cash flow reached $31.5 billion, an all-time record for Walmart. E-commerce GMV growth accelerated throughout the year. Adjusted EPS of $4.32 exceeded our initial full year guidance. GAAP EPS was $4.38. It has been a very successful year in a number of ways.
Now let's discuss the results in more detail starting with the fourth quarter. Total revenue excluding an unfavorable $2.6 billion currency impact increased 3% to $133.6 billion. On a constant currency basis, we added $3.7 billion in net sales. It's important to note that currency impacts on net sales during the quarter were about $600 million higher than anticipated versus when we began the quarter, driven primarily by the depreciation of the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar. Walmart U.S. delivered strong top line performance with comp sales of 1.8% exceeding guidance. International continued its steady constant currency top line performance with another solid quarter, and Sam's Club comp sales of 2.4% were better than expected with continued strength in e-commerce and omnichannel initiatives. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.30, which was near the upper end of our guidance range.
Walmart's consolidated gross profit margin increased 5 basis points in the quarter with expansion in both international and Sam's Club. Walmart U.S. gross margin declined in the quarter. I'll get into more detail on this in a moment. Total operating expenses increased 58 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology. In both this year and last year's fourth quarter, we adjusted for discrete items. These included $939 million in charges for store closures across all segments last year as well as $370 million for discontinued real estate projects and severance in the U.S. this year. For comparison purposes, excluding these discrete items for both years, operating expenses increased 97 basis points in the quarter. Now that we'll be lapping the U.S. wage increases from fiscal year 2017, we would expect to slightly lever expenses in fiscal year 2018.
I'll provide more details about operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce where we're changing rapidly and remaining laser-focused on our customers. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 15.5% and 17.5%, respectively. Excluding Yihaodian, GMV increased 29.7%.
Going forward, we plan to discuss e-commerce results a little differently from the past in order to give you a clearer view of our performance particularly in the important U.S. market. Given the organizational framework changes over the past few months, we will no longer be discussing global e-commerce as we have in the past. Sam's Club e-commerce and the various international e-commerce initiatives will be discussed as appropriate within those segment discussions.
As we discuss Walmart U.S. e-commerce, which is led by Marc Lore and represents the largest portion of our e-commerce effort, note that it includes all web-initiated transactions including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship to Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.
We saw strong growth this quarter in the Walmart U.S. e-commerce business with GMV and sales growth of 36% and 29%, respectively. Our integrated offering means customers are shopping with us through multiple channels. In fact, over the holidays, Pick Up Today, which is available in Walmart U.S. stores, grew by 27% over last year.
We're seeing the benefits of our e-commerce investments. During the holiday period, the e-commerce fulfillment network performed very well, supporting record volumes with on-time delivery rates that far exceeded last year. This network is also the backbone of the new free 2-day shopping promise with a $35 minimum order available at walmart.com. Customers are responding well to this new offer and e-commerce sales have strengthened since its launch on January 31. Looking ahead, you'll continue to see us make investments in e-commerce to drive traffic and improve the customer value proposition. We're excited about the things we're doing, the speed at which we're doing them and the work we still have to do.
In the fourth quarter, we continued to make excellent progress on working capital, with $11.9 billion in operating cash flow and $8.7 billion in free cash flow. Working capital has been a focus for us all year, and I'm really pleased with our discipline, particularly in managing inventory and payables. For the year, we generated $31.5 billion in operating cash flow and $20.9 billion of free cash flow. This was an increase in free cash flow of nearly $5 billion or more than 30% versus last year. This is a great testament to Walmart's financial strength. When you consider that we were able to reduce our net debt levels this year while also making strategic decisions to grow the business both organically and through M&A, including investments in stores, logistics, people and technology, it's a fantastic achievement.
We accomplished this while also returning a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. In fact, over the past year, we returned $14.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. As of the end of the fiscal year, we had used approximately $10.8 billion of the current $20 billion share repurchase authorization. Additionally, today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend from $2 per share to $2.04 per share in fiscal 2018. We've now increased our dividend for 44 consecutive years. We're proud of our track record of returning significant cash to shareholders while investing in future growth.
Let's now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. We're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. with steady improvement in stores, strong growth from e-commerce and growing contributions from the rollout of Online Grocery. We've now seen 9 consecutive quarters of traffic growth in our stores. Clearly, we're gaining traction and it's exciting to see how customers are responding to our focus on saving them time and money.
For the quarter, strong comp sales growth of 1.8% was driven by a 1.4% increase in customer traffic. All store formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment. We were particularly pleased with the positive comp in grocery, despite ongoing market deflation in food which negatively impacted the food comp by approximately 90 basis points. Throughout the 6-week holiday season, customers responded well to consistent everyday low prices and a simplified integrated multichannel experience that enabled last-minute shopping so they could find the perfect item.
Gross margin decreased 8 basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise as well as lower logistics costs benefited the margin rate, but were more than offset by the continued execution of our price investment strategy and the timing of post-holiday markdowns. We're entering the new year in a very solid inventory position. For the year, Walmart U.S. gross margin increased 24 basis points. As a reminder, both fourth quarter and full year comparisons included a $56 million impact last year related to store closures.
Operating expenses increased 4.6% this quarter and 8.1% for the year, primarily due to the associate wage rate increases as well as investments in technology and e-commerce. As I mentioned previously, in both this year and last year, we adjusted for discrete items. This year's fourth quarter included a $249 million charge related to discontinued real estate projects. Last year's fourth quarter included $670 million in charges related to the impact of store closures. Excluding these adjustments, operating expenses would have increased 7.3% in the fourth quarter and 8.8% for the year.
Walmart U.S. operating income declined 2.5% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the discrete items discussed earlier, Walmart U.S. operating income declined 10.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.2% for the year.
The Walmart U.S. team continues to do a great job with inventory, while maintaining high in-stock levels. Inventory declined 3.1% with comp store inventory down 7.2%, despite strong sales growth.
To wrap up Walmart U.S., we made a lot of progress this year in providing customers value and convenience. While sales have been slower than expected to start the year, which we believe is due in part to the delay in tax refunds versus last year, we expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017 to increase between 1% and 1.5%.
Now let's move to Walmart International.
Walmart International continued its solid sales performance this quarter. While Walmex results where the strongest with comp sales growth of 7%, the solid international performance was fairly broad-based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 6 of those markets grew comps by more than 4%.
For the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.1%, impacted by a $2.6 billion currency headwind. For the year, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.9%, impacted by an $11 billion currency headwind.
From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income increased 3.8% on a constant currency basis. I'd like to point out that there were a few items in the quarter that collectively had a negative impact to operating profit of approximately $100 million, primarily because of adjustments to useful lives of certain assets and impairments in certain markets, which were partially offset by the gain from the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile, as mentioned last quarter.
Operating income for the year increased 19.7% on a constant currency basis and increased 7.7% on a reported basis. As a reminder, these results include the gain associated with the sale of Yihaodian and the items mentioned above.
Let's now turn to some brief highlights of the key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 5 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.
Let's begin with Walmex. Strong sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions and countries, with total sales growing nearly 9% in the quarter. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased approximately 8% and outpaced all divisions of ANTAD, including self-service, specialty and department stores.
In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 0.2%. According to Nielsen, we continue to gain market share in traffic-driving categories, like food and consumables and health and wellness.
Turning to the U.K. Net sales declined 0.6% and comp sales declined 2.9% in the quarter. We have a lot of work to do in this market, but we're encouraged by some of the early signs of traction with improvements in the customer value proposition.
In China, net sales grew 5.4% and comp sales increased 2.3%. Sales were solid across hypermarkets and Sam's Club. We're excited about the future of e-commerce in China. The strategic alliance of JD.com will continue to expand our presence throughout the country and offer customers new and exciting products through our flagship sites of JD's platform.
So overall we're pleased with the consistent performance from our international portfolio and excited about the new fiscal year.
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. At Sam's Club, we're pleased with the efforts underway to transform the business. We're making progress in a number of areas, and we know we have to move faster to provide the value that members expect.
During the quarter, top line performance was driven by an increase in comp sales excluding fuel of 2.4%. SamsClub.com GMV was strong increasing by 25% and Club Pickup also performed well. Operating income excluding fuel declined 5.1% for the quarter. Investments in associate wages pressured expenses, along with charges related to the impairment of clubs. In addition, this year's fourth quarter included a $10 million discrete charge for discontinued real estate projects, while last year's fourth quarter included a $57 million discrete charge related to the impact of club closures. Excluding these discrete items, operating income would have declined 14.6% this quarter.
For the year, net sales excluding fuel increased 1.8% to $53.3 billion. Operating income excluding fuel declined 7.3%. Looking ahead for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%.
With that, let's discuss guidance for the total company. At our October investor meeting, we guided the fiscal 2018 full year EPS based on currency rates at that time would be relatively flat to adjusted full year fiscal 2017 EPS, and we still expect that to generally be the case. However, since then, the U.S. dollar has strengthened, in particular versus the Mexican peso, which negatively impacts our Walmex projections on a U.S. dollar basis. We also expect our tax rate next year to be higher than the rate for fiscal year 2017, which was positively impacted by transactions such as Yihaodian during the year. We expect fiscal 2018's tax rate to be around 32%, assuming no major changes to the tax environment in our major markets. As always, there can be variability from quarter to quarter. Certainly, we are aware of and engaged in the discussions around tax reform in the U S. As more information comes to light, we will continue to provide updates if any of our assumptions were to materially change.
When taking all this into consideration, we expect fiscal 2018 EPS to be in a range of $4.20 to $4.40 compared to fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS of $4.32. This assumes an expected currency impact of about $0.05 per share. As stated in October, we expect operating income to decline slightly in fiscal 2018, driven in part by continued strategic price investments, partially offset by a more disciplined approach to expenses. We would anticipate that EPS in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.90 to $1, which includes an expected currency impact of about $0.02 per share.
Net sales on a constant currency basis are anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%. We expect the underlying stores business in most parts of the world to continue to deliver solid top line results along with increased growth in our e-commerce business. We're focused on driving strong efficient growth by opening fewer new stores overall, particularly in the U.S., while prioritizing comp sales and accelerating e-commerce growth including the third-party marketplace. Based on current exchange rates, we would anticipate a currency impact on net sales of approximately $3 billion for the year. On a reported basis, we expect net sales growth of between 2% and 3%.
There are a number of additional assumptions in this guidance today including that economic conditions in the tax and regulatory landscape in our largest markets remain generally consistent. Also, as indicated at our October investor meeting, we expect capital expenditures excluding acquisitions to be approximately $11 billion for fiscal year 2018.
So in closing, I want to thank all of our great associates around the world for the progress we've made as a company this past year. As a team, we'll win with customers by serving them in new and exciting ways and deliver for our shareholders in this new fiscal year."

Total revenue grew 3% in the quarter and increased 3.1% for the year, both in constant currency. Comp sales growth of 1.8% in the Walmart U.S. business this quarter was better than expected, and I'm particularly pleased with the traffic in our stores. U.S. GMV grew 36% in the quarter, so we're headed in the right direction with this important part of our business too.
Our international business again delivered solid sales growth in constant currency last quarter and Sam's Club delivered its best comp sales growth of the year. I'm excited about what's happening at our company. We're moving with speed to better serve our customers every day and progressing against our 4 key objectives, which are: make every day easier for busy families, change how we work by becoming a more digital enterprise, deliver results and operate with discipline, and be the most trusted retailer.
Brett's going to take you through the financials. But before he does, I'd like to highlight some of our accomplishments from this past year that are positioning us to win in the future.
Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. It all starts with our associates, and I'm pleased that in addition to increased wages, we've deployed more sophisticated tools to assist our associates to meet the needs of customers. New technology and apps are providing real-time information to improve our in-stock levels and better manage inventory, which is down 7% this quarter versus last year on a comp store basis. We've also invested in training academies for associates to further develop the skills they need to better serve customers and succeed in today's retail environment. We expect to train more than 225,000 department managers and hourly supervisors by this fall. In fact, I recently visited a store in Mooresville, North Carolina, where they had reduced inventory so significantly that the back room was empty enough for them to build a training academy there. These initiatives are paying off for our customers through cleaner stores, friendlier service and faster checkout times.
Greg Foran and the team continued to innovate to improve the customer experience. In the last month, we opened 2 new supercenters in Florida and Texas, with features like Scan & Go, touchscreens where customers can access more items on walmart.com, virtual item displays, and an integrated health and wellness section. We've got quite a few experiments going on in the company these days, and we're learning at a faster rate. We've also been investing in price and customers are responding. We're confident that continued execution of our strategy will drive sustainable growth in traffic and sales.
Shifting gears to our international segment. I'm pleased to see the business delivering consistently solid sales results. While Walmex led the way this year, our performance was broad-based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year and 7 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 4%.
At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was over 7% this year and 14% on a 2-year stack.
In China, we announced an alliance with and investment in JD.com last summer, improving our e-commerce proposition and extending the reach of Walmart and Sam's Club brands to millions of new customers. We subsequently announced an increased ownership of JD.com to approximately 10%, and we recently furthered this relationship with the launch of an exclusive Walmart Global import store on JD.com Worldwide, which provides Chinese customers access to thousands of products imported from Walmart stores from around the world. We also announced an investment in last-mile delivery company, New Dada, enabling 2-hour delivery service from nearly 70 Walmart locations. China is a key growth market for our company, and we are proud of how we positioned the business to win.
In the U.K., we faced some challenges this past year, and we're addressing these with urgency. We're encouraged comp store sales improved during the fourth quarter. I visited stores in the market a few weeks ago and the team has us pointed in the right direction.
We spent considerable time looking at our international portfolio last year, and we took some decisive action along the way. For example, our decisions to divest noncore businesses, such as an apparel chain in Mexico and shopping malls in Chile, were based not on the merits of their performance, rather their relevance to the portfolio. We must ensure that we focus on businesses that are core to what we do.
Overall, I'm pleased with the consistently solid sales results in international. We have a strong business with good momentum.
Moving to Sam's Club. I'd like to start by thanking Roz Brewer for her leadership. Sam's Club comps improved each quarter during the year last year and she's positioned the business for further progress.
With Roz's departure, we promoted John Furner to CEO of Sam's Club. John's been with the business since 1993, working in Walmart U.S., international and most recently as Sam's Chief Merchandising Officer. He brings a unique set of experiences and a deep understanding of our company. He's going to be a great leader for Sam's.
We're pleased with our progress in technology at Sam's including the national launch of Scan & Go. E-commerce continues to grow with direct to home and Club pick-up. While we have more work to do to deliver the results we expect to achieve, we believe we're on the right track to win with members and accelerate growth.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our progress in e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. We continue to invest in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We're gaining traction and moving faster. We're the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top 3 online retailers by traffic and our Walmart app is among the top 3 apps in retail. We acquired Jet.com in the second half of last year and welcomed Marc Lore, the CEO of our U.S. e-commerce business. Marc is moving quickly. From a marketplace perspective, we now have over 35 million SKUs, more than quadrupling the number available at the beginning of the year. We recently announced free 2-day shipping on millions of items with a minimum order of $35. And as you might expect, we've seen a nice uptick in our e-commerce business since this launch. The acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw, in addition to Hayneedle, gave us immediate expertise and capabilities in new, more upscale categories of merchandise. We're also leveraging the strengths of Walmart and Jet to make both platforms better. I'm excited about what's to come.
I'm really pleased by how Greg Foran and his team are working in tandem with Marc Lore and his team to deliver the convenient shopping our customers desire, no matter how they choose to shop. They will continue to partner closely to serve our customers seamlessly across our app, site and stores. Over the holidays, wait times were down for pickup, and we're adding more items to Pick Up Today. Customers love being able to order an item with an app and get it that day.
In conclusion, as I step back and look at the retail landscape, customer expectations continue to change rapidly. They will increasingly expect even more personalization and convenience in their shopping experience. We're moving quickly to respond to the current opportunities as well as to innovate and transform the shopping experience for our customers in the future. According to Bain, Black Friday weekend sales marked the first time the number of people shopping online surpassed people shopping in stores, and over half did so through mobile devices. And more than 70% of traffic to walmart.com during Black Friday and Cyber Monday was driven by mobile. While e-commerce is growing rapidly, customers continue to rely on brick-and-mortar formats. The supercenter remains the best retail format in the world and, going forward, we will continue to leverage these unique assets, even more with initiatives like online grocery, in-store pickup and others. Rapid advances in technology mean we need to become more of a digital enterprise and that's what we're doing.
So in summary: We have a clear strategy we're executing against; we're uniquely positioned to deliver value unlike any other retailer through both physical and digital assets; we have momentum across the business, which positions us well for the new fiscal year; and while we must do more, we believe we're on the right track as we work to be the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders.
Now I'll give you to Brett."

As Doug mentioned, this has been an exciting year of transformation at Walmart. We've made strategic decisions revolving around the customer that will reposition the business for sustainable growth to win long term. We're moving wi",2615,"Good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, this has been an exciting year of transformation at Walmart. We've made strategic decisions revolving around the customer that will reposition the business for sustainable growth to win long term. We're moving with speed to provide customers with a better offer through stores, mobile and e-commerce. And we're confident this will drive value for shareholders. And while going through this transformation, our financial strength serves as a great competitive advantage.
For fiscal year 2017, there were a number of accomplishments. I'll highlight just a few. Constant currency net sales were up nearly 3%, a growth of $13.7 billion. Operating cash flow reached $31.5 billion, an all-time record for Walmart. E-commerce GMV growth accelerated throughout the year. Adjusted EPS of $4.32 exceeded our initial full year guidance. GAAP EPS was $4.38. It has been a very successful year in a number of ways.
Now let's discuss the results in more detail starting with the fourth quarter. Total revenue excluding an unfavorable $2.6 billion currency impact increased 3% to $133.6 billion. On a constant currency basis, we added $3.7 billion in net sales. It's important to note that currency impacts on net sales during the quarter were about $600 million higher than anticipated versus when we began the quarter, driven primarily by the depreciation of the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar. Walmart U.S. delivered strong top line performance with comp sales of 1.8% exceeding guidance. International continued its steady constant currency top line performance with another solid quarter, and Sam's Club comp sales of 2.4% were better than expected with continued strength in e-commerce and omnichannel initiatives. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.30, which was near the upper end of our guidance range.
Walmart's consolidated gross profit margin increased 5 basis points in the quarter with expansion in both international and Sam's Club. Walmart U.S. gross margin declined in the quarter. I'll get into more detail on this in a moment. Total operating expenses increased 58 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology. In both this year and last year's fourth quarter, we adjusted for discrete items. These included $939 million in charges for store closures across all segments last year as well as $370 million for discontinued real estate projects and severance in the U.S. this year. For comparison purposes, excluding these discrete items for both years, operating expenses increased 97 basis points in the quarter. Now that we'll be lapping the U.S. wage increases from fiscal year 2017, we would expect to slightly lever expenses in fiscal year 2018.
I'll provide more details about operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce where we're changing rapidly and remaining laser-focused on our customers. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 15.5% and 17.5%, respectively. Excluding Yihaodian, GMV increased 29.7%.
Going forward, we plan to discuss e-commerce results a little differently from the past in order to give you a clearer view of our performance particularly in the important U.S. market. Given the organizational framework changes over the past few months, we will no longer be discussing global e-commerce as we have in the past. Sam's Club e-commerce and the various international e-commerce initiatives will be discussed as appropriate within those segment discussions.
As we discuss Walmart U.S. e-commerce, which is led by Marc Lore and represents the largest portion of our e-commerce effort, note that it includes all web-initiated transactions including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship to Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.
We saw strong growth this quarter in the Walmart U.S. e-commerce business with GMV and sales growth of 36% and 29%, respectively. Our integrated offering means customers are shopping with us through multiple channels. In fact, over the holidays, Pick Up Today, which is available in Walmart U.S. stores, grew by 27% over last year.
We're seeing the benefits of our e-commerce investments. During the holiday period, the e-commerce fulfillment network performed very well, supporting record volumes with on-time delivery rates that far exceeded last year. This network is also the backbone of the new free 2-day shopping promise with a $35 minimum order available at walmart.com. Customers are responding well to this new offer and e-commerce sales have strengthened since its launch on January 31. Looking ahead, you'll continue to see us make investments in e-commerce to drive traffic and improve the customer value proposition. We're excited about the things we're doing, the speed at which we're doing them and the work we still have to do.
In the fourth quarter, we continued to make excellent progress on working capital, with $11.9 billion in operating cash flow and $8.7 billion in free cash flow. Working capital has been a focus for us all year, and I'm really pleased with our discipline, particularly in managing inventory and payables. For the year, we generated $31.5 billion in operating cash flow and $20.9 billion of free cash flow. This was an increase in free cash flow of nearly $5 billion or more than 30% versus last year. This is a great testament to Walmart's financial strength. When you consider that we were able to reduce our net debt levels this year while also making strategic decisions to grow the business both organically and through M&A, including investments in stores, logistics, people and technology, it's a fantastic achievement.
We accomplished this while also returning a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. In fact, over the past year, we returned $14.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. As of the end of the fiscal year, we had used approximately $10.8 billion of the current $20 billion share repurchase authorization. Additionally, today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend from $2 per share to $2.04 per share in fiscal 2018. We've now increased our dividend for 44 consecutive years. We're proud of our track record of returning significant cash to shareholders while investing in future growth.
Let's now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. We're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. with steady improvement in stores, strong growth from e-commerce and growing contributions from the rollout of Online Grocery. We've now seen 9 consecutive quarters of traffic growth in our stores. Clearly, we're gaining traction and it's exciting to see how customers are responding to our focus on saving them time and money.
For the quarter, strong comp sales growth of 1.8% was driven by a 1.4% increase in customer traffic. All store formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment. We were particularly pleased with the positive comp in grocery, despite ongoing market deflation in food which negatively impacted the food comp by approximately 90 basis points. Throughout the 6-week holiday season, customers responded well to consistent everyday low prices and a simplified integrated multichannel experience that enabled last-minute shopping so they could find the perfect item.
Gross margin decreased 8 basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise as well as lower logistics costs benefited the margin rate, but were more than offset by the continued execution of our price investment strategy and the timing of post-holiday markdowns. We're entering the new year in a very solid inventory position. For the year, Walmart U.S. gross margin increased 24 basis points. As a reminder, both fourth quarter and full year comparisons included a $56 million impact last year related to store closures.
Operating expenses increased 4.6% this quarter and 8.1% for the year, primarily due to the associate wage rate increases as well as investments in technology and e-commerce. As I mentioned previously, in both this year and last year, we adjusted for discrete items. This year's fourth quarter included a $249 million charge related to discontinued real estate projects. Last year's fourth quarter included $670 million in charges related to the impact of store closures. Excluding these adjustments, operating expenses would have increased 7.3% in the fourth quarter and 8.8% for the year.
Walmart U.S. operating income declined 2.5% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the discrete items discussed earlier, Walmart U.S. operating income declined 10.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.2% for the year.
The Walmart U.S. team continues to do a great job with inventory, while maintaining high in-stock levels. Inventory declined 3.1% with comp store inventory down 7.2%, despite strong sales growth.
To wrap up Walmart U.S., we made a lot of progress this year in providing customers value and convenience. While sales have been slower than expected to start the year, which we believe is due in part to the delay in tax refunds versus last year, we expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017 to increase between 1% and 1.5%.
Now let's move to Walmart International.
Walmart International continued its solid sales performance this quarter. While Walmex results where the strongest with comp sales growth of 7%, the solid international performance was fairly broad-based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 6 of those markets grew comps by more than 4%.
For the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.1%, impacted by a $2.6 billion currency headwind. For the year, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.9%, impacted by an $11 billion currency headwind.
From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income increased 3.8% on a constant currency basis. I'd like to point out that there were a few items in the quarter that collectively had a negative impact to operating profit of approximately $100 million, primarily because of adjustments to useful lives of certain assets and impairments in certain markets, which were partially offset by the gain from the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile, as mentioned last quarter.
Operating income for the year increased 19.7% on a constant currency basis and increased 7.7% on a reported basis. As a reminder, these results include the gain associated with the sale of Yihaodian and the items mentioned above.
Let's now turn to some brief highlights of the key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 5 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.
Let's begin with Walmex. Strong sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions and countries, with total sales growing nearly 9% in the quarter. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased approximately 8% and outpaced all divisions of ANTAD, including self-service, specialty and department stores.
In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 0.2%. According to Nielsen, we continue to gain market share in traffic-driving categories, like food and consumables and health and wellness.
Turning to the U.K. Net sales declined 0.6% and comp sales declined 2.9% in the quarter. We have a lot of work to do in this market, but we're encouraged by some of the early signs of traction with improvements in the customer value proposition.
In China, net sales grew 5.4% and comp sales increased 2.3%. Sales were solid across hypermarkets and Sam's Club. We're excited about the future of e-commerce in China. The strategic alliance of JD.com will continue to expand our presence throughout the country and offer customers new and exciting products through our flagship sites of JD's platform.
So overall we're pleased with the consistent performance from our international portfolio and excited about the new fiscal year.
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. At Sam's Club, we're pleased with the efforts underway to transform the business. We're making progress in a number of areas, and we know we have to move faster to provide the value that members expect.
During the quarter, top line performance was driven by an increase in comp sales excluding fuel of 2.4%. SamsClub.com GMV was strong increasing by 25% and Club Pickup also performed well. Operating income excluding fuel declined 5.1% for the quarter. Investments in associate wages pressured expenses, along with charges related to the impairment of clubs. In addition, this year's fourth quarter included a $10 million discrete charge for discontinued real estate projects, while last year's fourth quarter included a $57 million discrete charge related to the impact of club closures. Excluding these discrete items, operating income would have declined 14.6% this quarter.
For the year, net sales excluding fuel increased 1.8% to $53.3 billion. Operating income excluding fuel declined 7.3%. Looking ahead for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%.
With that, let's discuss guidance for the total company. At our October investor meeting, we guided the fiscal 2018 full year EPS based on currency rates at that time would be relatively flat to adjusted full year fiscal 2017 EPS, and we still expect that to generally be the case. However, since then, the U.S. dollar has strengthened, in particular versus the Mexican peso, which negatively impacts our Walmex projections on a U.S. dollar basis. We also expect our tax rate next year to be higher than the rate for fiscal year 2017, which was positively impacted by transactions such as Yihaodian during the year. We expect fiscal 2018's tax rate to be around 32%, assuming no major changes to the tax environment in our major markets. As always, there can be variability from quarter to quarter. Certainly, we are aware of and engaged in the discussions around tax reform in the U S. As more information comes to light, we will continue to provide updates if any of our assumptions were to materially change.
When taking all this into consideration, we expect fiscal 2018 EPS to be in a range of $4.20 to $4.40 compared to fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS of $4.32. This assumes an expected currency impact of about $0.05 per share. As stated in October, we expect operating income to decline slightly in fiscal 2018, driven in part by continued strategic price investments, partially offset by a more disciplined approach to expenses. We would anticipate that EPS in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.90 to $1, which includes an expected currency impact of about $0.02 per share.
Net sales on a constant currency basis are anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%. We expect the underlying stores business in most parts of the world to continue to deliver solid top line results along with increased growth in our e-commerce business. We're focused on driving strong efficient growth by opening fewer new stores overall, particularly in the U.S., while prioritizing comp sales and accelerating e-commerce growth including the third-party marketplace. Based on current exchange rates, we would anticipate a currency impact on net sales of approximately $3 billion for the year. On a reported basis, we expect net sales growth of between 2% and 3%.
There are a number of additional assumptions in this guidance today including that economic conditions in the tax and regulatory landscape in our largest markets remain generally consistent. Also, as indicated at our October investor meeting, we expect capital expenditures excluding acquisitions to be approximately $11 billion for fiscal year 2018.
So in closing, I want to thank all of our great associates around the world for the progress we've made as a company this past year. As a team, we'll win with customers by serving them in new and exciting ways and deliver for our shareholders in this new fiscal year."

As you may have seen this morning, we delivered a solid first quarter and we are encouraged with our start to the year. From my view, I'd say that Walmart U.S. highlights were the 1.5% growth in comp traffic, comp store inventory being down over 7%, improved expense performance in our stores versus last year and the acceleration of e-commerce GMV growth to 69%. There were some other highlights outside the Walmart U.S. business that we'll touch on later. 
Inside the company, we can see that we are moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers, but we can also see plenty of room to improve. We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we're capable of. So that's where we are focused on. I'm really encouraged by how our store and club associates are embracing change. We are creating new solutions to help us run the business better in addition to creating a better experience for the customer in stores and online. Let me give you a few examples. A few weeks ago, while visiting stores in Oklahoma City, I saw first-hand of how the combination of some new in-store apps and mobile handhelds are improving our in-store processes and making life easier for associates. A grocery department manager in 1 store showed us how see now ensures side counter modular accuracy and in-stock with a new app we developed for our mobile handhelds. With this new app, the time to complete her work has now been reduced, improving her productivity and giving her more time to interact with customers. I saw it again last week in Omaha, Nebraska. I saw another example in Canada in April. There, we have an improved process at store level that is reducing inventory levels in the back room in a meaningful way. Our team is building better tools. Our solutions are embracing them and results are improving. 
This is important because our key to winning starts with how we work inside the company. We're transforming to become more of a digital enterprise. The change is starting to be visible to our customers as they use online grocery, Walmart Pay, Scan & Go at Sam's Club and our Walmart app to skip the line when using our pharmacies and financial services in our U.S. stores. Online grocery also continues to perform well and we are on track to scale the offering to more stores this year in several countries, including the U.S. We are taking steps to save customers time as well as money. 
Brett's going to take you through the financials, but before he does, I'll talk briefly about each area. 
Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. Comp store sales grew 1.4% and comp store traffic improved 1.5%. We got off to a slower start than expected, due in part to delayed federal tax refund checks, but saw sales strengthen throughout the quarter. We also continued to manage the business well from an inventory and availability standpoint. I recently attended the grand opening of our 100th training Academy in Edmond, Oklahoma. I met associates there who were new to Walmart and were quickly learning about our business. I also met associates who have been with us for 30, 35 and even 40 years, and they were learning about new processes and tools. I'm proud that we have lifelong learners at Walmart and I'm excited about the training we are providing. We plan to graduate approximately 225,000 associates from our U.S. academy this year. Remember, 75% of Walmart U.S. store management teams started as our associates, so it's critical we provide effective training for our associates as they take on more responsibility in our company. Overall, the store business is getting stronger and I'm thankful to and the team for thoughtful plan and the energy they are investing to lead the improvement. Greg, and the team continue to partner closely to serve our customers and figure out how to invent a seamless shopping experience for customers across our apps, sites and stores. They are territory and I'm excited about what's to come. In U.S. e-commerce, we like the traction and we are working hard to make even more improvements. Walmart.com launched 2 new initiatives in the quarter. First, we made the change to shipping terms at the beginning of the quarter. Customers don't have to pay membership fee to get 2-day shipping on millions of items. Second, we recently began offering customers pickup discounts on non-store items. Our stores are located within 10 miles of nearly 90% of the U.S. population. So this is convenient for many of our customers, and also saves them money when they order online and pick it up during their visit to our stores. Walmart.com now has 50 million first and third party items to choose from compared to 10 million at this time last year. So continues to ramp. We also made a few small, but strategic e-commerce acquisitions to further improve our assortment, while gaining critical category expertise in higher-margin categories like shoes and apparel. The acquisitions have received a lot of attention, but e-commerce is not to buy our way to success. The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up. So overall we're making progress in providing the sameness shopping experience our customers desire and we will keep moving along this journey. 
Staying the U.S., let talks about Sam's Club. John Furner and the team have hit the ground running. They're focused on members, merchandise and our associates. They achieved comp sales growth of 1.6% in the quarter led by 1.1% comp traffic growth and e-commerce GMV increased 21%. I'm excited about how we are ramping up our product brand offering with improved quality and compelling new items. We've streamlined 20 private brands into 1 and will be introducing 300 new items this year that are branded. The team at Sam's Club is also taking important steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. Outside the U.S., and the team continued to deliver solid results. Overall, constant currency sales growth of less than 1% was negatively impacted by a couple of timing and divestiture-related issues that Brett will discuss, but our underlying business continues to perform well. At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth were nearly 4% this year and 12% on a 2-year stack. In April, I visited our business in China and Japan. China continues to be on fast forward as it relates to all things digital, including e-commerce. Operationally, our stores continue to improve and Sam's Clubs are doing well. Working with JD.com and New Dada, China's largest local on-demand logistics and grocery shop for online to off-line, delivery platform. We now offer 1 hour delivery service from 80 stores. This is an improvement from the 2-hour service we launched last year. We can see the benefits of omnichannel retail even more clearly in China than any other country where we operate. Given the urban density and automobile traffic challenges, stores serve the triple purpose of in-store shopping, pickup and delivery most effectively. I saw some similarities in Japan where stores were serving more than 1 purpose. In both markets, we are piloting use of the stores shipping locations and we are learning what works best from the financial point of view in different types of store trade areas our customer densities and travel distance can vary. 
Moving on to Canada. Our business continues to perform well, delivering 12 consecutive quarters of positive comp sales. We have made some progress in the U.K. and the team is executing their plan. We are navigating our way back to a position of strength in that highly competitive market. With normalizing comp sales for the later Easter and Leap Day, we continue to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket. 
For the overall segment, international had another solid predictable quarter. The team has done a nice job of growing profit faster than sales as they simultaneously shipped our positioning in terms of store, online grocery and e-commerce. 
In conclusion, we are encouraged with our start to the year. We have a clear strategy we are executing against. We are uniquely positioned to deliver value through both our physical and digital assets. We have momentum across the business. We are making progress and we know we are on the right track as we work to become most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders. We look forward to seeing many of you next month at our annual shareholders meeting here in Northwest Arkansas. Thanks for being interested in our business. Now I'll hand it over to Brett"

As I have been saying over the past few quarters, this is an exciting time to be at Walmart and we are delivering solid results. In the U.S., important initiatives underway both accelerated growth in e-commer",1910,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As I have been saying over the past few quarters, this is an exciting time to be at Walmart and we are delivering solid results. In the U.S., important initiatives underway both accelerated growth in e-commerce and drive traffic to our stores. Most of our key international markets continue to perform well, and top line performance at Sam's Club remains solid. 
On today's call I'm going to cover our consolidated results from the first quarter, talk about e-commerce in the U.S. and then provide details on our operating segments. We will discuss the consolidated results in the context of our financial framework of strong efficient growth, operating discipline and strategic capital allocation. 
Let's start with our consolidated results. EPS was 1 dollar, which is at the top end our guidance of $0.90 to $1 and 2% higher than last year. This marks the first quarter with EPS increase in more than 2 years on an underlying basis. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue increased 2.5% to $118.8 billion as we saw solid top line performance across the business. Walmart U.S. continued its momentum with comps 1.4%, while Sam's Club posted comp sales without fuel of 1.6%. And Walmart International, 7 of our 11 markets reported positive comps, even as the timing of Easter and last year Leap Day negatively impacted results. The U.S. e-commerce GMV growth accelerated significantly, up approximately 69%. Through the lens of strong, efficient growth, I'm pleased with the results. Gross profit margin increased 1 basis point during in the quarter. The rate for Walmart U.S. was flat while Walmart International was up slightly. In regard to operating discipline, while we didn't leverage expenses on a consolidated level, primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology, I'm pleased that we leveraged in our U.S. stores. We are making progress towards our objective of slightly leveraging expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. We continue to generate strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter, $5.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Cash flow was down year-on-year, primarily due to an increase in incentive payments as well as a comparison against significant working capital improvements last year. As we strategically allocate capital, our first priority is to invest in improving and growing the business. In the quarter, we completed remodeled of 95 stores globally, and in the U.S., we continue to expand our online grocery service to include nearly 670 locations. We also added a limited number of new stores and made 2 relatively small acquisitions in the e-commerce space, Moosejaw and ModCloth, to expand our online selection and improve our category expertise in important areas like apparel and outdoor gear. 
In addition to investing the business, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Before I get into operating segment, I'll talk about Walmart's U.S. e-commerce. As a reminder, the results include all revenue transactions, including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship To Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery as well as transactions through Jet.com and other sites in our family of brands. Year-over-year growth in GMV was approximately 69%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com. This is extraordinary growth and we are pleased with the traction we are generating across our e-commerce offerings. We have recently introduced free 2-day shipping with a basket size of $35 or more on select items and launched a new service called pickup discount, where customers can order non-store products online and receive a discount for picking these items up in our stores. This is a service that's convenient for customers and saves them money. 
Let's now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. You will recall in our fourth quarter comments that at the first quarter started slower than anticipated from sales standpoint, due in part to the delayed issuance of federal income tax refund checks. As anticipated, our sales strengthened as the quarter progressed, delivering comp sales growth of 1.4%, led by an increase in customer traffic of 1.5%. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. On a 2-year stack basis, comp traffic is up 3%. Average ticket declined slightly, primarily due to lower sales of higher ticket items at the bringing of the quarter as well as continued price investment. Additionally, the grocery business continued to improve with food categories delivering the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in more than 3 years, due in part to lack of market deflation in food, excluding price investments. All store formats had positively comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment. We were really pleased with our results for the Easter holiday period, as both food and general merchandise performed well. Gross margin rate was flat in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise and the acceleration of post-holiday markdowns taken in the fourth quarter benefited the margin rate, but this was offset by investments in price and the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 14 basis points, primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn't leverage expenses for the overall segment, I'm pleased that we leveraged in the stores. Operating income increased 0.9%, which is the first increase in more than 3 years. The team continues to do a fantastic job managing inventory. During the quarter, inventory comp store fell 7.3% while in-stock levels remained high. We are pleased with the continued momentum at Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. For the 13-week period ending July 28, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%. 
Now let's move on to Walmart International. International business continues to execute against strategic priorities and delivered a solid start to the year. As I mentioned earlier, international performance was negatively impacted by 1 less operating day this year due to Leap Day last year, as well as the later timing of Easter this year. Before we get into the results, let me discuss the financial impact, beginning in the first quarter, from strategic decisions we made previously to 2 businesses, Yihaodian, China and Suburbia, Mexico. In the second quarter of last year, as part of the announced alliance with JD.com, we divested our e-commerce business in China, Yihaodian, except for the first party piece of that business. Beginning in the fourth quarter of last year, we began to wind down the first party business with only a small amount of sales remaining at the end of the first quarter of this year. This created a sales headwind versus last year of $385 million in the quarter and we expect a similar impact in each of the next couple of quarters until we the unwinding of the business. Additionally, last month, Walmex announced it completed the sale of Suburbia. The gain from sale of this business will be recorded in the second quarter of this year, and as a result we expect the net benefit to EPS of approximately $0.0.5 in the quarter. Beginning the second quarter and continuing throughout the remainder of this year, International results will be negatively impacted by the operating profit lost due to sale of the business. We expect a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.01 per the third and fourth quarters. We also expect a full year impact to sales of approximately $600 million. We will continue to detail the impacts of these transactions as we go through the year. 
Now let's move on to the overall international results. On a constant-currency basis, net sales increased 0.8%, and excluding the Yihaodian net sales increased 2.2%. Reported net sales declined 3.5%, impacted by $1.2 billion currency headwind. From a profitability standpoint, first quarter operating income increased 9% on a constant-currency basis and declined 0.1% on a reported basis. During the quarter, our benefit to operating income of approximately $47 million from a land sale was recorded in one of our markets, Excluding this item, operating income would have increased 5% on a constant-currency basis. 
Let's turn to some brief highlights of key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 4 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant-currency basis. Let's begin with Walmex, where sales momentum continued across all countries and regions. Total sales increased 5.2% and comp sales growth was 3.7%. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased form 13% on a 2-year stack basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced. In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 1.5%. During the quarter, we reduced inventory levels even as sales increased, and according to Nielsen, we continued to gain market share in key traffic driving categories like food and consumables and health and wellness. Continued investments in price and in-store efficiency initiatives are being supported by progress with our cost analytics program. 
In China, net sales increased 0.7% and comp sales decreased 1.3%. In addition to the impact of 1 less day in the quarter due to Leap Day last year, sales were impacted by our strategic decision to reduce low-margin sales. During the quarter, we continued to expand our e-commerce offering by entering new cities through our crowd source delivery partnership with New Dada and now offer 1-hour delivery from 80 stores. We also launched new product categories, such as produce and frozen items on our Sam's Club flagship store on the JD.com platform. 
Turning to the U.K. , net sales increased 0.9.% while comp sales declined 2.8%. For normalizing for leap day last year and later Easter this year, we continue to see sequential improvement in the underlying business, including customer traffic and ticket. We are confident we are on the right track. 
So overall, our international strategy continues to produce consistent results, and we are pleased with the solid start to the year. 
Let's turn to the Sam's Club. At Sam's Club, comp sales without fuel increased 1.6% as traffic grew by 1.1%. We had good results across many of our categories and comps have been positive for 5 consecutive quarters. We are also pleased with our digital growth as Club Pickup increased nearly 30%. The team at Sam's is taking steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. The initiatives underway at Sam's are designed to grow membership and sales, and we know it all starts with member experience. We will deliver for them through our efforts to lead in digital and provide unmatched value on great merchandise. For the 13-week period ending July 28,2017, we expect comp sales without fuel to increase between 1% and 1.5%. 
With that, let's discuss total company EPS guidance. We feel good about the momentum across the business and expect progress to continue. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we expect EPS, excluding the gain from the sale of Suburbia, to be between $1 and $1.08. 
In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the important work you do every day. As a company, we are moving with speed and executing against the strategy we have outlined, and it's all happening through the lens of our financial framework. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Shareholders Meeting in a few weeks."

As you may have seen this morning, we delivered a solid first quarter, and we're encouraged with our start to the year. From my view, I'd say that Walmart U.S. highlights were the 1.5% growth in comp traffic, comp store inventory being down over 7%, improved expense performance in our stores versus last year and the acceleration of e-commerce GMV growth to 69%. There were some other highlights outside the Walmart U.S. business that we'll touch on later. 
Inside the company, we can see that we're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers, but we can also see plenty of room to improve. We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we're capable of. So that's where we're focused on. 
I'm really encouraged by how our store and club associates are embracing change. We're creating new solutions to help us run the business better in addition to creating a better experience for the customer in stores and online. 
Let me give you a few examples. 
A few weeks ago, while visiting stores in Oklahoma City, I saw first hand how the combination of some new in-store apps and mobile handhelds are improving our in-store processes and making life easier for associates. A grocery department manager in one store showed us how she now ensures side counter modular accuracy and in-stock with a new app we developed for our mobile handhelds. With this new app, the time to complete her work has now been reduced, improving her productivity and giving her more time to interact with customers. I saw it again last week in Omaha, Nebraska. 
I saw another example in Canada in April. There, we have an improved process at store level that is reducing inventory levels in the back room in a meaningful way. Our team is building better tools. Our associates are embracing them and the results are improving. 
This is important because it's our key to winning starts with how we work inside the company. We're transforming to become more of a digital enterprise. The change is starting to be visible to our customers as they use Online Grocery, Walmart Pay, Scan & Go in Sam's Club and our Walmart app to skip the line when using our pharmacies and financial services in our U.S. stores. Online Grocery also continues to perform well, and we're on track to scale the offering to more stores this year in several countries, including the U.S. We're taking steps to save customers time as well as money. 
Brett is going to take you through the financials, but before he does, I'll talk briefly about each area. 
Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. 
Comp store sales grew 1.4% and comp store traffic improved 1.5%. We got off to a slower start than expected due in part to delayed federal tax refund checks but saw sales strengthen throughout the quarter. We also continued to manage the business well from an inventory and availability standpoint. 
I recently attended the grand opening of our 100th training academy in Edmond, Oklahoma. I met associates there who were new to Walmart and were quickly learning about our business. I also met associates who have been with us for 30, 35 and even 40 years, and they were learning about new processes and tools. 
I'm proud that we have lifelong learners at Walmart, and I'm excited about the training we're providing. We plan to graduate approximately 225,000 associates from our U.S. academies this year. Remember, 75% of our Walmart U.S. store management teams started as hourly associates, so it's critical we provide effective training for our associates as they take on more responsibility in our company. 
Overall, the store business is getting stronger, and I'm thankful to Greg Foran and the team for a thoughtful plan and the energy they're investing to lead the improvement. Greg, Marc Lore and the team continue to partner closely to serve our customers and figure out how to invent a seamless shopping experience for customers across our apps, sites and stores. They are plowing new territory, and I'm excited about what's to come. 
In U.S. e-commerce, we like the traction, and we're working hard to make even more improvements. Walmart.com launched 2 new initiatives in the quarter. First, we made a change to shipping terms at the beginning of the quarter. Customers don't have to pay a membership fee to get 2-day shipping on millions of items. Second, we recently began offering customers pickup discounts on non-store items. Our stores are located within 10 miles of nearly 90% of the U.S. population, so this is convenient for many of our customers and also saves them money when they order online and pick it up during their visit to our stores. Walmart.com now has 50 million first- and third-party items to choose from compared to 10 million at this time last year. So our assortment continues to ramp. 
We also made a few small but strategic e-commerce acquisitions to further improve our assortment while gaining critical category expertise in higher-margin categories like shoes and apparel. The acquisitions have received a lot of attention, but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success. The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up. So overall, we're making progress in providing the seamless shopping experience our customers desire, and we will keep moving along this journey. 
Staying in the U.S., let talk about Sam's Club. John Furner and the team have hit the ground running. They're focused on members, merchandise and our associates. They achieved comp sales growth of 1.6% in the quarter, led by a 1.1% comp traffic growth, and e-commerce GMV increased 21%. 
I'm excited about how we're ramping up our product brand offering with improved quality and compelling new items. We've streamlined 20 private brands into 1, and we'll be introducing 300 new items this year that are branded Member's Mark. The team at Sam's Club is also taking important steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. 
Outside the U.S., Dave Cheesewright and the team continued to deliver solid results. Overall, constant currency sales growth of less than 1% was negatively impacted by a couple of timing and divestiture-related issues that Brett will discuss, but our underlying business continues to perform well. 
At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was nearly 4% this year and 12% on a 2-year stack. 
In April, I visited our businesses in China and Japan. China continues to be on fast forward as it relates to all things digital, including e-commerce. Operationally, our stores continued to improve and Sam's Clubs are doing well, working with JD.com and New Dada, China's largest local on-demand logistics and grocery O2O, short for online to off-line, delivery platform. We now offer 1-hour delivery service from 80 stores. This is an improvement from the 2-hour service we launched last year. 
We can see the benefits of omnichannel retail even more clearly in China than any other country where we operate. Given their urban density and automobile traffic challenges, stores serve the triple purpose of in-store shopping, pickup and delivery most effectively. 
I saw some similarities in Japan, where stores were serving more than one purpose. In both markets, we're piloting the use of the stores as shipping locations, and we're learning what works best from a financial point of view in different types of store trade areas given how customer densities and travel distance can vary. 
Moving on to Canada. Our business continues to perform well, delivering 12 consecutive quarters of positive comp sales. 
We've made some progress in the U.K., and the team is executing their plan. We're navigating our way back to a position of strength in that highly competitive market. When normalizing comp sales for the later Easter and Leap Day, we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket. 
For the overall segment, International had another solid, predictable quarter. The team has done a nice job of growing profit faster than sales as they simultaneously shift our positioning in terms of store formats, Online Grocery and e-commerce. 
In conclusion, we're encouraged with our start to the year. We have a clear strategy we're executing against. We're uniquely positioned to deliver value through both our physical and digital assets. We have momentum across the business. We're making progress, and we know we're on the right track as we work to become the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders. We look forward to seeing many of you next month at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting here in Northwest Arkansas. 
Thanks for being interested in our business. Now I'll hand it over to Brett."

As I've been saying over the past few quarters, this is an exciting time to be at Walmart, and we are delivering solid results. In the U.S., important initiatives are under way both to accelerate growth in e-commerce and drive traffic to our stores. Most of our key international markets continue to perform well, and top line performance at Sam's Club remains solid. 
On today's call, I'm going to cover our consolidated results from the first quarter, talk about e-commerce in the U.S. and then provide details on our operating segments. We'll discuss the consolidated results in the context of our financial framework of strong, efficient growth, operating discipline and strategic capital allocation. 
Let's start with our consolidated results. 
EPS was $1, which is at the top end our guidance of $0.90 to $1 and 2% higher than last year. This marks the first quarterly EPS increase in more than 2 years on an underlying basis. 
On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 2.5% to $118.8 billion as we saw solid top line performance across the business. Walmart U.S. continued its momentum with comps of 1.4%, while Sam's Club posted comp sales, without fuel, of 1.6%. In Walmart International, 7 of our 11 markets reported positive comps even as the timing of Easter and last year's Leap Day negatively impacted results. The U.S. e-commerce GMV growth accelerated significantly, up approximately 69%. 
Through the lens of strong, efficient growth, I'm pleased with the results. Gross profit margin increased 1 basis point during the quarter. The rate for Walmart U.S. was flat while Walmart International was up slightly. 
In regard to operating discipline, while we didn't leverage expenses on a consolidated level primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology, I'm pleased that we leveraged in our U.S. stores. We're making progress towards our objective of slightly leveraging expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. 
We continued to generate strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter, $5.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Cash flow was down year-on-year primarily due to an increase in incentive payments as well as a comparison against significant working capital improvements last year. 
As we strategically allocate capital, our first priority is to invest in improving and growing the business. In the quarter, we completed remodels of 95 stores globally; and in the U.S., we continued to expand our Online Grocery service to include nearly 670 locations. We also added a limited number of new stores and made 2 relatively small acquisitions in the e-commerce space, Moosejaw and ModCloth, to expand our online selection and improve our category expertise in important areas like apparel and outdoor gear. 
In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. 
Before I get into our operating segments, I'll talk about Walmart U.S. e-commerce. As a reminder, the results include all web-initiated transactions, including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship To Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and other sites in our family of brands. 
Year-over-year growth in GMV was approximately 69%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com. This was extraordinary growth, and we're pleased with the traction we're generating across our e-commerce offerings. 
We've recently introduced free 2-day shipping with a basket size of $35 or more on select items and launched a new service called Pickup Discount, where customers can order non-store products online and receive a discount for picking these items up in our stores. This is a service that's convenient for customers and saves them money. 
Let's now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. 
You will recall in our fourth quarter comments that the first quarter started out slower than anticipated from a sales standpoint, due in part to the delayed issuance of federal income tax refund checks. As anticipated, our sales strengthened as the quarter progressed, delivering comp sales growth of 1.4%, led by an increase in customer traffic of 1.5%. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. On a 2-year stack basis, comp traffic is up 3%. Average ticket declined slightly primarily due to lower sales of higher-ticket items at the bringing of the quarter, as well as continued price investment. Additionally, the grocery business continued to improve with food categories delivering the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in more than 3 years, due in part to a lack of market deflation in food, excluding price investments. 
All store formats had positive comp sales, and e-commerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment. We were really pleased with our results for the Easter holiday period as both food and general merchandise performed well. 
Gross margin rate was flat in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise and the acceleration of post-holiday markdowns taken in the fourth quarter benefited the margin rate, but this was offset by investments in price and the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 14 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn't leverage expenses for the overall segment, I'm pleased that we leveraged in the stores. 
Operating income increased 0.9%, which is the first increase in more than 3 years. 
The team continues to do a fantastic job managing inventory. During the quarter, inventory at comp store fell 7.3% while in-stock levels remained high. 
We're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. For the 13-week period ending July 28, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%. 
Now let's move on to Walmart International. 
International business continues to execute against its strategic priorities and delivered a solid start to the year. As I mentioned earlier, International performance was negatively impacted by 1 less operating day this year due to Leap Day last year, as well as the later timing of Easter this year. 
Before we get into the results, let me discuss the financial impact, beginning in the first quarter, from strategic decisions we made previously to divest 2 businesses, Yihaodian in China and Suburbia in Mexico. 
In the second quarter of last year, as part of the announced alliance with JD.com, we divested our e-commerce business in China, Yihaodian, except for the first-party piece of that business. Beginning in the fourth quarter of last year, we began to wind down the first-party business, with only a small amount of sales remaining at the end of the first quarter of this year. This created a sales headwind versus last year of $385 million in the quarter, and we expect a similar impact in each of the next couple of quarters until we lap the unwinding of the business. 
Additionally, last month, Walmex announced it completed the sale of its apparel format, Suburbia. The gain from the sale of this business will be recorded in the second quarter of this year, and as a result, we expect a net benefit to EPS of approximately $0.05 in the quarter. Beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the remainder of this year, International's results will be negatively impacted by the operating profit lost due to sale of the business. We expect a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.01 for the third and fourth quarters. We also expect a full year impact to sales of approximately $600 million. 
We'll continue to detail the impacts of these transactions as we go through the year. 
Now let's move on to the overall International results. 
On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 0.8%. And excluding Yihaodian, net sales increased 2.2%. Reported net sales declined 3.5%, impacted by a $1.2 billion currency headwind. 
From a profitability standpoint, first quarter operating income increased 9% on a constant currency basis and declined 0.1% on a reported basis. 
During the quarter, a benefit to operating income of approximately $47 million from a land sale was recorded in one of our markets. Excluding this item, operating income would have increased 5% on a constant currency basis. 
Let's now turn to some brief highlights of key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 4 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. 
Let's begin with Walmex, where sales momentum continued across all countries and regions. 
Total sales increased 5.2% and comp sales growth was 3.7%. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased over 13% on a 2-year stack basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service. 
In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 1.5%. During the quarter, we reduced inventory levels even as sales increased. And according to Nielsen, we continued to gain market share in key traffic-driving categories like food and consumables and health and wellness. Continued planned investments in price and in-store efficiency initiatives are being supported by progress with our cost analytics program. 
In China, net sales increased 0.7% and comp sales decreased 1.3%. In addition to the impact of 1 less day in the quarter due to Leap Day last year, sales were impacted by our strategic decision to reduce low-margin bulk sales. During the quarter, we continued to expand our e-commerce offering by entering new cities through our crowd-sourced delivery partnership with New Dada and now offer 1-hour delivery from 80 stores. We also launched new product categories, such as produce and frozen items, on our Sam's Club flagship store on the JD.com platform. 
Turning to the U.K. Net sales increased 0.9.% while comp sales declined 2.8%. When normalizing for Leap Day last year and a later Easter this year, we continued to see sequential improvement in the underlying business, including customer traffic and ticket. We're confident we're on the right track. 
So overall, our International strategy continues to produce consistent results, and we are pleased with the solid start to the year. 
Let's turn to Sam's Club. 
At Sam's Club, comp sales, without fuel, increased 1.6% as traffic grew by 1.1%. We had good results across many of our categories and comps have been positive for 5 consecutive quarters. We're also pleased with our digital growth as Club Pickup increased nearly 30%. The team at Sam's is taking steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. The initiatives under way at Sam's are designed to grow membership and sales, and we know it all starts with member experience. We'll deliver for them through our efforts to lead in digital and provide unmatched value on great merchandise. 
For the 13-week period ending July 28,2017, we expect comp sales, without fuel, to increase between 1% and 1.5%. 
With that, let's discuss total company EPS guidance. 
We feel good about the momentum across the business and expect progress to continue. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we expect EPS, excluding the gain from the sale of Suburbia, to be between $1 and $1.08. 
In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the important work you do every day. As a company, we're moving with speed and executing against the strategy we've outlined, and it's all happening through the lens of our financial framework. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting in a few weeks."

As you may have seen this morning, we delivered a solid first quarter, and we're encouraged with our start to the year. From my view, I'd say that Walmart U.S. highlights were the 1.5% growth in comp traffic, comp store inventory being down over 7%, improved expense performance in our stores versus last year and the acceleration of e-commerce GMV growth to 69%. There were some other highlights outside the Walmart U.S. business that we'll touch on later. 
Inside the company, we can see that we're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers, but we can also see plenty of room to improve. We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we're capable of. So that's where we're focused on. 
I'm really encouraged by how our store and club associates are embracing change. We're creating new solutions to help us run the business better in addition to creating a better experience for the customer in stores and online. 
Let me give you a few examples. 
A few weeks ago, while visiting stores in Oklahoma City, I saw first hand how the combination of some new in-store apps and mobile handhelds are improving our in-store processes and making life easier for associates. A grocery department manager in one store showed us how she now ensures side counter modular accuracy and in-stock with a new app we developed for our mobile handhelds. With this new app, the time to complete her work has now been reduced, improving her productivity and giving her more time to interact with customers. I saw it again last week in Omaha, Nebraska. 
I saw another example in Canada in April. There, we have an improved process at store level that is reducing inventory levels in the back room in a meaningful way. Our team is building better tools. Our associates are embracing them and the results are improving. 
This is important because it's our key to winning starts with how we work inside the company. We're transforming to become more of a digital enterprise. The change is starting to be visible to our customers as they use Online Grocery, Walmart Pay, Scan & Go in Sam's Club and our Walmart app to skip the line when using our pharmacies and financial services in our U.S. stores. Online Grocery also continues to perform well, and we're on track to scale the offering to more stores this year in several countries, including the U.S. We're taking steps to save customers time as well as money. 
Brett is going to take you through the financials, but before he does, I'll talk briefly about each area. 
Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. 
Comp store sales grew 1.4% and comp store traffic improved 1.5%. We got off to a slower start than expected due in part to delayed federal tax refund checks but saw sales strengthen throughout the quarter. We also continued to manage the business well from an inventory and availability standpoint. 
I recently attended the grand opening of our 100th training academy in Edmond, Oklahoma. I met associates there who were new to Walmart and were quickly learning about our business. I also met associates who have been with us for 30, 35 and even 40 years, and they were learning about new processes and tools. 
I'm proud that we have lifelong learners at Walmart, and I'm excited about the training we're providing. We plan to graduate approximately 225,000 associates from our U.S. academies this year. Remember, 75% of our Walmart U.S. store management teams started as hourly associates, so it's critical we provide effective training for our associates as they take on more responsibility in our company. 
Overall, the store business is getting stronger, and I'm thankful to Greg Foran and the team for a thoughtful plan and the energy they're investing to lead the improvement. Greg, Marc Lore and the team continue to partner closely to serve our customers and figure out how to invent a seamless shopping experience for customers across our apps, sites and stores. They are plowing new territory, and I'm excited about what's to come. 
In U.S. e-commerce, we like the traction, and we're working hard to make even more improvements. Walmart.com launched 2 new initiatives in the quarter. First, we made a change to shipping terms at the beginning of the quarter. Customers don't have to pay a membership fee to get 2-day shipping on millions of items. Second, we recently began offering customers pickup discounts on nonstore items. Our stores are located within 10 miles of nearly 90% of the U.S. population, so this is convenient for many of our customers and also saves them money when they order online and pick it up during their visit to our stores. Walmart.com now has 50 million first- and third-party items to choose from compared to 10 million at this time last year. So our assortment continues to ramp. 
We also made a few small but strategic e-commerce acquisitions to further improve our assortment while gaining critical category expertise in higher-margin categories like shoes and apparel. The acquisitions have received a lot of attention, but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success. The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up. So overall, we're making progress in providing the seamless shopping experience our customers desire, and we will keep moving along this journey. 
Staying in the U.S., let talk about Sam's Club. John Furner and the team have hit the ground running. They're focused on members, merchandise and our associates. They achieved comp sales growth of 1.6% in the quarter, led by a 1.1% comp traffic growth, and e-commerce GMV increased 21%. 
I'm excited about how we're ramping up our product brand offering with improved quality and compelling new items. We've streamlined 20 private brands into 1, and we'll be introducing 300 new items this year that are branded Member's Mark. The team at Sam's Club is also taking important steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. 
Outside the U.S., Dave Cheesewright and the team continued to deliver solid results. Overall, constant currency sales growth of less than 1% was negatively impacted by a couple of timing and divestiture-related issues that Brett will discuss, but our underlying business continues to perform well. 
At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was nearly 4% this year and 12% on a 2-year stack. 
In April, I visited our businesses in China and Japan. China continues to be on fast forward as it relates to all things digital, including e-commerce. Operationally, our stores continued to improve and Sam's Clubs are doing well, working with JD.com and New Dada, China's largest local on-demand logistics and grocery O2O, short for online to off-line, delivery platform. We now offer 1-hour delivery service from 80 stores. This is an improvement from the 2-hour service we launched last year. 
We can see the benefits of omnichannel retail even more clearly in China than any other country where we operate. Given their urban density and automobile traffic challenges, stores serve the triple purpose of in-store shopping, pickup and delivery most effectively. 
I saw some similarities in Japan, where stores were serving more than one purpose. In both markets, we're piloting the use of the stores as shipping locations, and we're learning what works best from a financial point of view in different types of store trade areas given how customer densities and travel distance can vary. 
Moving on to Canada. Our business continues to perform well, delivering 12 consecutive quarters of positive comp sales. 
We've made some progress in the U.K., and the team is executing their plan. We're navigating our way back to a position of strength in that highly competitive market. When normalizing comp sales for the later Easter and Leap Day, we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket. 
For the overall segment, International had another solid, predictable quarter. The team has done a nice job of growing profit faster than sales as they simultaneously shift our positioning in terms of store formats, Online Grocery and e-commerce. 
In conclusion, we're encouraged with our start to the year. We have a clear strategy we're executing against. We're uniquely positioned to deliver value through both our physical and digital assets. We have momentum across the business. We're making progress, and we know we're on the right track as we work to become the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders. We look forward to seeing many of you next month at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting here in Northwest Arkansas. 
Thanks for being interested in our business. Now I'll hand it over to Brett."

As I've been saying over the past few quarters, this is an exciting time to be at Walmart, and we are delivering solid results. In the U.S., important initiatives are under way both to accelerate growth in e-commerce and drive traffic to our stores. Most of our key international markets continue to perform well, and top line performance at Sam's Club remains solid. 
On today's call, I'm going to cover our consolidated results from the first quarter, talk about e-commerce in the U.S. and then provide details on our operating segments. We'll discuss the consolidated results in the context of our financial framework of strong, efficient growth, operating discipline and strategic capital allocation. 
Let's start with our consolidated results. 
EPS was $1, which is at the top end our guidance of $0.90 to $1 and 2% higher than last year. This marks the first quarterly EPS increase in more than 2 years on an underlying basis. 
On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 2.5% to $118.8 billion as we saw solid top line performance across the business. Walmart U.S. continued its momentum with comps of 1.4%, while Sam's Club posted comp sales, without fuel, of 1.6%. In Walmart International, 7 of our 11 markets reported positive comps even as the timing of Easter and last year's Leap Day negatively impacted results. The U.S. e-commerce GMV growth accelerated significantly, up approximately 69%. 
Through the lens of strong, efficient growth, I'm pleased with the results. Gross profit margin increased 1 basis point during the quarter. The rate for Walmart U.S. was flat while Walmart International was up slightly. 
In regard to operating discipline, while we didn't leverage expenses on a consolidated level primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology, I'm pleased that we leveraged in our U.S. stores. We're making progress towards our objective of slightly leveraging expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. 
We continued to generate strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter, $5.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Cash flow was down year-on-year primarily due to an increase in incentive payments as well as a comparison against significant working capital improvements last year. 
As we strategically allocate capital, our first priority is to invest in improving and growing the business. In the quarter, we completed remodels of 95 stores globally; and in the U.S., we continued to expand our Online Grocery service to include nearly 670 locations. We also added a limited number of new stores and made 2 relatively small acquisitions in the e-commerce space, Moosejaw and ModCloth, to expand our online selection and improve our category expertise in important areas like apparel and outdoor gear. 
In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. 
Before I get into our operating segments, I'll talk about Walmart U.S. e-commerce. As a reminder, the results include all web-initiated transactions, including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship To Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and other sites in our family of brands. 
Year-over-year growth in GMV was approximately 69%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com. This was extraordinary growth, and we're pleased with the traction we're generating across our e-commerce offerings. 
We've recently introduced free 2-day shipping with a basket size of $35 or more on select items and launched a new service called Pickup Discount, where customers can order nonstore products online and receive a discount for picking these items up in our stores. This is a service that's convenient for customers and saves them money. 
Let's now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. 
You will recall in our fourth quarter comments that the first quarter started out slower than anticipated from a sales standpoint, due in part to the delayed issuance of federal income tax refund checks. As anticipated, our sales strengthened as the quarter progressed, delivering comp sales growth of 1.4%, led by an increase in customer traffic of 1.5%. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. On a 2-year stack basis, comp traffic is up 3%. Average ticket declined slightly primarily due to lower sales of higher-ticket items at the bringing of the quarter, as well as continued price investment. Additionally, the grocery business continued to improve with food categories delivering the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in more than 3 years, due in part to a lack of market deflation in food, excluding price investments. 
All store formats had positive comp sales, and e-commerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment. We were really pleased with our results for the Easter holiday period as both food and general merchandise performed well. 
Gross margin rate was flat in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise and the acceleration of post-holiday markdowns taken in the fourth quarter benefited the margin rate, but this was offset by investments in price and the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 14 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn't leverage expenses for the overall segment, I'm pleased that we leveraged in the stores. 
Operating income increased 0.9%, which is the first increase in more than 3 years. 
The team continues to do a fantastic job managing inventory. During the quarter, inventory at comp store fell 7.3% while in-stock levels remained high. 
We're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. For the 13-week period ending July 28, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%. 
Now let's move on to Walmart International. 
International business continues to execute against its strategic priorities and delivered a solid start to the year. As I mentioned earlier, International performance was negatively impacted by 1 less operating day this year due to Leap Day last year, as well as the later timing of Easter this year. 
Before we get into the results, let me discuss the financial impact, beginning in the first quarter, from strategic decisions we made previously to divest 2 businesses, Yihaodian in China and Suburbia in Mexico. 
In the second quarter of last year, as part of the announced alliance with JD.com, we divested our e-commerce business in China, Yihaodian, except for the first-party piece of that business. Beginning in the fourth quarter of last year, we began to wind down the first-party business, with only a small amount of sales remaining at the end of the first quarter of this year. This created a sales headwind versus last year of $385 million in the quarter, and we expect a similar impact in each of the next couple of quarters until we lap the unwinding of the business. 
Additionally, last month, Walmex announced it completed the sale of its apparel format, Suburbia. The gain from the sale of this business will be recorded in the second quarter of this year, and as a result, we expect a net benefit to EPS of approximately $0.05 in the quarter. Beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the remainder of this year, International's results will be negatively impacted by the operating profit lost due to sale of the business. We expect a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.01 for the third and fourth quarters. We also expect a full year impact to sales of approximately $600 million. 
We'll continue to detail the impacts of these transactions as we go through the year. 
Now let's move on to the overall International results. 
On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 0.8%. And excluding Yihaodian, net sales increased 2.2%. Reported net sales declined 3.5%, impacted by a $1.2 billion currency headwind. 
From a profitability standpoint, first quarter operating income increased 9% on a constant currency basis and declined 0.1% on a reported basis. 
During the quarter, a benefit to operating income of approximately $47 million from a land sale was recorded in one of our markets. Excluding this item, operating income would have increased 5% on a constant currency basis. 
Let's now turn to some brief highlights of key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 4 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. 
Let's begin with Walmex, where sales momentum continued across all countries and regions. 
Total sales increased 5.2% and comp sales growth was 3.7%. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased over 13% on a 2-year stack basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service. 
In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 1.5%. During the quarter, we reduced inventory levels even as sales increased. And according to Nielsen, we continued to gain market share in key traffic-driving categories like food and consumables and health and wellness. Continued planned investments in price and in-store efficiency initiatives are being supported by progress with our cost analytics program. 
In China, net sales increased 0.7% and comp sales decreased 1.3%. In addition to the impact of 1 less day in the quarter due to Leap Day last year, sales were impacted by our strategic decision to reduce low-margin bulk sales. During the quarter, we continued to expand our e-commerce offering by entering new cities through our crowd-sourced delivery partnership with New Dada and now offer 1-hour delivery from 80 stores. We also launched new product categories, such as produce and frozen items, on our Sam's Club flagship store on the JD.com platform. 
Turning to the U.K. Net sales increased 0.9.% while comp sales declined 2.8%. When normalizing for Leap Day last year and a later Easter this year, we continued to see sequential improvement in the underlying business, including customer traffic and ticket. We're confident we're on the right track. 
So overall, our International strategy continues to produce consistent results, and we are pleased with the solid start to the year. 
Let's turn to Sam's Club. 
At Sam's Club, comp sales, without fuel, increased 1.6% as traffic grew by 1.1%. We had good results across many of our categories and comps have been positive for 5 consecutive quarters. We're also pleased with our digital growth as Club Pickup increased nearly 30%. The team at Sam's is taking steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. The initiatives under way at Sam's are designed to grow membership and sales, and we know it all starts with member experience. We'll deliver for them through our efforts to lead in digital and provide unmatched value on great merchandise. 
For the 13-week period ending July 28,2017, we expect comp sales, without fuel, to increase between 1% and 1.5%. 
With that, let's discuss total company EPS guidance. 
We feel good about the momentum across the business and expect progress to continue. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we expect EPS, excluding the gain from the sale of Suburbia, to be between $1 and $1.08. 
In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the important work you do every day. As a company, we're moving with speed and executing against the strategy we've outlined, and it's all happening through the lens of our financial framework. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting in a few weeks."

As you may have seen this morning, we delivered a solid first quarter, and we're encouraged with our start to the year. From my view, I'd say that Walmart U.S. highlights were the 1.5% growth in comp traffic, comp store inventory being down over 7%, improved expense performance in our stores versus last year and the acceleration of e-commerce GMV growth to 69%. There were some other highlights outside the Walmart U.S. business that we'll touch on later. 
Inside the company, we can see that we're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers, but we can also see plenty of room to improve. We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we're capable of. So that's where we're focused on. 
I'm really encouraged by how our store and club associates are embracing change. We're creating new solutions to help us run the business better in addition to creating a better experience for the customer in stores and online. 
Let me give you a few examples. 
A few weeks ago, while visiting stores in Oklahoma City, I saw firsthand how the combination of some new in-store apps and mobile handhelds are improving our in-store processes and making life easier for associates. A grocery department manager in one store showed us how she now ensures side counter modular accuracy and in-stock with a new app we developed for our mobile handhelds. With this new app, the time to complete her work has now been reduced, improving her productivity and giving her more time to interact with customers. I saw it again last week in Omaha, Nebraska. 
I saw another example in Canada in April. There, we have an improved process at store level that is reducing inventory levels in the back room in a meaningful way. Our team is building better tools. Our associates are embracing them and the results are improving. 
This is important because it's our key to winning starts with how we work inside the company. We're transforming to become more of a digital enterprise. The change is starting to be visible to our customers as they use Online Grocery, Walmart Pay, Scan & Go in Sam's Club and our Walmart app to skip the line when using our pharmacies and financial services in our U.S. stores. Online Grocery also continues to perform well, and we're on track to scale the offering to more stores this year in several countries, including the U.S. We're taking steps to save customers time as well as money. 
Brett is going to take you through the financials, but before he does, I'll talk briefly about each area. 
Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. 
Comp store sales grew 1.4% and comp store traffic improved 1.5%. We got off to a slower start than expected due in part to delayed federal tax refund checks but saw sales strengthen throughout the quarter. We also continued to manage the business well from an inventory and availability standpoint. 
I recently attended the grand opening of our 100th training academy in Edmond, Oklahoma. I met associates there who were new to Walmart and were quickly learning about our business. I also met associates who have been with us for 30, 35 and even 40 years, and they were learning about new processes and tools. 
I'm proud that we have lifelong learners at Walmart, and I'm excited about the training we're providing. We plan to graduate approximately 225,000 associates from our U.S. academies this year. Remember, 75% of our Walmart U.S. store management teams started as hourly associates, so it's critical we provide effective training for our associates as they take on more responsibility in our company. 
Overall, the store business is getting stronger, and I'm thankful to Greg Foran and the team for a thoughtful plan and the energy they're investing to lead the improvement. Greg, Marc Lore and the team continue to partner closely to serve our customers and figure out how to invent a seamless shopping experience for customers across our apps, sites and stores. They are plowing new territory, and I'm excited about what's to come. 
In U.S. e-commerce, we like the traction, and we're working hard to make even more improvements. Walmart.com launched 2 new initiatives in the quarter. First, we made a change to shipping terms at the beginning of the quarter. Customers don't have to pay a membership fee to get 2-day shipping on millions of items. Second, we recently began offering customers pickup discounts on nonstore items. Our stores are located within 10 miles of nearly 90% of the U.S. population, so this is convenient for many of our customers and also saves them money when they order online and pick it up during their visit to our stores. Walmart.com now has 50 million first- and third-party items to choose from compared to 10 million at this time last year. So our assortment continues to ramp. 
We also made a few small but strategic e-commerce acquisitions to further improve our assortment while gaining critical category expertise in higher-margin categories like shoes and apparel. The acquisitions have received a lot of attention, but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success. The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up. So overall, we're making progress in providing the seamless shopping experience our customers desire, and we will keep moving along this journey. 
Staying in the U.S., let talk about Sam's Club. John Furner and the team have hit the ground running. They're focused on members, merchandise and our associates. They achieved comp sales growth of 1.6% in the quarter, led by a 1.1% comp traffic growth, and e-commerce GMV increased 21%. 
I'm excited about how we're ramping up our product brand offering with improved quality and compelling new items. We've streamlined 20 private brands into 1, and we'll be introducing 300 new items this year that are branded Member's Mark. The team at Sam's Club is also taking important steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. 
Outside the U.S., Dave Cheesewright and the team continued to deliver solid results. Overall, constant currency sales growth of less than 1% was negatively impacted by a couple of timing and divestiture-related issues that Brett will discuss, but our underlying business continues to perform well. 
At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was nearly 4% this year and 12% on a 2-year stack. 
In April, I visited our businesses in China and Japan. China continues to be on fast forward as it relates to all things digital, including e-commerce. Operationally, our stores continued to improve and Sam's Clubs are doing well, working with JD.com and New Dada, China's largest local on-demand logistics and grocery O2O, short for online to off-line, delivery platform. We now offer 1-hour delivery service from 80 stores. This is an improvement from the 2-hour service we launched last year. 
We can see the benefits of omnichannel retail even more clearly in China than any other country where we operate. Given their urban density and automobile traffic challenges, stores serve the triple purpose of in-store shopping, pickup and delivery most effectively. 
I saw some similarities in Japan, where stores were serving more than one purpose. In both markets, we're piloting the use of the stores as shipping locations, and we're learning what works best from a financial point of view in different types of store trade areas given how customer densities and travel distance can vary. 
Moving on to Canada. Our business continues to perform well, delivering 12 consecutive quarters of positive comp sales. 
We've made some progress in the U.K., and the team is executing their plan. We're navigating our way back to a position of strength in that highly competitive market. When normalizing comp sales for the later Easter and Leap Day, we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket. 
For the overall segment, International had another solid, predictable quarter. The team has done a nice job of growing profit faster than sales as they simultaneously shift our positioning in terms of store formats, Online Grocery and e-commerce. 
In conclusion, we're encouraged with our start to the year. We have a clear strategy we're executing against. We're uniquely positioned to deliver value through both our physical and digital assets. We have momentum across the business. We're making progress, and we know we're on the right track as we work to become the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders. We look forward to seeing many of you next month at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting here in Northwest Arkansas. 
Thanks for being interested in our business. Now I'll hand it over to Brett."

As I've been saying over the past few quarters, this is an exciting time to be at Walmart, and we are delivering solid results. In the U.S., important initiatives are under way both to accelerate growth in e-commerce and drive traffic to our stores. Most of our key international markets continue to perform well, and top line performance at Sam's Club remains solid. 
On today's call, I'm going to cover our consolidated results from the first quarter, talk about e-commerce in the U.S. and then provide details on our operating segments. We'll discuss the consolidated results in the context of our financial framework of strong, efficient growth, operating discipline and strategic capital allocation. 
Let's start with our consolidated results. 
EPS was $1, which is at the top end our guidance of $0.90 to $1 and 2% higher than last year. This marks the first quarterly EPS increase in more than 2 years on an underlying basis. 
On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 2.5% to $118.8 billion as we saw solid top line performance across the business. Walmart U.S. continued its momentum with comps of 1.4%, while Sam's Club posted comp sales, without fuel, of 1.6%. In Walmart International, 7 of our 11 markets reported positive comps even as the timing of Easter and last year's Leap Day negatively impacted results. The U.S. e-commerce GMV growth accelerated significantly, up approximately 69%. 
Through the lens of strong, efficient growth, I'm pleased with the results. Gross profit margin increased 1 basis point during the quarter. The rate for Walmart U.S. was flat while Walmart International was up slightly. 
In regard to operating discipline, while we didn't leverage expenses on a consolidated level primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology, I'm pleased that we leveraged in our U.S. stores. We're making progress towards our objective of slightly leveraging expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. 
We continued to generate strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter, $5.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Cash flow was down year-on-year primarily due to an increase in incentive payments as well as a comparison against significant working capital improvements last year. 
As we strategically allocate capital, our first priority is to invest in improving and growing the business. In the quarter, we completed remodels of 95 stores globally; and in the U.S., we continued to expand our Online Grocery service to include nearly 670 locations. We also added a limited number of new stores and made 2 relatively small acquisitions in the e-commerce space, Moosejaw and ModCloth, to expand our online selection and improve our category expertise in important areas like apparel and outdoor gear. 
In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. 
Before I get into our operating segments, I'll talk about Walmart U.S. e-commerce. As a reminder, the results include all web-initiated transactions, including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship To Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and other sites in our family of brands. 
Year-over-year growth in GMV was approximately 69%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com. This was extraordinary growth, and we're pleased with the traction we're generating across our e-commerce offerings. 
We've recently introduced free 2-day shipping with a basket size of $35 or more on select items and launched a new service called Pickup Discount, where customers can order nonstore products online and receive a discount for picking these items up in our stores. This is a service that's convenient for customers and saves them money. 
Let's now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. 
You will recall in our fourth quarter comments that the first quarter started out slower than anticipated from a sales standpoint, due in part to the delayed issuance of federal income tax refund checks. As anticipated, our sales strengthened as the quarter progressed, delivering comp sales growth of 1.4%, led by an increase in customer traffic of 1.5%. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. On a 2-year stack basis, comp traffic is up 3%. Average ticket declined slightly primarily due to lower sales of higher-ticket items at the bringing of the quarter, as well as continued price investment. Additionally, the grocery business continued to improve with food categories delivering the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in more than 3 years, due in part to a lack of market deflation in food, excluding price investments. 
All store formats had positive comp sales, and e-commerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment. We were really pleased with our results for the Easter holiday period as both food and general merchandise performed well. 
Gross margin rate was flat in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise and the acceleration of post-holiday markdowns taken in the fourth quarter benefited the margin rate, but this was offset by investments in price and the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 14 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn't leverage expenses for the overall segment, I'm pleased that we leveraged in the stores. 
Operating income increased 0.9%, which is the first increase in more than 3 years. 
The team continues to do a fantastic job managing inventory. During the quarter, inventory at comp store fell 7.3% while in-stock levels remained high. 
We're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. For the 13-week period ending July 28, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%. 
Now let's move on to Walmart International. 
International business continues to execute against its strategic priorities and delivered a solid start to the year. As I mentioned earlier, International performance was negatively impacted by 1 less operating day this year due to Leap Day last year, as well as the later timing of Easter this year. 
Before we get into the results, let me discuss the financial impact, beginning in the first quarter, from strategic decisions we made previously to divest 2 businesses, Yihaodian in China and Suburbia in Mexico. 
In the second quarter of last year, as part of the announced alliance with JD.com, we divested our e-commerce business in China, Yihaodian, except for the first-party piece of that business. Beginning in the fourth quarter of last year, we began to wind down the first-party business, with only a small amount of sales remaining at the end of the first quarter of this year. This created a sales headwind versus last year of $385 million in the quarter, and we expect a similar impact in each of the next couple of quarters until we lap the unwinding of the business. 
Additionally, last month, Walmex announced it completed the sale of its apparel format, Suburbia. The gain from the sale of this business will be recorded in the second quarter of this year, and as a result, we expect a net benefit to EPS of approximately $0.05 in the quarter. Beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the remainder of this year, International's results will be negatively impacted by the operating profit lost due to sale of the business. We expect a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.01 for the third and fourth quarters. We also expect a full year impact to sales of approximately $600 million. 
We'll continue to detail the impacts of these transactions as we go through the year. 
Now let's move on to the overall International results. 
On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 0.8%. And excluding Yihaodian, net sales increased 2.2%. Reported net sales declined 3.5%, impacted by a $1.2 billion currency headwind. 
From a profitability standpoint, first quarter operating income increased 9% on a constant currency basis and declined 0.1% on a reported basis. 
During the quarter, a benefit to operating income of approximately $47 million from a land sale was recorded in one of our markets. Excluding this item, operating income would have increased 5% on a constant currency basis. 
Let's now turn to some brief highlights of key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 4 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. 
Let's begin with Walmex, where sales momentum continued across all countries and regions. 
Total sales increased 5.2% and comp sales growth was 3.7%. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased over 13% on a 2-year stack basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service. 
In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 1.5%. During the quarter, we reduced inventory levels even as sales increased. And according to Nielsen, we continued to gain market share in key traffic-driving categories like food and consumables and health and wellness. Continued planned investments in price and in-store efficiency initiatives are being supported by progress with our cost analytics program. 
In China, net sales increased 0.7% and comp sales decreased 1.3%. In addition to the impact of 1 less day in the quarter due to Leap Day last year, sales were impacted by our strategic decision to reduce low-margin bulk sales. During the quarter, we continued to expand our e-commerce offering by entering new cities through our crowd-sourced delivery partnership with New Dada and now offer 1-hour delivery from 80 stores. We also launched new product categories, such as produce and frozen items, on our Sam's Club flagship store on the JD.com platform. 
Turning to the U.K. Net sales increased 0.9.% while comp sales declined 2.8%. When normalizing for Leap Day last year and a later Easter this year, we continued to see sequential improvement in the underlying business, including customer traffic and ticket. We're confident we're on the right track. 
So overall, our International strategy continues to produce consistent results, and we are pleased with the solid start to the year. 
Let's turn to Sam's Club. 
At Sam's Club, comp sales, without fuel, increased 1.6% as traffic grew by 1.1%. We had good results across many of our categories and comps have been positive for 5 consecutive quarters. We're also pleased with our digital growth as Club Pickup increased nearly 30%. The team at Sam's is taking steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. The initiatives under way at Sam's are designed to grow membership and sales, and we know it all starts with member experience. We'll deliver for them through our efforts to lead in digital and provide unmatched value on great merchandise. 
For the 13-week period ending July 28,2017, we expect comp sales, without fuel, to increase between 1% and 1.5%. 
With that, let's discuss total company EPS guidance. 
We feel good about the momentum across the business and expect progress to continue. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we expect EPS, excluding the gain from the sale of Suburbia, to be between $1 and $1.08. 
In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the important work you do every day.

As you saw in our earnings materials this morning, we delivered a very solid quarter and it's great to see continued momentum in the business. Total revenue grew 3% in the quarter and increased 3.1% for the year, both in constant currency. Comp sales growth of 1.8% in the Walmart U.S. business this quarter was better than expected, and I'm particularly pleased with the traffic in our stores. U.S. GMV grew 36% in the quarter, so we're headed in the right direction with this important part of our business too.
Our international business again delivered solid sales growth in constant currency last quarter and Sam's Club delivered its best comp sales growth of the year. I'm excited about what's happening at our company. We're moving with speed to better serve our customers every day and progressing against our 4 key objectives, which are: make every day easier for busy families, change how we work by becoming a more digital enterprise, deliver results and operate with discipline, and be the most trusted retailer.
Brett's going to take you through the financials. But before he does, I'd like to highlight some of our accomplishments from this past year that are positioning us to win in the future.
Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. It all starts with our associates, and I'm pleased that in addition to increased wages, we've deployed more sophisticated tools to assist our associates to meet the needs of customers. New technology and apps are providing real-time information to improve our in-stock levels and better manage inventory, which is down 7% this quarter versus last year on a comp store basis. We've also invested in training academies for associates to further develop the skills they need to better serve customers and succeed in today's retail environment. We expect to train more than 225,000 department managers and hourly supervisors by this fall. In fact, I recently visited a store in Mooresville, North Carolina, where they had reduced inventory so significantly that the back room was empty enough for them to build a training academy there. These initiatives are paying off for our customers through cleaner stores, friendlier service and faster checkout times.
Greg Foran and the team continued to innovate to improve the customer experience. In the last month, we opened 2 new supercenters in Florida and Texas, with features like Scan & Go, touchscreens where customers can access more items on walmart.com, virtual item displays, and an integrated health and wellness section. We've got quite a few experiments going on in the company these days, and we're learning at a faster rate. We've also been investing in price and customers are responding. We're confident that continued execution of our strategy will drive sustainable growth in traffic and sales.
Shifting gears to our international segment. I'm pleased to see the business delivering consistently solid sales results. While Walmex led the way this year, our performance was broad-based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year and 7 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 4%.
At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was over 7% this year and 14% on a 2-year stack.
In China, we announced an alliance with and investment in JD.com last summer, improving our e-commerce proposition and extending the reach of Walmart and Sam's Club brands to millions of new customers. We subsequently announced an increased ownership of JD.com to approximately 10%, and we recently furthered this relationship with the launch of an exclusive Walmart Global import store on JD.com Worldwide, which provides Chinese customers access to thousands of products imported from Walmart stores from around the world. We also announced an investment in last-mile delivery company, New Dada, enabling 2-hour delivery service from nearly 70 Walmart locations. China is a key growth market for our company, and we are proud of how we positioned the business to win.
In the U.K., we faced some challenges this past year, and we're addressing these with urgency. We're encouraged comp store sales improved during the fourth quarter. I visited stores in the market a few weeks ago and the team has us pointed in the right direction.
We spent considerable time looking at our international portfolio last year, and we took some decisive action along the way. For example, our decisions to divest noncore businesses, such as an apparel chain in Mexico and shopping malls in Chile, were based not on the merits of their performance, rather their relevance to the portfolio. We must ensure that we focus on businesses that are core to what we do.
Overall, I'm pleased with the consistently solid sales results in international. We have a strong business with good momentum.
Moving to Sam's Club. I'd like to start by thanking Roz Brewer for her leadership. Sam's Club comps improved each quarter during the year last year and she's positioned the business for further progress.
With Roz's departure, we promoted John Furner to CEO of Sam's Club. John's been with the business since 1993, working in Walmart U.S., international and most recently as Sam's Chief Merchandising Officer. He brings a unique set of experiences and a deep understanding of our company. He's going to be a great leader for Sam's.
We're pleased with our progress in technology at Sam's including the national launch of Scan & Go. E-commerce continues to grow with direct to home and Club pick-up. While we have more work to do to deliver the results we expect to achieve, we believe we're on the right track to win with members and accelerate growth.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our progress in e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. We continue to invest in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We're gaining traction and moving faster. We're the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top 3 online retailers by traffic and our Walmart app is among the top 3 apps in retail. We acquired Jet.com in the second half of last year and welcomed Marc Lore, the CEO of our U.S. e-commerce business. Marc is moving quickly. From a marketplace perspective, we now have over 35 million SKUs, more than quadrupling the number available at the beginning of the year. We recently announced free 2-day shipping on millions of items with a minimum order of $35. And as you might expect, we've seen a nice uptick in our e-commerce business since this launch. The acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw, in addition to Hayneedle, gave us immediate expertise and capabilities in new, more upscale categories of merchandise. We're also leveraging the strengths of Walmart and Jet to make both platforms better. I'm excited about what's to come.
I'm really pleased by how Greg Foran and his team are working in tandem with Marc Lore and his team to deliver the convenient shopping our customers desire, no matter how they choose to shop. They will continue to partner closely to serve our customers seamlessly across our app, site and stores. Over the holidays, wait times were down for pickup, and we're adding more items to Pick Up Today. Customers love being able to order an item with an app and get it that day.
In conclusion, as I step back and look at the retail landscape, customer expectations continue to change rapidly. They will increasingly expect even more personalization and convenience in their shopping experience. We're moving quickly to respond to the current opportunities as well as to innovate and transform the shopping experience for our customers in the future. According to Bain, Black Friday weekend sales marked the first time the number of people shopping online surpassed people shopping in stores, and over half did so through mobile devices. And more than 70% of traffic to walmart.com during Black Friday and Cyber Monday was driven by mobile. While e-commerce is growing rapidly, customers continue to rely on brick-and-mortar formats. The supercenter remains the best retail format in the world and, going forward, we will continue to leverage these unique assets, even more with initiatives like online grocery, in-store pickup and others. Rapid advances in technology mean we need to become more of a digital enterprise and that's what we're doing.
So in summary: We have a clear strategy we're executing against; we're uniquely positioned to deliver value unlike any other retailer through both physical and digital assets; we have momentum across the business, which positions us well for the new fiscal year; and while we must do more, we believe we're on the right track as we work to be the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders.
Now I'll give you to Brett."
313055,326063600,1216606,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Q4 2017 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2017",2017-02-21,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, this has been an exciting year of transformation at Walmart.

As Doug mentioned, this has been an exciting year of transformation at Walmart. We've made strategic decisions revolving around the customer that will reposition the business for sustainable growth to win long term. We're moving with speed to provide customers with a better offer through stores, mobile and e-commerce. And we're confident this will drive value for shareholders. And while going through this transformation, our financial strength serves as a great competitive advantage.
For fiscal year 2017, there were a number of accomplishments. I'll highlight just a few. Constant currency net sales were up nearly 3%, a growth of $13.7 billion. Operating cash flow reached $31.5 billion, an all-time record for Walmart. E-commerce GMV growth accelerated throughout the year. Adjusted EPS of $4.32 exceeded our initial full year guidance. GAAP EPS was $4.38. It has been a very successful year in a number of ways.
Now let's discuss the results in more detail starting with the fourth quarter. Total revenue excluding an unfavorable $2.6 billion currency impact increased 3% to $133.6 billion. On a constant currency basis, we added $3.7 billion in net sales. It's important to note that currency impacts on net sales during the quarter were about $600 million higher than anticipated versus when we began the quarter, driven primarily by the depreciation of the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar. Walmart U.S. delivered strong top line performance with comp sales of 1.8% exceeding guidance. International continued its steady constant currency top line performance with another solid quarter, and Sam's Club comp sales of 2.4% were better than expected with continued strength in e-commerce and omnichannel initiatives. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.30, which was near the upper end of our guidance range.
Walmart's consolidated gross profit margin increased 5 basis points in the quarter with expansion in both international and Sam's Club. Walmart U.S. gross margin declined in the quarter. I'll get into more detail on this in a moment. Total operating expenses increased 58 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology. In both this year and last year's fourth quarter, we adjusted for discrete items. These included $939 million in charges for store closures across all segments last year as well as $370 million for discontinued real estate projects and severance in the U.S. this year. For comparison purposes, excluding these discrete items for both years, operating expenses increased 97 basis points in the quarter. Now that we'll be lapping the U.S. wage increases from fiscal year 2017, we would expect to slightly lever expenses in fiscal year 2018.
I'll provide more details about operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce where we're changing rapidly and remaining laser-focused on our customers. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 15.5% and 17.5%, respectively. Excluding Yihaodian, GMV increased 29.7%.
Going forward, we plan to discuss e-commerce results a little differently from the past in order to give you a clearer view of our performance particularly in the important U.S. market. Given the organizational framework changes over the past few months, we will no longer be discussing global e-commerce as we have in the past. Sam's Club e-commerce and the various international e-commerce initiatives will be discussed as appropriate within those segment discussions.
As we discuss Walmart U.S. e-commerce, which is led by Marc Lore and represents the largest portion of our e-commerce effort, note that it includes all web-initiated transactions including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship to Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.
We saw strong growth this quarter in the Walmart U.S. e-commerce business with GMV and sales growth of 36% and 29%, respectively. Our integrated offering means customers are shopping with us through multiple channels. In fact, over the holidays, Pick Up Today, which is available in Walmart U.S. stores, grew by 27% over last year.
We're seeing the benefits of our e-commerce investments. During the holiday period, the e-commerce fulfillment network performed very well, supporting record volumes with on-time delivery rates that far exceeded last year. This network is also the backbone of the new free 2-day shipping promise with a $35 minimum order available at walmart.com. Customers are responding well to this new offer and e-commerce sales have strengthened since its launch on January 31. Looking ahead, you'll continue to see us make investments in e-commerce to drive traffic and improve the customer value proposition. We're excited about the things we're doing, the speed at which we're doing them and the work we still have to do.
In the fourth quarter, we continued to make excellent progress on working capital, with $11.9 billion in operating cash flow and $8.7 billion in free cash flow. Working capital has been a focus for us all year, and I'm really pleased with our discipline, particularly in managing inventory and payables. For the year, we generated $31.5 billion in operating cash flow and $20.9 billion of free cash flow. This was an increase in free cash flow of nearly $5 billion or more than 30% versus last year. This is a great testament to Walmart's financial strength. When you consider that we were able to reduce our net debt levels this year while also making strategic decisions to grow the business both organically and through M&A, including investments in stores, logistics, people and technology, it's a fantastic achievement.
We accomplished this while also returning a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. In fact, over the past year, we returned $14.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. As of the end of the fiscal year, we had used approximately $10.8 billion of the current $20 billion share repurchase authorization. Additionally, today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend from $2 per share to $2.04 per share in fiscal 2018. We've now increased our dividend for 44 consecutive years. We're proud of our track record of returning significant cash to shareholders while investing in future growth.
Let's now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. We're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. with steady improvement in stores, strong growth from e-commerce and growing contributions from the rollout of Online Grocery. We've now seen 9 consecutive quarters of traffic growth in our stores. Clearly, we're gaining traction and it's exciting to see how customers are responding to our focus on saving them time and money.
For the quarter, strong comp sales growth of 1.8% was driven by a 1.4% increase in customer traffic. All store formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment. We were particularly pleased with the positive comp in grocery, despite ongoing market deflation in food which negatively impacted the food comp by approximately 90 basis points. Throughout the 6-week holiday season, customers responded well to consistent everyday low prices and a simplified integrated multichannel experience that enabled last-minute shopping so they could find the perfect item.
Gross margin decreased 8 basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise as well as lower logistics costs benefited the margin rate, but were more than offset by the continued execution of our price investment strategy and the timing of post-holiday markdowns. We're entering the new year in a very solid inventory position. For the year, Walmart U.S. gross margin increased 24 basis points. As a reminder, both fourth quarter and full year comparisons included a $56 million impact last year related to store closures.
Operating expenses increased 4.6% this quarter and 8.1% for the year, primarily due to the associate wage rate increases as well as investments in technology and e-commerce. As I mentioned previously, in both this year and last year, we adjusted for discrete items. This year's fourth quarter included a $249 million charge related to discontinued real estate projects. Last year's fourth quarter included $670 million in charges related to the impact of store closures. Excluding these adjustments, operating expenses would have increased 7.3% in the fourth quarter and 8.8% for the year.
Walmart U.S. operating income declined 2.5% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the discrete items discussed earlier, Walmart U.S. operating income declined 10.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.2% for the year.
The Walmart U.S. team continues to do a great job with inventory, while maintaining high in-stock levels. Inventory declined 3.1% with comp store inventory down 7.2%, despite strong sales growth.
To wrap up Walmart U.S., we made a lot of progress this year in providing customers value and convenience. While sales have been slower than expected to start the year, which we believe is due in part to the delay in tax refunds versus last year, we expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017 to increase between 1% and 1.5%.
Now let's move to Walmart International.
Walmart International continued its solid sales performance this quarter. While Walmex results where the strongest with comp sales growth of 7%, the solid international performance was fairly broad-based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 6 of those markets grew comps by more than 4%.
For the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.1%, impacted by a $2.6 billion currency headwind. For the year, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.9%, impacted by an $11 billion currency headwind.
From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income increased 3.8% on a constant currency basis. I'd like to point out that there were a few items in the quarter that collectively had a negative impact to operating profit of approximately $100 million, primarily because of adjustments to useful lives of certain assets and impairments in certain markets, which were partially offset by the gain from the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile, as mentioned last quarter.
Operating income for the year increased 19.7% on a constant currency basis and increased 7.7% on a reported basis. As a reminder, these results include the gain associated with the sale of Yihaodian and the items mentioned above.
Let's now turn to some brief highlights of the key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 5 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.
Let's begin with Walmex. Strong sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions and countries, with total sales growing nearly 9% in the quarter. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased approximately 8% and outpaced all divisions of ANTAD, including self-service, specialty and department stores.
In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 0.2%. According to Nielsen, we continue to gain market share in traffic-driving categories, like food and consumables and health and wellness.
Turning to the U.K. Net sales declined 0.6% and comp sales declined 2.9% in the quarter. We have a lot of work to do in this market, but we're encouraged by some of the early signs of traction with improvements in the customer value proposition.
In China, net sales grew 5.4% and comp sales increased 2.3%. Sales were solid across hypermarkets and Sam's Club. We're excited about the future of e-commerce in China. The strategic alliance of JD.com will continue to expand our presence throughout the country and offer customers new and exciting products through our flagship sites of JD's platform.
So overall we're pleased with the consistent performance from our international portfolio and excited about the new fiscal year.
Now let's turn to Sam's Club. At Sam's Club, we're pleased with the efforts underway to transform the business. We're making progress in a number of areas, and we know we have to move faster to provide the value that members expect.
During the quarter, top line performance was driven by an increase in comp sales excluding fuel of 2.4%. SamsClub.com GMV was strong increasing by 25% and Club Pickup also performed well. Operating income excluding fuel declined 5.1% for the quarter. Investments in associate wages pressured expenses, along with charges related to the impairment of clubs. In addition, this year's fourth quarter included a $10 million discrete charge for discontinued real estate projects, while last year's fourth quarter included a $57 million discrete charge related to the impact of club closures. Excluding these discrete items, operating income would have declined 14.6% this quarter.
For the year, net sales excluding fuel increased 1.8% to $53.3 billion. Operating income excluding fuel declined 7.3%. Looking ahead for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%.
With that, let's discuss guidance for the total company. At our October investor meeting, we guided the fiscal 2018 full year EPS based on currency rates at that time would be relatively flat to adjusted full year fiscal 2017 EPS, and we still expect that to generally be the case. However, since then, the U.S. dollar has strengthened, in particular versus the Mexican peso, which negatively impacts our Walmex projections on a U.S. dollar basis. We also expect our tax rate next year to be higher than the rate for fiscal year 2017, which was positively impacted by transactions such as Yihaodian during the year. We expect fiscal 2018's tax rate to be around 32%, assuming no major changes to the tax environment in our major markets. As always, there can be variability from quarter to quarter. Certainly, we are aware of and engaged in the discussions around tax reform in the U S. As more information comes to light, we will continue to provide updates if any of our assumptions were to materially change.
When taking all this into consideration, we expect fiscal 2018 EPS to be in a range of $4.20 to $4.40 compared to fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS of $4.32. This assumes an expected currency impact of about $0.05 per share. As stated in October, we expect operating income to decline slightly in fiscal 2018, driven in part by continued strategic price investments, partially offset by a more disciplined approach to expenses. We would anticipate that EPS in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.90 to $1, which includes an expected currency impact of about $0.02 per share.
Net sales on a constant currency basis are anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%. We expect the underlying stores business in most parts of the world to continue to deliver solid top line results along with increased growth in our e-commerce business. We're focused on driving strong efficient growth by opening fewer new stores overall, particularly in the U.S., while prioritizing comp sales and accelerating e-commerce growth including the third-party marketplace. Based on current exchange rates, we would anticipate a currency impact on net sales of approximately $3 billion for the year. On a reported basis, we expect net sales growth of between 2% and 3%.
There are a number of additional assumptions in this guidance today including that economic conditions in the tax and regulatory landscape in our largest markets remain generally consistent. Also, as indicated at our October investor meeting, we expect capital expenditures excluding acquisitions to be approximately $11 billion for fiscal year 2018.
So in closing, I want to thank all of our great associates around the world for the progress we've made as a company this past year. As a team, we'll win with customers by serving them in new and exciting ways and deliver for our shareholders in this new fiscal year."

Our second quarter results were solid with continued top line momentum in the business. Walmart U.S. grew comp sales 1.8% and comp traffic 1.3%. We continue to gain traction in e-commerce with Walmart U.S. GMV up 67%. The U.S. store team has done great job staying focused on providing a fast and easy customer experience while managing expenses and inventory. Customers are responding to the improvements we're making to deliver a seamless shopping experience that saves them time and money, and that's exciting to see.
In addition, Sam's Club delivered comp traffic growth of more than 2%. In International, 9 of 11 markets posted comp sales and 5 of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. So overall, we're making progress across the business and feel good about where we are midway through the year.
Our strategy is to make everyday easier for busy families. To accomplish this, we continue our transformation to become more of a digital enterprise that moves with speed and agility. I'm encouraged by innovation in the business. We're testing associate delivery of Walmart.com orders in a few stores and by the end of the year, we'll have approximately 100 automated pickup towers in stores across the U.S., where customers can pick up their orders within a matter of minutes.
With easy reorder on Walmart.com, a customer has a visibility to their past in-store and online purchases. In a matter of seconds, they can easily repurchase the items they bought most frequently before and save the time it may have taken to make a weekly shopping list. 
Another example is our integrated back-to-school offering. Our dedicated back-to-school destination at Walmart.com enable customers to shop school supply lists for more than 1 million classrooms across the United States. They can find their own list by simply entering their ZIP Code and quickly adding all the items from the school list to their basket. Then they can choose whether to pick up the items at their local store or ship them to their home. It's a huge timesaver for busy families.
If you haven't done your back-to-school shopping, you should definitely check this out.
We have tests going on with digital and shopping, robotics and image analytics to scan house [indiscernible] and we're using machine learning to assist our merchants with pricing. That Sam's Club members continue to provide great feedback on the convenience of Scan & Go, and we'll be further expanding Scan & Go within Walmart U.S. this year. 
This quarter, we also enjoyed welcoming entrepreneurs for more than 500 small businesses to Bentonville, pitch their made in USA products to sell in our stores and online as part of our investing in American jobs open call in June.
And last month, we released proposals for policy actions to address various manufacturing growth here in the U.S.
We're pleased to be making progress towards our goal of purchasing an additional $250 billion in products made, sourced or grown in the U.S. Customers want to buy products that are not only good for their families, but also for the people that made them. 
In e-commerce, customers are responding favorably to our expanded assortment, which surpassed 67 million SKUs on Walmart.com. Our recent acquisitions, such to, Shoe Buy and Bonobos, further improved our assortment and have provided critical category expertise and higher margin categories like shoes and apparel.
A couple of weeks ago, I was in Boston to meet with the team, which is now known as shoes.com. They were very engaged and really impressive. In addition, I was excited to visit with the team in Detroit in July. This talented group is thriving in their creative culture and it was great to hear what they're working on.
We believe that we are uniquely positioned to grow and delight customers by providing a seamless shopping experience they desire. Having stores within 10 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population allows us to serve customers in ways that are most convenient for them. We've seen strong results from the rollout of Online Grocery, which is now in more than 900 U.S. locations, and we're expanding this service in many of our markets around the world.
Retailers constantly evolving and it's critical that we move even faster as the customer and competitive landscape continue to change. Brett will provide more details on the financials shortly, but before he does, I'll talk briefly about each area of the business. Let me start with Walmart U.S. 
We had a strong quarter with stomp sales growth of 1.8% and comp traffic growth of 1.3%. It's exciting that sales growth is coming from across the business, including stores, e-commerce and a combination of both. 
Under Greg Ford's leadership, the stores continue to perform well. The grocery business has really strengthened as food categories deliver the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in 5 years. We're also pleased with the expense discipline as physical stores leverage expenses in the second consecutive quarter. We've done this while maintaining high in-stock and service levels. 
Stores associates are using better technology and processes to perform their tasks, and we're becoming more efficient. Our training programs are fueling this progress as well. This training is not only equipping associates for their current roles, but preparing them for promotion into roles with greater responsibility and pay. We've now opened 175 training academies and expect to have 200 operating by the end of the year.
In Walmart U.S. e-commerce, Marc Lore and the team delivered another quarter of robust top line growth with GMV up 67%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through Walmart.com as customers are finding a broader assortment and more options to receive what they want at their convenience. 
They love not having to pay a membership fee to get Walmart's free 2-day shipping on millions of items. And we're seeing an nice increase in customers receiving discounts for picking up nonstore items at their local stores. Mark, Greg and their teams continue to make good progress in driving innovative solutions across the business and providing the seamless shopping experience customers desire.
Staying in the U.S., let's talk about Sam's Club. John Furner and team have improved execution, resulting in stronger comp traffic. Sam's Club had comp sales growth without fuel of 1.2% in the quarter led by 2.1% comp traffic growth and e-commerce GMV increased to 23%. Overall, we're starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win. Club Pickup continues to grow, and I'm excited about how we're leveraging clubs to serve members across multiple channels. We're also strengthening the assortment with exciting merchandise, including progress in fresh and with our private brand, Member's Mark, which is more than a $10 billion brand and growing.
Outside the U.S., the Walmart International team, led by Dave Cheesewright, continued to deliver strong underlying results with 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales and the segment leveraging expenses overall.
Walmex continues to be a strongest international market with comp sales growth of more than 7% in the quarter. What's even more impressive is that this sales momentum is broad-based across all countries and regions.
In China, our stores are improving, and we launched Walmart and Sam's Club global flagship stores through our alliance with JD.com this quarter. In addition, more than 25% of Walmart stores in China now offer delivery of orders in less than 1 hour through the JD delivery platform.
Moving to Canada, the business continues to perform well. The investments that we've made in price are resonating with customers and contributing to market share gains in key traffic driving categories. We're also encourage that the U.K. delivered positive comp sales. In June, I visited to see the progress being made. Customers are responding to investments in price and store experience by visiting the stores more often and increasing their basket sizes. 
There's still much more to be done, but we're clearly headed in the right direction. While there, I visited stores as well as our grocery delivery fulfillment center. I was impressed by how the team is focused on not only improving grocery pickup and delivery from stores but also from fulfillment centers and higher volume environments.
So overall, the International segment has made steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and e-commerce.
In conclusion, we're encouraged with the solid first half results. We're uniquely positioned to deliver the seamless, fast, innovative and exciting shopping experience our customers desire. I'm pleased with how we're equipping our associates to deliver it. I'd like to thank our associates for their focus on serving customers and all the ways they choose to shop. It's making a difference.
We have a clear strategy that we're executing against a good momentum across the business. Thanks for your continued interest in Walmart.
Now I'll hand it over to Brett."

We're guided",1915,"Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. We had a solid first half of the year. We're improving our competitive position with a differentiated offering by giving customers a better experience in our stores and more of what they want online. We're guided by our financial framework to deliver strong, efficient growth, operate with discipline and allocate capital strategically. We're making progress on each element and its through this lens that I'll discuss our results.
Second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.08 is at the top end of our guidance. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 1.8%, led by traffic growth of 1.3%. U.S. e-commerce GMV grew 67% and International delivered strong results.
Two items significantly impacted EPS for the quarter. There was a $0.17 negative impact related to the premiums paid for bond tenders, which allowed us to retire higher-rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. 
We also recorded a gain from the sale of our Suburbia business in Mexico, which benefited EPS by $0.05. It's also important to remember that during the second quarter of last year, the company's EPS was positively impacted by $0.14 related to the gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business in China.
Adjusted for these items, EPS increased approximately 1% year-over-year. Gross profit margin decreased 11 basis points during the quarter. Strategic price investments in key markets and the growing mix of our e-commerce business reduced the gross margin rate. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes more details on gross margins for each segment.
We continue to make some progress with expenses as we leverage expenses in our U.S. stores as well as in the International segment. As a company, SG&A delevered by 10 basis points in the period primarily due to increase technology spending and some impairment charges related to Sam's Club. We expect a slightly leverage expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. Operating with discipline is important to where we're going in the future. We have a lot of work to do but I'm encouraged by the focus I'm seeing.
Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the first 6 months were solid at $11.4 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. Compared with last year, the decreases in operating cash flow and free cash flow were due to an increase in incentive payments and the timing of other payments. 
We're still seeing improvement in working capital but not as strong as the tremendous improvement last year, which also impacts the year-on-year comparability.
In terms of capital allocation, we completed remodels of 283 stores globally. And in the U.S., was further expanded our Online Grocery service to include more than 900 locations. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2017, consolidated return on investment decreased 50 basis points due primarily to reduced operating income.
Let's now move on to e-commerce. As a reminder, e-commerce results include all web-initiated transactions, including those through Walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, ship to store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family brands.
Walmart U.S. e-commerce again performed very well on the top line as GMV grew 67% and sales increased 60%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, which is grown quickly. 
We're delivering growth through an improved customer value proposition that includes free 2-day shipping on millions of items and easy reorder as well as an expanded assortment, now with more than 67 million SKUs, an increase of more than 30% from the first quarter.
With easy reorder, we're integrating both in-store and online purchases to provide customers with a single spot to view and repurchase the items they buy most frequently. Initiatives like these, along with everyday low prices, are the reasons why customers are choosing Walmart in greater numbers. As a reminder, we'll begin to lap the Jet.com acquisition in the third quarter.
Now let's move on to operating segment details. Walmart U.S. delivered another quarter of solid comp sales increasing 1.8%, led by growth in customer traffic of 1.3%. On a 2-year stack basis, comp sales were up 3.4% and comp traffic increased 2.5%. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and 11th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. 
The grocery business continue to improve as food categories delivering the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in 5 years, led by strong customer traffic and a return of slight market inflation of food, excluding our own price investments.
All formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 70 basis points to the segment. Keep in mind, the e-commerce sales contribution includes not only purchases that are shipped to customer's home, but also omnichannel transactions fulfilled in stores, such as online grocery and pick up today.
Gross margin rate declined 5 basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise benefited the margin rate what was more than offset by the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business as well as continued investments in price.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 13 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn't leverage expenses for the overall segment, we did leverage in the stores for the second straight quarter. Service levels remain high and our associates are doing a great job of being more efficient through improved training and by utilizing upgraded technology.
Operating income increased 2.2% in the quarter, which is the second straight quarterly increase.
Managing inventory has been a key focus for the U.S. business, and the team continues to do a fantastic job in this area. During the quarter, inventory at comp stores fell 3.8% while in-stock levels remain high.
We're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. With the third quarter underway, the back-to-school season is in full swing and we're providing more options for customers to save time and money in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%.
Now let's move on to Walmart International. Walmart International continue to execute against the strategic priorities and delivered strong underlying results. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 2.5% and decreased 1% on a reported basis. 
Keep in mind, the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of nearly $520 million in the period when compared to last year.
The good performance in the quarter was fairly broad-based, and results at Walmex were particularly strong with comp sales growing more than 7%. 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales, including in the U.K. and 5 of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. As a reminder, the timing of Easter benefited our results for the second quarter.
Operating income declined by 2% on a constant currency basis and 7.8% on a reported basis. As I mentioned earlier, there were a few items for International affecting year-over-year performance related to divestitures. The net impact from these divestitures benefited operating income by $415 million this year and $513 million last year in constant currency. Excluding these items, operating income grew 5.2% on a constant currency basis. 
We delivered these results even as we continue to make strategic investments to enhance the shopping experience both in-store and online in several of our major markets. 
The attention to operating discipline allowed us to leverage expenses in the period even as we made important investments.
Let's now turn to some highlights from key markets. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes detailed information on our 4 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.
Let's begin with Walmex, where momentum in sales continued across all countries and regions. Total sales increased 9.2%, excluding suburbia, and comp sales grew 7.2%. 
In Mexico, comp sales increased more than 15% on 2-year stack basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced self-service.
In Canada, net sales increased 3.4% and comp sales increased 2.5%. We further improved price position against competitors, which contributed to market share gains and key traffic driving categories such as food and consumables. Inventory was also a focus, as the team reduced overall levels even as sales increase.
Turning to the U.K., net sales increased 3.9% and comp sales increased 1.8%. Customers responded to investments and the value proposition and the continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket. 
In China, net sales increased 2.5% and comp sales increased 0.6%. Previously, we highlighted our decision to reduce the mix of bulk sales of certain items in our stores and while we saw negative impact to top line results, we believe it was the right decision. Results for the quarter were primarily driven by momentum in fresh and consumables categories. Additionally, we had good performances with local festivals and holidays.
From an e-commerce perspective, we continue to expand our offering through the alliance with JD.com. We now have 134 Walmart stores across 18 cities that have joined the JD Daojia platform, which offers delivery of orders in less than 1 hour.
Moving on to Sam's Club. Comp sales without fuel increased 1.2% in the period, led by traffic growth of 2.1%. We're serving members across multiple channels and our e-commerce initiatives produce strong results with 80 basis points of contribution to comp sales and year-over-year growth of 29% for Club Pickup. 
Operating income decreased in the period primarily due to charge of about $50 million as a result of impairments of certain assets and the decision to close 4 underperforming clubs. The team is moving quickly to execute on their priorities of people, products and digital, and we're starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win. 
We believe good growth opportunities exist in the club channel, and we know we have to do more to capture a greater share in this space. We're laser focused on our members and how we can serve them in new and exciting ways.
For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales without fuel to increase between 1% and 1.5%.
With that, let's talk about guidance. We're pleased with our first half performance. Given our results today, combined with our expectations for the balance of the year, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be $4.30 to $4.40, which includes a range of $0.90 to $0.98 for the third quarter. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 for the full year. 
The initial guidance for full year EPS assume a negative currency impact of about $0.05 per share, but we now expect the EPS impact from currency will be less given current exchange rates. We continue to assume a full year effective tax rate of around 32%. 
As with all guidance, this assumes the economic conditions in key markets remains relatively consistent.
Overall, we're doing what we said we would do, executing our plan and delivering good results. I continue to be excited about where we're heading as a company and how we're improving our customer's lives. As I close today, let me say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the work you do everyday. You serve an incredible number of customers each day, and you do it well."

The U.S. store team has done a great job staying focused on providing a fast and easy customer experience while managing expenses and inventory. Customers are responding to the improvements we're making to deliver a seamless shopping experience that saves them time and money, and that's exciting to see.
In addition, Sam's Club delivered comp traffic growth of more than 2%. In International, 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales and 5 of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. So overall, we're making progress across the business and feel good about where we are midway through the year.
Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families. To accomplish this, we continue our transformation to become more of a digital enterprise that moves with speed and agility. I'm encouraged by innovation in the business. We're testing associate delivery of walmart.com orders in a few stores and by the end of the year, we'll have approximately 100 automated pickup towers in stores across the U.S., where customers can pick up their orders within a matter of minutes.
With easy reorder on walmart.com, a customer has a visibility to their past in-store and online purchases. In a matter of seconds, they can easily repurchase the items they bought most frequently before and save the time it may have taken to make a weekly shopping list. 
Another example is our integrated back-to-school offering. Our dedicated back-to-school destination on walmart.com enables customers to shop school supply lists for more than 1 million classrooms across the United States. They can find their own list by simply entering their zip code and quickly adding all the items from the school list to their basket. Then they can choose whether to pick up the items at their local store or ship them to their home. It's a huge timesaver for busy families.
If you haven't done your back-to-school shopping, you should definitely check this out.
We have tests going on with digital endless aisle shopping, robotics and image analytics to scan aisles for outs and we're using machine learning to assist our merchants with pricing. Sam's Club members continue to provide great feedback on the convenience of Scan & Go, and we'll be further expanding Scan & Go within Walmart U.S. this year. 
This quarter, we also enjoyed welcoming entrepreneurs from more than 500 small businesses to Bentonville, to pitch their Made in USA products to sell in our stores and online as part of our Investing in American Jobs Open Call in June.
And last month, we released proposals for policy actions to address barriers to manufacturing growth here in the U.S.
We're pleased to be making progress towards our goal of purchasing an additional $250 billion in products made, sourced or grown in the U.S. Customers want to buy products that are not only good for their families, but also for the people that made them. 
In e-commerce, customers are responding favorably to our expanded assortment, which surpassed 67 million SKUs on walmart.com. Our recent acquisitions, such as Moosejaw, Shoebuy and Bonobos, further improved our assortment and have provided critical category expertise and higher margin categories like shoes and apparel.
A couple of weeks ago, I was in Boston to meet with the Shoebuy team, which is now known as shoes.com. They were very engaged and really impressive. In addition, I was excited to visit with the Moosejaw team in Detroit in July. This talented group is thriving in their creative culture and it was great to hear what they are working on.
We believe that we are uniquely positioned to grow and delight customers by providing a seamless shopping experience they desire. Having stores within 10 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population allows us to serve customers in ways that are most convenient for them. We've seen strong results from the rollout of Online Grocery, which is now in more than 900 U.S. locations, and we're expanding this service in many of our markets around the world.
Retailers constantly evolving and it's critical that we move even faster as the customer and competitive landscape continue to change. Brett will provide more details on the financials shortly, but before he does, I'll talk briefly about each area of the business. Let me start with Walmart U.S. 
We had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 1.8% and comp traffic growth of 1.3%. It's exciting that sales growth is coming from across the business, including stores, e-commerce and a combination of both. 
Under Greg Foran's leadership, the stores continue to perform well. The grocery business has really strengthened as food categories deliver the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in 5 years. We're also pleased with the expense discipline as physical stores leveraged expenses for the second consecutive quarter. We've done this while maintaining high in-stock and service levels. 
Stores associates are using better technology and processes to perform their tasks, and we're becoming more efficient. Our training programs are fueling this progress as well. This training is not only equipping associates for their current roles, but preparing them for promotion into roles with greater responsibility and pay. We've now opened 175 training academies and expect to have 200 operating by the end of the year.
In Walmart U.S. e-commerce, Marc Lore and the team delivered another quarter of robust top line growth with GMV up 67%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com as customers are finding a broader assortment and more options to receive what they want at their convenience. 
They love not having to pay a membership fee to get Walmart's free 2-day shipping on millions of items. And we're seeing a nice increase in customers receiving discounts for picking up nonstore items at their local stores. Mark, Greg and their teams continue to make good progress in driving innovative solutions across the business and providing the seamless shopping experience customer's desire.
Staying in the U.S., let's talk about Sam's Club. John Furner and team have improved execution, resulting in stronger comp traffic. Sam's Club had comp sales growth without fuel of 1.2% in the quarter led by 2.1% comp traffic growth and e-commerce GMV increased to 23%. Overall, we're starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win. Club Pickup continues to grow, and I'm excited about how we're leveraging clubs to serve members across multiple channels. We're also strengthening the assortment with exciting merchandise, including progress in fresh and with our private brand, Member's Mark, which is more than a $10 billion brand and growing.
Outside the U.S., the Walmart International team, led by Dave Cheesewright, continued to deliver strong underlying results with 9 of 11 markets posting positive comp sales and the segment leveraging expenses overall.
Walmex continues to be the strongest international market with comp sales growth of more than 7% in the quarter. What's even more impressive is that this sales momentum is broad-based across all countries and regions.
In China, our stores are improving, and we launched Walmart and Sam's Club global flagship stores through our alliance with jd.com this quarter. In addition, more than 25% of Walmart stores in China now offer delivery of orders in less than 1 hour through the JD Daojia delivery platform.
Moving to Canada, the business continues to perform well. The investments that we've made in price are resonating with customers and contributing to market share gains in key traffic driving categories. We're also encouraged that the U.K. delivered positive comp sales. In June, I visited Asda to see the progress being made. Customers are responding to investments in price and store experience by visiting the stores more often and increasing their basket sizes. 
There's still much more to be done, but we're clearly headed in the right direction. While there, I visited stores as well as our Heston grocery-delivery fulfillment center. I was impressed by how the team is focused on not only improving grocery pickup and delivery from stores but also from fulfillment centers and higher volume environments.
So overall, the International segment has made steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and e-commerce.
In conclusion, we're encouraged with the solid first half results. We're uniquely positioned to deliver the seamless, fast, innovative and exciting shopping experience our customer's desire. I'm pleased with how we're equipping our associates to deliver it. I'd like to thank our associates for their focus on serving customers and all the ways they choose to shop. It's making a difference.
We have a clear strategy that we're executing against and good momentum across the business. Thanks for your continued interest in Walmart.
Now I'll hand it over to Brett."

We had a solid first half of the year. We're improving our competitive position with a differentiated offering by giving customers a better experience in our stores and more of what they want online. We're guided",1921,"Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. We had a solid first half of the year. We're improving our competitive position with a differentiated offering by giving customers a better experience in our stores and more of what they want online. We're guided by our financial framework to deliver strong efficient growth, operate with discipline and allocate capital strategically. We're making progress on each element and it's through this lens that I'll discuss our results.
Second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.08 is at the top end of our guidance. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 1.8%, led by traffic growth of 1.3%. U.S. e-commerce GMV grew 67% and International delivered strong results.
Two items significantly impacted EPS for the quarter. There was a $0.17 negative impact related to the premiums paid for bond tenders, which allowed us to retire higher-rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. 
We also recorded a gain from the sale of our Suburbia business in Mexico, which benefited EPS by $0.05. It's also important to remember that during the second quarter of last year, the company's EPS was positively impacted by $0.14 related to the gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business in China.
Adjusted for these items, EPS increased approximately 1% year-over-year. Gross profit margin decreased 11 basis points during the quarter. Strategic price investments in key markets and the growing mix of our e-commerce business reduced the gross margin rate. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes more details on gross margins for each segment.
We continue to make some progress with expenses as we leverage expenses in our U.S. stores as well as in the International segment. As a company, SG&A delevered by 10 basis points in the period primarily due to increase technology spending and some impairment charges related to Sam's Club. We expect a slightly leverage expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. Operating with discipline is important to where we're going in the future. We have a lot of work to do but I'm encouraged by the focus I'm seeing.
Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the first 6 months were solid at $11.4 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. Compared with last year, the decreases in operating cash flow and free cash flow were due to an increase in incentive payments and the timing of other payments. 
We're still seeing improvement in working capital but not as strong as the tremendous improvement last year, which also impacts the year-on-year comparability.
In terms of capital allocation, we completed remodels of 283 stores globally. And in the U.S., was further expanded our Online Grocery service to include more than 900 locations. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2017, consolidated return on investment decreased 50 basis points due primarily to reduced operating income.
Let's now move on to e-commerce. As a reminder, e-commerce results include all web-initiated transactions, including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship to Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery as well as transactions through jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.
Walmart U.S. e-commerce again performed very well on the top line as GMV grew 67% and sales increased 60%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, which is growing quickly. 
We're delivering growth through an improved customer value proposition that includes free 2-day shipping on millions of items and easy reorder as well as an expanded assortment, now with more than 67 million SKUs, an increase of more than 30% from the first quarter.
With easy reorder, we're integrating both in-store and online purchases to provide customers with a single spot to view and repurchase the items they buy most frequently. Initiatives like these, along with everyday low prices, are the reasons why customers are choosing Walmart in greater numbers. As a reminder, we'll begin to lap the jet.com acquisition in the third quarter.
Now let's move on to operating segment details. Walmart U.S. delivered another quarter of solid comp sales increasing 1.8%, led by growth in customer traffic of 1.3%. On a 2-year stack basis, comp sales were up 3.4% and comp traffic increased 2.5%. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and 11th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. 
The grocery business continue to improve as food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in 5 years, led by strong customer traffic and a return of slight market inflation in food, excluding our own price investments.
All formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 70 basis points to the segment. Keep in mind, the e-commerce sales contribution includes not only purchases that are shipped to a customer's home, but also omnichannel transactions fulfilled in stores, such as Online Grocery and Pick Up Today.
Gross margin rate declined 5 basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise benefited the margin rate but was more than offset by the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business as well as continued investments in price.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 13 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn't leverage expenses for the overall segment, we did leverage in the stores for the second straight quarter. Service levels remain high and our associates are doing a great job of being more efficient through improved training and by utilizing upgraded technology.
Operating income increased 2.2% in the quarter, which is the second straight quarterly increase.
Managing inventory has been a key focus for the U.S. business, and the team continues to do a fantastic job in this area. During the quarter, inventory at comp stores fell 3.8%, while in-stock levels remained high.
We're pleased with the continued momentum at Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. With the third quarter underway, the back-to-school season is in full swing and we're providing more options for customers to save time and money in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%.
Now let's move on to Walmart International. Walmart International continue to execute against the strategic priorities and delivered strong underlying results. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 2.5% and decreased 1% on a reported basis. 
Keep in mind, the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of nearly $520 million in the period when compared to last year.
The good performance in the quarter was fairly broad-based, and results at Walmex were particularly strong with comp sales growing more than 7%. 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales, including in the U.K. and 5 of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. As a reminder, the timing of Easter benefited our results for the second quarter.
Operating income declined by 2% on a constant currency basis and 7.8% on a reported basis. As I mentioned earlier, there were few items for International affecting year-over-year performance related to divestitures. The net impact from these divestitures benefited operating income by $415 million this year and $513 million last year in constant currency. Excluding these items, operating income grew 5.2% on a constant currency basis. 
We delivered these results even as we continue to make strategic investments to enhance the shopping experience both in-store and online in several of our major markets. 
The attention to operating discipline allowed us to leverage expenses in the period even as we made important investments.
Let's now turn to some highlights from key markets. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes detailed information on our 4 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.
Let's begin with Walmex, where momentum in sales continued across all countries and regions. Total sales increased 9.2%, excluding Suburbia, and comp sales grew 7.2%. 
In Mexico, comp sales increased more than 15% on a 2-year stack basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service.
In Canada, net sales increased 3.4% and comp sales increased 2.5%. We further improved our price position against competitors, which contributed to market share gains and key traffic driving categories such as food and consumables. Inventory was also a focus, as the team reduced overall levels even as sales increased.
Turning to the U.K., net sales increased 3.9% and comp sales increased 1.8%. Customers responded to investments and the value proposition and we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket. 
In China, net sales increased 2.5% and comp sales increased 0.6%. Previously, we highlighted our decision to reduce the mix of bulk sales of certain items in our stores and while we saw negative impact to top line results, we believe it was the right decision. Results for the quarter were primarily driven by momentum in fresh and consumables categories. Additionally, we had good performances with local festivals and holidays.
From an e-commerce perspective, we continue to expand our offering through the alliance with jd.com. We now have 134 Walmart stores across 18 cities that have joined the JD Daojia platform, which offers delivery of orders in less than 1 hour.
Moving on to Sam's Club. Comp sales without fuel increased 1.2% in the period, led by traffic growth of 2.1%. We're serving members across multiple channels and our e-commerce initiatives produce strong results with 80 basis points of contribution to comp sales and year-over-year growth of 29% for Club Pickup. 
Operating income decreased in the period primarily due to charge of about $50 million as a result of impairments of certain assets and the decision to close 4 underperforming clubs. The team is moving quickly to execute on their priorities of people, products and digital, and we're starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win. 
We believe good growth opportunities exist in the club channel, and we know we have to do more to capture a greater share in this space. We are laser focused on our members and how we can serve them in new and exciting ways.
For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales without fuel to increase between 1% and 1.5%.
With that, let's talk about guidance. We're pleased with our first half performance. Given our results today, combined with our expectations for the balance of the year, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be $4.30 to $4.40, which includes a range of $0.90 to $0.98 for the third quarter. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 for the full year. 
The initial guidance for full year EPS assumed a negative currency impact of about $0.05 per share, but we now expect the EPS impact from currency will be less given current exchange rates. We continue to assume a full year effective tax rate of around 32%. 
As with all guidance, this assumes the economic conditions in key markets remains relatively consistent.
Overall, we're doing what we said we would do, executing our plan and delivering good results. I continue to be excited about where we're heading as a company and how we're improving our customer's lives. As I close today, let me say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the work you do every day. You serve an incredible number of customers each day, and you do it well."

Retail is constantly evolving, and it's critical that we move even faster as the customer and competitive landscape continue to change. Brett will provide more details on the financials shortly, but before he does, I'll talk briefly about each area of the business. Let me start with Walmart U.S. 
We had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 1.8% and comp traffic growth of 1.3%. It's exciting that sales growth is coming from across the business, including stores, e-commerce and a combination of both. 
Under Greg Foran's leadership, the stores continue to perform well. The grocery business has really strengthened as food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in 5 years. We're also pleased with the expense discipline as physical stores leveraged expenses for the second consecutive quarter. We've done this while maintaining high in-stock and service levels. 
Store associates are using better technology and processes to perform their tasks, and we're becoming more efficient. Our training programs are fueling this progress as well. This training is not only equipping associates for their current roles, but preparing them for promotion into roles with greater responsibility and pay. We've now opened 175 training academies and expect to have 200 operating by the end of the year.
In Walmart U.S. e-commerce, Marc Lore and the team delivered another quarter of robust top line growth with GMV up 67%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com as customers are finding a broader assortment and more options to receive what they want at their convenience.

And we're seeing a nice increase in customers receiving discounts for picking up nonstore items at their local stores. Marc, Greg and their teams continue to make good progress in driving innovative solutions across the business and providing the seamless shopping experience customers desire.
Staying in the U.S., let's talk about Sam's Club. John Furner and team have improved execution, resulting in stronger comp traffic. Sam's Club had comp sales growth without fuel of 1.2% in the quarter led by 2.1% comp traffic growth and e-commerce GMV increased to 23%. Overall, we're starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win. Club Pickup continues to grow, and I'm excited about how we're leveraging clubs to serve members across multiple channels. We're also strengthening the assortment with exciting merchandise, including progress in fresh and with our private brand, Member's Mark, which is more than a $10 billion brand and growing.
Outside the U.S., the Walmart International team, led by Dave Cheesewright, continued to deliver strong underlying results with 9 of 11 markets posting positive comp sales and the segment leveraging expenses overall.
Walmex continues to be the strongest international market with comp sales growth of more than 7% in the quarter. What's even more impressive is that this sales momentum is broad-based across all countries and regions.
In China, our stores are improving, and we launched Walmart and Sam's Club global flagship stores through our alliance with JD.com this quarter. In addition, more than 25% of Walmart stores in China now offer delivery of orders in less than 1 hour through the JD Daojia delivery platform.
Moving to Canada, the business continues to perform well. The investments that we've made in price are resonating with customers and contributing to market share gains in key traffic-driving categories. We're also encouraged that the U.K. delivered positive comp sales. In June, I visited Asda to see the progress being made. Customers are responding to investments in price and store experience by visiting the stores more often and increasing their basket sizes. There's still much more to be done, but we're clearly headed in the right direction. 
While there, I visited stores as well as our Heston grocery-delivery fulfillment center. I was impressed by how the team is focused on not only improving grocery pickup and delivery from stores but also from fulfillment centers and higher-volume environments.
So overall, the International segment has made steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and e-commerce.
In conclusion, we're encouraged with the solid first half results. We're uniquely positioned to deliver the seamless, fast, innovative and exciting shopping experience our customers desire. I'm pleased with how we're equipping our associates to deliver it. I'd like to thank our associates for their focus on serving customers in all the ways they choose to shop. It's making a difference.
We have a clear strategy that we're executing against and good momentum across the business. Thanks for your continued interest in Walmart.
Now I'll hand it over to Brett."

We're gu",1913,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We had a solid first half of the year. We're improving our competitive position with a differentiated offering by giving customers a better experience in our stores and more of what they want online. We're guided by our financial framework to deliver strong efficient growth, operate with discipline and allocate capital strategically. We're making progress on each element, and it's through this lens that I'll discuss our results.
Second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.08 is at the top end of our guidance. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 1.8%, led by traffic growth of 1.3%. U.S. e-commerce GMV grew 67% and International delivered strong results.
Two items significantly impacted EPS for the quarter. There was a $0.17 negative impact related to the premiums paid for bond tenders, which allowed us to retire higher-rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. We also recorded a gain from the sale of our Suburbia business in Mexico, which benefited EPS by $0.05. It's also important to remember that during the second quarter of last year, the company's EPS was positively impacted by $0.14 related to the gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business in China.
Adjusted for these items, EPS increased approximately 1% year-over-year. Gross profit margin decreased 11 basis points during the quarter. Strategic price investments in key markets and the growing mix of our e-commerce business reduced the gross margin rate. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes more details on gross margins for each segment.
We continue to make some progress with expenses as we leverage expenses in our U.S. stores as well as in the International segment. As a company, SG&A delevered by 10 basis points in the period primarily due to increase technology spending and some impairment charges related to Sam's Club. We expect to slightly leverage expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. Operating with discipline is important to where we're going in the future. We have a lot of work to do, but I'm encouraged by the focus I'm seeing.
Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the first 6 months were solid at $11.4 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. Compared with last year, the decreases in operating cash flow and free cash flow were due to an increase in incentive payments and the timing of other payments. 
We're still seeing improvement in working capital but not as strong as the tremendous improvement last year, which also impacts the year-on-year comparability.
In terms of capital allocation, we completed remodels of 283 stores globally. And in the U.S., we further expanded our Online Grocery service to include more than 900 locations. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2017, consolidated return on investment decreased 50 basis points due primarily to reduced operating income.
Let's now move on to e-commerce. As a reminder, e-commerce results include all web-initiated transactions, including those through walmart.com, such as ship-to-home, ship-to-store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.
Walmart U.S. e-commerce again performed very well on the top line as GMV grew 67% and sales increased 60%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, which is growing quickly. 
We're delivering growth through an improved customer value proposition that includes free 2-day shipping on millions of items and Easy Reorder as well as an expanded assortment now with more than 67 million SKUs, an increase of more than 30% from the first quarter.
With Easy Reorder, we're integrating both in-store and online purchases to provide customers with a single spot to view and repurchase the items they buy most frequently. Initiatives like these, along with everyday low prices, are the reasons why customers are choosing Walmart in greater numbers. As a reminder, we'll begin to lap the Jet.com acquisition in the third quarter.
Now let's move on to operating segment details. Walmart U.S. delivered another quarter of solid comp sales, increasing 1.8%, led by growth in customer traffic of 1.3%. On a 2-year stacked basis, comp sales were up 3.4% and comp traffic increased 2.5%. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and 11th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. 
The grocery business continued to improve as food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in 5 years, led by strong customer traffic and a return of slight market inflation in food, excluding our own price investments.
All formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 70 basis points to the segment. Keep in mind, the e-commerce sales contribution includes not only purchases that are shipped to a customer's home but also omnichannel transactions fulfilled in stores, such as Online Grocery and Pick Up Today.
Gross margin rate declined 5 basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise benefited the margin rate but was more than offset by the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business as well as continued investments in price.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 13 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn't leverage expenses for the overall segment, we did leverage in the stores for the second straight quarter. Service levels remain high, and our associates are doing a great job of being more efficient through improved training and by utilizing upgraded technology. Operating income increased 2.2% in the quarter, which is the second straight quarterly increase.
Managing inventory has been a key focus for the U.S. business, and the team continues to do a fantastic job in this area. During the quarter, inventory at comp stores fell 3.8%, while in-stock levels remained high.
We're pleased with the continued momentum at Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. With the third quarter underway, the back-to-school season is in full swing, and we're providing more options for customers to save time and money in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%.
Now let's move on to Walmart International. Walmart International continue to execute against the strategic priorities and delivered strong underlying results. On a constant-currency basis, net sales increased 2.5% and decreased 1% on a reported basis. Keep in mind, the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of nearly $520 million in the period when compared to last year.
The good performance in the quarter was fairly broad based, and results at Walmex were particularly strong with comp sales growing more than 7%. 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales, including in the U.K., and 5 of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. As a reminder, the timing of Easter benefited our results for the second quarter.
Operating income declined by 2% on a constant-currency basis and 7.8% on a reported basis. As I mentioned earlier, there were few items for International affecting year-over-year performance related to divestitures. The net impact from these divestitures benefited operating income by $415 million this year and $513 million last year in constant currency. Excluding these items, operating income grew 5.2% on a constant-currency basis. 
We delivered these results even as we continued to make strategic investments to enhance the shopping experience both in-store and online in several of our major markets. The attention to operating discipline allowed us to leverage expenses in the period even as we made important investments.
Let's now turn to some highlights from key markets. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes detailed information on our 4 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant-currency basis.
Let's begin with Walmex, where momentum in sales continued across all countries and regions. Total sales increased 9.2%, excluding Suburbia, and comp sales grew 7.2%. In Mexico, comp sales increased more than 15% on a 2-year stacked basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service.
In Canada, net sales increased 3.4% and comp sales increased 2.5%. We further improved our price position against competitors, which contributed to market share gains in key traffic-driving categories, such as food and consumables. Inventory was also a focus, as the team reduced overall levels even as sales increased.
Turning to the U.K., net sales increased 3.9% and comp sales increased 1.8%. Customers responded to investments in the value proposition, and we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket. 
In China, net sales increased 2.5% and comp sales increased 0.6%. Previously, we highlighted our decision to reduce the mix of bulk sales of certain items in our stores, and while we saw negative impact to top line results, we believe it was the right decision. Results for the quarter were primarily driven by momentum in fresh and consumables categories. Additionally, we had good performances with local festivals and holidays.
From an e-commerce perspective, we continue to expand our offering through the alliance with jd.com. We now have 134 Walmart stores across 18 cities that have joined the JD Daojia platform, which offers delivery of orders in less than 1 hour.
Moving on to Sam's Club. Comp sales without fuel increased 1.2% in the period, led by traffic growth of 2.1%. We're serving members across multiple channels, and our e-commerce initiatives produced strong results with 80 basis points of contribution to comp sales and year-over-year growth of 29% for Club Pickup. 
Operating income decreased in the period primarily due to a charge of about $50 million as a result of impairments of certain assets and the decision to close 4 underperforming clubs. The team is moving quickly to execute on their priorities of people, products and digital, and we're starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win. 
We believe good growth opportunities exist in the club channel, and we know we have to do more to capture greater share in this space. We're laser focused on our members and how we can serve them in new and exciting ways. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales without fuel to increase between 1% and 1.5%.
With that, let's talk about guidance. We're pleased with our first half performance. Given our results to-date, combined with our expectations for the balance of the year, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be $4.30 to $4.40, which includes a range of $0.90 to $0.98 for the third quarter. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 for the full year. 
The initial guidance for full year EPS assumed a negative currency impact of about $0.05 per share, but we now expect the EPS impact from currency will be less given current exchange rates. We continue to assume a full year effective tax rate of around 32%. As with all guidance, this assumes the economic conditions in key markets remains relatively consistent.
Overall, we're doing what we said we would do: executing our plan and delivering good results. I continue to be excited about where we're heading as a company and how we're improving our customers' lives. As I close today, let me say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the work you do every day. You serve an incredible number of customers each day, and you do it well."

As you may have seen this morning, we delivered a solid first quarter, and we're encouraged with our start to the year. From my view, I'd say that Walmart U.S. highlights were the 1.5% growth in comp traffic, comp store inventory being down over 7%, improved expense performance in our stores versus last year and the acceleration of e-commerce GMV growth to 69%. There were some other highlights outside the Walmart U.S. business that we'll touch on later. 
Inside the company, we can see that we're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers, but we can also see plenty of room to improve. We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we're capable of. So that's where we're focused on. 
I'm really encouraged by how our store and club associates are embracing change. We're creating new solutions to help us run the business better in addition to creating a better experience for the customer in stores and online. 
Let me give you a few examples. 
A few weeks ago, while visiting stores in Oklahoma City, I saw firsthand how the combination of some new in-store apps and mobile handhelds are improving our in-store processes and making life easier for associates. A grocery department manager in one store showed us how she now ensures side counter modular accuracy and in-stock with a new app we developed for our mobile handhelds. With this new app, the time to complete her work has now been reduced, improving her productivity and giving her more time to interact with customers. I saw it again last week in Omaha, Nebraska. 
I saw another example in Canada in April. There, we have an improved process at store level that is reducing inventory levels in the back room in a meaningful way. Our team is building better tools. Our associates are embracing them and the results are improving. 
This is important because it's our key to winning starts with how we work inside the company. We're transforming to become more of a digital enterprise. The change is starting to be visible to our customers as they use Online Grocery, Walmart Pay, Scan & Go in Sam's Club and our Walmart app to skip the line when using our pharmacies and financial services in our U.S. stores. Online Grocery also continues to perform well, and we're on track to scale the offering to more stores this year in several countries, including the U.S. We're taking steps to save customers time as well as money. 
Brett is going to take you through the financials, but before he does, I'll talk briefly about each area. 
Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. 
Comp store sales grew 1.4% and comp store traffic improved 1.5%. We got off to a slower start than expected due in part to delayed federal tax refund checks but saw sales strengthen throughout the quarter. We also continued to manage the business well from an inventory and availability standpoint. 
I recently attended the grand opening of our 100th training academy in Edmond, Oklahoma. I met associates there who were new to Walmart and were quickly learning about our business. I also met associates who have been with us for 30, 35 and even 40 years, and they were learning about new processes and tools. 
I'm proud that we have lifelong learners at Walmart, and I'm excited about the training we're providing. We plan to graduate approximately 225,000 associates from our U.S. academies this year. Remember, 75% of our Walmart U.S. store management teams started as hourly associates, so it's critical we provide effective training for our associates as they take on more responsibility in our company. 
Overall, the store business is getting stronger, and I'm thankful to Greg Foran and the team for a thoughtful plan and the energy they're investing to lead the improvement. Greg, Marc Lore and the team continue to partner closely to serve our customers and figure out how to invent a seamless shopping experience for customers across our apps, sites and stores. They are plowing new territory, and I'm excited about what's to come. 
In U.S. e-commerce, we like the traction, and we're working hard to make even more improvements. Walmart.com launched 2 new initiatives in the quarter. First, we made a change to shipping terms at the beginning of the quarter. Customers don't have to pay a membership fee to get 2-day shipping on millions of items. Second, we recently began offering customers pickup discounts on nonstore items. Our stores are located within 10 miles of nearly 90% of the U.S. population, so this is convenient for many of our customers and also saves them money when they order online and pick it up during their visit to our stores. Walmart.com now has 50 million first- and third-party items to choose from compared to 10 million at this time last year. So our assortment continues to ramp. 
We also made a few small but strategic e-commerce acquisitions to further improve our assortment while gaining critical category expertise in higher-margin categories like shoes and apparel. The acquisitions have received a lot of attention, but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success. The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up. So overall, we're making progress in providing the seamless shopping experience our customers desire, and we will keep moving along this journey. 
Staying in the U.S., let talk about Sam's Club. John Furner and the team have hit the ground running. They're focused on members, merchandise and our associates. They achieved comp sales growth of 1.6% in the quarter, led by a 1.1% comp traffic growth, and e-commerce GMV increased 21%. 
I'm excited about how we're ramping up our product brand offering with improved quality and compelling new items. We've streamlined 20 private brands into 1, and we'll be introducing 300 new items this year that are branded Member's Mark. The team at Sam's Club is also taking important steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. 
Outside the U.S., Dave Cheesewright and the team continued to deliver solid results. Overall, constant currency sales growth of less than 1% was negatively impacted by a couple of timing and divestiture-related issues that Brett will discuss, but our underlying business continues to perform well. 
At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was nearly 4% this year and 12% on a 2-year stack. 
In April, I visited our businesses in China and Japan. China continues to be on fast forward as it relates to all things digital, including e-commerce. Operationally, our stores continued to improve and Sam's Clubs are doing well, working with JD.com and New Dada, China's largest local on-demand logistics and grocery O2O, short for online to off-line, delivery platform. We now offer 1-hour delivery service from 80 stores. This is an improvement from the 2-hour service we launched last year. 
We can see the benefits of omnichannel retail even more clearly in China than any other country where we operate. Given their urban density and automobile traffic challenges, stores serve the triple purpose of in-store shopping, pickup and delivery most effectively. 
I saw some similarities in Japan, where stores were serving more than one purpose. In both markets, we're piloting the use of the stores as shipping locations, and we're learning what works best from a financial point of view in different types of store trade areas given how customer densities and travel distance can vary. 
Moving on to Canada. Our business continues to perform well, delivering 12 consecutive quarters of positive comp sales. 
We've made some progress in the U.K., and the team is executing their plan. We're navigating our way back to a position of strength in that highly competitive market. When normalizing comp sales for the later Easter and Leap Day, we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket. 
For the overall segment, International had another solid, predictable quarter. The team has done a nice job of growing profit faster than sales as they simultaneously shift our positioning in terms of store formats, Online Grocery and e-commerce. 
In conclusion, we're encouraged with our start to the year. We have a clear strategy we're executing against. We're uniquely positioned to deliver value through both our physical and digital assets. We have momentum across the business. We're making progress, and we know we're on the right track as we work to become the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders. We look forward to seeing many of you next month at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting here in Northwest Arkansas. 
Thanks for being interested in our business. Now I'll hand it over to Brett."

As I've been saying over the past few quarters, this is an exciting time to be at Walmart, and we are delivering solid results. In the U.S., important initiatives are under way both to accelerate growth in e-commerce and drive traffic to our stores. Most of our key international markets continue to perform well, and top line performance at Sam's Club remains solid. 
On today's call, I'm going to cover our consolidated results from the first quarter, talk about e-commerce in the U.S. and then provide details on our operating segments. We'll discuss the consolidated results in the context of our financial framework of strong, efficient growth, operating discipline and strategic capital allocation. 
Let's start with our consolidated results. 
EPS was $1, which is at the top end our guidance of $0.90 to $1 and 2% higher than last year. This marks the first quarterly EPS increase in more than 2 years on an underlying basis. 
On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 2.5% to $118.8 billion as we saw solid top line performance across the business. Walmart U.S. continued its momentum with comps of 1.4%, while Sam's Club posted comp sales, without fuel, of 1.6%. In Walmart International, 7 of our 11 markets reported positive comps even as the timing of Easter and last year's Leap Day negatively impacted results. The U.S. e-commerce GMV growth accelerated significantly, up approximately 69%. 
Through the lens of strong, efficient growth, I'm pleased with the results. Gross profit margin increased 1 basis point during the quarter. The rate for Walmart U.S. was flat while Walmart International was up slightly. 
In regard to operating discipline, while we didn't leverage expenses on a consolidated level primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology, I'm pleased that we leveraged in our U.S. stores. We're making progress towards our objective of slightly leveraging expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. 
We continued to generate strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter, $5.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Cash flow was down year-on-year primarily due to an increase in incentive payments as well as a comparison against significant working capital improvements last year. 
As we strategically allocate capital, our first priority is to invest in improving and growing the business. In the quarter, we completed remodels of 95 stores globally; and in the U.S., we continued to expand our Online Grocery service to include nearly 670 locations. We also added a limited number of new stores and made 2 relatively small acquisitions in the e-commerce space, Moosejaw and ModCloth, to expand our online selection and improve our category expertise in important areas like apparel and outdoor gear. 
In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. 
Before I get into our operating segments, I'll talk about Walmart U.S. e-commerce. As a reminder, the results include all web-initiated transactions, including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship To Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and other sites in our family of brands. 
Year-over-year growth in GMV was approximately 69%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com. This was extraordinary growth, and we're pleased with the traction we're generating across our e-commerce offerings. 
We've recently introduced free 2-day shipping with a basket size of $35 or more on select items and launched a new service called Pickup Discount, where customers can order nonstore products online and receive a discount for picking these items up in our stores. This is a service that's convenient for customers and saves them money. 
Let's now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. 
You will recall in our fourth quarter comments that the first quarter started out slower than anticipated from a sales standpoint, due in part to the delayed issuance of federal income tax refund checks. As anticipated, our sales strengthened as the quarter progressed, delivering comp sales growth of 1.4%, led by an increase in customer traffic of 1.5%. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. On a 2-year stack basis, comp traffic is up 3%. Average ticket declined slightly primarily due to lower sales of higher-ticket items at the bringing of the quarter, as well as continued price investment. Additionally, the grocery business continued to improve with food categories delivering the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in more than 3 years, due in part to a lack of market deflation in food, excluding price investments. 
All store formats had positive comp sales, and e-commerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment. We were really pleased with our results for the Easter holiday period as both food and general merchandise performed well. 
Gross margin rate was flat in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise and the acceleration of post-holiday markdowns taken in the fourth quarter benefited the margin rate, but this was offset by investments in price and the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 14 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn't leverage expenses for the overall segment, I'm pleased that we leveraged in the stores. 
Operating income increased 0.9%, which is the first increase in more than 3 years. 
The team continues to do a fantastic job managing inventory. During the quarter, inventory at comp store fell 7.3% while in-stock levels remained high. 
We're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. For the 13-week period ending July 28, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%. 
Now let's move on to Walmart International. 
International business continues to execute against its strategic priorities and delivered a solid start to the year. As I mentioned earlier, International performance was negatively impacted by 1 less operating day this year due to Leap Day last year, as well as the later timing of Easter this year. 
Before we get into the results, let me discuss the financial impact, beginning in the first quarter, from strategic decisions we made previously to divest 2 businesses, Yihaodian in China and Suburbia in Mexico. 
In the second quarter of last year, as part of the announced alliance with JD.com, we divested our e-commerce business in China, Yihaodian, except for the first-party piece of that business. Beginning in the fourth quarter of last year, we began to wind down the first-party business, with only a small amount of sales remaining at the end of the first quarter of this year. This created a sales headwind versus last year of $385 million in the quarter, and we expect a similar impact in each of the next couple of quarters until we lap the unwinding of the business. 
Additionally, last month, Walmex announced it completed the sale of its apparel format, Suburbia. The gain from the sale of this business will be recorded in the second quarter of this year, and as a result, we expect a net benefit to EPS of approximately $0.05 in the quarter. Beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the remainder of this year, International's results will be negatively impacted by the operating profit lost due to sale of the business. We expect a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.01 for the third and fourth quarters. We also expect a full year impact to sales of approximately $600 million. 
We'll continue to detail the impacts of these transactions as we go through the year. 
Now let's move on to the overall International results. 
On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 0.8%. And excluding Yihaodian, net sales increased 2.2%. Reported net sales declined 3.5%, impacted by a $1.2 billion currency headwind. 
From a profitability standpoint, first quarter operating income increased 9% on a constant currency basis and declined 0.1% on a reported basis. 
During the quarter, a benefit to operating income of approximately $47 million from a land sale was recorded in one of our markets. Excluding this item, operating income would have increased 5% on a constant currency basis. 
Let's now turn to some brief highlights of key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our 4 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. 
Let's begin with Walmex, where sales momentum continued across all countries and regions. 
Total sales increased 5.2% and comp sales growth was 3.7%. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased over 13% on a 2-year stack basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service. 
In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 1.5%. During the quarter, we reduced inventory levels even as sales increased. And according to Nielsen, we continued to gain market share in key traffic-driving categories like food and consumables and health and wellness. Continued planned investments in price and in-store efficiency initiatives are being supported by progress with our cost analytics program. 
In China, net sales increased 0.7% and comp sales decreased 1.3%. In addition to the impact of 1 less day in the quarter due to Leap Day last year, sales were impacted by our strategic decision to reduce low-margin bulk sales. During the quarter, we continued to expand our e-commerce offering by entering new cities through our crowd-sourced delivery partnership with New Dada and now offer 1-hour delivery from 80 stores. We also launched new product categories, such as produce and frozen items, on our Sam's Club flagship store on the JD.com platform. 
Turning to the U.K. Net sales increased 0.9.% while comp sales declined 2.8%. When normalizing for Leap Day last year and a later Easter this year, we continued to see sequential improvement in the underlying business, including customer traffic and ticket. We're confident we're on the right track. 
So overall, our International strategy continues to produce consistent results, and we are pleased with the solid start to the year. 
Let's turn to Sam's Club. 
At Sam's Club, comp sales, without fuel, increased 1.6% as traffic grew by 1.1%. We had good results across many of our categories and comps have been positive for 5 consecutive quarters. We're also pleased with our digital growth as Club Pickup increased nearly 30%. The team at Sam's is taking steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. The initiatives under way at Sam's are designed to grow membership and sales, and we know it all starts with member experience. We'll deliver for them through our efforts to lead in digital and provide unmatched value on great merchandise. 
For the 13-week period ending July 28,2017, we expect comp sales, without fuel, to increase between 1% and 1.5%. 
With that, let's discuss total company EPS guidance. 
We feel good about the momentum across the business and expect progress to continue. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we expect EPS, excluding the gain from the sale of Suburbia, to be between $1 and $1.08. 
In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the important work you do every day. As a company, we're moving with speed and executing against the strategy we've outlined, and it's all happening through the lens of our financial framework. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting in a few weeks."

Our second quarter results were solid with continued top line momentum in the business. Walmart U.S. grew comp sales 1.8% and comp traffic 1.3%. We continue to gain traction in e-commerce with Walmart U.S. GMV up 67%. The U.S. store team's done a great job staying focused on providing a fast and easy customer experience while managing expenses and inventory. Customers are responding to the improvements we're making to deliver a seamless shopping experience that saves them time and money, and that's exciting to see.
In addition, Sam's Club delivered comp traffic growth of more than 2%. In International, 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales, and 5 of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. So overall, we're making progress across the business and feel good about where we are midway through the year.
Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families. To accomplish this, we continue our transformation to become more of a digital enterprise that moves with speed and agility. I'm encouraged by innovation in the business. We're testing associate delivery of walmart.com orders in a few stores, and by the end of the year, we'll have approximately 100 automated pickup towers in stores across the U.S., where customers can pick up their orders within a matter of minutes.
With Easy Reorder on walmart.com, a customer has visibility to their past in-store and online purchases. In a matter of seconds, they can easily repurchase the items they've bought most frequently before and save the time it may have taken to make a weekly shopping list. 
Another example is our integrated back-to-school offering. Our dedicated back-to-school destination on walmart.com enables customers to shop school supply lists for more than 1 million classrooms across the United States. They can find their own list by simply entering their zip code and quickly adding all the items from the school list to their basket. Then they can choose whether to pick up the items at their local store or ship them to their home. It's a huge timesaver for busy families. If you haven't done your back-to-school shopping, you should definitely check this out.
We have tests going on with digital endless aisle shopping, robotics and image analytics to scan aisles for outs, and we're using machine learning to assist our merchants with pricing. Sam's Club members continue to provide great feedback on the convenience of Scan & Go, and we'll be further expanding Scan & Go within Walmart U.S. this year. 
This quarter, we also enjoyed welcoming entrepreneurs from more than 500 small businesses to Bentonville to pitch their Made in the U.S.A. products to sell in our stores and online as part of our ""Investing in American Jobs Open Call"" in June. And last month, we released proposals for policy actions to address barriers to manufacturing growth here in the U.S.
We're pleased to be making progress towards our goal of purchasing an additional $250 billion in products made, sourced or grown in the U.S. Customers want to buy products that are not only good for their families but also for the people that made them. 
In e-commerce, customers are responding favorably to our expanded assortment, which surpassed 67 million SKUs on walmart.com. Our recent acquisitions, such as Moosejaw, Shoebuy and Bonobos, further improved our assortment and have provided critical category expertise and higher margin categories like shoes and apparel.
A couple of weeks ago, I was in Boston to meet with the Shoebuy team, which is now known as shoes.com. They were very engaged and really impressive. In addition, I was excited to visit with the Moosejaw team in Detroit in July. This talented group is thriving in their creative culture, and it was great to hear what they're working on.
We believe that we're uniquely positioned to grow and delight customers by providing a seamless shopping experience they desire. Having stores within 10 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population allows us to serve customers in ways that are most convenient for them. We've seen strong results from the rollout of Online Grocery, which is now in more than 900 U.S. locations, and we're expanding this service in many of our markets around the world.
Retail is constantly evolving, and it's critical that we move even faster as the customer and competitive landscape continue to change. Brett will provide more details on the financials shortly, but before he does, I'll talk briefly about each area of the business. Let me start with Walmart U.S. 
We had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 1.8% and comp traffic growth of 1.3%. It's exciting that sales growth is coming from across the business, including stores, e-commerce and a combination of both. 
Under Greg Foran's leadership, the stores continue to perform well. The grocery business has really strengthened as food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in 5 years. We're also pleased with the expense discipline as physical stores leveraged expenses for the second consecutive quarter. We've done this while maintaining high in-stock and service levels. 
Store associates are using better technology and processes to perform their tasks, and we're becoming more efficient. Our training programs are fueling this progress as well. This training is not only equipping associates for their current roles, but preparing them for promotion into roles with greater responsibility and pay. We've now opened 175 training academies and expect to have 200 operating by the end of the year.
In Walmart U.S. e-commerce, Marc Lore and the team delivered another quarter of robust top line growth with GMV up 67%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com as customers are finding a broader assortment and more options to receive what they want at their convenience. 
They love not having to pay a membership fee to get Walmart's free 2-day shipping on millions of items. And we're seeing a nice increase in customers receiving discounts for picking up nonstore items at their local stores. Marc, Greg and their teams continue to make good progress in driving innovative solutions across the business and providing the seamless shopping experience customers desire.
Staying in the U.S., let's talk about Sam's Club. John Furner and team have improved execution, resulting in stronger comp traffic. Sam's Club had comp sales growth without fuel of 1.2% in the quarter led by 2.1% comp traffic growth and e-commerce GMV increased to 23%. Overall, we're starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win. Club Pickup continues to grow, and I'm excited about how we're leveraging clubs to serve members across multiple channels. We're also strengthening the assortment with exciting merchandise, including progress in fresh and with our private brand, Member's Mark, which is more than a $10 billion brand and growing.
Outside the U.S., the Walmart International team, led by Dave Cheesewright, continued to deliver strong underlying results with 9 of 11 markets posting positive comp sales and the segment leveraging expenses overall.
Walmex continues to be the strongest international market with comp sales growth of more than 7% in the quarter. What's even more impressive is that this sales momentum is broad-based across all countries and regions.
In China, our stores are improving, and we launched Walmart and Sam's Club global flagship stores through our alliance with JD.com this quarter. In addition, more than 25% of Walmart stores in China now offer delivery of orders in less than 1 hour through the JD Daojia delivery platform.
Moving to Canada, the business continues to perform well. The investments that we've made in price are resonating with customers and contributing to market share gains in key traffic-driving categories. We're also encouraged that the U.K. delivered positive comp sales. In June, I visited Asda to see the progress being made. Customers are responding to investments in price and store experience by visiting the stores more often and increasing their basket sizes. There's still much more to be done, but we're clearly headed in the right direction. 
While there, I visited stores as well as our Heston grocery-delivery fulfillment center. I was impressed by how the team is focused on not only improving grocery pickup and delivery from stores but also from fulfillment centers and higher-volume environments.
So overall, the International segment has made steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and e-commerce.
In conclusion, we're encouraged with the solid first half results. We're uniquely positioned to deliver the seamless, fast, innovative and exciting shopping experience our customers desire. I'm pleased with how we're equipping our associates to deliver it. I'd like to thank our associates for their focus on serving customers in all the ways they choose to shop. It's making a difference.
We have a clear strategy that we're executing against and good momentum across the business. Thanks for your continued interest in Walmart.
Now I'll hand it over to Brett."

We're improving our competitive position with a differentiated offering by giving customers a better experience in our stores and more of what they want online. We're guided by our financial framework to deliver strong efficient growth, operate with discipline and allocate capital strategically. We're making progress on each element, and it's through this lens that I'll discuss our results.
Second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.08 is at the top end of our guidance. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 1.8%, led by traffic growth of 1.3%. U.S. e-commerce GMV grew 67% and International delivered strong results.
Two items significantly impacted EPS for the quarter. There was a $0.17 negative impact related to the premiums paid for bond tenders, which allowed us to retire higher-rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. We also recorded a gain from the sale of our Suburbia business in Mexico, which benefited EPS by $0.05. It's also important to remember that during the second quarter of last year, the company's EPS was positively impacted by $0.14 related to the gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business in China.
Adjusted for these items, EPS increased approximately 1% year-over-year. Gross profit margin decreased 11 basis points during the quarter. Strategic price investments in key markets and the growing mix of our e-commerce business reduced the gross margin rate. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes more details on gross margins for each segment.
We continue to make some progress with expenses as we leverage expenses in our U.S. stores as well as in the International segment. As a company, SG&A delevered by 10 basis points in the period primarily due to increase technology spending and some impairment charges related to Sam's Club. We expect to slightly leverage expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. Operating with discipline is important to where we're going in the future. We have a lot of work to do, but I'm encouraged by the focus I'm seeing.
Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the first 6 months were solid at $11.4 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. Compared with last year, the decreases in operating cash flow and free cash flow were due to an increase in incentive payments and the timing of other payments. 
We're still seeing improvement in working capital but not as strong as the tremendous improvement last year, which also impacts the year-on-year comparability.
In terms of capital allocation, we completed remodels of 283 stores globally. And in the U.S., we further expanded our Online Grocery service to include more than 900 locations. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2017, consolidated return on investment decreased 50 basis points due primarily to reduced operating income.
Let's now move on to e-commerce. As a reminder, e-commerce results include all web-initiated transactions, including those through walmart.com, such as ship-to-home, ship-to-store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.
Walmart U.S. e-commerce again performed very well on the top line as GMV grew 67% and sales increased 60%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, which is growing quickly. 
We're delivering growth through an improved customer value proposition that includes free 2-day shipping on millions of items and Easy Reorder as well as an expanded assortment now with more than 67 million SKUs, an increase of more than 30% from the first quarter.
With Easy Reorder, we're integrating both in-store and online purchases to provide customers with a single spot to view and repurchase the items they buy most frequently. Initiatives like these, along with everyday low prices, are the reasons why customers are choosing Walmart in greater numbers. As a reminder, we'll begin to lap the Jet.com acquisition in the third quarter.
Now let's move on to operating segment details. Walmart U.S. delivered another quarter of solid comp sales, increasing 1.8%, led by growth in customer traffic of 1.3%. On a 2-year stacked basis, comp sales were up 3.4% and comp traffic increased 2.5%. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and 11th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. 
The grocery business continued to improve as food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in 5 years, led by strong customer traffic and a return of slight market inflation in food, excluding our own price investments.
All formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 70 basis points to the segment. Keep in mind, the e-commerce sales contribution includes not only purchases that are shipped to a customer's home but also omnichannel transactions fulfilled in stores, such as Online Grocery and Pick Up Today.
Gross margin rate declined 5 basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise benefited the margin rate but was more than offset by the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business as well as continued investments in price.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 13 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn't leverage expenses for the overall segment, we did leverage in the stores for the second straight quarter. Service levels remain high, and our associates are doing a great job of being more efficient through improved training and by utilizing upgraded technology. Operating income increased 2.2% in the quarter, which is the second straight quarterly increase.
Managing inventory has been a key focus for the U.S. business, and the team continues to do a fantastic job in this area. During the quarter, inventory at comp stores fell 3.8%, while in-stock levels remained high.
We're pleased with the continued momentum at Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. With the third quarter underway, the back-to-school season is in full swing, and we're providing more options for customers to save time and money in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%.
Now let's move on to Walmart International. Walmart International continue to execute against the strategic priorities and delivered strong underlying results. On a constant-currency basis, net sales increased 2.5% and decreased 1% on a reported basis. Keep in mind, the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of nearly $520 million in the period when compared to last year.
The good performance in the quarter was fairly broad based, and results at Walmex were particularly strong with comp sales growing more than 7%. 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales, including in the U.K., and 5 of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. As a reminder, the timing of Easter benefited our results for the second quarter.
Operating income declined by 2% on a constant-currency basis and 7.8% on a reported basis. As I mentioned earlier, there were few items for International affecting year-over-year performance related to divestitures. The net impact from these divestitures benefited operating income by $415 million this year and $513 million last year in constant currency. Excluding these items, operating income grew 5.2% on a constant-currency basis. 
We delivered these results even as we continued to make strategic investments to enhance the shopping experience both in-store and online in several of our major markets. The attention to operating discipline allowed us to leverage expenses in the period even as we made important investments.
Let's now turn to some highlights from key markets. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes detailed information on our 4 major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant-currency basis.
Let's begin with Walmex, where momentum in sales continued across all countries and regions. Total sales increased 9.2%, excluding Suburbia, and comp sales grew 7.2%. In Mexico, comp sales increased more than 15% on a 2-year stacked basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service.
In Canada, net sales increased 3.4% and comp sales increased 2.5%. We further improved our price position against competitors, which contributed to market share gains in key traffic-driving categories, such as food and consumables. Inventory was also a focus, as the team reduced overall levels even as sales increased.
Turning to the U.K., net sales increased 3.9% and comp sales increased 1.8%. Customers responded to investments in the value proposition, and we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket. 
In China, net sales increased 2.5% and comp sales increased 0.6%. Previously, we highlighted our decision to reduce the mix of bulk sales of certain items in our stores, and while we saw negative impact to top line results, we believe it was the right decision. Results for the quarter were primarily driven by momentum in fresh and consumables categories. Additionally, we had good performances with local festivals and holidays.
From an e-commerce perspective, we continue to expand our offering through the alliance with jd.com. We now have 134 Walmart stores across 18 cities that have joined the JD Daojia platform, which offers delivery of orders in less than 1 hour.
Moving on to Sam's Club. Comp sales without fuel increased 1.2% in the period, led by traffic growth of 2.1%. We're serving members across multiple channels, and our e-commerce initiatives produced strong results with 80 basis points of contribution to comp sales and year-over-year growth of 29% for Club Pickup. 
Operating income decreased in the period primarily due to a charge of about $50 million as a result of impairments of certain assets and the decision to close 4 underperforming clubs. The team is moving quickly to execute on their priorities of people, products and digital, and we're starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win. 
We believe good growth opportunities exist in the club channel, and we know we have to do more to capture greater share in this space. We're laser focused on our members and how we can serve them in new and exciting ways. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales without fuel to increase between 1% and 1.5%.
With that, let's talk about guidance. We're pleased with our first half performance. Given our results to-date, combined with our expectations for the balance of the year, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be $4.30 to $4.40, which includes a range of $0.90 to $0.98 for the third quarter. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 for the full year. 
The initial guidance for full year EPS assumed a negative currency impact of about $0.05 per share, but we now expect the EPS impact from currency will be less given current exchange rates. We continue to assume a full year effective tax rate of around 32%. As with all guidance, this assumes the economic conditions in key markets remains relatively consistent.
Overall, we're doing what we said we would do: executing our plan and delivering good results. I continue to be excited about where we're heading as a company and how we're improving our customers' lives. As I close today, let me say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the work you do every day. You serve an incredible number of customers each day, and you do it well."

We're providing customers with fast and easy ways to save money and time, and they're responding. The highlights for the quarter from my perspective our Walmart U.S. comp sales of 2.7% were strong; Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales were up 50%; adjusted EPS exceeded our guidance range; Sam's Club comps were strong at 2.8%; and in international, 10 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales. 
So overall, we're moving in the right direction, the productivity loop is starting to turn, and I'm encouraged by our results. 
I'll discuss more details from our third quarter in a minute, but I'd like to start by thanking everyone, who came to Bentonville for our Investment Community Meeting in October. We hope that you gained a clear perspective of our strategy to make every day easier for busy families. We have a plan that plays to our unique strengths. We're acting faster and being disciplined about costs and capital. 
Curiosity, creativity, decisiveness and speed are priorities. There's a lot of innovation today in the business, and we enjoyed sharing some of the initiatives with you. We've expanded Online Grocery pickup, launched Mobile Express Returns, and we're testing automated pickup towers and same-day grocery delivery. We're also learning how to automate some routine functions in our stores like scanning for shelf level out of stocks and modular accuracy. We're leveraging our unique assets and financial strength to better serve customers and accelerate growth. When we were together last month, we outlined 4 priorities: make everyday easier for busy families; change how we work; deliver results and operate with discipline; and be the most trusted retailer. 
By executing on all these strategic priorities, we are confident that our customers and shareholders will benefit. The importance of that fourth priority, being the most trusted retailer, was certainly amplified over the past 3 months. We saw a significant destruction through hurricanes and wildfires in the U.S. and the earthquake in Mexico. 
I'm so proud of the commitment our associates showed to the communities we serve. During these difficult times, our customers needed us more than ever, and associates responded to each crisis in remarkable fashion. We're proud that as a company, we committed over $38 million to disaster relief this year, and that our customers have donated over $43 million, bringing the total to more than $80 million to date. 
As you know, Puerto Rico experienced widespread devastation and with the ongoing recovery, we'll continue to partner with government officials, relief organizations and others there on the island to support the rebuilding efforts. We'd also encourage each of you to get involved by financially supporting the Puerto Rico recovery efforts at give.miamifoundation.org/Walmart. 
Now let's move back to our third quarter results and briefly discuss each area of the business. Brett will provide more details on the financials shortly. Let me start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 2.7% and comp traffic growth of 1.5%. While we recognize that there is some incremental hurricane-related sales in these numbers, our core business is performing well. Greg Foran and the team continue to improve our U.S. stores across almost all categories we're seeing growth. The food business, in particular, has accelerated and delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in almost 6 years with our fresh meat, bakery and produce teams leading the way. Expense leverage has also been a priority, and we are pleased that the segment leveraged expenses in the third quarter. 
It's important to note that we've accomplished this while maintaining high-end stock and service levels for customers. Our associates are using technology and apps for inventory management and price changes that help to make their jobs easier and increase productivity in the stores. Store leverage is helping to allow our strategic investments in e-commerce to continue. It's also exciting to see how we're removing friction from the customer expense with express pharmacy, an easier money services process and by expanding pickup options with our automated towers and online grocery. 
We now have online grocery in more than 1,100 stores and are looking forward to expand in this popular offering to another 1,000 locations next year. 
Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales were up 50% this quarter, with the majority of the increase through walmart.com. Existing customers have become advocates for popular initiatives like online grocery and free 2-day shipping. And as a result, new customers, suppliers and partnerships are coming to Walmart. The expanded assortment on walmart.com has also contributed to growth. Over the past year, we've tripled the number of items on walmart.com to reach more than 70 million SKUs today. 
As you heard last month, Marc's team is making progress on hiring additional category specialists, focused on improving the customer experience and our positioning with the top $1 million in e-commerce items. The recent agreement with Lord and Taylor is a great example of how we will be creating specialty experiences that complement what we offer and serve customers with the brands they want. We're making good progress attracting premium brands at the site such as KitchenAid and Bose. 
We're continuing to expand our tests of same-day delivery and next day delivery, including our test with August home, and the use of crowd-sourced partners for grocery and our own associates. The acquisition of Parcel brings us the ability to deliver items in New York and other major metropolitan areas on the same or next day. 
At Jet.com, we continue to position the business to focus on higher income, urban customers. We launched the Uniquely J private brand and also began selling ModCloth items on Jet this quarter. In addition, we've started to attract more premium brands to the site, and we expect this to continue. 
Staying in the U.S., let's talk about Sam's Club. Sam's Club delivered comp sales growth without fuel of 2.8% in the quarter. We're especially pleased with the improvement in member traffic, which was up 3.6%, including some hurricane-related benefits. We're focusing the business to accelerate growth, narrowing the target member and taking steps to become more special to that member. As John Furner outlined last month, the target member is a larger family with a higher income, probably in the suburbs, they own their own home and a car or 2. They may own a small restaurant or buy for their office as well. By narrowing the focus on this member, we believe we can earn a greater share of their wallet. 
We're already making good progress in areas where we want to win, including fresh food and with our Member's Mark private brand. In addition, John and the team are using technology to make Sam's a better place to shop and work. I'm encouraged by what we're seeing at Sam's Club. 
Outside of the U.S., the Walmart international team continued to deliver strong top line results with 10 of 11 markets posting positive comp sales. Walmex performed well again this quarter with comp sales growth of 7%. 
Last month, I visited stores in Mexico and was energized by how the team is improving each of our formats. Our stores and clubs are fun to shop. The team is also on their way towards a digital transformation. They're changing how they work and that will bear fruit in the future. 
In Mexico, we're providing convenience through initiatives like online grocery, and we recently launched an e-commerce marketplace, which expanded our general merchandise assortment by about 20%. In Canada, customers are responding to the investments we've made in price, and this is contributed to market share gains in key traffic-driving categories. We continued to expand the number of locations where we offer online grocery pickup during the quarter and also launched an e-commerce marketplace, which doubled our online assortment and continues our focus on key categories like home and apparel. 
In China, we saw solid net sales growth of 4%. The team continues to do a nice job of improving key categories like fresh and consumables. We also further expanded the number of Walmart stores in China that offer grocery delivery in less than 1 hour, through the JD Daojia delivery platform to nearly 140 stores. 
In the U.K., Asda delivered positive comp sales again this quarter. The improvements in store experience and price investments are increasing store basket sizes. We're excited to have Roger Burnley lead Asda into the future as CEO starting next year. Over the past year, Roger has been our COO and deputy CEO and has a long and distinguished retail career. 
I'd like to thank Sean Clarke, for the tremendous work that he has done over the past year to stabilize the business and positioned it for growth. Sean has done a lot for our company living in 5 countries over his 21-year career with Walmart. Thank you, Sean. 
So overall, the International segment continues to execute the strategy and deliver solid results. In conclusion, I'm pleased with our third quarter results. But I'm more excited about our strategic positioning as we enter the fourth quarter this year. We're stronger as a company, we have momentum, and we have more opportunities to leverage our unique assets to serve customers in ways that are easy, fast, friendly and fun. 
Thanks for your interest in Walmart and on behalf of all of year have an enjoyable holiday season. Now I'll hand it over to Brett."

I want to begin by thanking everyone, who attended our Investment Meeting in Northwest Arkansas or listened via webcast.

I want to begin by thanking everyone, who attended our Investment Meeting in Northwest Arkansas or listened via webcast. We really enjoyed hosting the meeting as it gave us the opportunity to highlight our plan to win with customers and shareholders. Underlying this plan is our financial framework, which highlights focusing on delivering strong, efficient growth, being disciplined how we operate and allocating capital strategically. 
We expect top line growth going forward to be led more by comp sales and e-commerce, with less emphasis on new units in the U.S. We have good sales momentum and cost transformation is gaining traction. This gives us confidence in our ability to operate with discipline and leverage expenses. In terms of capital allocation, we're prioritizing e-commerce, technology, supply chain and store remodels over new stores and clubs, which we believe will contribute to long-term value creation for shareholders. We're excited about the future of Walmart. 
Before I move on, let me highlight 3 items that negatively impacted GAAP EPS in the quarter. First, there was a $0.29 charge related to the premiums paid for bonds tendered, which allowed us to retire higher rate debt reducing interest expense in future periods. Additionally, discussions with the government agencies in the FCPA matter have progressed to the point that the company recorded an accrual of $283 million or $0.09 per share. 
In Walmart International, the decision to exit certain properties in one of our markets led to an impairment charge of $0.04 per share. 
Now let's turn to our third quarter results. Consolidated net sales increased 3.8% in constant currency, driven by comp sales growth across the company, and adjusted EPS was $1, which is m the high end of our guidance range. I'm especially pleased with our progress on expenses. Excluding the charge for the FCPA accrual, we leveraged expenses as a company in the quarter. The leverage and adjusted EPS is even more encouraging given the hurricane-related costs in the quarter. 
Overall, our results were strong. However, our results were positively impacted by currency translation in the quarter. Sales and operating income benefited by approximately $450 million and $60 million, respectively. 
Gross profit margin declined 29 basis points during the quarter. Price investments in certain markets and the mix effects of our growing e-commerce business were the primary contributors to the decline, although, the impact from hurricanes in the U.S. was a significant contributor as well. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes more details on gross margins for each segment. 
Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the first 9 months were solid at $17.1 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively. Compared with last year, the decrease in free cash flow is due to timing of payments, an increase in incentive payments as well as lapping last year's improvements in working capital management. 
In terms of capital allocation, we completed remodels of 342 stores globally. And in the U.S., we further expanded our online grocery service to include more than 1,100 locations. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2017, consolidated return on investment decreased 30 basis points due primarily to reduced operating income. 
Let's move on to e-commerce. As a reminder, e-commerce results include all web-initiated transactions, including those through walmart.com such as ship-to-home, ship-to-store, pick up today and online grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands. 
Walmart U.S. e-commerce continued a strong performance with net sales growth of 50%. We began to lap the acquisition of Jet.com mid-quarter, which impacted our overall growth. Walmart.com, including online grocery, once again led the way and was responsible for the majority of the growth in the period. Throughout this year, we've talked a lot about the speed at which we're moving, and we continued that progress in the third quarter. 
For example, we launched new partnerships with Google and August Home, these are capital-light initiatives that expand convenience for customers by enabling hands free voice shopping and unattended delivery in the home. We also acquired Parcel, a technology-based same day last mile delivery company focused on customers in New York City. 
Let's move on to operating segment details. Walmart U.S. had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 2.7% led by a traffic increase of 1.5%. While difficult to quantify precisely, we estimate hurricane-related impacts benefiting comps by 30 to 50 basis points. On a 2-year stack basis, comp sales were up 3.9% and comp traffic increased 2.2%. This is the strongest quarterly and 2-year stacked performance in more than 8 years. The food business continued to accelerate with sales, traffic and unit growth across categories. In fact, food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in almost 6 years. 
Market inflation was around or slightly less than what we saw in the second quarter. All formats had positive comps and e-commerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment. Gross margin rate declined 36 basis points in the quarter. The margin rate decreased in part due to the continued execution of our price investment strategy and the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business. In addition, we estimate that hurricane-related impacts were about 1/3 of the overall decline. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points with stores leveraging at a higher level than that. The U.S. team has made great progress, while maintaining high customer service levels, as associates are more efficient with improved technology, training and processes. 
The combination of strong sales and greater operating discipline led to operating income increasing 0.8% in the quarter. Recent hurricanes benefited top line results, but negatively impacted gross margins and SG&A. We estimate the net result was a negative impact to segment income of approximately $150 million. 
Our stores continued to do an excellent job of maintaining inventory, while maintaining high in-stock levels. Inventory at comp stores was down 3.5% in the quarter. Overall, we're pleased with the execution and momentum. The fourth quarter is underway, and we are offering easy access to great products at excellent value heading into this holiday season both in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending January 26, 2018, we accept comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2% on a more difficult comparison. 
Now let's move on to Walmart International. We continue to experience broad-based momentum across the business and deliver strong top line results. During the quarter, 10 of 11 markets delivered positive comp sales. We're focused on driving growth across our markets through our fresh offering, private brands and online grocery expansion. Net sales on a constant-currency basis increased 2.5%. 
On a reported basis, net sales increased 4.1%, which includes a benefit of approximately $450 million from currency. Additionally, it's important to note the impacts from the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of nearly $560 million when compared to last year. While our solid sales performance was fairly broad based, we're particularly pleased with the results in Mexico and China, as well as with the improved results in the U.K. 
Operating income declined 12.2% in constant currency and 7.8% or a $105 million on a reported basis. The decline is attributable to 2 items, an impairment charge of approximately $150 million due to our decision to exit certain properties in one of our markets and lapping last year's gain of $86 million from the sale of several shopping malls in Chile. Without these items, operating income would have increased year-on-year. 
Let's now turn to why let's from key markets. The results discussed below are on a constant-currency basis. Let's begin with Walmex, where when sales momentum continued across all countries and regions. Net sales increased 9.2%, excluding Suburbia, and comp sales increased 7%. 
In Mexico, comp sales increased 14.5% on a 2-year stacked basis. All divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service and our strongest performance came from food and staples. In Canada, net sales increased 1.9% and comp sales increased 1%. We further improved our price position, which contributed to market share gains in key traffic-driving getaway such as food and consumables. The team reduced overall inventory levels even as sales increased. 
Turning to the U.K., net sales increased 3.6% and comp sales increased 1.1% as customers are responding to investments in the value proposition. In-store service metrics have improved, and our performance has strengthened across private brands and online grocery offerings. While the business has improved, we still have more work to do. In China, net sales increased 4% and comp sales increased 2.5%, which is the best comp result in about 4 years. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by strong seasonal categories during the mid-autumn festival as well as strength across key categories such as fresh and consumables. 
From an e-commerce standpoint, we continue to grow our partnership with JD.com. During the quarter, we launched the Walmart JD Omni Channel Shopping Festival, expanded our 1-hour grocery delivery service to additional locations and focused on initiatives related to inventory management and logistics efficiencies. Overall, it was another solid quarter for Walmart International. 
Moving on to Sam's Club. Comp sales without fuel increased 2.8% with strong traffic growth of 3.6%. We estimate that hurricane-related impacts benefited comps by approximately 70 to 90 basis points, but negatively impacted gross margins and SG&A. We estimate the net result was a negative impact to segment income of approximately $20 million. The focus at Sam's is on people, product and digital. From a product standpoint, we're making good progress in fresh and with our private label brand, Member's Mark. 
During the quarter, fresh categories, including meat, produce and bakery all performed well. This is an important traffic driver for our clubs, and I'm pleased with the results we're delivering. Member's Mark is a trusted and growing brand, and we recently increased its penetration across multiple categories. 
More than ever, we're leveraging this brand to highlight value on items found exclusively at Sam's Club. Efforts to simplify the business are paying off, and we are becoming more productive. The team leveraged expenses in the period and operating income, excluding fuel increased 4.2%. This was a really solid quarter for Sam's Club. For the 13-week period ending January 26, 2018, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%. 
Let me close today with guidance. We have good momentum in the business, and we are executing with them back with a number of financial framework. We expect a solid performance for the important holiday season, and we are raising expectations for full year adjusted EPS to a range of $4.38 to $4.46. This compares to previous adjusted EPS guidance of $4.3 to $4.40 for the full year. 
In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our associates for the work you do every day and serving our customers and communities around the world.

We're providing customers with fast and easy ways to save money and time, and they're responding. The highlights for the quarter from my perspective are: Walmart U.S. comp sales of 2.7% were strong; Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales were up 50%; adjusted EPS exceeded our guidance range; Sam's Club comps were strong at 2.8%; and in international, 10 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales. So overall, we're moving in the right direction, the productivity loop is starting to turn, and I'm encouraged by our results.
I'll discuss more details from our third quarter in a minute, but I'd like to start by thanking everyone, who came to Bentonville for our Investment Community Meeting in October. We hope that you gained a clear perspective of our strategy to make every day easier for busy families. We have a plan that plays to our unique strengths. We're acting faster and being disciplined about costs and capital. Curiosity, creativity, decisiveness and speed are priorities. There's a lot of innovation today in the business, and we enjoyed sharing some of the initiatives with you. We've expanded online grocery pickup, launched Mobile Express Returns, and we're testing automated pickup towers and same-day grocery delivery. We're also learning how to automate some routine functions in our stores, like scanning for shelf level out of stocks and modular accuracy. We're leveraging our unique assets and financial strength to better serve customers and accelerate growth.
When we were together last month, we outlined 4 priorities: make everyday easier for busy families; change how we work; deliver results and operate with discipline; and be the most trusted retailer.
By executing on all these strategic priorities, we're confident that our customers and shareholders will benefit. The importance of that fourth priority, being the most trusted retailer, was certainly amplified over the past 3 months. We saw a significant destruction through hurricanes and wildfires in the U.S. and the earthquake in Mexico. I'm so proud of the commitment our associates showed to the communities we serve. During these difficult times, our customers needed us more than ever, and associates responded to each crisis in remarkable fashion. We're proud that as a company we committed over $38 million to disaster relief this year, and that our customers have donated over $43 million, bringing the total to more than $80 million to date.
As you know, Puerto Rico experienced widespread devastation and with the ongoing recovery, we'll continue to partner with government officials, relief organizations and others there on the island to support the rebuilding efforts. We'd also encourage each of you to get involved by financially supporting the Puerto Rico recovery efforts at give.miamifoundation.org/Walmart.
Now let's move back to our third quarter results and briefly discuss each area of the business. Brett will provide more details on the financials shortly. Let me start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 2.7% and comp traffic growth of 1.5%. While we recognize that there are some incremental hurricane-related sales in these numbers, our core business is performing well. Greg Foran and the team continue to improve our U.S. stores. Across almost all categories, we're seeing growth. The food business, in particular, has accelerated and delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in almost 6 years with our fresh meat, bakery and produce teams leading the way. Expense leverage has also been a priority, and we're pleased that the segment leveraged expenses in the third quarter.
It's important to note that we've accomplished this while maintaining high in-stock and service levels for customers. Our associates are using technology and apps for inventory management and price changes that help make their jobs easier and increase productivity in the stores. Store leverage is helping to allow our strategic investments in eCommerce to continue. It's also exciting to see how we're removing friction from the customer experience with express pharmacy, an easier money services process and by expanding pickup options with our automated towers and Online Grocery. We now have Online Grocery in more than 1,100 stores and are looking forward to expanding this popular offering to another 1,000 locations next year.
Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales were up 50% this quarter, with the majority of the increase through walmart.com. Existing customers have become advocates for popular initiatives like Online Grocery and Free 2-Day Shipping. And as a result, new customers, suppliers and partnerships are coming to Walmart. The expanded assortment on walmart.com has also contributed to growth. Over the past year, we've tripled the number of items on walmart.com to reach more than 70 million SKUs today. As you heard last month, Marc's team is making progress on hiring additional category specialists, focused on improving the customer experience and our positioning with the top $1 million in eCommerce items. The recent agreement with Lord & Taylor is a great example of how we will be creating specialty experiences that complement what we offer and serve customers with the brands they want. We're making good progress attracting premium brands to the site, such as KitchenAid and Bose.
We're continuing to expand our tests of same-day delivery and next day delivery, including our tests with August Home, and the use of crowd-sourced partners for grocery and our own associates. The acquisition of Parcel brings us the ability to deliver items in New York and other major metropolitan areas on the same or next day.
At Jet.com, we continue to position the business to focus on higher-income urban customers. We launched the Uniquely J private brand and also began selling ModCloth items on Jet this quarter. In addition, we've started to attract more premium brands to the site, and we expect this to continue.
Staying in the U.S., let's talk about Sam's Club. Sam's Club delivered comp sales growth without fuel of 2.8% in the quarter. We're especially pleased with the improvement in member traffic, which was up 3.6%, including some hurricane-related benefits. We're focusing the business to accelerate growth, narrowing the target member and taking steps to become more special to that member. As John Furner outlined last month, the target member is a larger family with a higher income, probably in the suburbs. They own their own home and a car or 2. They may own a small restaurant or buy for their office as well. By narrowing the focus on this member, we believe we can earn a greater share of their wallet. We're already making good progress in areas where we want to win, including fresh food and with our Member's Mark private brand. In addition, John and the team are using technology to make Sam's a better place to shop and work. I'm encouraged by what we're seeing at Sam's Club.
Outside of the U.S., the Walmart International team continued to deliver strong top line results with 10 of 11 markets posting positive comp sales. Walmex performed well again this quarter with comp sales growth of 7%. Last month, I visited stores in Mexico and was energized by how the team is improving each of our formats. Our stores and clubs are fun to shop. The team is also on their way towards a digital transformation. They're changing how they work and that will bear fruit in the future.
In Mexico, we're providing convenience through initiatives, like Online Grocery, and we recently launched an eCommerce marketplace, which expanded our general merchandise assortment by about 20%.
In Canada, customers are responding to the investments we've made in price, and this is contributing to market share gains in key traffic-driving categories. We continued to expand the number of locations where we offer Online Grocery pickup during the quarter and also launched an eCommerce marketplace, which doubled our online assortment and continues our focus on key categories, like home and apparel.
In China, we saw a solid net sales growth of 4%. The team continues to do a nice job of improving key categories, like fresh and consumables. We also further expanded the number of Walmart stores in China that offer grocery delivery in less than 1 hour, through the JD Daojia delivery platform to nearly 140 stores.
In the U.K., Asda delivered positive comp sales again this quarter. The improvements in store experience and price investments are increasing store basket sizes. We're excited to have Roger Burnley lead Asda into the future as CEO starting next year. Over the past year, Roger has been our COO and deputy CEO, and he has a long and distinguished retail career. I'd like to thank Sean Clarke for the tremendous work that he has done over the past year to stabilize the business and position it for growth. Sean has done a lot for our company living in 5 countries over his 21-year career with Walmart. Thank you, Sean.
So overall, the International segment continues to execute the strategy and deliver solid results.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our third quarter results. But I'm more excited about our strategic positioning as we enter the fourth quarter this year. We're stronger as a company. We have momentum. And we have more opportunities to leverage our unique assets to serve customers in ways that are easy, fast, friendly and fun.
Thanks for your interest in Walmart and on behalf of all of us here, have an enjoyable holiday season. Now I'll hand it over to Brett."

I want to begin by thanking everyone, who attended our investor meeting last month in Northwest Arkansas or listened via webcast.

I want to begin by thanking everyone, who attended our investor meeting last month in Northwest Arkansas or listened via webcast. We really enjoyed hosting the meeting as it gave us the opportunity to highlight our plan to win with customers and shareholders. Underlying this plan is our financial framework, which highlights focusing on delivering strong, efficient growth, being disciplined in how we operate and allocating capital strategically.
We expect top line growth going forward to be led more by comp sales and eCommerce, with less emphasis on new units in the U.S. We have good sales momentum and cost transformation is gaining traction. This gives us confidence in our ability to operate with discipline and leverage expenses. In terms of capital allocation, we're prioritizing eCommerce, technology, supply chain and store remodels over new stores and clubs, which we believe will contribute to long-term value creation for shareholders. We're excited about the future of Walmart.
Before I move on, let me highlight 3 items that negatively impacted GAAP EPS in the quarter. First, there was a $0.29 charge related to the premiums paid for bonds tendered, which allowed us to retire higher rate debt reducing interest expense in future periods. Additionally, discussions with the government agencies in the FCPA matter have progressed to the point that the company recorded an accrual of $283 million or $0.09 per share. In Walmart International, the decision to exit certain properties in one of our markets led to an impairment charge of $0.04 per share.
Now let's turn to our third quarter results. Consolidated net sales increased 3.8% in constant currency, driven by comp sales growth across the company, and adjusted EPS was $1, which is above the high end of our guidance range.
I'm especially pleased with our progress on expenses. Excluding the charge for the FCPA accrual, we leveraged expenses as a company in the quarter. The leverage and adjusted EPS is even more encouraging given the hurricane-related costs in the quarter.
Overall, our results were strong. However, results were positively impacted by currency translation in the quarter. Sales and operating income benefited by approximately $450 million and $60 million, respectively.
Gross profit margin declined 29 basis points during the quarter. Price investments in certain markets and the mix effects of our growing eCommerce business were the primary contributors to the decline, although the impact from hurricanes in the U.S. was a significant contributor as well. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes more details on gross margins for each segment.
Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the first 9 months were solid at $17.1 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively. Compared with last year, the decrease in free cash flow is due to timing of payments, an increase in incentive payments as well as lapping last year's improvements in working capital management.
In terms of capital allocation, we completed remodels of 342 stores globally. And in the U.S., we further expanded our Online Grocery service to include more than 1,100 locations. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2017, consolidated return on investment decreased 30 basis points due primarily to reduced operating income.
Let's move on to eCommerce. As a reminder, eCommerce results include all web-initiated transactions, including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship to Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.
Walmart U.S. eCommerce continued its strong performance with net sales growth of 50%. We began to lap the acquisition of Jet.com mid-quarter, which impacted our overall growth. Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, once again led the way and was responsible for the majority of the growth in the period. Throughout this year, we've talked a lot about the speed at which we're moving, and we continued that progress in the third quarter. For example, we launched new partnerships with Google and August Home. These are capital-light initiatives that expand convenience for customers by enabling hands free voice shopping and unattended delivery in the home. We also acquired Parcel, a technology-based, same-day, last-mile delivery company focused on customers in New York City.
Let's move on to operating segment details. Walmart U.S. had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 2.7%, led by a traffic increase of 1.5%. While difficult to quantify precisely, we estimate hurricane-related impacts benefited comps by 30 to 50 basis points. On a 2-year stacked basis, comp sales were up 3.9% and comp traffic increased 2.2%. This is the strongest quarterly and 2-year stacked comp performance in more than 8 years. The food business continued to accelerate with sales, traffic and unit growth across categories. In fact, food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in almost 6 years. Market inflation was around or slightly less than what we saw in the second quarter. All formats had positive comps and eCommerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment.
Gross margin rate declined 36 basis points in the quarter. The margin rate decreased in part due to the continued execution of our price investment strategy and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. In addition, we estimate that hurricane-related impacts were about 1/3 of the overall decline.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points with stores leveraging at a higher level than that. The U.S. team has made great progress, while maintaining high customer service levels, as associates are more efficient with improved technology, training and processes. 
The combination of strong sales and greater operating discipline led to operating income increasing 0.8% in the quarter. Recent hurricanes benefited top line results, but negatively impacted gross margins and SG&A. We estimate the net result was a negative impact to segment income of approximately $150 million.
Our stores continued to do an excellent job of managing inventory, while maintaining high in-stock levels. Inventory at comp stores was down 3.5% in the quarter.
Overall, we're pleased with the execution and momentum. The fourth quarter is underway, and we are offering easy access to great products at excellent value heading into this holiday season, both in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending January 26, 2018, we except comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2% on a more difficult comparison.
Now let's move on to Walmart International. We continue to experience broad-based momentum across the business and deliver strong top line results. During the quarter, 10 of 11 markets delivered positive comp sales. We're focused on driving growth across our markets through our fresh offering, private brands and Online Grocery expansion.
Net sales on a constant-currency basis increased 2.5%. On a reported basis, net sales increased 4.1%, which includes a benefit of approximately $450 million from currency. Additionally, it's important to note the impacts from the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of nearly $560 million when compared to last year. While our solid sales performance was fairly broad based, we are particularly pleased with the results in Mexico and China, as well as with the improved results in the U.K.
Operating income declined 12.2% in constant currency and 7.8% or $105 million on a reported basis. The decline is attributable to 2 items; an impairment charge of approximately $150 million due to our decision to exit certain properties in one of our markets and lapping last year's gain of $86 million from the sale of several shopping malls in Chile. Without these items, operating income would have increased year-on-year.
Let's now turn to highlights from key markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. Let's begin with Walmex, where sales momentum continued across all countries and regions. Net sales increased 9.2%, excluding Suburbia, and comp sales increased 7%.
In Mexico, comp sales increased 14.5% on a 2-year stacked basis. All divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service and our strongest performance came from food and staples.
In Canada, net sales increased 1.9% and comp sales increased 1%. We further improved our price position, which contributed to market share gains in key traffic-driving categories, such as food and consumables. The team reduced overall inventory levels even as sales increased.
Turning to the U.K., net sales increased 3.6% and comp sales increased 1.1%, as customers are responding to investments in the value proposition. In-store service metrics have improved, and our performance has strengthened across private brands and Online Grocery offerings. While the business has improved, we still have more work to do.
In China, net sales increased 4% and comp sales increased 2.5%, which is the best comp result in about 4 years. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by strong seasonal categories during the Mid-Autumn Festival as well as strength across key categories, such as fresh and consumables.
From an eCommerce standpoint, we continued to grow our partnership with JD.com. During the quarter, we launched the Walmart-JD Omni-Channel Shopping Festival, expanded our 1-hour grocery delivery service to additional locations and focused on initiatives related to inventory management and logistics efficiencies. Overall, it was another solid quarter for Walmart International.
Moving on to Sam's Club. Comp sales without fuel increased 2.8% with strong traffic growth of 3.6%. We estimate that hurricane-related impacts benefited comps by approximately 70 to 90 basis points, but negatively impacted gross margins and SG&A. We estimate the net result was a negative impact to segment income of approximately $20 million.
The focus at Sam's is on people, product and digital. From a product standpoint, we're making good progress in fresh and with our private label brand, Member's Mark. During the quarter, fresh categories, including meat, produce and bakery all performed well. This is an important traffic driver for our clubs, and I'm pleased with the results we're delivering. Member's Mark is a trusted and growing brand, and we recently increased its penetration across multiple categories. More than ever, we're leveraging this brand to highlight value on items found exclusively at Sam's Club. Efforts to simplify the business are paying off, and we are becoming more productive. The team leveraged expenses in the period and operating income, excluding fuel, increased 4.2%. This was a really solid quarter for Sam's Club. For the 13-week period ending January 26, 2018, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%.
Let me close today with guidance. We have good momentum in the business, and we are executing within our financial framework. We expect a solid performance for the important holiday season, and we are raising expectations for full year adjusted EPS to a range of $4.38 to $4.46. This compares to previous adjusted EPS guidance of $4.30 to $4.40 for the full year.
In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our associates for the work you do every day in serving our customers and communities around the world.

When we were together last month, we outlined 4 priorities: make every day easier for busy families; change how we work; deliver results and operate with discipline; and be the most trusted retailer.
By executing on all these strategic priorities, we're confident that our customers and shareholders will benefit. The importance of that fourth priority, being the most trusted retailer, was certainly amplified over the past 3 months. We saw significant destruction through hurricanes and wildfires in the U.S. and the earthquake in Mexico. I'm so proud of the commitment our associates showed to the communities we serve. During these difficult times, our customers needed us more than ever, and associates responded to each crisis in remarkable fashion. We're proud that as a company we committed over $38 million to disaster relief this year, and that our customers have donated over $43 million, bringing the total to more than $80 million to date.
As you know, Puerto Rico experienced widespread devastation and with the ongoing recovery, we'll continue to partner with government officials, relief organizations and others there on the island to support the rebuilding efforts. We'd also encourage each of you to get involved by financially supporting the Puerto Rico recovery efforts at give.miamifoundation.org/Walmart.
Now let's move back to our third quarter results and briefly discuss each area of the business. Brett will provide more details on the financials shortly. Let me start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 2.7% and comp traffic growth of 1.5%. While we recognize that there are some incremental hurricane-related sales in these numbers, our core business is performing well. Greg Foran and the team continue to improve our U.S. stores. Across almost all categories, we're seeing growth. The food business, in particular, has accelerated and delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in almost 6 years with our fresh meat, bakery and produce teams leading the way. Expense leverage has also been a priority, and we're pleased that the segment leveraged expenses in the third quarter.
It's important to note that we've accomplished this while maintaining high in-stock and service levels for customers. Our associates are using technology and apps for inventory management and price changes that help make their jobs easier and increase productivity in the stores. Store leverage is helping to allow our strategic investments in eCommerce to continue. It's also exciting to see how we're removing friction from the customer experience with express pharmacy, an easier money services process and by expanding pickup options with our automated towers and Online Grocery. We now have Online Grocery in more than 1,100 stores and are looking forward to expanding this popular offering to another 1,000 locations next year.
Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales were up 50% this quarter, with the majority of the increase through walmart.com. Existing customers have become advocates for popular initiatives like Online Grocery and Free 2-Day Shipping. And as a result, new customers, suppliers and partnerships are coming to Walmart. The expanded assortment on walmart.com has also contributed to growth. Over the past year, we've tripled the number of items on walmart.com to reach more than 70 million SKUs today. As you heard last month, Marc's team is making progress on hiring additional category specialists, focused on improving the customer experience and our positioning with the top 1 million eCommerce items. The recent agreement with Lord & Taylor is a great example of how we will be creating specialty experiences that complement what we offer and serve customers with the brands they want. We're making good progress attracting premium brands to the site, such as KitchenAid and Bose.
We're continuing to expand our tests of same-day delivery and next day delivery, including our tests with August Home, and the use of crowd-sourced partners for grocery and our own associates. The acquisition of Parcel brings us the ability to deliver items in New York and other major metropolitan areas on the same or next day.
At Jet.com, we continue to position the business to focus on higher-income urban customers. We launched the Uniquely J private brand and also began selling ModCloth items on Jet this quarter. In addition, we've started to attract more premium brands to the site, and we expect this to continue.
Staying in the U.S., let's talk about Sam's Club. Sam's Club delivered comp sales growth without fuel of 2.8% in the quarter. We're especially pleased with the improvement in member traffic, which was up 3.6%, including some hurricane-related benefits. We're focusing the business to accelerate growth, narrowing the target member and taking steps to become more special to that member. As John Furner outlined last month, the target member is a larger family with a higher income, probably in the suburbs. They own their own home and a car or 2. They may own a small restaurant or buy for their office as well. By narrowing the focus on this member, we believe we can earn a greater share of their wallet. We're already making good progress in areas where we want to win, including fresh food and with our Member's Mark private brand. In addition, John and the team are using technology to make Sam's a better place to shop and work. I'm encouraged by what we're seeing at Sam's Club.
Outside the U.S., the Walmart International team continued to deliver strong top line results with 10 of 11 markets posting positive comp sales. Walmex performed well again this quarter with comp sales growth of 7%. Last month, I visited stores in Mexico and was energized by how the team is improving each of our formats. Our stores and clubs are fun to shop. The team is also on their way towards a digital transformation. They're changing how they work and that will bear fruit in the future.
In Mexico, we're providing convenience through initiatives, like Online Grocery, and we recently launched an eCommerce marketplace, which expanded our general merchandise assortment by about 20%.
In Canada, customers are responding to the investments we've made in price, and this is contributing to market share gains in key traffic-driving categories. We continued to expand the number of locations where we offer Online Grocery pickup during the quarter and also launched an eCommerce marketplace, which doubled our online assortment and continues our focus on key categories, like home and apparel.
In China, we saw a solid net sales growth of 4%. The team continues to do a nice job of improving key categories, like fresh and consumables. We also further expanded the number of Walmart stores in China that offer grocery delivery in less than 1 hour, through the JD Daojia delivery platform to nearly 140 stores.
In the U.K., Asda delivered positive comp sales again this quarter. The improvements in store experience and price investments are increasing store basket sizes. We're excited to have Roger Burnley lead Asda into the future as CEO starting next year. Over the past year, Roger has been our COO and deputy CEO, and he has a long and distinguished retail career. I'd like to thank Sean Clarke for the tremendous work that he has done over the past year to stabilize the business and position it for growth. Sean has done a lot for our company living in 5 countries over his 21-year career with Walmart. Thank you, Sean.
So overall, the International segment continues to execute the strategy and deliver solid results.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our third quarter results. But I'm more excited about our strategic positioning as we enter the fourth quarter this year. We're stronger as a company. We have momentum. And we have more opportunities to leverage our unique assets to serve customers in ways that are easy, fast, friendly and fun.
Thanks for your interest in Walmart and on behalf of all of us here, have an enjoyable holiday season. Now I'll hand it over to Brett."
313055,540077200,1349724,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Q3 2018 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2017",2017-11-16,"Earnings Calls","Walmart Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. I want to begin by thanking everyone, who attended our investor meeting last month in Northwest Arkansas or listened via webcast. We really enjoyed hosting the meeting as it gave us the opportunity to highlight our plan to win with",1827,"Good morning, everyone. I want to begin by thanking everyone, who attended our investor meeting last month in Northwest Arkansas or listened via webcast. We really enjoyed hosting the meeting as it gave us the opportunity to highlight our plan to win with customers and shareholders. Underlying this plan is our financial framework, which highlights focusing on delivering strong, efficient growth, being disciplined in how we operate and allocating capital strategically.
We expect top line growth going forward to be led more by comp sales and eCommerce, with less emphasis on new units in the U.S. We have good sales momentum and cost transformation is gaining traction. This gives us confidence in our ability to operate with discipline and leverage expenses. In terms of capital allocation, we're prioritizing eCommerce, technology, supply chain and store remodels over new stores and clubs, which we believe will contribute to long-term value creation for shareholders. We're excited about the future of Walmart.
Before I move on, let me highlight 3 items that negatively impacted GAAP EPS in the quarter. First, there was a $0.29 charge related to the premiums paid for bonds tendered, which allowed us to retire higher rate debt reducing interest expense in future periods. Additionally, discussions with the government agencies in the FCPA matter have progressed to the point that the company recorded an accrual of $283 million or $0.09 per share. In Walmart International, the decision to exit certain properties in one of our markets led to an impairment charge of $0.04 per share.
Now let's turn to our third quarter results. Consolidated net sales increased 3.8% in constant currency, driven by comp sales growth across the company, and adjusted EPS was $1, which is above the high end of our guidance range.
I'm especially pleased with our progress on expenses. Excluding the charge for the FCPA accrual, we leveraged expenses as a company in the quarter. The leverage and adjusted EPS is even more encouraging given the hurricane-related costs in the quarter.
Overall, our results were strong. However, results were positively impacted by currency translation in the quarter. Sales and operating income benefited by approximately $450 million and $60 million, respectively.
Gross profit margin declined 29 basis points during the quarter. Price investments in certain markets and the mix effects of our growing eCommerce business were the primary contributors to the decline, although the impact from hurricanes in the U.S. was a significant contributor as well. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes more details on gross margins for each segment.
Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the first 9 months were solid at $17.1 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively. Compared with last year, the decrease in free cash flow is due to timing of payments, an increase in incentive payments as well as lapping last year's improvements in working capital management.
In terms of capital allocation, we completed remodels of 342 stores globally. And in the U.S., we further expanded our Online Grocery service to include more than 1,100 locations. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2017, consolidated return on investment decreased 30 basis points due primarily to reduced operating income.
Let's move on to eCommerce. As a reminder, eCommerce results include all web-initiated transactions, including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship to Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.
Walmart U.S. eCommerce continued its strong performance with net sales growth of 50%. We began to lap the acquisition of Jet.com mid-quarter, which impacted our overall growth. Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, once again led the way and was responsible for the majority of the growth in the period. Throughout this year, we've talked a lot about the speed at which we're moving, and we continued that progress in the third quarter. For example, we launched new partnerships with Google and August Home. These are capital-light initiatives that expand convenience for customers by enabling hands free voice shopping and unattended delivery in the home. We also acquired Parcel, a technology-based, same-day, last-mile delivery company focused on customers in New York City.
Let's move on to operating segment details. Walmart U.S. had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 2.7%, led by a traffic increase of 1.5%. While difficult to quantify precisely, we estimate hurricane-related impacts benefited comps by 30 to 50 basis points. On a 2-year stacked basis, comp sales were up 3.9% and comp traffic increased 2.2%. This is the strongest quarterly and 2-year stacked comp performance in more than 8 years. The food business continued to accelerate with sales, traffic and unit growth across categories. In fact, food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in almost 6 years. Market inflation was around or slightly less than what we saw in the second quarter. All formats had positive comps and eCommerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment.
Gross margin rate declined 36 basis points in the quarter. The margin rate decreased in part due to the continued execution of our price investment strategy and the mix effect from our growing eCommerce business. In addition, we estimate that hurricane-related impacts were about 1/3 of the overall decline.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points with stores leveraging at a higher level than that. The U.S. team has made great progress, while maintaining high customer service levels, as associates are more efficient with improved technology, training and processes. 
The combination of strong sales and greater operating discipline led to operating income increasing 0.8% in the quarter. Recent hurricanes benefited top line results, but negatively impacted gross margins and SG&A. We estimate the net result was a negative impact to segment income of approximately $150 million.
Our stores continued to do an excellent job of managing inventory, while maintaining high in-stock levels. Inventory at comp stores was down 3.5% in the quarter.
Overall, we're pleased with the execution and momentum. The fourth quarter is underway, and we are offering easy access to great products at excellent value heading into this holiday season, both in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending January 26, 2018, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2% on a more difficult comparison.
Now let's move on to Walmart International. We continue to experience broad-based momentum across the business and deliver strong top line results. During the quarter, 10 of 11 markets delivered positive comp sales. We're focused on driving growth across our markets through our fresh offering, private brands and Online Grocery expansion.
Net sales on a constant-currency basis increased 2.5%. On a reported basis, net sales increased 4.1%, which includes a benefit of approximately $450 million from currency. Additionally, it's important to note the impacts from the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of nearly $560 million when compared to last year. While our solid sales performance was fairly broad based, we are particularly pleased with the results in Mexico and China, as well as with the improved results in the U.K.
Operating income declined 12.2% in constant currency and 7.8% or $105 million on a reported basis. The decline is attributable to 2 items: an impairment charge of approximately $150 million due to our decision to exit certain properties in one of our markets and lapping last year's gain of $86 million from the sale of several shopping malls in Chile. Without these items, operating income would have increased year-on-year.
Let's now turn to highlights from key markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. Let's begin with Walmex, where sales momentum continued across all countries and regions. Net sales increased 9.2%, excluding Suburbia, and comp sales increased 7%.
In Mexico, comp sales increased 14.5% on a 2-year stacked basis. All divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service and our strongest performance came from food and staples.
In Canada, net sales increased 1.9% and comp sales increased 1%. We further improved our price position, which contributed to market share gains in key traffic-driving categories, such as food and consumables. The team reduced overall inventory levels even as sales increased.
Turning to the U.K., net sales increased 3.6% and comp sales increased 1.1%, as customers are responding to investments in the value proposition. In-store service metrics have improved, and our performance has strengthened across private brands and Online Grocery offerings. While the business has improved, we still have more work to do.
In China, net sales increased 4% and comp sales increased 2.5%, which is the best comp result in about 4 years. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by strong seasonal categories during the Mid-Autumn Festival as well as strength across key categories, such as fresh and consumables.
From an eCommerce standpoint, we continue to grow our partnership with JD.com. During the quarter, we launched the Walmart-JD Omni-Channel Shopping Festival, expanded our 1-hour grocery delivery service to additional locations and focused on initiatives related to inventory management and logistics efficiencies. Overall, it was another solid quarter for Walmart International.
Moving on to Sam's Club. Comp sales without fuel increased 2.8% with strong traffic growth of 3.6%. We estimate that hurricane-related impacts benefited comps by approximately 70 to 90 basis points, but negatively impacted gross margins and SG&A. We estimate the net result was a negative impact to segment income of approximately $20 million.
The focus at Sam's is on people, product and digital. From a product standpoint, we're making good progress in fresh and with our private label brand, Member's Mark. During the quarter, fresh categories, including meat, produce and bakery all performed well. This is an important traffic driver for our clubs, and I'm pleased with the results we're delivering. Member's Mark is a trusted and growing brand, and we recently increased its penetration across multiple categories. More than ever, we're leveraging this brand to highlight value on items found exclusively at Sam's Club. Efforts to simplify the business are paying off, and we are becoming more productive. The team leveraged expenses in the period and operating income, excluding fuel, increased 4.2%. This was a really solid quarter for Sam's Club. For the 13-week period ending January 26, 2018, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%.
Let me close today with guidance. We have good momentum in the business, and we are executing within our financial framework. We expect a solid performance for the important holiday season, and we are raising expectations for full year adjusted EPS to a range of $4.38 to $4.46. This compares to previous adjusted EPS guidance of $4.30 to $4.40 for the full year.
In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our associates for the work you do every day in serving our customers and communities around the world."

So overall, we're moving in the right direction, the productivity loop is starting to turn, and I'm encouraged by our results.
I'll discuss more details from our third quarter in a minute, but I'd like to start by thanking everyone, who came to Bentonville for our Investment Community Meeting in October. We hope that you gained a clear perspective of our strategy to make every day easier for busy families. We have a plan that plays to our unique strengths. We're acting faster and being disciplined about costs and capital. Curiosity, creativity, decisiveness and speed are priorities. There's a lot of innovation today in the business, and we enjoyed sharing some of the initiatives with you. We've expanded online grocery pickup, launched Mobile Express Returns, and we're testing automated pickup towers and same-day grocery delivery. We're also learning how to automate some routine functions in our stores, like scanning for shelf level out of stocks and modular accuracy. We're leveraging our unique assets and financial strength to better serve customers and accelerate growth.
When we were together last month, we outlined 4 priorities: make every day easier for busy families; change how we work; deliver results and operate with discipline; and be the most trusted retailer.
By executing on all these strategic priorities, we're confident that our customers and shareholders will benefit. The importance of that fourth priority, being the most trusted retailer, was certainly amplified over the past 3 months. We saw significant destruction through hurricanes and wildfires in the U.S. and the earthquake in Mexico. I'm so proud of the commitment our associates showed to the communities we serve. During these difficult times, our customers needed us more than ever, and associates responded to each crisis in remarkable fashion. We're proud that as a company we committed over $38 million to disaster relief this year, and that our customers have donated over $43 million, bringing the total to more than $80 million to date.
As you know, Puerto Rico experienced widespread devastation and with the ongoing recovery, we'll continue to partner with government officials, relief organizations and others there on the island to support the rebuilding efforts. We'd also encourage each of you to get involved by financially supporting the Puerto Rico recovery efforts at give.miamifoundation.org/Walmart.
Now let's move back to our third quarter results and briefly discuss each area of the business. Brett will provide more details on the financials shortly. Let me start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 2.7% and comp traffic growth of 1.5%. While we recognize that there are some incremental hurricane-related sales in these numbers, our core business is performing well. Greg Foran and the team continue to improve our U.S. stores. Across almost all categories, we're seeing growth. The food business, in particular, has accelerated and delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in almost 6 years with our fresh meat, bakery and produce teams leading the way. Expense leverage has also been a priority, and we're pleased that the segment leveraged expenses in the third quarter.
It's important to note that we've accomplished this while maintaining high in-stock and service levels for customers. Our associates are using technology and apps for inventory management and price changes that help make their jobs easier and increase productivity in the stores. Store leverage is helping to allow our strategic investments in eCommerce to continue. It's also exciting to see how we're removing friction from the customer experience with express pharmacy, an easier money services process and by expanding pickup options with our automated towers and Online Grocery. We now have Online Grocery in more than 1,100 stores and are looking forward to expanding this popular offering to another 1,000 locations next year.
Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales were up 50% this quarter, with the majority of the increase through walmart.com. Existing customers have become advocates for popular initiatives like Online Grocery and Free 2-Day Shipping. And as a result, new customers, suppliers and partnerships are coming to Walmart. The expanded assortment on walmart.com has also contributed to growth. Over the past year, we've tripled the number of items on walmart.com to reach more than 70 million SKUs today. As you heard last month, Marc's team is making progress on hiring additional category specialists, focused on improving the customer experience and our positioning with the top 1 million eCommerce items. The recent agreement with Lord & Taylor is a great example of how we will be creating specialty experiences that complement what we offer and serve customers with the brands they want. We're making good progress attracting premium brands to the site, such as KitchenAid and Bose.
We're continuing to expand our tests of same-day delivery and next day delivery, including our tests with August Home, and the use of crowd-sourced partners for grocery and our own associates. The acquisition of Parcel brings us the ability to deliver items in New York and other major metropolitan areas on the same or next day.
At Jet.com, we continue to position the business to focus on higher-income urban customers. We launched the Uniquely J private brand and also began selling ModCloth items on Jet this quarter. In addition, we've started to attract more premium brands to the site, and we expect this to continue.
Staying in the U.S., let's talk about Sam's Club. Sam's Club delivered comp sales growth without fuel of 2.8% in the quarter. We're especially pleased with the improvement in member traffic, which was up 3.6%, including some hurricane-related benefits. We're focusing the business to accelerate growth, narrowing the target member and taking steps to become more special to that member. As John Furner outlined last month, the target member is a larger family with a higher income, probably in the suburbs. They own their own home and a car or 2. They may own a small restaurant or buy for their office as well. By narrowing the focus on this member, we believe we can earn a greater share of their wallet. We're already making good progress in areas where we want to win, including fresh food and with our Member's Mark private brand. In addition, John and the team are using technology to make Sam's a better place to shop and work. I'm encouraged by what we're seeing at Sam's Club.
Outside the U.S., the Walmart International team continued to deliver strong top line results with 10 of 11 markets posting positive comp sales. Walmex performed well again this quarter with comp sales growth of 7%. Last month, I visited stores in Mexico and was energized by how the team is improving each of our formats. Our stores and clubs are fun to shop. The team is also on their way towards a digital transformation. They're changing how they work and that will bear fruit in the future.
In Mexico, we're providing convenience through initiatives, like Online Grocery, and we recently launched an eCommerce marketplace, which expanded our general merchandise assortment by about 20%.
In Canada, customers are responding to the investments we've made in price, and this is contributing to market share gains in key traffic-driving categories. We continued to expand the number of locations where we offer Online Grocery pickup during the quarter and also launched an eCommerce marketplace, which doubled our online assortment and continues our focus on key categories, like home and apparel.
In China, we saw a solid net sales growth of 4%. The team continues to do a nice job of improving key categories, like fresh and consumables. We also further expanded the number of Walmart stores in China that offer grocery delivery in less than 1 hour, through the JD Daojia delivery platform to nearly 140 stores.
In the U.K., Asda delivered positive comp sales again this quarter. The improvements in store experience and price investments are increasing store basket sizes. We're excited to have Roger Burnley lead Asda into the future as CEO starting next year. Over the past year, Roger has been our COO and deputy CEO, and he has a long and distinguished retail career. I'd like to thank Sean Clarke for the tremendous work that he has done over the past year to stabilize the business and position it for growth. Sean has done a lot for our company living in 5 countries over his 21-year career with Walmart. Thank you, Sean.
So overall, the International segment continues to execute the strategy and deliver solid results.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our third quarter results. But I'm more excited about our strategic positioning as we enter the fourth quarter this year. We're stronger as a company. We have momentum. And we have more opportunities to leverage our unique assets to serve customers in ways that are easy, fast, friendly and fun.
Thanks for your interest in Walmart and on behalf of all of us here, have an enjoyable holiday season. Now I'll hand it over to Brett."

I want to begin by thanking everyone, who attended our investor meeting last month in Northwest Arkansas or listened via webcast. We really enjoyed hosting the meeting as it gave us the opportunity to highlight our plan to win with customers and shareholders. Underlying this plan is our financial framework, which highlights focusing on delivering strong, efficient growth, being disciplined in how we operate and allocating capital strategically.
We expect top line growth going forward to be led more by comp sales and eCommerce, with less emphasis on new units in the U.S. We have good sales momentum and cost transformation is gaining traction. This gives us confidence in our ability to operate with discipline and leverage expenses. In terms of capital allocation, we're prioritizing eCommerce, technology, supply chain and store remodels over new stores and clubs, which we believe will contribute to long-term value creation for shareholders. We're excited about the future of Walmart.
Before I move on, let me highlight 3 items that negatively impacted GAAP EPS in the quarter. First, there was a $0.29 charge related to the premiums paid for bonds tendered, which allowed us to retire higher rate debt reducing interest expense in future periods. Additionally, discussions with the government agencies in the FCPA matter have progressed to the point that the company recorded an accrual of $283 million or $0.09 per share. In Walmart International, the decision to exit certain properties in one of our markets led to an impairment charge of $0.04 per share.
Now let's turn to our third quarter results. Consolidated net sales increased 3.8% in constant currency, driven by comp sales growth across the company, and adjusted EPS was $1, which is above the high end of our guidance range.
I'm especially pleased with our progress on expenses. Excluding the charge for the FCPA accrual, we leveraged expenses as a company in the quarter. The leverage and adjusted EPS is even more encouraging given the hurricane-related costs in the quarter.
Overall, our results were strong. However, results were positively impacted by currency translation in the quarter. Sales and operating income benefited by approximately $450 million and $60 million, respectively.
Gross profit margin declined 29 basis points during the quarter. Price investments in certain markets and the mix effects of our growing eCommerce business were the primary contributors to the decline, although the impact from hurricanes in the U.S. was a significant contributor as well. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes more details on gross margins for each segment.
Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the first 9 months were solid at $17.1 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively. Compared with last year, the decrease in free cash flow is due to timing of payments, an increase in incentive payments as well as lapping last year's improvements in working capital management.
In terms of capital allocation, we completed remodels of 342 stores globally. And in the U.S., we further expanded our Online Grocery service to include more than 1,100 locations. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2017, consolidated return on investment decreased 30 basis points due primarily to reduced operating income.
Let's move on to eCommerce. As a reminder, eCommerce results include all web-initiated transactions, including those through walmart.com, such as Ship to Home, Ship to Store, Pick Up Today and Online Grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.
Walmart U.S. eCommerce continued its strong performance with net sales growth of 50%. We began to lap the acquisition of Jet.com mid-quarter, which impacted our overall growth. Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, once again led the way and was responsible for the majority of the growth in the period. Throughout this year, we've talked a lot about the speed at which we're moving, and we continued that progress in the third quarter. For example, we launched new partnerships with Google and August Home. These are capital-light initiatives that expand convenience for customers by enabling hands free voice shopping and unattended delivery in the home. We also acquired Parcel, a technology-based, same-day, last-mile delivery company focused on customers in New York City.
Let's move on to operating segment details. Walmart U.S. had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 2.7%, led by a traffic increase of 1.5%. While difficult to quantify precisely, we estimate hurricane-related impacts benefited comps by 30 to 50 basis points. On a 2-year stacked basis, comp sales were up 3.9% and comp traffic increased 2.2%. This is the strongest quarterly and 2-year stacked comp performance in more than 8 years. The food business continued to accelerate with sales, traffic and unit growth across categories. In fact, food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in almost 6 years. Market inflation was around or slightly less than what we saw in the second quarter. All formats had positive comps and eCommerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment.
Gross margin rate declined 36 basis points in the quarter. The margin rate decreased in part due to the continued execution of our price investment strategy and the mix effect from our growing eCommerce business. In addition, we estimate that hurricane-related impacts were about 1/3 of the overall decline.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points with stores leveraging at a higher level than that. The U.S. team has made great progress, while maintaining high customer service levels, as associates are more efficient with improved technology, training and processes. 
The combination of strong sales and greater operating discipline led to operating income increasing 0.8% in the quarter. Recent hurricanes benefited top line results, but negatively impacted gross margins and SG&A. We estimate the net result was a negative impact to segment income of approximately $150 million.
Our stores continued to do an excellent job of managing inventory, while maintaining high in-stock levels. Inventory at comp stores was down 3.5% in the quarter.
Overall, we're pleased with the execution and momentum. The fourth quarter is underway, and we are offering easy access to great products at excellent value heading into this holiday season, both in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending January 26, 2018, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2% on a more difficult comparison.
Now let's move on to Walmart International. We continue to experience broad-based momentum across the business and deliver strong top line results. During the quarter, 10 of 11 markets delivered positive comp sales. We're focused on driving growth across our markets through our fresh offering, private brands and Online Grocery expansion.
Net sales on a constant-currency basis increased 2.5%. On a reported basis, net sales increased 4.1%, which includes a benefit of approximately $450 million from currency. Additionally, it's important to note the impacts from the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of nearly $560 million when compared to last year. While our solid sales performance was fairly broad based, we are particularly pleased with the results in Mexico and China, as well as with the improved results in the U.K.
Operating income declined 12.2% in constant currency and 7.8% or $105 million on a reported basis. The decline is attributable to 2 items: an impairment charge of approximately $150 million due to our decision to exit certain properties in one of our markets and lapping last year's gain of $86 million from the sale of several shopping malls in Chile. Without these items, operating income would have increased year-on-year.
Let's now turn to highlights from key markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis. Let's begin with Walmex, where sales momentum continued across all countries and regions. Net sales increased 9.2%, excluding Suburbia, and comp sales increased 7%.
In Mexico, comp sales increased 14.5% on a 2-year stacked basis. All divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service and our strongest performance came from food and staples.
In Canada, net sales increased 1.9% and comp sales increased 1%. We further improved our price position, which contributed to market share gains in key traffic-driving categories, such as food and consumables. The team reduced overall inventory levels even as sales increased.
Turning to the U.K., net sales increased 3.6% and comp sales increased 1.1%, as customers are responding to investments in the value proposition. In-store service metrics have improved, and our performance has strengthened across private brands and Online Grocery offerings. While the business has improved, we still have more work to do.
In China, net sales increased 4% and comp sales increased 2.5%, which is the best comp result in about 4 years. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by strong seasonal categories during the Mid-Autumn Festival as well as strength across key categories, such as fresh and consumables.
From an eCommerce standpoint, we continue to grow our partnership with JD.com. During the quarter, we launched the Walmart-JD Omni-Channel Shopping Festival, expanded our 1-hour grocery delivery service to additional locations and focused on initiatives related to inventory management and logistics efficiencies. Overall, it was another solid quarter for Walmart International.
Moving on to Sam's Club. Comp sales without fuel increased 2.8% with strong traffic growth of 3.6%. We estimate that hurricane-related impacts benefited comps by approximately 70 to 90 basis points, but negatively impacted gross margins and SG&A. We estimate the net result was a negative impact to segment income of approximately $20 million.
The focus at Sam's is on people, product and digital. From a product standpoint, we're making good progress in fresh and with our private label brand, Member's Mark. During the quarter, fresh categories, including meat, produce and bakery all performed well. This is an important traffic driver for our clubs, and I'm pleased with the results we're delivering. Member's Mark is a trusted and growing brand, and we recently increased its penetration across multiple categories. More than ever, we're leveraging this brand to highlight value on items found exclusively at Sam's Club. Efforts to simplify the business are paying off, and we are becoming more productive. The team leveraged expenses in the period and operating income, excluding fuel, increased 4.2%. This was a really solid quarter for Sam's Club. For the 13-week period ending January 26, 2018, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%.
Let me close today with guidance. We have good momentum in the business, and we are executing within our financial framework. We expect a solid performance for the important holiday season, and we are raising expectations for full year adjusted EPS to a range of $4.38 to $4.46. This compares to previous adjusted EPS guidance of $4.30 to $4.40 for the full year.
In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our associates for the work you do every day in serving our customers and communities around the world."
