I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, President and Chief Operating Officer; Pierre Courduroux, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Robb Fraley, our Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. 
Also joining me from the Investor Relations team are Priyal Patel and Ben Kampelman.
Today, we will provide our annual R&D pipeline update on this call, as led by Dr. Fraley, as well as an overview of our first quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.
We've provided you today with EPS and other measures on both the GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary -- may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First, let me review our first quarter results as shown on Slide 4. As shown in our reconciliations, we delivered as-reported earnings per share of $0.07 in the first quarter, which included $0.19 of pending Bayer-related transaction costs. 
On an ongoing basis, earnings per share were $0.21 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, well above the prior year ongoing loss of $0.11, driven by the expected strong start to our business in South America and improved currency. 
With that brief overview, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

As we move in the second quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to remain focused on 2 things: continuing to deliver on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones and working closely wi",967,"Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. As we move in the second quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to remain focused on 2 things: continuing to deliver on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones and working closely with Bayer on the necessary steps to close the deal, which is targeted for the end of calendar year 2017.
Let's begin with an update on the deal, which is shown on Slide 5. First, we're pleased to see the strong shareowner support for the proposal to combine with Bayer, with approximately 99% of the votes cast in support of the combination. 
With the vote behind us, our team is working with Bayer on the required regulatory filings and continued key stakeholder outreach. The Hart-Scott-Rodino filings have been made in the U.S. along with several filings in other jurisdictions, and we anticipate submission of the required filing in the EU in the first calendar quarter of this year. 
We continue to expect the transaction to close by the end of 2017, and our confidence stems from the fact that these are 2 different but highly complementary businesses with limited overlap. If [ph] those overlaps do exist, however, Bayer anticipates and is committed to undertake a certain level of divestitures as required by the regulatory agencies. 
Also, both Robb and I have been personally involved in extensive grower outreach as well as discussions with key policymakers and politicians, sharing our views on the innovation enhancements that we envision from this combination. Innovation is the foundation of the industrial logic for the combination with Bayer just as it was with the consolidation that we led in the industry back in the late '90s. An innovation creates jobs, and it creates opportunities for both consumers and for our growers. This deal takes what we've been doing for the last 15 years to a whole new level, with St. Louis as the heartland for seeds and biotech research for the new company worldwide. 
15 years ago, we were spending roughly $550 million a year in R&D. This year, we'll spend approximately $1.5 billion in R&D, and we look forward to the combined levels of R&D that we anticipate investing in [ph] innovation for growers through the combination with Bayer.
Growers seek this innovation opportunity because they recognize that resources are finite, demand is real, and productivity improvement is the key to their success. The USDA demand figures have indicated that over the past 4 seasons, world demand for corn grew by over 4 billion bushels while soy demand in the same time frame grew by over 2 billion bushels. 
The December WASDE report indicated continued strength, with corn demand for the current marketing year growing by over 1.4 billion bushels and soy demand growing by over 500 million bushels. In fact, as seen on Slide 6, meeting that trend-line demand on a relatively stable footprint over the next decade would require a twofold increase in the rate of yield gain for cotton and a fourfold increase for soybeans.
So the innovation that we expect to deliver with our leading technology platforms, as shown on Slide 7, will be necessary to increase productivity to meet this projected demand. And we expect the combination with Bayer to amplify that rate of innovation.
It all starts with our industry-leading seed and trait technologies, which reached approximately 400 million acres today as a result of our broad licensing approach, which Bayer has indicated that they will continue. This footprint serves as the foundation for future germplasm upgrades; new trait technologies; seed treatments through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes; and finally, our unique and rapidly expanding Climate FieldView platform. 
To reinforce our innovation platform leadership, we continue to expand our capabilities in genome editing, including a new agreement with the Broad Institute. 
Our desire to expand the strong innovation core also stems from the myriad of game-changing opportunities that we see in the horizon. We are very clearly entering a new era in agriculture. Hundreds of new entrants invested more than $4.5 billion of venture capital in agriculture in 2015, which is more than 10x the investment from just 5 short years ago. More players than ever are seeking to provide new technologies to growers to enhance productivity both profitably and sustainably. This is for good reason. Demand requires it, and we are pleased to see the investment to spur this needed innovation. 
Our shared vision with Bayer is to harness this wave of innovation and more optimally integrate into a [ph] format that's usable and insightful to growers primarily through our Climate FieldView platform. By pairing Bayer's exceptional crop protection portfolio with our seeds and traits and Climate FieldView platforms, we expect farmers to benefit from accelerated innovation, expanded geographic and crop offerings and optimized integrated solutions from science-based recommendations. 
An investment space [ph] that secures the sustainable food supply needs and deserves this improved rate of innovation. So today, Robb will expand on these examples as well as on our own pipeline update. 
So we look forward to updating you on the status of the deal as we move through this year. Until then, we're committed to operate as an independent company focused on delivering on our plans for fiscal year '17 as well as our key business milestones. 
With growth in our Q1 results and outstanding demand for our new soybean technologies, we continue to expect our return to earnings per share growth for the full year. As Pierre will elaborate, we're reconfirming our full year ongoing earnings per share and free cash flow guidance with a small increase in our as-reported earnings per share outlook.
So with that brief summary, let me pass it to Brett to elaborate on our operational path to delivering [ph] in 2017. Brett?"
528414,405049966,1107803,"Monsanto Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 05, 2017",2017-01-05,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin our operational outlook for fiscal year 2017 with corn, as shown on Slide 8, where we continue to expect corn gross profit growth from global price mix gains, genetic share gains and acreage momentum i",833,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin our operational outlook for fiscal year 2017 with corn, as shown on Slide 8, where we continue to expect corn gross profit growth from global price mix gains, genetic share gains and acreage momentum in South America. 
In the first quarter, we saw a greater than 25% increase in planted corn acres in Argentina and more than a 10% increase in corn acres planted in Brazil. This was accompanied by double-digit price increases in corn germplasm and [ph] local currency in both countries. 
In the U.S., the early read on the order book supports our intention to grow genetic share yet again. We've priced the majority of our existing hybrids flat to down slightly, with our new hybrids at a premium, maintaining our premium pricing compared to our competition. 
Demand for Year 1 hybrids remains exceptionally strong, and we are now in a sold-out position. Also, SmartStax remains a steady percent of our overall portfolio. 
In addition, we're prepared to respond as necessary to any emerging competitive dynamics, but we've not seen any unusual levels of discounting to date. 
In soybeans, we expect to reach several significant milestones in 2017, as shown on Slide 9. We're off to a good start and still plan to reach an expected 45 million to 55 million acres of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO soybeans in South America, as shown on Slide 10. We expect the vast majority of this footprint will be in Brazil. 
In Argentina, we've seen continued progress toward maintaining a reliable value capture. Recent renewal of the government resolution that enables a testing and invoicing protocol was positive, and we continue to work with the industry coalition to secure a seed bill that encourages and rewards investment.
Continuing with soybeans on Slide 11. We're well supplied for more than 15 million U.S. acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, and our order book reflects the overwhelming pent-up demand for this technology. 
With the EPA approval for in-crop use of dicamba in hand, [ph] and as of this morning, we've now already received nearly 3/4 of the necessary state approvals for both soybeans and cotton, which covers the vast majority of the acres. And we expect to have the rest before planting. 
We are conducting extensive training on the use of Xtendimax in the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, delivering multiple training opportunities and tools to provide customers with an excellent experience with the technology.
Moving to our cotton business. We had a strong start in the first quarter with increased acres in Australia. And in the U.S., we now expect the Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton area [ph] to exceed 4 million acres, including a per-acre trade premium. 
Additionally, this season, we will have an introductory release of Bollgard 3 XtendFlex Cotton, with the full-scale launch planned for 2018. This is the first cotton product ever to combine 3 modes of action for both insect and weed control. 
Finally, we expect 2017 to be the third consecutive year of share growth in U.S. cotton, coming on the heels of more than 8 points of branded and licensed share growth in 2016.
In Ag Productivity, we are focused on the launch of Xtendimax herbicide with VaporGrip Technology. 
In addition, generic glyphosate prices have continued to trend favorably over the course of the last several months, and our strategy to price just above generics with our glyphosate-based herbicides has already led to some small price increases in the U.S. We also saw a nice uptick in glyphosate volumes in our first quarter. However, we did experience the expected glyphosate pricing headwinds and anticipate those will continue into the second quarter as the current global pricing is lower than the prior comparable period. 
As a partial offset, we just recently signed an agreement to sell our Latitude wheat fungicide business for $140 million. Subject to the closure, we expect to receive an EBIT benefit of approximately $85 million in this segment in the second quarter. 
This sale is part of our continued efforts to focus and optimize our product portfolio and puts the asset into the hands of Mitsui, who has more potential to drive a greater level of value out of the asset.
And finally, Climate FieldView, as shown on Slide 12, continues to see major advancements as the business and the platform continues to evolve. We released 4 new product enhancements for 2017, and these upgrades, together with outstanding demand for FieldView Plus and Drive, have us well down the path to our goal of 25 million paid acres. 
Simultaneously, we expect to add several more partners to the platform in the coming year and continue to grow geographically, with expansion expected in the U.S., Europe, Brazil and Canada this year and in addition, to [ph] plans to launch in Australia, Argentina and South Africa in the next few years.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?"
528414,405049966,1107803,"Monsanto Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 05, 2017",2017-01-05,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Let's start with a review of the first quarter. As expected, ongoing results came in better than the prior year on the strength of our southern hemisphere business. Our soybean gross profit is up by approximate",780,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Let's start with a review of the first quarter. As expected, ongoing results came in better than the prior year on the strength of our southern hemisphere business. Our soybean gross profit is up by approximately 50% in the first quarter, with 6 points of gross margin improvements led by Intacta penetration and currency benefits. Corn gross profit grew by more than 30% due primarily to double-digit price-mix leaps [ph] in local currency in both Brazil and Argentina and from strong growth in acres planted in both countries. 
Finally, total operating spend decreased, with reduced restructuring expense more than offsetting increases from the pending Bayer transaction cost, currency and growth in [ph] conditions in South America. 
Our Q1 free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion reflects strong U.S. cash straight [ph] payments and includes the payment of the previously accrued PCB personal injury settlement. 
Let's move ahead to our full year outlook on Slide 13.  On an as-reported basis and as shown in our reconciliations, we expect our fiscal year '17 EPS to be in the range of $3.97 to $4.45. These earnings are expected to translate into $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flows. 
On an ongoing basis, our fiscal year '17 ongoing earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.90, reflecting the growth we expect for the year. 
Despite the fact that the year-over-year change in currency rates was modestly favorable for us in the first quarter of '17, we continue to assume that the change in rates will have a relatively neutral effect on the full year basis given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against several currencies.
Our Seeds and Genomics segment's gross profit is still expected to increase mid-single digits as a percent year-over-year, with soybean gross profit alone expected to grow by more than 20%, driven by new trait penetration and anticipated cost of goods sold reduction. 
In corn, growth is expected to come from global genetic share gains and global germplasm price-mix lift in local currency that we expect to be flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages.  We expect global corn acres to be roughly flat for the full fiscal year, with declines in U.S. corn acreage offset by the early increases in South America. 
Shifting gears, our Ag Productivity gross profit is now expected to be in the range of $850 million to $950 million, reflecting year-over-year price declines in our glyphosate-based herbicides in the first half of the year, offset partially by the benefit of licensing opportunity and expected higher volumes. The adjustments to our gross profit outlook is simply reflecting the fact that the approximate 85 million benefit from the sale of the Latitude business was ultimately recorded in other income for the segment as opposed to gross profit as originally anticipated.
Finally, we expect roughly $100 million of gross profit from licensing deals towards the end of the fiscal year roughly split between the 2 segments of the business. 
Our restructuring and cost savings initiatives remain on track as shown in Slide 14 and the estimated cost to deliver these actions and initiatives is now down slightly to approximately $1 billion. We continue to see this opportunity to deliver approximately $380 million in annual savings in operating expenses and cost of goods at the close of fiscal year '17 as compared to fiscal year '15.
However, overall operating expenses in fiscal year '17 setting aside the pending Bayer construction cost and restructuring expenses are expected to increase slightly reflation is associated to growth of the business more than offsetting our savings. The expected tax rate for the year remains in the range of 25% to 28%. 
If we narrow the view to our second quarter, we expect as reported earnings per share and ongoing earnings per share to be roughly $0.20 to $0.50 better than the prior year. 
Beyond the continued momentum in our corn and soybeans businesses, the expected first-half earnings improvements reflects the benefit from the sale of the Latitude business and the absence of significant portion of the Argentine peso devaluation.
Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect roughly $0.40 less in EPS benefit from strategic deals versus the prior year plus a more challenging currency environment than what we experienced in the first quarter. However, with a strong start in the first quarter and our continued focus on return in innovation and financial discipline, we remain confident in our outlook for fiscal year; 17.
With that, I will now pass you to Rob to share the update on the pipeline. Rob?"
528414,405049966,1107803,"Monsanto Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 05, 2017",2017-01-05,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Pierre. Good morning, everyone. So this update is something I look forward to every year. It's a chance to share an overview of the truly unparalleled science that my team is bringing to farmers around the world. I believe our science and our pipe",1460,"Thanks, Pierre. Good morning, everyone. So this update is something I look forward to every year. It's a chance to share an overview of the truly unparalleled science that my team is bringing to farmers around the world. I believe our science and our pipeline are stronger than ever. In fact not only is this the fourth consecutive year of more than 20 pipeline advancements but our advancement class of fiscal year 2017 also brings a record 14 projects advancing to commercial launch. 
As I think about what our teams have accomplished, the most notable highlights are summarized on Slide 3 of the pipeline update deck. What I think it's just as impressive is the 28 advancements is the remarkable balance of the advancement class. It showcases the depth and the breath of the pipeline and this marks the sixth straight year where projects have advanced across all of our R&D platforms whether it's breeding, biotech, biologicals, crop protection or digital ag and climate. 
Climate has made incredible progress this year and the digital ag pipeline is now the most robust in the industry with more than 35 projects in R&D including 6 advancements to commercializations that are all part of the paid elements of our platform. 
So what does this all translate to? Basically, our core pipeline is expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales with additional upside if we include our newer platforms like Climate and Biologicals and frankly, I believe the story gets even more exciting with Bayer. We truly see the opportunity to accelerate innovation, optimize integrated solutions and expand offerings and this translates to significant benefits to farmers, and I'll bring this to life with a few examples later on. 
But first, let's take a look at what our customers can expect from our leading hybrids and varieties shown on Slide 4. 
Starting with corn, the cow continues to deliver the industry's best performance, marked by 11 straight years of outperforming competitive products and the margin is significant as we see a consistent 7 to 10-bushel per acre average yield advantage. 
Soybeans have outperformed for the seventh consecutive year with a greater than 2-bushel per acre average yield advantage and cotton continues this trend as well.  Deltapine cotton is again outperforming the competition for the seventh consecutive year so across-the-board, our breeding engine is delivering results that our customers can count on. 
That industry-leading germplasm performance is being protected by next-generation versions of insect and weed control traits.
Moving to Slide 5, the story here is really around delivering wave after wave of upgrades for corn from additional modes of action to expand the spectrum for insect and weed control. We have significant insect control products coming in SmartStax PRO as well as Trecepta corn. And in weed control, our third-generation product in phase 4 offers tolerance to glyphosate, dicamba and glufosinate to offer growers maximum flexibility in applying the herbicides that make the most sense for their operations. 
Longer-term, the fourth generation insect and weed control traits get even better and this is really remarkable progress towards developing new products for farmers.
Moving to soybeans on Slide 6, we have the opportunity to Xtend our leadership with insect and weed control solutions. You know there's a good reason why we expect Intacta to land on between 45 million and 55 million acres in South America this year. The technology really works well and the next-generation technology is going to work even better. It has multiple modes of action that not only improve the durability of the platform but also expand the insect spectrum across the broader range of tests that growers care about and that product is already in phase 4 along with the third-generation of weed control.
Again, much like in corn, the next generation insect and weed control traits further enhance durability and spectrum providing new solutions for growers.
Let's now move from the technologies that have been core to our strategy for years to ones that I think could be transformational in the years ahead. There's a huge opportunity with [indiscernible] and I've talked recently about the number of deals that we've inked in this space. We're now using these tools to develop the next generation of products that will populate our pipeline in coming years. The deal with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard that you referenced is an advancement that has the potential to enable more complex gene edits at an even greater efficiency and that adds to our growing portfolio of capabilities. 
So with the tools we have at our disposal, we believe we've established a path for developing and commercializing crop improvements based on genome editing. 
Our story in biologicals just continues to get better based on our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes as shown on Slide 7. We're especially excited about Acceleron B300 SAT and think it could have a fit on more than 90 million acres. And farmers are going to get their first look at this product this year. 
Further, we had another year of outstanding results for our NEMASTRIKE Technology with approximately 2 bushels of yield advantage demonstrated in soybeans and 7 bushels in corn and we remain on track for a 2018 launch of this blockbuster nematode control product. 
Let me focus now for a few minutes on how the pending combination with Bayer would further accelerate our pipeline and innovation and agriculture as shown on Slide 8. 
I've talked a lot about the benefits that this combination will bring and I think the bottom line is this deal is an innovation catalyst and we expect it to benefit farmers by optimizing and expanding R&D investment and allowing us to really up our gain. It will accelerate the pace of scientific innovation and our ability to provide integrated seed trait and chemistry solutions. And finally, it will allow us to expand our technology platforms into new crops like wheat and geographies like Asia and Africa. 
The combination with Bayer is transformative. It's about putting a complementary pro forma R&D budget of approximately $2.7 billion together to solve the challenges that farmers face and that our industry and society has an obligation to meet.
Let's start with an important example of accelerating innovation based on combining the highly complementary portfolios from Bayer and Monsanto on Slide 9. 
Today, herbicide tolerance is a cornerstone consideration for farmers making seed purchase decisions across a number of crops. The R&D challenge is that sequential development of first herbicide and then the accompanying biotech trade takes a long time so the opportunity lies in developing both trade and chemistry on parallel paths and doing so can shape years of the delivery time lines of a new herbicide tolerant system and the accelerated earnings can be invested in 2 additional areas of R&D. We're pursuing this route with PPO tolerance in our agreement with Sumitomo today and we've got the opportunity to do even more with Bayer's next-generation herbicide candidates. 
A second example on how the combination with Bayer enables better integrated solutions for farmers is shown on Slide 10. Giving farmers information to select the best combination of seed, trade and crop inputs enables them to make better planting decisions to drive productivity, profitability and sustainability on each field. 
For example, by knowing exactly which portions of a field need immediate attention, being able to precisely identify the exact pathogen and then quickly determine which fungicide is optimal can help mitigate developing crop disease problems. The detailed knowledge of crop genetics, agronomic practices and local weather, combined with Climate's imagery, full season sensor data and machine learning algorithms to identify specific diseases can alert and guide farmers to make faster and more informed decisions to protect yields from fungal diseases.
So this is where the future of agriculture is heading in these examples are just some of the possibilities that we see.
So in summary, on Slide 11, it's been another terrific year for the team. We've made phenomenal R&D progress that is balanced across the portfolio. In breeding, we're maintaining a performance advantage that our customers have come to expect. In biotechnology, the story is really about protecting the platforms with newer and better next-generation seed -- next-generation insect and weed control traits and our new innovation platforms are developing cutting edge products like B300 SAT and NEMASTRIKE Technology along with a 6 new products that we've launched in our Climate FieldView platform. 
Our strategy is been focused on optimally integrating these leading platforms and the combination with Bayer will allow our 2 companies to accelerate the pace of innovation and bring new products to farmers faster through our shared vision.
So with that, I'll pass it on to Laura for Q&A."

Definitely the change in the currency relationship created part of the opportunity to reach for some of the pricing improvements around double digits and by all means even double-digit that not bring back everything that we've lost in the past with the currencies so there's potential opportunity as we continue to look to the future there. At the same time what I think just are more important is the continued performance of our products down there. Intacta continues to do incredibly well as Rob talked about in this update we have the son of Intacta right behind us so we're looking before the term of the decade would launching the second generation of Intacta. Our corn portfolio continues to do extremely well down there. We have those next generation of insect control coming there and then germplasm performance as Pierre mentioned. So all of those things combined set up nicely to be able to continue to look into the future and see incremental value as we deliver incremental value to the farmer. Currency being a piece of that, but also the performance of the products."

I think first of all as you recognize there's a variety of gene editing tools. There's protein base, there's nucleic acid base and just in the last few weeks, there's been a couple of publications on 2 brand-new gene editing systems that have been discovered. In any case, with these tools allow you to do is go in and precisely change basically any base pair or any gene in the crop and so there are very powerful tool for making precise changes. I think the other thing that's important to highlight is you still need a world-class breeding engine, a testing network in order to identify and evaluate the best combinations and those gene editing traits are going to be introduced into corn and soybean and cotton, stacked with the biotech traits that are defining the marketplace today. So we see them very complementary to the breeding and trade engines that we have developed and I think they will allow us to further accelerate that rate of gain and I think the fact that we've now concluded licensing agreements with some of the major players and innovative technologies puts us in a great position to take advantage of these products. Some of the first gene editing products and some of the smaller crops are working their way through the regulatory system as I indicated in my comments, we're now fully utilizing these tools and certainly by the beginning or middle of the next decade we will see these gene editing products work their way into the marketplace. Really an exciting technology and I think we've created a strong position moving forward into the space."

Chris, I think your core question on what has been the pleasant surprises maybe the hardest question I get this morning because we've had some terrific results across the platform. I mean, you saw the breeding results there great and the genome wide sequencing with the expansion of our testing facilities that we have in the Southern U.S. to do more of that work in the greenhouse we expect to see breeding gains accelerate. We're in a privileged position with building on the fourth and fifth generation of trades. If you had the chance to go through our tour this summer, we've discovered more new insect control genes in the last year than the industry discovered in its entire history so that's a great surprise. I flag the progress in Climate -- I mean to have now 35 projects in their pipeline, they're hitting on all cylinders and when you go to our new innovations area, we're probably talking about being able to launch the largest microbial product ever with B300 SAT. The gene editing tools have really matured quickly in our hands and I think the NemaStrike product is going to be a blockbuster product in our portfolio. So it's hard to pick favorites.

That resolution has been extended so that gives us an opportunity for the next growing season that we could not this one, but think about the next one. The coalition is working extensively with the government to build the new seed law. The previous seed law that you referenced with the 3-year, for the industry is a nonstarter. I mean, 3 years of -- compared to the rest of the world with the teams years of intellectual property protection is a nonstarter. So that would not encourage us to bring any additional technology to Argentina. At the same time there is receptivity within the government and then conversations to look for a seed law that addresses their concerns and the industry's concerns and get to a place where it encourages investment in agriculture and to do that you need you reward those that are driving innovation so we're prepared to continue to drive innovation as Rob noted in our soybean portfolio most of those products have a great fit in Argentina, but until we see an improved situation and have more confidence around the value, we'll stick with just working with Intacta right now and then we'll look to others as the situation evolves."

Also joining me from the Investor Relations team are Priyal Patel and Ben Kampelman.
Today, we will provide our annual R&D pipeline update on this call, as led by Dr. Fraley, as well as an overview of our first quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.
We've provided you today with EPS and other measures on both the GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary -- may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.

The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First, let me review our first quarter results as shown on Slide 4. As shown in our reconciliations, we delivered as-reported earnings per share of $0.07 in the first quarter, which included $0.19 of pending Bayer-related transaction costs. 
On an ongoing basis, earnings per share were $0.21 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, well above the prior year ongoing loss of $0.11, driven by the expected strong start to our business in South America and improved currency.

528414,405049966,1107874,"Monsanto Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 05, 2017",2017-01-05,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. As we move in the second quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to remain focused on 2 things: continuing to deliver on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones and working closely wi",963,"Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. As we move in the second quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to remain focused on 2 things: continuing to deliver on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones and working closely with Bayer on the necessary steps to close the deal, which is targeted for the end of calendar year 2017.
Let's begin with an update on the deal, which is shown on Slide 5. First, we're pleased to see the strong shareowner support for the proposal to combine with Bayer, with approximately 99% of the votes cast in support of the combination. 
With the vote behind us, our team is working with Bayer on the required regulatory filings and continued key stakeholder outreach. The Hart-Scott-Rodino filings have been made in the U.S. along with several filings in other jurisdictions, and we anticipate submission of the required filing in the EU in the first calendar quarter of this year. 
We continue to expect the transaction to close by the end of 2017, and our confidence stems from the fact that these are 2 different but highly complementary businesses with limited overlap. If those overlaps do exist, however, Bayer anticipates and is committed to undertake a certain level of divestitures as required by the regulatory agencies. 
Also, both Robb and I have been personally involved in extensive grower outreach as well as discussions with key policymakers and politicians, sharing our views on the innovation enhancements that we envision from this combination. Innovation is the foundation of the industrial logic for the combination with Bayer just as it was with the consolidation that we led in the industry back in the late '90s. An innovation creates jobs, and it creates opportunities for both consumers and for our growers. This deal takes what we've been doing for the last 15 years to a whole new level, with St. Louis as the heartland for seeds and biotech research for the new company worldwide. 
15 years ago, we were spending roughly $550 million a year in R&D. This year, we'll spend approximately $1.5 billion in R&D, and we look forward to the combined levels of R&D that we anticipate investing in innovation for growers through the combination with Bayer.
Growers seek this innovation opportunity because they recognize that resources are finite, demand is real, and productivity improvement is the key to their success. The USDA demand figures have indicated that over the past 4 seasons, world demand for corn grew by over 4 billion bushels while soy demand in the same time frame grew by over 2 billion bushels. 
The December WASDE report indicated continued strength, with corn demand for the current marketing year growing by over 1.4 billion bushels and soy demand growing by over 500 million bushels. In fact, as seen on Slide 6, meeting that trend-line demand on a relatively stable footprint over the next decade would require a twofold increase in the rate of yield gain for cotton and a fourfold increase for soybeans.
So the innovation that we expect to deliver with our leading technology platforms, as shown on Slide 7, will be necessary to increase productivity to meet this projected demand. And we expect the combination with Bayer to amplify that rate of innovation.
It all starts with our industry-leading seed and trait technologies, which reached approximately 400 million acres today as a result of our broad licensing approach, which Bayer has indicated that they will continue. This footprint serves as the foundation for future germplasm upgrades; new trait technologies; seed treatments through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes; and finally, our unique and rapidly expanding Climate FieldView platform. 
To reinforce our innovation platform leadership, we continue to expand our capabilities in genome editing, including a new agreement with the Broad Institute. 
Our desire to expand the strong innovation core also stems from the myriad of game-changing opportunities that we see in the horizon. We are very clearly entering a new era in agriculture. Hundreds of new entrants invested more than $4.5 billion of venture capital in agriculture in 2015, which is more than 10x the investment from just 5 short years ago. More players than ever are seeking to provide new technologies to growers to enhance productivity both profitably and sustainably. This is for good reason. Demand requires it, and we are pleased to see the investment to spur this needed innovation. 
Our shared vision with Bayer is to harness this wave of innovation and more optimally integrate it into a format that's usable and insightful to growers primarily through our Climate FieldView platform. By pairing Bayer's exceptional crop protection portfolio with our seeds and traits and Climate FieldView platforms, we expect farmers to benefit from accelerated innovation, expanded geographic and crop offerings and optimized integrated solutions from science-based recommendations. 
An investment space that secures a sustainable food supply needs and deserves this improved rate of innovation. So today, Robb will expand on these examples as well as on our own pipeline update. 
So we look forward to updating you on the status of the deal as we move through this year. Until then, we're committed to operate as an independent company focused on delivering on our plans for fiscal year '17 as well as our key business milestones. 
With growth in our Q1 results and outstanding demand for our new soybean technologies, we continue to expect our return to earnings per share growth for the full year. As Pierre will elaborate, we're reconfirming our full year ongoing earnings per share and free cash flow guidance with a small increase in our as-reported earnings per share outlook.
So with that brief summary, let me pass it to Brett to elaborate on our operational path to deliver in 2017. Brett?"

Let's begin our operational outlook for fiscal year 2017 with corn, as shown on Slide 8, where we continue to expect corn gross profit growth from global price mix gains, genetic share gains and acreage momentum i",829,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin our operational outlook for fiscal year 2017 with corn, as shown on Slide 8, where we continue to expect corn gross profit growth from global price mix gains, genetic share gains and acreage momentum in South America. 
In the first quarter, we saw a greater than 25% increase in planted corn acres in Argentina and more than a 10% increase in corn acres planted in Brazil. This was accompanied by double-digit price increases in corn germplasm in local currency in both countries. 
In the U.S., the early read on the order book supports our intention to grow genetic share yet again. We've priced the majority of our existing hybrids flat to down slightly, with our new hybrids at a premium, maintaining our premium pricing compared to our competition. 
Demand for Year 1 hybrids remains exceptionally strong, and we are now in a sold-out position. Also, SmartStax remains a steady percent of our overall portfolio. 
In addition, we're prepared to respond as necessary to any emerging competitive dynamics, but we've not seen any unusual levels of discounting to date. 
In soybeans, we expect to reach several significant milestones in 2017, as shown on Slide 9. We're off to a good start and still plan to reach an expected 45 million to 55 million acres of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO soybeans in South America, as shown on Slide 10. We expect the vast majority of this footprint will be in Brazil. 
In Argentina, we've seen continued progress toward maintaining a reliable value capture. Recent renewal of the government resolution that enables a testing and invoicing protocol was positive, and we continue to work with the industry coalition to secure a seed bill that encourages and rewards investment.
Continuing with soybeans on Slide 11. We're well supplied for more than 15 million U.S. acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, and our order book reflects the overwhelming pent-up demand for this technology. 
With the EPA approval for in-crop use of dicamba in hand and as of this morning, we've now already received nearly 3/4 of the necessary state approvals for both soybeans and cotton, which covers the vast majority of the acres, and we expect to have the rest before planting. 
We are conducting extensive training on the use of Xtendimax in the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, delivering multiple training opportunities and tools to provide customers with an excellent experience with the technology.
Moving to our cotton business. We had a strong start in the first quarter with increased acres in Australia. And in the U.S., we now expect the Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton area to exceed 4 million acres, including a per-acre trait premium. 
Additionally, this season, we will have an introductory release of Bollgard 3 XtendFlex Cotton, with the full-scale launch planned for 2018. This is the first cotton product ever to combine 3 modes of action for both insect and weed control. 
Finally, we expect 2017 to be the third consecutive year of share growth in U.S. cotton, coming on the heels of more than 8 points of branded and licensed share growth in 2016.
In Ag Productivity, we are focused on the launch of Xtendimax herbicide with VaporGrip Technology. 
In addition, generic glyphosate prices have continued to trend favorably over the course of the last several months, and our strategy to price just above generics with our glyphosate-based herbicides has already led to some small price increases in the U.S. We also saw a nice uptick in glyphosate volumes in our first quarter. However, we did experience the expected glyphosate pricing headwinds and anticipate those will continue into the second quarter as the current global pricing is lower than the prior comparable period. 
As a partial offset, we just recently signed an agreement to sell our Latitude wheat fungicide business for $140 million. Subject to the closure, we expect to receive an EBIT benefit of approximately $85 million in this segment in the second quarter. 
This sale is part of our continued efforts to focus and optimize our product portfolio and puts the asset into the hands of Mitsui, who has more potential to drive a greater level of value out of the asset.
And finally, Climate FieldView, as shown on Slide 12, continues to see major advancements as the business and the platform continues to evolve. We released 4 new product enhancements for 2017, and these upgrades, together with outstanding demand for FieldView Plus and Drive, have us well down the path to our goal of 25 million paid acres. 
Simultaneously, we expect to add several more partners to the platform in the coming year and continue to grow geographically, with expansion expected in the U.S., Europe, Brazil and Canada this year and in addition to plans to launch in Australia, Argentina and South Africa in the next few years.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?"
528414,405049966,1107874,"Monsanto Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 05, 2017",2017-01-05,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Let's start with a review of the first quarter. As expected, ongoing results came in better than the prior year on the strength of our southern hemisphere business. Our soybean gross profit is up by approximate",782,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Let's start with a review of the first quarter. As expected, ongoing results came in better than the prior year on the strength of our southern hemisphere business. Our soybean gross profit is up by approximately 50% in the first quarter, with 6 points of gross margin improvements led by Intacta penetration and currency benefits. Corn gross profit grew by more than 30% due primarily to double-digit price-mix lift in local currency in both Brazil and Argentina and from strong growth in acres planted in both countries. 
Finally, total operating spend decreased, with reduced restructuring expense more than offsetting increases from the pending Bayer transaction cost, currency and growth conditions in South America. 
Our Q1 free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion reflects strong U.S. cash prepayments and includes the payment of the previously accrued PCB personal injury settlement. 
Let's move ahead to our full year outlook on Slide 13. On an as-reported basis and as shown in our reconciliations, we expect our fiscal year '17 EPS to be in the range of $3.97 to $4.45. These earnings are expected to translate into $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flows. 
On an ongoing basis, our fiscal year '17 ongoing earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.90, reflecting the growth we expect for the year. 
Despite the fact that the year-over-year change in currency rates was modestly favorable for us in the first quarter of '17, we continue to assume that the change in rates will have a relatively neutral effect on the full year basis given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against several currencies.
Our Seeds and Genomics segment's gross profit is still expected to increase mid-single digits as a percent year-over-year, with soybean gross profit alone expected to grow by more than 20%, driven by new trait penetration and anticipated cost of goods sold reduction. 
In corn, growth is expected to come from global genetic share gains and global germplasm price-mix lift in local currency that we expect to be flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages. We expect global corn acres to be roughly flat for the full fiscal year, with declines in U.S. corn acreage offset by the early increases in South America. 
Shifting gears, our Ag Productivity gross profit is now expected to be in the range of $850 million to $950 million, reflecting year-over-year price declines in our glyphosate-based herbicides in the first half of the year, offset partially by the benefit of licensing opportunity and expected higher volumes. The adjustment to our gross profit outlook is simply reflecting the fact that the approximate $85 million benefit from the sale of the Latitude business was ultimately recorded in other income for the segment as opposed to gross profit as originally anticipated.
Finally, we expect roughly $100 million of gross profit from strategic licensing deals towards the end of the fiscal year, roughly split between the 2 segments of the business. 
Our restructuring and cost savings initiatives remain on track, as shown on Slide 14. And the estimated cost to deliver those actions and initiatives is now down slightly to approximately $1 billion. We continue to see the opportunity to deliver approximately $380 million in annual savings in operating expenses and cost of goods at the close of fiscal year '17 as compared to fiscal year '15.
However, overall operating expenses in fiscal year '17, setting aside the pending Bayer transaction costs and restructuring expenses, are expected to increase slightly, with inflation in the costs associated with the return to growth of the business more than offsetting our savings. 
The expected tax rate for the year remains in the range of 25% to 28%. 
If we narrow the view to our second quarter, we expect as-reported earnings per share and ongoing earnings per share to be roughly $0.20 to $0.50 better than the prior year. 
Beyond the continued momentum in our corn and soybeans businesses, the expected first half earnings improvement reflects the benefit from the sale of the Latitude business and the absence of significant portion of the Argentine peso devaluation.
Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect roughly $0.40 less in EPS benefit from strategic deals versus the prior year plus a more challenging currency environment than what we experienced in the first quarter. However, with a strong start in the first quarter and our continued focus on return on innovation and financial discipline, we remain confident in our outlook for fiscal year '17.
With that, I will now pass you to Robb to share the update on the pipeline. Robb?"
528414,405049966,1107874,"Monsanto Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 05, 2017",2017-01-05,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Pierre. Good morning, everyone. So this update is something I look forward to every year. It's a chance to share an overview of the truly unparalleled science that my team is bringing to farmers around the world. I believe our science and our pi",1459,"Thanks, Pierre. Good morning, everyone. So this update is something I look forward to every year. It's a chance to share an overview of the truly unparalleled science that my team is bringing to farmers around the world. 
I believe our science and our pipeline are stronger than ever. In fact, not only is this the fourth consecutive year of more than 20 pipeline advancements, but our advancement class of fiscal year 2017 also brings a record 14 projects advancing to commercial launch. 
As I think about what our teams have accomplished, the most notable highlights are summarized on Slide 3 of the pipeline update deck. What I think is just as impressive as the 28 advancements is the remarkable balance of the advancement class. It showcases the depth and the breadth of the pipeline. And this marks the sixth straight year where projects have advanced across all of our R&D platforms, whether it's breeding, biotech, biologicals, crop protection or digital ag and Climate. 
Climate has made incredible progress this year, and the digital ag pipeline is now the most robust in the industry, with more than 35 projects in R&D, including 6 advancements to commercializations that are all part of the paid elements of our platform. 
So what does this all translate to? Basically, our core pipeline is expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales, with additional upside if we include our newer platforms like Climate and biologicals. And frankly, I believe the story gets even more exciting with Bayer. We truly see the opportunity to accelerate innovation, optimize integrated solutions and expand offerings, and this translates to significant benefits to farmers. And I'll bring this to life with a few examples later on. 
But first, let's take a look at what our customers can expect from our leading hybrids and varieties, shown on Slide 4. 
Starting with corn. DEKALB continues to deliver the industry's best performance, marked by 11 straight years of outperforming competitive products. And the margin is significant as we see a consistent 7- to 10-bushel per acre average yield advantage. 
Soybeans have outperformed for the seventh consecutive year with a greater than 2-bushel per acre average yield advantage. And cotton continues this trend as well. Deltapine cotton is again outperforming the competition for the seventh consecutive year. So across the board, our breeding engine is delivering results that our customers can count on. 
That industry-leading germplasm performance is being protected by next-generation versions of insect and weed control traits.
Moving to Slide 5. The story here is really around delivering wave after wave of upgrades for corn from additional modes of action to expand the spectrum for insect and weed control. We have significant insect control products coming in SmartStax PRO as well as Trecepta corn. And in weed control, our third-generation product in Phase IV offers tolerance to glyphosate, dicamba and glufosinate to offer growers maximum flexibility in applying the herbicides that make the most sense for their operations. 
Longer term, the fourth-generation insect and weed control traits get even better. And this is really remarkable progress towards developing new products for farmers.
Moving to soybeans on Slide 6. We have the opportunity to extend our leadership with insect and weed control solutions. There's a good reason why we expect Intacta to land on between 45 million and 55 million acres in South America this year. The technology really works well, and the next-generation technology is going to work even better. It has multiple modes of action that not only improve the durability of the platform but also expand the insect spectrum across the broader range of pests that growers care about. And that product is already in Phase IV along with the third generation of weed control.
Again, much like in corn, the next-generation insect and weed control traits further enhance durability and spectrum, providing new solutions for growers.
Let's now move from the technologies that have been core to our strategy for years to ones that I think could be transformational in the years ahead. There's a huge opportunity with genome editing, and I've talked recently about the number of deals that we've inked in this space. We're now using these tools to develop the next generation of products that will populate our pipeline in coming years. The deal with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard that Hugh referenced is an advancement that has the potential to enable more complex gene edits at an even greater efficiency, and that adds to our growing portfolio of capabilities. 
So with the tools we have at our disposal, we believe we've established a path for developing and commercializing crop improvements based on genome editing. 
Our story in biologicals just continues to get better based on our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, as shown on Slide 7. We're especially excited about Acceleron B-300 SAT and think it could have a fit on more than 90 million acres. And farmers are going to get their first look at this product this year. 
Further, we had another year of outstanding results for our NemaStrike Technology with approximately 2 bushels of yield advantage demonstrated in soybeans and 7 bushels in corn. And we remain on track for a 2018 launch of this blockbuster nematode control product. 
Let me focus now for a few minutes on how the pending combination with Bayer would further accelerate our pipeline and innovation in agriculture, as shown on Slide 8. 
I've talked a lot about the benefits that this combination will bring. And I think the bottom line is this deal is an innovation catalyst, and we expect it to benefit farmers by optimizing and expanding R&D investment and allowing us to really up our game. It will accelerate the pace of scientific innovation and our ability to provide integrated seed, trait and chemistry solutions. And finally, it will allow us to expand our technology platforms into new crops like wheat and geographies like Asia and Africa. 
The combination with Bayer is transformative. It's about putting a complementary pro forma R&D budget of approximately $2.7 billion together to solve the challenges that farmers face and that our industry and society has an obligation to meet.
Let's start with an important example of accelerating innovation based on combining the highly complementary portfolios from Bayer and Monsanto on Slide 9. 
Today, herbicide tolerance is a cornerstone consideration for farmers making seed purchase decisions across a number of crops. The R&D challenge is that sequential development of first the herbicide and then the accompanying biotech trait takes a long time. So the opportunity lies in developing both trait and chemistry on parallel paths, and doing so can shave years off the delivery time lines of a new herbicide-tolerant system, and the accelerated earnings can be invested into additional areas of R&D. We're pursuing this route with PPO tolerance in our agreement with Sumitomo today, and we've got the opportunity to do even more with Bayer's next-generation herbicide candidates. 
A second example on how the combination with Bayer enables better integrated solutions for farmers is shown on Slide 10. Giving farmers information to select the best combination of seed, trait and crop inputs enables them to make better planting decisions to drive productivity, profitability and sustainability on each field. 
For example, by knowing exactly which portions of a field need immediate attention, being able to precisely identify the exact pathogen and then quickly determine which fungicide is optimal can help mitigate developing crop disease problems. The detailed knowledge of crop genetics, agronomic practices and local weather, combined with Climate's imagery, full season sensor data and machine learning algorithms to identify specific diseases, can alert and guide farmers to make faster and more informed decisions to protect yields from fungal diseases.
So this is where the future of agriculture is heading, and these examples are just some of the possibilities that we see.
So in summary, on Slide 11, it's been another terrific year for the team. We've made phenomenal R&D progress that is balanced across the portfolio. In breeding, we're maintaining a performance advantage that our customers have come to expect. In biotechnology, the story is really about protecting the platforms with newer and better next-generation seed -- excuse me, next-generation insect and weed control traits, and our new innovation platforms are developing cutting-edge products like B-300 SAT and NemaStrike Technology, along with the 6 new products we've launched in our Climate FieldView platform. 
Our strategy has been focused on optimally integrating these leading platforms, and the combination with Bayer will allow our 2 companies to accelerate the pace of innovation and bring new products to farmers faster through our shared vision.
So with that, I'll pass it on to Laura for Q&A."

As Robb talked about in his update, we have the son [ph] of Intacta right behind that. So we're looking before the turn of the decade of launching the second generation of Intacta. Our corn portfolio continues to do extremely well down there. We have those next generations of insect control coming there and then germplasm performance, as Pierre mentioned.

So I think first of all, as you recognize, there's a variety of gene editing tools. There's protein-based. There's nucleic acid-based. And just in the last few weeks, there's been a couple of publications on 2 brand-new gene editing systems that have been discovered. In any case, what these tools allow you to do is to go in and precisely change basically any base pair or any gene in the crop. And so they're a very, very powerful tool for making precise changes. I think the other thing that's important to highlight is you still need a world-class breeding engine, a testing network in order to identify and evaluate the best combinations. And those gene editing traits are going to be introduced into corn and soybean and cotton, stacked with the biotech traits that are defining the marketplace today. So we see them very complementary to the breeding and trait engines that we have developed, and I think they will allow us to further accelerate that rate of gain. And I think the fact that we've now concluded licensing agreements with some of the major players in innovative technologies puts us in a great position to take advantage of these products. I mean, some of the first gene editing products and some of the smaller crops are working their way through the regulatory system. As I indicated in my comments, we're now fully utilizing these tools, and certainly by the beginning or middle of the next decade, we will see these gene editing products work their way into the marketplace. Really an exciting technology, and I think we've created a strong position moving forward into the space."

It's always nice to talk about pleasant surprises at the start of a new year. In terms of the balance between our customers asking for what R&D is producing, you never get complete synchrony in that, but I think over time, we've done really well in 2 areas. One is anticipating what growers need. Robb made the point that Xtend took 7 years to get through the EPA, and that's been a frustration where the limits haven't been great signs. The limits have been the regulatory pace, and we sincerely hope that that's going to change. And then I think the other great thing that we've been successful within this balance that you refer to, Chris, is having second-, third- and sometimes fourth-generation products sequentially developed so that as we are growing acres and meeting demand, we've got the next product in development and ready to move through. So I would say those are probably 2 of the synchrony elements. But Robb, pleasant surprises in R&D?"

Chris, I think your core question on what have been the pleasant surprises is maybe the hardest question I get this morning because we've had some terrific results across the platform. I mean, you saw the breeding results. They're great. And with the genome-wide sequencing, with the expansion of our testing facilities that we have in the southern U.S. to do more of that work in the greenhouse, we expect to see breeding gains accelerate. We're in a privileged position with building on the fourth and fifth generation of traits. If you had the chance to go through our tour this summer, we've discovered more new insect control genes in the last year than the industry has discovered in its entire history. So that's a great surprise. I flag the progress in Climate. I mean, to have now 35 projects in their pipeline, they are hitting on the -- on all cylinders. And when you go to our new innovations area, I mean, we're probably talking about being able to launch the largest microbial product ever with B-300 SAT. The gene editing tools have really matured quickly in our hands, and I think the NemaStrike product is going to be a blockbuster product in our portfolio. So it's hard to pick favorites. There's been some really exciting progress this year."

We've been at this for some time now, working with the farmers and the government to get a system in place. And we had one, and that got disrupted. But the good news was last summer in about June, there was a resolution that put it back in place where we could have mandatory testing as well as invoicing. That resolution has been extended. So that gives us an opportunity for the next growing season that we could not just this one but as we think about the next one. The coalition is working extensively with the government to build a new seed law. The previous seed law that you referenced with the 3-year, for the industry is a nonstarter. I mean, 3 years, compared to the rest of the world with the teens years of intellectual property protection, is a nonstarter. So that would not encourage us to bring any additional technology to Argentina. At the same time, there is receptivity within the government and in conversations to look for a seed law that addresses their concerns and the industry's concerns and get to a place where it encourages investment in agriculture. And to do that, you need to reward those that are driving innovation. So we're prepared to continue to drive innovation, as Robb noted, in our soybean portfolio. Most of those products have a great fit in Argentina, but until we see an improved situation and have more confidence around the value, we'll stick with just working with Intacta right now, and then we'll look to others as the situation evolves."

On an ongoing basis, earnings per share were $0.21 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, well above the prior year ongoing loss of $0.11, driven by the expected strong start to our business in South America and improved currency.

As we move into the second quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to remain focused on 2 things: continuing to deliver on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones and working closely",964,"Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. As we move into the second quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to remain focused on 2 things: continuing to deliver on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones and working closely with Bayer on the necessary steps to close the deal, which is targeted for the end of calendar year 2017.
Let's begin with an update on the deal, which is shown on Slide 5. First, we're pleased to see the strong shareowner support for the proposal to combine with Bayer, with approximately 99% of the votes cast in support of the combination. 
With the vote behind us, our team is working with Bayer on the required regulatory filings and continued key stakeholder outreach. The Hart-Scott-Rodino filings have been made in the U.S. along with several filings in other jurisdictions, and we anticipate submission of the required filing in the EU in the first calendar quarter of this year. 
We continue to expect the transaction to close by the end of 2017, and our confidence stems from the fact that these are 2 different but highly complementary businesses with limited overlap. Where those overlaps do exist, however, Bayer anticipates and is committed to undertake a certain level of divestitures as required by the regulatory agencies. 
Also, both Robb and I have been personally involved in extensive grower outreach as well as discussions with key policymakers and politicians, sharing our views on the innovation enhancements that we envision from this combination. Innovation is the foundation of the industrial logic for the combination with Bayer just as it was with the consolidation that we led in the industry back in the late '90s. And innovation creates jobs and it creates opportunities for both consumers and for our growers. This deal takes what we've been doing for the last 15 years to a whole new level, with St. Louis as the heartland for seeds and biotech research for the new company worldwide. 
15 years ago, we were spending roughly $550 million a year on R&D. This year, we'll spend approximately $1.5 billion on R&D, and we look forward to the combined levels of R&D that we anticipate investing on innovation for growers through the combination with Bayer.
Growers seek this innovation opportunity because they recognize that resources are finite, demand is real, and productivity improvement is the key to their success. The USDA demand figures have indicated that over the past 4 seasons, world demand for corn grew by over 4 billion bushels while soy demand in the same time frame grew by over 2 billion bushels. 
The December WASDE report indicated continued strength, with corn demand for the current marketing year growing by over 1.4 billion bushels and soy demand growing by over 500 million bushels. In fact, as seen on Slide 6, meeting that trend-line demand on a relatively stable footprint over the next decade would require a twofold increase in the rate of yield gain for corn and a fourfold increase for soybeans.
So the innovation that we expect to deliver with our leading technology platforms, as shown on Slide 7, will be necessary to increase productivity to meet this projected demand, and we expect the combination with Bayer to amplify that rate of innovation.
It all starts with our industry-leading seed and trait technologies, which reach approximately 400 million acres today as a result of our broad licensing approach, which Bayer has indicated that they will continue. This footprint serves as the foundation for future germplasm upgrades, new trait technologies, seed treatments through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes and finally, our unique and rapidly expanding Climate FieldView platform. 
To reinforce our innovation platform leadership, we continue to expand our capabilities in genome editing, including a new agreement with the Broad Institute. 
Our desire is to expand this strong innovation core also stems from the myriad of game-changing opportunities that we see on the horizon. We are very clearly entering a new era in agriculture. Hundreds of new entrants invested more than $4.5 billion of venture capital in agriculture in 2015, which is more than 10x the investment from just 5 short years ago. More players than ever are seeking to provide new technologies to growers to enhance productivity both profitably and sustainably. This is for good reason. Demand requires it, and we are pleased to see the investment to spur this needed innovation. 
Our shared vision with Bayer is to harness this wave of innovation and more optimally integrate it into a format that's usable and insightful to growers, primarily through our Climate FieldView platform. By pairing Bayer's exceptional crop protection portfolio with our seeds and traits and Climate FieldView platforms, we expect farmers to benefit from accelerated innovation, expanded geographic and crop offerings and optimized integrated solutions from science-based recommendations. 
An investment space that secures a sustainable food supply needs and deserves this improved rate of innovation. So today, Robb will expand on these examples as well as on our own pipeline update. 
So we look forward to updating you on the status of the deal as we move through this year. Until then, we're committed to operate as an independent company focused on delivering on our plans for fiscal year '17 as well as our key business milestones. 
With growth in our Q1 results and outstanding demand for our new soybean technologies, we continue to expect a return to earnings per share growth for the full year. As Pierre will elaborate, we're reconfirming our full year ongoing earnings per share and free cash flow guidance with a small increase in our as-reported earnings per share outlook.
So with that brief summary, let me pass it to Brett to elaborate on our operational path to deliver in 2017. Brett?"

Let's begin our operational outlook for fiscal year 2017 with corn, as shown on Slide 8, where we continue to expect corn gross profit growth from global price mix gains, genetic share gains and acreage momentum i",829,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin our operational outlook for fiscal year 2017 with corn, as shown on Slide 8, where we continue to expect corn gross profit growth from global price mix gains, genetic share gains and acreage momentum in South America. 
In the first quarter, we saw a greater than 25% increase in planted corn acres in Argentina and more than a 10% increase in corn acres planted in Brazil. This was accompanied by double-digit price increases in corn germplasm in local currency in both countries. 
In the U.S., the early read on the order book supports our intention to grow genetic share yet again. We've priced the majority of our existing hybrids flat to down slightly, with our new hybrids at a premium, maintaining our premium pricing compared to our competition. 
Demand for Year 1 hybrids remains exceptionally strong, and we are now in a sold-out position. Also, SmartStax remains a steady percent of our overall portfolio. 
In addition, we're prepared to respond as necessary to any emerging competitive dynamics, but we've not seen any unusual levels of discounting to date. 
In soybeans, we expect to reach several significant milestones in 2017, as shown on Slide 9. We're off to a good start and still plan to reach an expected 45 million to 55 million acres of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO soybeans in South America, as shown on Slide 10. We expect the vast majority of this footprint will be in Brazil. 
In Argentina, we've seen continued progress toward maintaining a reliable value capture. Recent renewal of the government resolution that enables a testing and invoicing protocol was positive, and we continue to work with the industry coalition to secure a seed bill that encourages and rewards investment.
Continuing with soybeans on Slide 11. We're well supplied for more than 15 million U.S. acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, and our order book reflects the overwhelming pent-up demand for this technology. 
With the EPA approval for in-crop use of dicamba in hand, and as of this morning, we've now already received nearly 3/4 of the necessary state approvals for both soybeans and cotton, which covers the vast majority of the acres, and we expect to have the rest before planting. 
We are conducting extensive training on the use of Xtendimax and the Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System, delivering multiple training opportunities and tools to provide customers with an excellent experience with the technology.
Moving to our cotton business. We had a strong start in the first quarter with increased acres in Australia. And in the U.S., we now expect the Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton area to exceed 4 million acres, including a per-acre trait premium. 
Additionally, this season, we will have an introductory release of Bollgard 3 XtendFlex Cotton, with a full-scale launch planned for 2018. This is the first cotton product ever to combine 3 modes of action for both insect and weed control. 
Finally, we expect 2017 to be the third consecutive year of share growth in U.S. cotton, coming on the heels of more than 8 points of branded and licensed share growth in 2016.
In Ag Productivity, we are focused on the launch of Xtendimax herbicide with VaporGrip Technology. 
In addition, generic glyphosate prices have continued to trend favorably over the course of the last several months, and our strategy to price just above generics with our glyphosate-based herbicides has already led to some small price increases in the U.S. We also saw a nice uptick in glyphosate volumes in our first quarter. However, we did experience the expected glyphosate pricing headwinds and anticipate those will continue into the second quarter as the current global pricing is lower than the prior comparable period. 
As a partial offset, we just recently signed an agreement to sell our Latitude wheat fungicide business for $140 million. Subject to the closure, we expect to receive an EBIT benefit of approximately $85 million in this segment in the second quarter. 
This sale is part of our continued efforts to focus and optimize our product portfolio and puts the asset into the hands of Mitsui, who has more potential to drive a greater level of value out of the asset.
And finally, Climate FieldView, as shown on Slide 12, continues to see major advancements as the business and the platform continues to evolve. We released 4 new product enhancements for 2017, and these upgrades, together with outstanding demand for FieldView Plus and Drive, have us well down the path to our goal of 25 million paid acres. 
Simultaneously, we expect to add several more partners to the platform in the coming year and continue to grow geographically, with expansion expected in the U.S., Europe, Brazil and Canada this year, and in addition, to plans to launch in Australia, Argentina and South Africa in the next few years.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?"
528414,405049966,1108014,"Monsanto Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 05, 2017",2017-01-05,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Let's start with a review of the first quarter. As expected, ongoing results came in better than the prior year on the strength of our Southern Hemisphere business. Our soybean gross profit is up by approximate",783,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Let's start with a review of the first quarter. As expected, ongoing results came in better than the prior year on the strength of our Southern Hemisphere business. Our soybean gross profit is up by approximately 50% in the first quarter, with 6 points of gross margin improvement led by Intacta penetration and currency benefits. Corn gross profit grew by more than 30% due primarily to double-digit price-mix lift in local currency in both Brazil and Argentina and from strong growth in acres planted in both countries. 
Finally, total operating spend decreased, with reduced restructuring expense more than offsetting increases from the pending Bayer transaction cost, currency and growth in commissions in South America. 
Our Q1 free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion reflects strong U.S. cash prepayments and includes the payment of the previously accrued PCB personal injury settlement. 
Let's move ahead to our full year outlook on Slide 13. On an as-reported basis and as shown in our reconciliations, we expect our fiscal year '17 EPS to be in the range of $3.97 to $4.45. These earnings are expected to translate into $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flows. 
On an ongoing basis, our fiscal year '17 ongoing earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.90, reflecting the growth we expect for the year. 
Despite the fact that the year-over-year change in currency rates was modestly favorable for us in the first quarter of '17, we continue to assume that the changing rates will have a relatively neutral effect on a full year basis given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against several currencies.
Our Seeds and Genomics segment's gross profit is still expected to increase mid-single digits as a percent year-over-year, with soybean gross profit alone expected to grow by more than 20%, driven by new trait penetration and anticipated cost of goods sold reduction. 
In corn, growth is expected to come from global genetic share gains and global germplasm price-mix lift in local currency that we expect to be flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages. We expect global corn acres to be roughly flat for the full fiscal year, with declines in U.S. corn acreage offset by the early increases in South America. 
Shifting gears, our Ag Productivity gross profit is now expected to be in the range of $850 million to $950 million, reflecting year-over-year price declines in our glyphosate-based herbicides in the first half of the year, offset partially by the benefit of licensing opportunity and expected higher volumes. The adjustment to our gross profit outlook is simply reflecting the fact that the approximate $85 million benefit from the sale of the Latitude business was ultimately recorded in other income for the segment as opposed to gross profit as originally anticipated.
Finally, we expect roughly $100 million of gross profit from strategic licensing deals towards the end of the fiscal year, roughly split between the 2 segments of the business. 
Our restructuring and cost savings initiatives remain on track, as shown on Slide 14. And the estimated cost to deliver those actions and initiatives is now down slightly to approximately $1 billion. We continue to see the opportunity to deliver approximately $380 million in annual savings in operating expenses and cost of goods at the close of fiscal year '17 as compared to fiscal year '15.
However, overall operating expenses in fiscal year '17, setting aside the pending Bayer transaction costs and restructuring expenses, are expected to increase slightly, with inflation in the costs associated with the return to growth of the business more than offsetting our savings. 
The expected tax rate for the year remains in the range of 25% to 28%. 
If we narrow the view to our second quarter, we expect as-reported earnings per share and ongoing earnings per share to be roughly $0.20 to $0.50 better than the prior year. 
Beyond the continued momentum in our corn and soybeans businesses, the expected first half earnings improvements reflects the benefit from the sale of the Latitude business and the absence of a significant portion of the Argentine peso devaluation.
Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect roughly $0.40 less in EPS benefit from strategic deals versus the prior year plus a more challenging currency environment than what we experienced in the first quarter. However, with a strong start in the first quarter and our continued focus on return on innovation and financial discipline, we remain confident in our outlook for fiscal year '17.
With that, I will now pass you to Robb to share the update on the pipeline. Robb?"
528414,405049966,1108014,"Monsanto Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 05, 2017",2017-01-05,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Pierre. Good morning, everyone. So this update is something I look forward to every year. It's a chance to share an overview of the truly unparalleled science that my team is bringing to farmers around the world. I believe our science and our pi",1457,"Thanks, Pierre. Good morning, everyone. So this update is something I look forward to every year. It's a chance to share an overview of the truly unparalleled science that my team is bringing to farmers around the world. 
I believe our science and our pipeline are stronger than ever. In fact, not only is this the fourth consecutive year of more than 20 pipeline advancements, but our advancement class of fiscal year 2017 also brings a record 14 projects advancing to commercial launch. 
As I think about what our teams have accomplished, the most notable highlights are summarized on Slide 3 of the pipeline update deck. What I think is just as impressive as the 28 advancements is the remarkable balance of the advancement class. It showcases the depth and the breadth of the pipeline. And this marks the sixth straight year where projects have advanced across all of our R&D platforms, whether it's breeding, biotech, biologicals, crop protection or digital ag and Climate. 
Climate has made incredible progress this year, and the digital ag pipeline is now the most robust in the industry, with more than 35 projects in R&D, including 6 advancements to commercializations, that are all part of the paid elements of our platform. 
So what does this all translate to? Basically, our core pipeline is expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales, with additional upside if we include our newer platforms like Climate and biologicals. And frankly, I believe the story gets even more exciting with Bayer. We truly see the opportunity to accelerate innovation, optimize integrated solutions and expand offerings, and this translates to significant benefits to farmers. And I'll bring this to life with a few examples later on. 
But first, let's take a look at what our customers can expect from our leading hybrids and varieties, shown on Slide 4. 
Starting with corn, DEKALB continues to deliver the industry's best performance, marked by 11 straight years of outperforming competitive products. And the margin is significant as we see a consistent 7- to 10-bushel per acre average yield advantage. 
Soybeans have outperformed for the seventh consecutive year with a greater than 2-bushel per acre average yield advantage. And cotton continues this trend as well. Deltapine cotton is again outperforming the competition for the seventh consecutive year. So across the board, our breeding engine is delivering results that our customers can count on. 
That industry-leading germplasm performance is being protected by next-generation versions of insect and weed control traits.
Moving to Slide 5. The story here is really around delivering wave after wave of upgrades for corn from additional modes of action to expand the spectrum for insect and weed control. We have significant insect control products coming in SmartStax PRO as well as Trecepta corn. And in weed control, our third-generation product in Phase IV offers tolerance to glyphosate, dicamba and glufosinate to offer growers maximum flexibility in applying the herbicides that make the most sense for their operations. 
Longer term, the fourth-generation insect and weed control traits get even better. And this is really remarkable progress towards developing new products for farmers.
Moving to soybeans on Slide 6. We have the opportunity to extend our leadership with insect and weed control solutions. There's a good reason why we expect Intacta to land on between 45 million and 55 million acres in South America this year. The technology really works well, and the next-generation technology is going to work even better. It has multiple modes of action that not only improve the durability of the platform but also expand the insect spectrum across the broader range of pests that growers care about. And that product is already in Phase IV, along with the third generation of weed control.
Again, much like in corn, the next-generation insect and weed control traits further enhance durability and spectrum, providing new solutions for growers.
Let's now move from the technologies that have been core to our strategy for years to ones that I think could be transformational in the years ahead. There's a huge opportunity with genome editing, and I've talked recently about the number of deals that we've inked in this space. We're now using these tools to develop the next generation of products that will populate our pipeline in coming years. The deal with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard that Hugh referenced is an advancement that has the potential to enable more complex gene edits at an even greater efficiency, and that adds to our growing portfolio of capabilities. 
So with the tools we have at our disposal, we believe we've established a path for developing and commercializing crop improvements based on genome editing. 
Our story in biologicals just continues to get better based on our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, as shown on Slide 7. We're especially excited about Acceleron B-300 SAT and think it could have a fit on more than 90 million acres. And farmers are going to get their first look at this product this year. 
Further, we had another year of outstanding results for our NemaStrike Technology with approximately 2 bushels of yield advantage demonstrated in soybeans and 7 bushels in corn. And we remain on track for a 2018 launch of this blockbuster nematode control product. 
Let me focus now for a few minutes on how the pending combination with Bayer would further accelerate our pipeline and innovation in agriculture, as shown on Slide 8. 
I've talked a lot about the benefits that this combination will bring. And I think the bottom line is this deal is an innovation catalyst, and we expect it to benefit farmers by optimizing and expanding R&D investment and allowing us to really up our game. It will accelerate the pace of scientific innovation and our ability to provide integrated seed, trait and chemistry solutions. And finally, it will allow us to expand our technology platforms into new crops like wheat and geographies like Asia and Africa. 
The combination with Bayer is transformative. It's about putting a complementary pro forma R&D budget of approximately $2.7 billion together to solve the challenges that farmers face and that our industry and society has an obligation to meet.
Let's start with an important example of accelerating innovation based on combining the highly complementary portfolios from Bayer and Monsanto, on Slide 9. 
Today, herbicide tolerance is a cornerstone consideration for farmers making seed purchase decisions across a number of crops. The R&D challenge is that sequential development of first the herbicide and then the accompanying biotech trait takes a long time. So the opportunity lies in developing both trait and chemistry on parallel paths, and doing so can shave years off the delivery time lines of a new herbicide-tolerant system, and the accelerated earnings can be invested into additional areas of R&D. We're pursuing this route with PPO tolerance in our agreement with Sumitomo today, and we've got the opportunity to do even more with Bayer's next-generation herbicide candidates. 
A second example on how the combination with Bayer enables better integrated solutions for farmers is shown on Slide 10. Giving farmers information to select the best combination of seed, trait and crop inputs enables them to make better planting decisions to drive productivity, profitability and sustainability on each field. 
For example, by knowing exactly which portions of a field need immediate attention, being able to precisely identify the exact pathogen and then quickly determine which fungicide is optimal can help mitigate developing crop disease problems. The detailed knowledge of crop genetics, agronomic practices and local weather, combined with Climate's imagery, full season sensor data and machine learning algorithms to identify specific diseases, can alert and guide farmers to make faster and more informed decisions to protect yields from fungal diseases.
So this is where the future of agriculture is heading, and these examples are just some of the possibilities that we see.
So in summary, on Slide 11, it's been another terrific year for the team. We've made phenomenal R&D progress that is balanced across the portfolio. In breeding, we're maintaining the performance advantage that our customers have come to expect. In biotechnology, the story is really about protecting the platforms with newer and better next-generation seed -- next-generation insect and weed control traits, and our new innovation platforms are developing cutting-edge products like B-300 SAT and NemaStrike Technology, along with the 6 new products we've launched in our Climate FieldView platform. 
Our strategy has been focused on optimally integrating these leading platforms, and the combination with Bayer will allow our 2 companies to accelerate the pace of innovation and bring new products to farmers faster through our shared vision.
So with that, I'll pass it on to Laura for Q&A."

At the same time, what I think is just or more important is the continued performance of our products down there. Intacta continues to do incredibly well. As Robb talked about in his update, we have the son of Intacta right behind that. So we're looking before the turn of the decade at launching the second generation of Intacta. Our corn portfolio continues to do extremely well down there. We have those next generations of insect control coming there and then germplasm performance, as Pierre mentioned. So all of those things combined set up nicely to be able to continue to look into the future and see incremental value as we deliver incremental value to the farmer, currency being a piece of that but also the performance of the products."

So I think first of all, as you recognize, there's a variety of gene editing tools. There's protein-based. There's nucleic acid-based. And just in the last few weeks, there's been a couple of publications on 2 brand-new gene editing systems that have been discovered. In any case, what these tools allow you to do is to go in and precisely change basically any base pair or any gene in a crop. And so they're a very powerful tool for making precise changes. I think the other thing that's important to highlight is you still need a world-class breeding engine, a testing network in order to identify and evaluate the best combinations. And those gene editing traits are going to be introduced into corn and soybean and cotton, stacked with the biotech traits that are defining the marketplace today. So we see them very complementary to the breeding and trait engines that we have developed, and I think they will allow us to further accelerate that rate of gain. And I think the fact that we've now concluded licensing agreements with some of the major players in innovative technologies puts us in a great position to take advantage of these products. I mean, some of the first gene editing products in some of the smaller crops are working their way through the regulatory system. As I indicated in my comments, we're now fully utilizing these tools, and certainly by the beginning or middle of the next decade, we will see these gene editing products work their way into the marketplace. Really an exciting technology, and I think we've created a strong position moving forward into the space."

Chris, I think your core question on what have been the pleasant surprises is maybe the hardest question I get this morning because we've had some terrific results across the platform. I mean, you saw the breeding results. They're great. And with the genome-wide sequencing, with the expansion of our testing facilities that we'll have in the southern U.S. to do more of that work in the greenhouse, we expect to see breeding gains accelerate. We're in a privileged position with building on the fourth and fifth generation of traits. If you had a chance to go through our tour this summer, we've discovered more new insect control genes in the last year than the industry has discovered in its entire history. So that's a great surprise. I flagged the progress in Climate. I mean, to have now 35 projects in their pipeline, they are hitting on the -- on all cylinders. And when you go to our new innovations area, I mean, we're probably talking about being able to launch the largest microbial product ever with B-300 SAT. The gene editing tools have really matured quickly in our hands, and I think the NemaStrike product is going to be a blockbuster product in our portfolio. So it's hard to pick favorites. There's been some really exciting progress this year."

We've been at this for some time now, working with the farmers and the government to get a system in place. And we had one, and that got disrupted. But the good news was last summer in about June, there was a resolution that put it back in place, where we could have mandatory testing as well as invoicing. That resolution has been extended. So that gives us an opportunity for the next growing season, that we could, not just this one but as we think about the next one, the coalition is working extensively with the government to build a new seed law. The previous seed law that you referenced with the 3-year, for the industry, is a nonstarter. I mean, 3 years, compared to the rest of the world with the teens years of intellectual property protection, is a nonstarter. So that would not encourage us to bring any additional technology to Argentina. At the same time, there is receptivity within the government and in conversations to look for a seed law that addresses their concerns and the industry's concerns and get to a place where it encourages investment in agriculture. And to do that, you need to reward those that are driving innovation. So we're prepared to continue to drive the innovation, as Robb noted, in our soybean portfolio. Most of those products have a great fit in Argentina, but until we see an improved situation and have more confidence around the value, we'll stick with just working with Intacta right now, and then we'll look to others as the situation evolves."

I don't think that it's -- some -- one of the early questions was growth beyond '17 and the acceleration in growth beyond '17. We don't see China being a major contributor to that in the next 2, 3, 4 years. It's going to take a lot longer, I think.

So as we close out this morning, it's clear that the year ahead will be a significant one for Monsanto, and we're really clearly focused on our 2 key deliverables. 
To that end, our plan to return to EPS growth in '17 is tracking nicely. We're encouraged, and we've passed our first significant milestone with really strong shareowner support on the agreement to combine with Bayer.

Also joining me from the Investor Relations team are Priyal Patel and Ben Kampelman.
Today, we will provide our annual R&D pipeline update on this call, as led by Dr. Fraley, as well as an overview of our first quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.
We've provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary -- may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First, let me review our first quarter results, as shown on Slide 4. As shown in our reconciliations, we delivered as-reported earnings per share of $0.07 in the first quarter, which included $0.19 of pending Bayer-related transaction costs. 
On an ongoing basis, earnings per share were $0.21 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, well above the prior year ongoing loss of $0.11, driven by the expected strong start to our business in South America and improved currency. 
With that brief overview, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

As we move into the second quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to remain focused on 2 things: continuing to deliver on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones and working closely",964,"Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. As we move into the second quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to remain focused on 2 things: continuing to deliver on the 2017 operational plan and key business milestones and working closely with Bayer on the necessary steps to close the deal, which is targeted for the end of calendar year 2017.
Let's begin with an update on the deal, which is shown on Slide 5. First, we're pleased to see the strong shareowner support for the proposal to combine with Bayer, with approximately 99% of the votes cast in support of the combination. 
With the vote behind us, our team is working with Bayer on the required regulatory filings and continued key stakeholder outreach. The Hart-Scott-Rodino filings have been made in the U.S. along with several filings in other jurisdictions, and we anticipate submission of the required filing in the EU in the first calendar quarter of this year. 
We continue to expect the transaction to close by the end of 2017, and our confidence stems from the fact that these are 2 different but highly complementary businesses with limited overlap. Where those overlaps do exist, however, Bayer anticipates and is committed to undertake a certain level of divestitures as required by the regulatory agencies. 
Also, both Robb and I have been personally involved in extensive grower outreach as well as discussions with key policymakers and politicians, sharing our views on the innovation enhancements that we envision from this combination. Innovation is the foundation of the industrial logic for the combination with Bayer just as it was with the consolidation that we led in the industry back in the late '90s. And innovation creates jobs and it creates opportunities for both consumers and for our growers. This deal takes what we've been doing for the last 15 years to a whole new level, with St. Louis as the heartland for seeds and biotech research for the new company worldwide. 
15 years ago, we were spending roughly $550 million a year on R&D. This year, we'll spend approximately $1.5 billion on R&D, and we look forward to the combined levels of R&D that we anticipate investing on innovation for growers through the combination with Bayer.
Growers seek this innovation opportunity because they recognize that resources are finite, demand is real, and productivity improvement is the key to their success. The USDA demand figures have indicated that over the past 4 seasons, world demand for corn grew by over 4 billion bushels while soy demand in the same time frame grew by over 2 billion bushels. 
The December WASDE report indicated continued strength, with corn demand for the current marketing year growing by over 1.4 billion bushels and soy demand growing by over 500 million bushels. In fact, as seen on Slide 6, meeting that trend-line demand on a relatively stable footprint over the next decade would require a twofold increase in the rate of yield gain for corn and a fourfold increase for soybeans.
So the innovation that we expect to deliver with our leading technology platforms, as shown on Slide 7, will be necessary to increase productivity to meet this projected demand, and we expect the combination with Bayer to amplify that rate of innovation.
It all starts with our industry-leading seed and trait technologies, which reach approximately 400 million acres today as a result of our broad licensing approach, which Bayer has indicated that they will continue. This footprint serves as the foundation for future germplasm upgrades, new trait technologies, seed treatments through our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes and finally, our unique and rapidly expanding Climate FieldView platform. 
To reinforce our innovation platform leadership, we continue to expand our capabilities in genome editing, including a new agreement with the Broad Institute. 
Our desire is to expand this strong innovation core also stems from the myriad of game-changing opportunities that we see on the horizon. We are very clearly entering a new era in agriculture. Hundreds of new entrants invested more than $4.5 billion of venture capital in agriculture in 2015, which is more than 10x the investment from just 5 short years ago. More players than ever are seeking to provide new technologies to growers to enhance productivity both profitably and sustainably. This is for good reason. Demand requires it, and we are pleased to see the investment to spur this needed innovation. 
Our shared vision with Bayer is to harness this wave of innovation and more optimally integrate it into a format that's usable and insightful to growers, primarily through our Climate FieldView platform. By pairing Bayer's exceptional crop protection portfolio with our seeds and traits and Climate FieldView platforms, we expect farmers to benefit from accelerated innovation, expanded geographic and crop offerings and optimized integrated solutions from science-based recommendations. 
An investment space that secures a sustainable food supply needs and deserves this improved rate of innovation. So today, Robb will expand on these examples as well as on our own pipeline update. 
So we look forward to updating you on the status of the deal as we move through this year. Until then, we're committed to operate as an independent company focused on delivering on our plans for fiscal year '17 as well as our key business milestones. 
With growth in our Q1 results and outstanding demand for our new soybean technologies, we continue to expect a return to earnings per share growth for the full year. As Pierre will elaborate, we're reconfirming our full year ongoing earnings per share and free cash flow guidance with a small increase in our as-reported earnings per share outlook.
So with that brief summary, let me pass it to Brett to elaborate on our operational path to deliver in 2017. Brett?"
528414,405049966,1108290,"Monsanto Company, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 05, 2017",2017-01-05,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin our operational outlook for fiscal year 2017 with corn, as shown on Slide 8, where we continue to expect corn gross profit growth from global price mix gains, genetic share gains and acreage momentum i",829,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin our operational outlook for fiscal year 2017 with corn, as shown on Slide 8, where we continue to expect corn gross profit growth from global price mix gains, genetic share gains and acreage momentum in South America. 
In the first quarter, we saw a greater than 25% increase in planted corn acres in Argentina and more than a 10% increase in corn acres planted in Brazil. This was accompanied by double-digit price increases in corn germplasm in local currency in both countries. 
In the U.S., the early read on the order book supports our intention to grow genetic share yet again. We've priced the majority of our existing hybrids flat to down slightly, with our new hybrids at a premium, maintaining our premium pricing compared to our competition. 
Demand for Year 1 hybrids remains exceptionally strong, and we are now in a sold-out position. Also, SmartStax remains a steady percent of our overall portfolio. 
In addition, we're prepared to respond as necessary to any emerging competitive dynamics, but we've not seen any unusual levels of discounting to date. 
In soybeans, we expect to reach several significant milestones in 2017, as shown on Slide 9. We're off to a good start and still plan to reach an expected 45 million to 55 million acres of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO soybeans in South America, as shown on Slide 10. We expect the vast majority of this footprint will be in Brazil. 
In Argentina, we've seen continued progress toward maintaining a reliable value capture. Recent renewal of the government resolution that enables a testing and invoicing protocol was positive, and we continue to work with the industry coalition to secure a seed bill that encourages and rewards investment.
Continuing with soybeans on Slide 11. We're well supplied for more than 15 million U.S. acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, and our order book reflects the overwhelming pent-up demand for this technology. 
With the EPA approval for in-crop use of dicamba in hand, and as of this morning, we've now already received nearly 3/4 of the necessary state approvals for both soybeans and cotton, which covers the vast majority of the acres, and we expect to have the rest before planting. 
We are conducting extensive training on the use of Xtendimax and the Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System, delivering multiple training opportunities and tools to provide customers with an excellent experience with the technology.
Moving to our cotton business. We had a strong start in the first quarter with increased acres in Australia. And in the U.S., we now expect the Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton area to exceed 4 million acres, including a per-acre trait premium. 
Additionally, this season, we will have an introductory release of Bollgard 3 XtendFlex Cotton, with a full-scale launch planned for 2018. This is the first cotton product ever to combine 3 modes of action for both insect and weed control. 
Finally, we expect 2017 to be the third consecutive year of share growth in U.S. cotton, coming on the heels of more than 8 points of branded and licensed share growth in 2016.
In Ag Productivity, we are focused on the launch of Xtendimax herbicide with VaporGrip Technology. 
In addition, generic glyphosate prices have continued to trend favorably over the course of the last several months, and our strategy to price just above generics with our glyphosate-based herbicides has already led to some small price increases in the U.S. We also saw a nice uptick in glyphosate volumes in our first quarter. However, we did experience the expected glyphosate pricing headwinds and anticipate those will continue into the second quarter as the current global pricing is lower than the prior comparable period. 
As a partial offset, we just recently signed an agreement to sell our Latitude wheat fungicide business for $140 million. Subject to the closure, we expect to receive an EBIT benefit of approximately $85 million in this segment in the second quarter. 
This sale is part of our continued efforts to focus and optimize our product portfolio and puts the asset into the hands of Mitsui, who has more potential to drive a greater level of value out of the asset.
And finally, Climate FieldView, as shown on Slide 12, continues to see major advancements as the business and the platform continues to evolve. We released 4 new product enhancements for 2017, and these upgrades, together with outstanding demand for FieldView Plus and Drive, have us well down the path to our goal of 25 million paid acres. 
Simultaneously, we expect to add several more partners to the platform in the coming year and continue to grow geographically, with expansion expected in the U.S., Europe, Brazil and Canada this year, and in addition, to plans to launch in Australia, Argentina and South Africa in the next few years.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?"

Let's start with a review of the first quarter. As expected, ongoing results came in better than the prior year on the strength of our Southern Hemisphere business. Our soybean gross profit is up by approximate",783,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Let's start with a review of the first quarter. As expected, ongoing results came in better than the prior year on the strength of our Southern Hemisphere business. Our soybean gross profit is up by approximately 50% in the first quarter, with 6 points of gross margin improvement led by Intacta penetration and currency benefits. Corn gross profit grew by more than 30% due primarily to double-digit price-mix lift in local currency in both Brazil and Argentina and from strong growth in acres planted in both countries. 
Finally, total operating spend decreased, with reduced restructuring expense more than offsetting increases from the pending Bayer transaction cost, currency and growth in commissions in South America. 
Our Q1 free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion reflects strong U.S. cash prepayments and includes the payment of the previously accrued PCB personal injury settlement. 
Let's move ahead to our full year outlook on Slide 13. On an as-reported basis and as shown in our reconciliations, we expect our fiscal year '17 EPS to be in the range of $3.97 to $4.45. These earnings are expected to translate into $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flows. 
On an ongoing basis, our fiscal year '17 ongoing earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.90, reflecting the growth we expect for the year. 
Despite the fact that the year-over-year change in currency rates was modestly favorable for us in the first quarter of '17, we continue to assume that the changing rates will have a relatively neutral effect on a full year basis given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against several currencies.
Our Seeds and Genomics segment's gross profit is still expected to increase mid-single digits as a percent year-over-year, with soybean gross profit alone expected to grow by more than 20%, driven by new trait penetration and anticipated cost of goods sold reduction. 
In corn, growth is expected to come from global genetic share gains and global germplasm price-mix lift in local currency that we expect to be flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages. We expect global corn acres to be roughly flat for the full fiscal year, with declines in U.S. corn acreage offset by the early increases in South America. 
Shifting gears, our Ag Productivity gross profit is now expected to be in the range of $850 million to $950 million, reflecting year-over-year price declines in our glyphosate-based herbicides in the first half of the year, offset partially by the benefit of licensing opportunity and expected higher volumes. The adjustment to our gross profit outlook is simply reflecting the fact that the approximate $85 million benefit from the sale of the Latitude business was ultimately recorded in other income for the segment as opposed to gross profit as originally anticipated.
Finally, we expect roughly $100 million of gross profit from strategic licensing deals towards the end of the fiscal year, roughly split between the 2 segments of the business. 
Our restructuring and cost savings initiatives remain on track, as shown on Slide 14. And the estimated cost to deliver those actions and initiatives is now down slightly to approximately $1 billion. We continue to see the opportunity to deliver approximately $380 million in annual savings in operating expenses and cost of goods at the close of fiscal year '17 as compared to fiscal year '15.
However, overall operating expenses in fiscal year '17, setting aside the pending Bayer transaction costs and restructuring expenses, are expected to increase slightly, with inflation in the costs associated with the return to growth of the business more than offsetting our savings. 
The expected tax rate for the year remains in the range of 25% to 28%. 
If we narrow the view to our second quarter, we expect as-reported earnings per share and ongoing earnings per share to be roughly $0.20 to $0.50 better than the prior year. 
Beyond the continued momentum in our corn and soybeans businesses, the expected first half earnings improvements reflects the benefit from the sale of the Latitude business and the absence of a significant portion of the Argentine peso devaluation.
Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect roughly $0.40 less in EPS benefit from strategic deals versus the prior year plus a more challenging currency environment than what we experienced in the first quarter. However, with a strong start in the first quarter and our continued focus on return on innovation and financial discipline, we remain confident in our outlook for fiscal year '17.
With that, I will now pass you to Robb to share the update on the pipeline. Robb?"

So this update is something I look forward to every year. It's a chance to share an overview of the truly unparalleled science that my team is bringing to farmers around the world. I believe our science and our pi",1457,"Thanks, Pierre. Good morning, everyone. So this update is something I look forward to every year. It's a chance to share an overview of the truly unparalleled science that my team is bringing to farmers around the world. 
I believe our science and our pipeline are stronger than ever. In fact, not only is this the fourth consecutive year of more than 20 pipeline advancements, but our advancement class of fiscal year 2017 also brings a record 14 projects advancing to commercial launch. 
As I think about what our teams have accomplished, the most notable highlights are summarized on Slide 3 of the pipeline update deck. What I think is just as impressive as the 28 advancements is the remarkable balance of the advancement class. It showcases the depth and the breadth of the pipeline. And this marks the sixth straight year where projects have advanced across all of our R&D platforms, whether it's breeding, biotech, biologicals, crop protection or digital ag and Climate. 
Climate has made incredible progress this year, and the digital ag pipeline is now the most robust in the industry, with more than 35 projects in R&D, including 6 advancements to commercializations, that are all part of the paid elements of our platform. 
So what does this all translate to? Basically, our core pipeline is expected to deliver up to $25 billion in peak net sales, with additional upside if we include our newer platforms like Climate and biologicals. And frankly, I believe the story gets even more exciting with Bayer. We truly see the opportunity to accelerate innovation, optimize integrated solutions and expand offerings, and this translates to significant benefits to farmers. And I'll bring this to life with a few examples later on. 
But first, let's take a look at what our customers can expect from our leading hybrids and varieties, shown on Slide 4. 
Starting with corn, DEKALB continues to deliver the industry's best performance, marked by 11 straight years of outperforming competitive products. And the margin is significant as we see a consistent 7- to 10-bushel per acre average yield advantage. 
Soybeans have outperformed for the seventh consecutive year with a greater than 2-bushel per acre average yield advantage. And cotton continues this trend as well. Deltapine cotton is again outperforming the competition for the seventh consecutive year. So across the board, our breeding engine is delivering results that our customers can count on. 
That industry-leading germplasm performance is being protected by next-generation versions of insect and weed control traits.
Moving to Slide 5. The story here is really around delivering wave after wave of upgrades for corn from additional modes of action to expand the spectrum for insect and weed control. We have significant insect control products coming in SmartStax PRO as well as Trecepta corn. And in weed control, our third-generation product in Phase IV offers tolerance to glyphosate, dicamba and glufosinate to offer growers maximum flexibility in applying the herbicides that make the most sense for their operations. 
Longer term, the fourth-generation insect and weed control traits get even better. And this is really remarkable progress towards developing new products for farmers.
Moving to soybeans on Slide 6. We have the opportunity to extend our leadership with insect and weed control solutions. There's a good reason why we expect Intacta to land on between 45 million and 55 million acres in South America this year. The technology really works well, and the next-generation technology is going to work even better. It has multiple modes of action that not only improve the durability of the platform but also expand the insect spectrum across the broader range of pests that growers care about. And that product is already in Phase IV, along with the third generation of weed control.
Again, much like in corn, the next-generation insect and weed control traits further enhance durability and spectrum, providing new solutions for growers.
Let's now move from the technologies that have been core to our strategy for years to ones that I think could be transformational in the years ahead. There's a huge opportunity with genome editing, and I've talked recently about the number of deals that we've inked in this space. We're now using these tools to develop the next generation of products that will populate our pipeline in coming years. The deal with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard that Hugh referenced is an advancement that has the potential to enable more complex gene edits at an even greater efficiency, and that adds to our growing portfolio of capabilities. 
So with the tools we have at our disposal, we believe we've established a path for developing and commercializing crop improvements based on genome editing. 
Our story in biologicals just continues to get better based on our BioAg Alliance with Novozymes, as shown on Slide 7. We're especially excited about Acceleron B-300 SAT and think it could have a fit on more than 90 million acres. And farmers are going to get their first look at this product this year. 
Further, we had another year of outstanding results for our NemaStrike Technology with approximately 2 bushels of yield advantage demonstrated in soybeans and 7 bushels in corn. And we remain on track for a 2018 launch of this blockbuster nematode control product. 
Let me focus now for a few minutes on how the pending combination with Bayer would further accelerate our pipeline and innovation in agriculture, as shown on Slide 8. 
I've talked a lot about the benefits that this combination will bring. And I think the bottom line is this deal is an innovation catalyst, and we expect it to benefit farmers by optimizing and expanding R&D investment and allowing us to really up our game. It will accelerate the pace of scientific innovation and our ability to provide integrated seed, trait and chemistry solutions. And finally, it will allow us to expand our technology platforms into new crops like wheat and geographies like Asia and Africa. 
The combination with Bayer is transformative. It's about putting a complementary pro forma R&D budget of approximately $2.7 billion together to solve the challenges that farmers face and that our industry and society has an obligation to meet.
Let's start with an important example of accelerating innovation based on combining the highly complementary portfolios from Bayer and Monsanto, on Slide 9. 
Today, herbicide tolerance is a cornerstone consideration for farmers making seed purchase decisions across a number of crops. The R&D challenge is that sequential development of first the herbicide and then the accompanying biotech trait takes a long time. So the opportunity lies in developing both trait and chemistry on parallel paths, and doing so can shave years off the delivery time lines of a new herbicide-tolerant system, and the accelerated earnings can be invested into additional areas of R&D. We're pursuing this route with PPO tolerance in our agreement with Sumitomo today, and we've got the opportunity to do even more with Bayer's next-generation herbicide candidates. 
A second example on how the combination with Bayer enables better integrated solutions for farmers is shown on Slide 10. Giving farmers information to select the best combination of seed, trait and crop inputs enables them to make better planting decisions to drive productivity, profitability and sustainability on each field. 
For example, by knowing exactly which portions of a field need immediate attention, being able to precisely identify the exact pathogen and then quickly determine which fungicide is optimal can help mitigate developing crop disease problems. The detailed knowledge of crop genetics, agronomic practices and local weather, combined with Climate's imagery, full season sensor data and machine learning algorithms to identify specific diseases, can alert and guide farmers to make faster and more informed decisions to protect yields from fungal diseases.
So this is where the future of agriculture is heading, and these examples are just some of the possibilities that we see.
So in summary, on Slide 11, it's been another terrific year for the team. We've made phenomenal R&D progress that is balanced across the portfolio. In breeding, we're maintaining the performance advantage that our customers have come to expect. In biotechnology, the story is really about protecting the platforms with newer and better next-generation seed -- next-generation insect and weed control traits, and our new innovation platforms are developing cutting-edge products like B-300 SAT and NemaStrike Technology, along with the 6 new products we've launched in our Climate FieldView platform. 
Our strategy has been focused on optimally integrating these leading platforms, and the combination with Bayer will allow our 2 companies to accelerate the pace of innovation and bring new products to farmers faster through our shared vision.
So with that, I'll pass it on to Laura for Q&A."

At the same time, what I think is just or more important is the continued performance of our products down there. Intacta continues to do incredibly well. As Robb talked about in his update, we have the son of Intacta right behind that. So we're looking before the turn of the decade at launching the second generation of Intacta. Our corn portfolio continues to do extremely well down there. We have those next generations of insect control coming there and then germplasm performance, as Pierre mentioned. So all of those things combined set up nicely to be able to continue to look into the future and see incremental value as we deliver incremental value to the farmer, currency being a piece of that but also the performance of the products."

So I think first of all, as you recognize, there's a variety of gene editing tools. There's protein-based. There's nucleic acid-based. And just in the last few weeks, there's been a couple of publications on 2 brand-new gene editing systems that have been discovered. In any case, what these tools allow you to do is to go in and precisely change basically any base pair or any gene in a crop. And so they're a very powerful tool for making precise changes. I think the other thing that's important to highlight is you still need a world-class breeding engine, a testing network in order to identify and evaluate the best combinations. And those gene editing traits are going to be introduced into corn and soybean and cotton, stacked with the biotech traits that are defining the marketplace today. So we see them very complementary to the breeding and trait engines that we have developed, and I think they will allow us to further accelerate that rate of gain. And I think the fact that we've now concluded licensing agreements with some of the major players in innovative technologies puts us in a great position to take advantage of these products. I mean, some of the first gene editing products in some of the smaller crops are working their way through the regulatory system. As I indicated in my comments, we're now fully utilizing these tools, and certainly by the beginning or middle of the next decade, we will see these gene editing products work their way into the marketplace. Really an exciting technology, and I think we've created a strong position moving forward into the space."

It's always nice to talk about pleasant surprises at the start of a new year. In terms of the balance between what our customers are asking for and what R&D is producing, you never get complete synchrony in that, but I think over time, we've done really well in 2 areas. One is anticipating what growers need. Robb made the point that Xtend took 7 years to get through the EPA, and that's been a frustration, where the limits haven't been great science; the limits have been the regulatory pace, and we sincerely hope that that's going to change. And then I think the other great thing that we've been successful in, and this balance that you refer to, Chris, is having second-, third- and then sometimes fourth-generation products sequentially developed so that as we are growing acres and meeting demand, we've got the next product in development and ready to move through.

And so we're trying to bring all of this together to make the right solutions happen for farmers. Chris, I think your core question on what have been the pleasant surprises is maybe the hardest question I get this morning because we've had some terrific results across the platform. I mean, you saw the breeding results. They're great. And with the genome-wide sequencing, with the expansion of our testing facilities that we'll have in the southern U.S. to do more of that work in the greenhouse, we expect to see breeding gains accelerate. We're in a privileged position with building on the fourth and fifth generation of traits. If you had a chance to go through our tour this summer, we've discovered more new insect control genes in the last year than the industry has discovered in its entire history. So that's a great surprise. I flagged the progress in Climate. I mean, to have now 35 projects in their pipeline, they are hitting on the -- on all cylinders. And when you go to our new innovations area, I mean, we're probably talking about being able to launch the largest microbial product ever with B-300 SAT. The gene editing tools have really matured quickly in our hands, and I think the NemaStrike product is going to be a blockbuster product in our portfolio. So it's hard to pick favorites. There's been some really exciting progress this year."

I think the key thing about, as we look at the first quarter, what transpired in the first quarter with glyphosate is very consistent with what we expected. We expected our pricing to be less than the comparable period to last year. That being said, we do see really positive indicators, as Hugh noted, with the as-in [ph] prices starting to move in China in the right trend line, or a positive trend line. We're seeing that starting to show up in the generics. That's what gave us the opportunity to make the small adjustment in our price to the positive side in the U.S. We continue to watch the rest of the markets around the world, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities. And I -- my anticipation at this point is we'll continue to move in that direction for the reason that you noted. It's not been an exciting business for many of them. The other point that I would make is not only did we see some improvement in that area, our volumes were really strong in the first quarter in our branded business.So I feel really good about our position in the marketplace and how we're priced, and the trend lines are favorable at this point."

We've been at this for some time now, working with the farmers and the government to get a system in place. And we had one, and that got disrupted. But the good news was last summer in about June, there was a resolution that put it back in place, where we could have mandatory testing as well as invoicing. That resolution has been extended. So that gives us an opportunity for the next growing season, that we could, not just this one but as we think about the next one, the coalition is working extensively with the government to build a new seed law. The previous seed law that you referenced with the 3-year, for the industry, is a nonstarter. I mean, 3 years, compared to the rest of the world with the teens years of intellectual property protection, is a nonstarter. So that would not encourage us to bring any additional technology to Argentina. At the same time, there is receptivity within the government and in conversations to look for a seed law that addresses their concerns and the industry's concerns and get to a place where it encourages investment in agriculture. And to do that, you need to reward those that are driving innovation. So we're prepared to continue to drive the innovation, as Robb noted, in our soybean portfolio. Most of those products have a great fit in Argentina, but until we see an improved situation and have more confidence around the value, we'll stick with just working with Intacta right now, and then we'll look to others as the situation evolves."

This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.
We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both the GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect the actual results.
First, let me share our second quarter results as shown on Slide 4. As outlined in our reconciliations, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $3.09 and ongoing earnings per share of $3.19 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, well above the prior year as reported earnings per share of $2.41 and ongoing earnings per share of $2.42.

The end of the second quarter allows us to gauge progress against our 2 priorities for the year: number one, to deliver our fiscal year 2017 operational plan and key milestones; and number two, to",1036,"Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. The end of the second quarter allows us to gauge progress against our 2 priorities for the year: number one, to deliver our fiscal year 2017 operational plan and key milestones; and number two, to close the merger with Bayer. So let's start first with the deal as shown on Slide 6. Bayer has led the regulatory filing process with support from Monsanto, as appropriate, and as they indicated in their year-end earnings call, both parties are working towards closure at the end of the calendar year. They continue to expect the filing to be made with the EU Commission this calendar quarter, and progress has been made with the second request from the U.S. Department of Justice. Like you, we also see the other proposed combinations advancing as this industry undergoes a necessary and a healthy transformation to serve farmers better around the world.
As the process moves forward, our emphasis at Monsanto is always been on bringing much needed innovation to growers. Robb and I have spent significant time sharing our prospectus with ag industry organizations, policymakers and grower groups on the benefits of this deal. Innovation is at the heart of the industrial logic for combining with Bayer just as it was with the consolidation that we led in the industry 20 years ago.
Since then, we've seen scores of biotech, breeding and crop technology improvements, and our view is that the next 20 years will raise the level of agronomic performance even further. Very simply, this deal is about accelerating innovation, optimizing integrated solutions and expanding the offerings that will be available to farmers through broad licensing globally and the years to come. From delivering new choices even faster to expanding solutions in disease and insect control, our combination with Bayer is a real gateway to exciting possibilities in ag science, as shown on Slide 7.
And it doesn't stop there. We think greater focus can be brought to historically underfunded crops like wheat as well as opportunities and geographies where agriculture could benefit from improvements in scale in parts of Asia and certainly, in Africa.
After outlining examples like these with growers, one thing is very clear: they want innovation and they fully recognize the role that it plays in bringing them solutions to run profitable and sustainable operations necessary to meet the demand curves.
This overarching need to produce more hasn't changed. In fact, as seen on Slide 8, demand continues to strengthen. The trend line from forecasts projects that annual demand for corn and beans is expected to rise. Growth expectations for just the 2016, 2017 marketing year translates to demand for an incremental 1.7 billion bushels for corn and more than 600 million bushels for soybeans. To put that into context, if this incremental demand were met by new production acres in the U.S. alone, that would require more than 20 million new acres of corn and soybeans combined.
And as shown on Slide 9, as Monsanto's proven innovation and unique platform advantages that position us well to meet these challenges and what makes us such an attractive complementary partner for Bayer. However, we're not set in and we continue to invest in our future. We're building upon our industry-leading Climate FieldView platform, a strong foundation of seed, trait consistent solutions, particularly with our next-generation technologies and insect and control.
Shortly after we spoke back in January, we broke ground on Louisiana glyphosate production site to make way for our first-ever dicamba production facility, expected to come online at the end of this decade. This plant, together with capacity being added by the industry, will be an integral part of delivering the top weed control system throughout the Americas. We're stocking with the fastest trait ramp-ups in our company's history with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans and Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton. Longer term, we're building out our leading platforms with investment in R&D capabilities. We nearly completed the initial phase of our planned $400 million test field R&D site expansion, and we expect that the ribbon cutting will be later this year.
In addition, typical pipeline projects are progressing well, including our blockbuster NemaStrike Technology with exceptional nematode control. The public comment period for the EPA approval process for this new technology recently closed with positive feedback, and we're now well on track for commercialization next year. Also, we reached another significant positive milestone and the reregistration of glyphosate in Europe with the European Chemicals Agency concluding that glyphosate is not a carcinogen. Once again, this alliance with more than 800 studies spanning 4 decades all confirm the safety of this critical farming tool. In fact, this same conclusion has been reached by the U.S. EPA, the European Food Safety Authority and regulators in Japan and Canada and numerous other countries. So despite some headlines to the contrary, some science from respected organizations continues to prevail. 
And finally, on the business. We've done excellent first half, delivering $3.39 of ongoing earnings per share as compared to $2.25 in the prior year. Our gross profit improved nearly 20% in the first half, due primarily to strong pricing and area expansion in cotton in South America and the strong performance of our newest soybean trait technologies. This growth in gross profit coupled with the absence of the Argentina devaluation and the gain on the Latitude sale has propelled this strong start to the fiscal year. Given these results and our increased confidence in the outlook for the rest of the year, our guidance for fiscal year '17 now moves to the high end of the range for both as reported and ongoing of EPS.
So all in all, I'm very proud of our team and their focus on our business. We're making strides towards closure on the pending combination. Our record-breaking technology penetration continues to drive earnings growth and are investing for the longer term and R&D. And we do all of these through our single and strategic lens to continue to bring value-added innovation to growers around the globe.
So with that overview, let me pass it to Brett to discuss the operational plans that support this outlook. Brett?"

Our focus on delivering the business has continued through the second quarter and places our company on a path to provide earnings growth through the turn of the decade. To help illustrate how, let's begin the ope",845,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Our focus on delivering the business has continued through the second quarter and places our company on a path to provide earnings growth through the turn of the decade. To help illustrate how, let's begin the operational outlook with corn, as shown on Slide 10. We continue to expect to grow our corn gross profit even as the commodity prices remain challenging in the mid- to high $3 range. This is driven by global germplasm price-mix lift in local currency and genetic share gains despite expectations that the global planted acres could now decline slightly. Starting in the U.S. with an early spring, our Q2 deliveries were ahead of expectations and provided some timing benefit. In addition, I'm pleased to share that we're sold out of our first year Disease Shield hybrids, which also came with our newest microbial seed treatment, Acceleron B300 SAT. In Brazil, double-digit price-mix lift in local currency continues in the second quarter, and we're seeing strong demand for VT Triple PRO traded hybrids. In Argentina, we now are estimating even greater acres at more than 40%. And finally, Europe remains on track with strong grower demand driving volumes in the second quarter though we do expect some decline in acres planted compared to last year.
Let's move to our soybean franchise on Slide 11 next. We're very excited about the story developing here. We're on pace to deliver greater than 25% growth in global soybean gross profit and are seeing nice margin improvement year-over-year. Our ramp of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in the United States is now moving fast, as shown on Slide 12. We have all the approvals in place for Xtendimax with Group Technology for the key soybean growing states we're seeking with the exception of Arkansas. We're also pleased to see that the recent EPA approvals of numerous tank mix partners, including glyphosate, providing industry-leading weed control and a convenient tool for growers. Seed supply is excellent, and we now expect 18 million acres of traded varieties to be planted from Mississippi to Minnesota. This demand-driven increase from our prior estimates matches our largest trait launch ever and all together, at 18 million acres, would be the highest penetration we've ever achieved in the second year of a trait launch. 
Moving to South America on Slide 13, performance of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro continues to demonstrate its advantage over competing varieties. We are in the early days of evaluating the first wave of our own yield trials. This adds to our confidence in the 45 million to 55 million acre range for the technology this year as Intacta continues to saturate penetration records. In Argentina, our planning assumption is there is a continuation of the current royalty capture system for the upcoming season. Our other crops are also seeing steady growth, starting with cotton on Slide 14. Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton is now expected to exceed 4 million acres in the U.S., which will be a driver towards our target of delivering our third straight year of share gains. On top of that, we're starting to sell Bollgard 3 XtendFlex cotton in the U.S. this year to further increase the spectrum and durability of insect control.
Moving to our Climate business on Slide 15. We're seeing major advancements in a number of areas. Digital ag tools are rapidly evolving, and the strategic differentiators for the Climate FieldView really set it apart. Collaborations and partnerships with others in this space as well as our pace of adoption and expansion have established our leadership role. Interest in joining our platform has been strong, and we're currently in discussions with more than 25 potential technology providers. We remain on track to deliver our fiscal year target of 25 million paid acres. And geographically, experience with the platform is growing in the U.S, Europe, Canada and Brazil, as shown on Slide 16. In fact, in Brazil, some of the largest growers in the country are using the technology on 750,000 acres. The feedback is good and we're off to a very promising start. Lastly, let's close with Ag Productivity. We're seeing first half price improvements for generic glyphosate acid translate to retail, which we expect to result in modest price improvements in the second half of the year. This anticipated price increase plus volume growth places glyphosate on a more positive trend line, although we do anticipate some higher cost with the increased volumes.
In addition, it was great to see the first shipments of Xtendimax with technology moving to retail, and we expect this to continue in the second half.
In summary, I'll echo Hugh's comments. We delivered a great start to the year, and our operational plans set us up for a strong close. We have tremendous momentum with the record penetration we're seeing with our latest soybean and cotton technologies and continue to anticipate genetic share gains across multiple crops and key geographies.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?"

In Q2, we delivered as-reported earnings of $3.09 per share and an ongoing earnings of $3.19 per share. These translated to growth of more than 28% in both as-reported and ongoing earnings per share and was mostly driven by 3 things: more than $300 million of gross profit growth from our corn and soybean businesses; the absence of the approximate 180 million impact of the Argentine peso devaluation; and finally, the 83 million gain from the sale of the Latitude business recorded in other income this quarter. In corn, gross profit grew by 12% in the second quarter and came mainly from Brazil, Europe and the U.S. U.S. corn growth related primarily to improved cost of goods with the return of a more normalized production plan, while Europe and the U.S. combined had a volume-timing benefit of roughly $40 million stemming from strong grower demand. In addition, they both delivered share gains mitigated by expected planted acre declines. Finally the single largest driver came from pricing in Brazil where we continue to see strong double-digit germplasm price increases in local currency. In soybeans, the 19% growth in gross profit and 6 points of margin expansion came from reduced COGS and increase trait revenues from our Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans in the U.S., which were compounded by higher volumes from expected increased soybean acres and share gains. Cotton gross profit also grew nicely in the quarter where we saw more than 50 million in growth in the U.S. This was due largely to a timing benefit from a change in our customer contracts and to a lesser degree, from initial sales of a Bollgard II XtendFlex.
Moving to Ag Productivity. We saw our gross profit for the quarter grew by about 3% over the prior year. Regarding Roundup and our glyphosate-based herbicides, we continue to experience the pricing headwinds we expected. However, at the second level, this was more than offset by incremental glyphosate volumes and the initial sales of our dicamba-based herbicides. Finally, as we expected, operating expenses increased in the quarter, mostly due to the return to growth of the business. These increases were primarily driven by increasing expense, higher commissions in South America and greater investment in the Climate FieldView platform. They were partially offset by the continued savings from our restructuring and transformation actions. We continue to expect these to generate $200 million of operating expense and COGS savings versus the prior year on our path to $500 million of savings by 2018 versus our 2015 baseline, as shown on Slide 17. For cash, for the first half of fiscal year 2017, we delivered nearly $1 billion of free cash flow as compared to $900 million in the prior year. These improvements was driven by the considerable increase in our net income, offset by working capital increases from receivables and inventories and payments for restructuring actions accrued in the prior year. These results reflect our new definition of free cash flow, which is operating cash flows less CapEx. This new definition of free cash flow aligns to the more commonly used definition by publicly traded companies, and we've conformed our historical reporting and our guidance accordingly.
Let's move ahead to our full year outlook on Slide 18. With strong first half results plus the outlook for the rest of the year, we now confidently expect to be at the high end of the as-reported earnings per share range of $3.95 to $4.44 and of the ongoing earnings per share range of $4.50 to $4.90. From a gross profit perspective, we continue to expect our segment gross profit to increase mid-single digits as a percent year-over-year.
In corn, we expect some volume gains from global genetic share gains, particularly in the U.S., to contribute to this gross profit growth. However, we now anticipate acres planted to be down slightly on a global basis with the upside in South America being more than offset by the expected declines in the northern hemisphere. Global germplasm price-mix local currency is still expected to be flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages with strong increases in South America being muted by germplasm price-mix in the U.S. that is expected to be roughly flat. In soybeans, gross profit is expected to now grow by more than 25%, driven by new trait penetration and an anticipated cost of goods sold reduction. In cotton, with the strength of Bollgard II XtendFlex in the U.S. and the return of high-value acres in Australia, the gross profit is expected to grow by more than 35%. Meanwhile, other crops gross profit is expected to decline due to the absence of the onetime $210 million alfalfa technology license payment from Q3 of the prior year. Within Ag Productivity, considering deal dynamics and the variable Brett discussed, our gross profit guidance still remains within the range of $850 million to $950 million, albeit moving more towards the lower end. From a strategic deals perspective, we further mentioned in our discussion we are now expecting the benefit to be somewhat below the earlier estimate of $100 million from licensing and asset sales and now share between the EBIT of our 2 segments in the second half of the fiscal year. This shift is in the projected recording of the Ag Productivity deal benefit to other income. It is the primary reason we are pointing to the lower end of the range for gross profit for that segment. Overall, operating expense in 2017 excluding the pending Bayer transaction cost and restructuring expenses are still expected to increase slightly. This is because inflation and the costs associated with the return to growth of the business are anticipated to more than offset our savings. Finally, our outlook also assumes that changes in currency rates will have a relatively neutral effect on net income for the full year, and we continue to expect the tax rate for the year to be in the range of 25% to 28%. If we look just at Q3, we expect as-reported earnings per share to be roughly flat with the prior year. This is due to the absence of last year's Argentine-related tax matters call-out of $0.50 per share, mostly offset by the expected decline in ongoing earnings per share from the absence of the alfalfa deal, which was roughly $0.34 of earnings last year and the volume timing shift from Q3 to Q2 in the European and U.S. corn businesses.
For the full year, we now anticipate these earnings to translate to the high end of our range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flows, resulting from expected operating cash flows at the high end of the range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion and CapEx of $1.2 billion.
In closing, at the midpoint of our year, we look back on a strong first half, driven by outstanding returns on innovation and financial discipline. As we look forward, we're increasingly confident in the outlook for our business and our continued progress towards closure of the pending combination with Bayer.
With that, I will now pass it to Laura for the Q&A."

So pricing in South America, specifically pricing in Brazil, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, has been extremely strong, and we've seen a nice recovery and some growth in pricing in Brazil. So this has been something we've been observing in the first quarter but also continuing into the market in the second quarter, so that was really a very strong performance in Brazil. And regarding costs, I mean you remember we've always talked about having a penalty last year related to our cost of goods and reduced production plans. This year, we are going back to normal production plans. And as expected, we are seeing an improvement in our cost of goods position. So from a pure margin perspective, these would be the 2 critical drivers. And we've also seen really nice performance in terms of volumes in the U.S, in Europe. Part of that being related to timing. I mean, we've got really nice mild weather during the winter and also expected share gains. And obviously, we'll see that before the end of the year but very strong performance in corn in this quarter, definitely."

I think, as all of you know, the environment for our customers continues to be very difficult with corn prices still, call it, plus or minus 3 50, hanging in there somewhere, and that's not a robust pricing scenario for our farmer customers, so it creates a challenging environment. So 2 things that, that impacts. Number one, as you increase yield, which we do with our new hybrids and introduce those into the marketplace, the value of that incremental yield is based upon the price of the commodity. So that has an effect, Bob on how much you actually go up based on that yield gain that's occurring. And then it also plays into the farmers expectation around how they set their portfolio. Here's what has not changed, and this has been consistent for many, many years. Farmers do not back away from buying the latest and greatest because they drive yield and productivity. That is their only friend, whether it's a good commodity environment or a bad commodity environment, that's their only friend is drive yield and dilute the fixed cost that they're getting across their business. And when they start using tools like Climate and start managing their other inputs more effectively and efficiently and they can still get those yield increases, they can drive their cost per unit of production down. So that's the focus and that's why you look at this year, we completely sold out our Disease Shield hybrid with the new B300 SAT, which is that is our top of the line. It doesn't get any better than that, and those sold out. So farmer demand for high end is still there. They look at adjusting through the rest of the portfolio, and that's been hard to get those price increases with commodity price, and that's how it plays out and puts us where we're at."

What we're seeing in the second half is -- because of the sale of our Latitude business, we're not going to have the revenues from that business that we usually enjoy in the fourth quarter. And then from a cost of goods perspective, we've got a couple of increases in cost of goods in our glyphosate business and also a number of project costs in the manufacturing side that are going to impact our second half results. So these are the key drivers of our guidance into the second half of the year.

From the beginning of this, our position has been that all these deals should be done and that the industry really not only would benefit, but the industry really needed this consolidation. So as you think about despite the terrible commodity prices at the moment, the grower, to Brett's point, is desperately hungry for innovation, and the big piece of that innovation, I think, is going to come through this work. Each of these deals is unique, but we are heartened to see the deals ahead of us making progress because I think underscores the fact that the regulatory process works. And then to your point on closure by year-end and confidence, we've learned over the years, it's never good to speculate on government agencies, but I would tell you the unique thing about our deal -- I guess everyone thinks their deal is unique -- but the unique thing about this deal is there a very limited amount overlap. So as this call this morning is underscored, we're really strong in the area of seeds and biotech. Bayer is the premier company and the broad front of crop protection. And I think that -- I won't speak for regulatory agencies but the remedy lies on elimination of that overlap around the world. So we are working -- Bayer is taking the lead. We are supporting them, but we are working diligently towards a year-end close. And Robb and I have been bundling playing hours going and talking to ag constituencies around the world, and those have gone well. The feedback there has been good because there's such a focus on the need for not just more innovation but faster innovation. The time lines, when you think about how long we wait for them Xtend, 7 years from submission to approval, there's a need to kickstart faster innovation in this industry, and I'm hopeful that there's conclusion. The conclusion is still we'll see a phase shift on timing as well. So that's how I am looking at it. And obviously, as owners and people interested in the company, we'll keep you up to speed as we get more to talk about.
So let me respect your time and thank you for joining us today, and thanks to Laura and her team for continuing to bring albeit streamlined communication but keeping the facts in front of you during this period. So as we close out today, I'd say it's clear that the year ahead for us will be significant, and we here at Monsanto are clearly focused on our 2 key deliverables. To that end, our planned EPS growth in '17 is tracking nicely. And to the previous comments from Frank, we continue to work towards closing the agreement to combine with Bayer by the end of this calendar year. I'm very proud of our teams here at Monsanto. They've maintained their focus on the business, and as always, they've maintained focus on our grower customers during a tough time and have done really good results. So thanks again for joining us in the call this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you again in June at our Q3 earnings. Thanks very much."

Also joining me from the IR team is Ben Kampelman. Our second quarter call marks a critical time during our annual business cycle, and importantly, allows us to provide a meaningful outlook for the balance of the fiscal year. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.
We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both the GAAP and ongoing business basis, where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First, let me share our second quarter results, as shown on Slide 4. As outlined in our reconciliations, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $3.09 and ongoing earnings per share of $3.19 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, well above the prior year, as reported earnings per share of $2.41 and ongoing earnings per share of $2.42.
With that brief overview, I'll hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

The end of the second quarter allows us to gauge progress against our 2 priorities for the year; number one, to deliver our fiscal year 2017 operational plan and key milestones; and number two, to",1047,"Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. The end of the second quarter allows us to gauge progress against our 2 priorities for the year; number one, to deliver our fiscal year 2017 operational plan and key milestones; and number two, to close the merger with Bayer. So let's start first with the deal as shown on Slide 6. Bayer has led the regulatory filing process with support from Monsanto, as appropriate, and as they indicated in their year-end earnings call, both parties are working towards closure at the end of this calendar year. They continue to expect the filing to be made with the EU Commission this calendar quarter, and progress has been made with the second request from the U.S. Department of Justice. Like you, we also see the other proposed combinations advancing, as this industry undergoes a necessary and a healthy transformation to serve farmers better around the world.
As the process moves forward, our emphasis at Monsanto is where it's always been, on bringing much needed innovation to growers. Robb and I have spent significant time sharing our prospectus with ag industry organizations, policymakers and grower groups on the benefits of this deal. Innovation is at the heart of the industrial logic for combining with Bayer, just as it was with the consolidation that we led in the industry 20 years ago.
Since then, we've seen the scores of biotech, breeding and crop technology improvements, and our view is that the next 20 years will raise the level of agronomic performance even further. Very simply, this deal is about accelerating innovation, optimizing integrated solutions and expanding the offerings that will be available to farmers through broad licensing globally and the years to come. From delivering new choices even faster to expanding solutions in disease and insect control, our combination with Bayer is a real gateway to exciting possibilities in ag science, as shown on Slide 7. And it doesn't stop there. We think greater focus can be brought to historically underfunded crops, like wheat, as well as opportunities and geographies where agriculture could benefit from improvements in scale like parts of Asia, and certainly, in Africa. After outlining examples like these with growers, one thing is very clear, they want innovation and they fully recognize the role that it plays in bringing them solutions to run the profitable and sustainable operations necessary to meet the demand curves.
This overarching need to produce more hasn't changed. In fact, as seen on Slide 8, demand continues to strengthen. The trend line from WASDE forecast projects that annual demand for corn and beans is expected to rise. Growth expectations for just the 2016, 2017 marketing year translates to demand for an incremental 1.7 billion bushels for corn and more than 600 million bushels for soybeans. To put that into context, if this incremental demand were met by new production acres in the U.S. alone, that would require more than 20 million new acres of corn and soybeans combined.
And as shown on Slide 9 is Monsanto's proven innovation and unique platform advantages that position us well to meet these challenges and what makes us such an attractive complementary partner for Bayer. However, we're not sitting still, and we continue to invest in our future. We're building upon our industry-leading Climate FieldView platform and strong foundation of seed, trait and system solutions, particularly with our next-generation technologies in insect and weed control.
Shortly after we spoke back in January, we broke-ground our Luling, Louisiana glyphosate production site to make way for our first-ever dicamba production facility, expected to come online at the end of this decade. This plant, together with capacity being added by the industry, will be an integral part of delivering the top weed control system throughout the Americas. We're stocking less demand with the fastest trait ramp-ups in our company's history, with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans and Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton. Longer term, we're building out our leading platforms, with investment in R&D capabilities. We've nearly completed the initial phase of our planned $400 million Chesterfield R&D site expansion, and we expect that the ribbon cutting will be later this year.
In addition, typical pipeline projects are progressing well, including our blockbuster NemaStrike Technology, with exceptional nematode control. The public comment period for the EPA approval process for this new technology recently closed with positive feedback, and we're now well on track for commercialization next year. Also, we reached another significant positive milestone in the reregistration of glyphosate in Europe with the European Chemicals Agency concluding that glyphosate is not a carcinogen. Once again, this aligns with more than 800 studies, spanning 4 decades that all confirm the safety of this critical farming tool. In fact, this same conclusion has been reached by the U.S. EPA, the European Food Safety Authority, and regulators in Japan and Canada and numerous other countries. So despite some headlines to the contrary, some science from respected organizations continues to prevail. 
And finally, on the business. We've done excellent first half, delivering $3.39 of ongoing earnings per share, as compared to $2.25 in the prior year. Our gross profit improved nearly 20% in the first half, due primarily to strong pricing and area expansion in cotton in South America and the strong performance of our newest soybean seed and trait technologies. This growth in gross profit, coupled with the absence of the Argentina currency devaluation and the gain on the Latitude sale has propelled this strong start to the fiscal year. Given these results and our increased confidence in the outlook for the rest of the year, our guidance for fiscal year '17 now moves to the high end of the range for both as reported and ongoing of EPS.
So all in all, I'm very proud of our team and their focus on our business. We're making strides towards closure on the pending combination. Our record-breaking technology penetration continues to drive earnings growth and we're investing for the longer term and R&D. And we do all of these through our singular strategic lens to continue to bring value-added innovation to growers around the globe.
So with that overview, let me pass it to Brett to discuss the operational plans that support this outlook. Brett?"
528414,405049408,1166230,"Monsanto Company, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 05, 2017",2017-04-05,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Our focus on delivering the business has continued through the second quarter and places our company on a path to provide earnings growth through the turn of the decade. To help illustrate how, let's begin the ope",852,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Our focus on delivering the business has continued through the second quarter and places our company on a path to provide earnings growth through the turn of the decade. To help illustrate how, let's begin the operational outlook with corn, as shown on Slide 10. We continue to expect to grow our corn gross profit even as the commodity prices remain challenging in the mid to high $3 range. This is driven by global germplasm price-mix lift in local currency and genetic share gains despite expectations that the global planted acres could now decline slightly. Starting in the U.S. with an early spring, our Q2 deliveries were ahead of expectations, and provided some timing benefit. In addition, I'm pleased to share that we're sold out of our first year DEKALB Disease Shield hybrids, which also came with our newest microbial seed treatment, Acceleron B-300 SAT. In Brazil, double-digit price-mix lift in local currency continues in the second quarter, and we're seeing strong demand for VT Triple PRO traded hybrids. In Argentina, we now are estimating even greater growth in acres at more than 40%. And finally, Europe remains on track with strong grower demand driving volumes in the second quarter, though we do expect some decline in acres planted compared to last year.
Let's move to our soybean franchise on Slide 11 next. We're very excited about the story developing here. We're on pace to deliver greater than 25% growth in global soybean gross profit, and are seeing nice margin improvement year-over-year. Our ramp of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in the United States is now moving fast, as shown on Slide 12. We have all the approvals in place for Xtendimax with Vapor Group Technology for the key soybean growing states we're seeking with the exception of Arkansas. We're also pleased to see that the recent EPA approvals of numerous tank mix partners, including glyphosate, providing industry-leading weed control and a convenient tool for growers. Seed supply is excellent, and we now expect 18 million acres of traded varieties to be planted from Mississippi to Minnesota. This demand-driven increase from our prior estimates matches our largest trait launch ever, and all together, at 18 million acres, would be the highest penetration we've ever achieved in the second year of a trait launch. 
Moving to South America on Slide 13, performance of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro continues to demonstrate its advantage over competing varieties, and we are in the early days of evaluating the first wave of our own yield trials. This adds to our confidence in the 45 million to 55 million acre range for the technology this year, as Intacta continues to set trait penetration records. In Argentina, our planning assumption is there is a continuation of the current royalty capture system for the upcoming season. 
Our other crops are also seeing steady growth, starting with cotton on Slide 14. Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton is now expected to exceed 4 million acres in the U.S., which will be a driver towards our target of delivering our third straight year of share gains. On top of that, we're starting to sell Bollgard 3 XtendFlex cotton in the U.S. this year to further increase the spectrum and durability of insect control.
Moving to our Climate business on Slide 15. We're seeing major advancements in a number of areas. Digital ag tools are rapidly evolving, and the strategic differentiators for the Climate FieldView really set it apart. Collaborations and partnerships with others in this space, as well as our pace of adoption and expansion have established our leadership role. Interest in joining our platform has been strong, and we're currently in discussions with more than 25 potential technology providers. We remain on track to deliver our fiscal year target of 25 million paid acres. And geographically, experience with the platform is growing in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Brazil, as shown on Slide 16. In fact, in Brazil, some of the largest growers in the country are using the technology on 750,000 acres. The feedback is good and we're off to a very promising start. Lastly, let's close with Ag Productivity. We're seeing first half price improvements for generic glyphosate acid translate to retail, which we expect to result in modest price improvements in the second half of the year. This anticipated price increase, plus volume growth, places glyphosate on a more positive trend line, although we do anticipate some higher cost with the increased volumes.
In addition, it was great to see the first shipments of Xtendimax with VaporGrip technology moving to retail, and we expect this to continue in the second half. In summary, I'll echo Hugh's comments. We delivered a great start to the year, and our operational plans set us up for a strong close. We have tremendous momentum with the record penetration we're seeing with our latest soybean and cotton technologies, and continue to anticipate genetic share gains across multiple crops and key geographies.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?"

In Q2, we delivered as-reported earnings of $3.09 per share and an ongoing earnings of $3.19 per share. These translated to growth of more than 28% in both as-reported and ongoing earnings per share, and was mostly driven by 3 things: more than $300 million of gross profit growth from our corn and soybean businesses; the absence of the approximate 180 million impact of the Argentine peso devaluation; and finally, the 83 million gain from the sale of the Latitude business recorded in other income this quarter. In corn, gross profit grew by 12% in the second quarter and came mainly from Brazil, Europe and the U.S. U.S. corn growth related primarily to improved cost of goods with the return of a more normalized production plan, while Europe and the U.S. combined had a volume-timing benefit of roughly $40 million, stemming from strong grower demand. In addition, they both delivered anticipated share gains, mitigated by expected planted acre declines. Finally, the single largest driver came from pricing in Brazil, where we continue to see strong double-digit germplasm price increases in local currency. In soybeans, the 19% growth in gross profit and 6 points of margin expansion came from reduced COGS and increased trait revenues from our Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans in the U.S., which were compounded by higher volumes from expected increased soybean acres and share gains. Cotton gross profit also grew nicely in the quarter, where we saw more than 50 million in growth in the U.S. This was due largely to a timing benefit from a change in our customer contracts, and to a lesser degree, from initial sales of our Bollgard II XtendFlex.
Moving to Ag Productivity. We saw our gross profit for the quarter grew by about 3% over the prior year. Regarding Roundup and our glyphosate-based herbicides, we continued to experience the pricing headwinds we expected. However, at the segment level, this was more than offset by incremental glyphosate volumes and the initial sales of our dicamba-based herbicides. Finally, as we expected, operating expenses increased in the quarter, mostly due to the return to growth of the business. These increases were primarily driven by increasing incentive accrual expense, higher commissions in South America and greater investment in the Climate FieldView platform. They were partially offset by the continued savings from our restructuring and transformation actions. We continue to expect these to generate $200 million of operating expense and COGS savings versus the prior year on our path to $500 million of savings by 2018 versus our 2015 baseline, as shown on Slide 17. For cash, for the first half of fiscal year '17, we delivered nearly $1 billion of free cash flow as compared to $900 million in the prior year. This improvement was driven by the considerable increase in our net income, offset by working capital increases from receivables and inventories and payments for restructuring actions accrued in the prior year. These results reflect our new definition of free cash flow, which is operating cash flows less CapEx. This new definition of free cash flow aligns to the more commonly used definition by publicly traded companies, and we've conformed our historical reporting and our guidance accordingly.
Let's move ahead to our full year outlook on Slide 18. With strong first half results, plus the outlook for the rest of the year, we now confidently expect to be at the high end of the as-reported earnings per share range of $3.95 to $4.44 and of the ongoing earnings per share range of $4.50 to $4.90. From a gross profit perspective, we continue to expect our Seeds and Genomics segment gross profit to increase mid-single digits as a percent year-over-year.
In corn, we expect some volume gains from global genetic share gains, particularly in the U.S., to contribute to this gross profit growth. However, we now anticipate acres planted to be down slightly on a global basis, with the upside in South America being more than offset by the expected declines in the northern hemisphere. Global germplasm price-mix lift in local currency is still expected to be flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages, with the strong increases in South America being muted by germplasm price-mix lift in the U.S. that is expected to be roughly flat. In soybeans, gross profit is expected to now grow by more than 25%, driven by new trait penetration and an anticipated cost of goods sold reduction. In cotton, with the strength of Bollgard II XtendFlex in the U.S. and the return of high-value acres in Australia, the gross profit is expected to grow by more than 35%. Meanwhile, other crops gross profit is expected to decline due to the absence of the onetime $210 million alfalfa technology license payment from Q3 of the prior year. Within Ag Productivity, considering deal dynamics and the variable Brett discussed, our gross profit guidance still remains within the range of $850 million to $950 million, albeit moving more towards the lower end. From a strategic deals perspective, we have further advancement in our discussion. We are now expecting the benefit to be somewhat below the earlier estimate of $100 million from licensing and asset sales, and now share between the EBIT of our 2 segments in the second half of the fiscal year. This shift is in the projected recording of the Ag Productivity deal benefit to other income. It is the primary reason we are pointing to the lower end of the range for gross profit for that segment. Overall, operating expense in 2017, excluding the pending Bayer transaction cost and restructuring expenses, are still expected to increase slightly. This is because inflation and the cost associated with the return to growth of the business are anticipated to more than offset our savings. Finally, our outlook also assumes that changes in currency rates will have a relatively neutral effect on net income for the full year, and we continue to expect the tax rate for the year to be in the range of 25% to 28%. If we look just at Q3, we expect as-reported earnings per share to be roughly flat with the prior year. This is due to the absence of last year's Argentine-related tax matters call-out of $0.50 per share, mostly offset by the expected decline in ongoing earnings per share from the absence of the alfalfa deal, which was roughly $0.34 of earnings last year, and the volume timing shift from Q3 to Q2 in the European and U.S. corn businesses.
For the full year, we now anticipate these earnings to translate to the high end of our range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flows, resulting from expecting operating cash flows at the high end of the range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion and CapEx of $1.2 billion.
In closing, at the midpoint of our year, we look back on a strong first half, driven by outstanding returns on innovation and financial discipline. As we look forward, we're increasingly confident in the outlook for our business and our continued progress towards closure of the pending combination with Bayer.
With that, I will now pass it to Laura for the Q&A."

So pricing in South America, specifically pricing in Brazil, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, has been extremely strong, and we've seen a nice recovery and some growth in pricing in Brazil. So this has been something we've been observing in the first quarter, but also continuing into the premium market in the second quarter, so that was really a very strong performance in Brazil. And regarding costs, I mean, you remember we've always talked about having a penalty last year related to our cost of goods and reduced production plans. This year, we are going back to normal production plans. And as expected, we are seeing an improvement in our cost of goods position. So from a pure margin perspective, these would be the 2 critical drivers. And we've also seen really nice performance in terms of volumes in the U.S. in Europe, part of that being related to timing. I mean, we've got a really nice mild weather during the winter, but also expected share gains.

I think, as all of you know, the environment for our customers continues to be very difficult with corn prices still, call it, plus or minus $3.50, hanging in there somewhere, and that's not a robust pricing scenario for our farmer customers, so it creates a challenging environment. So 2 things that, that impacts. Number one, as you increase yield, which we do with our new hybrids and introduce those into the marketplace, the value of that incremental yield is based upon the price of the commodity. So that has an effect, Bob, on how much you actually go up based on that yield gain that's occurring. And then it also plays into the farmers expectation around how they set their portfolio. Here's what has not changed, and this has been consistent for many, many years. Farmers do not back away from buying the latest and greatest because they drive yield and productivity. That is their only friend, whether it's a good commodity environment or a bad commodity environment, that's their only friend, is drive yield and dilute the fixed cost that they're getting across their business. And when they start using tools, like Climate, and start managing their other inputs more effectively and efficiently and they can still get those yield increases, they can drive their cost per unit of production down. So that's the focus and that's why you look at this year, we completely sold out of our Disease Shield hybrid with the new B-300 SAT, which is -- that is our top of the line. It doesn't get any better than that, and those sold out. So farmer demand for high end is still there. They look at adjusting through the rest of the portfolio, and it's been hard to get those price increases with commodity price, and that's how it plays out and puts us where we're at."

So this one will be a positive in the second half. What we're seeing in the second half is -- I mean, because of the sale of our Latitude business, we are not going to have the revenues from that business that we usually enjoy in the fourth quarter. And then from a cost of goods perspective, we've got a couple of increases in cost of goods in our glyphosate business and also a number of project cost in the manufacturing side that are going to impact our second half results. So these are the key drivers of our guidance into the second half of the year. Regarding the slight adjustment to our guidance in the second half, it's mostly that some of the deals we are contemplating based on the work we've been doing is also going to be recorded in our income rather than gross profit. But overall, I mean, the nice thing we are seeing in this segment is that our glyphosate business now is on the right trend."

From the beginning of this, our position has been that all these deals should be done and that the industry really not only would benefit, but the industry really needed this consolidation. So as you think about despite the terrible commodity prices at the moment, the grower, to Brett's point, is desperately hungry for innovation, and the big piece of that innovation, I think, is going to come through this work. Each of these deals is unique, but we are heartened to see the deals ahead of us making progress because I think it underscores the fact that the regulatory process works. And then to your point on closure by year-end and confidence, we've learned over the years, it's never good to speculate on government agencies, but I would tell you the unique thing about our deal, I guess everybody thinks that their deal is unique, but the unique thing about this deal is there are very limited amount of overlap. So as this call this morning is underscored, we're really strong in the area of seeds and biotech. Bayer is the premier company in the broad front of crop protection. And I think that -- I won't speak for regulatory agencies, but the remedy lies on the elimination of the overlap around the world. So we are working -- Bayer is taking the lead. We are supporting them, but we are working diligently towards a year-end close. And Robb and I have been bundling, playing hours, going and talking to ag constituencies around the world, and those have gone well. The feedback there has been good because there's such a focus on the need for not just more innovation but faster innovation. The time lines, when you think about how long we wait for them, Xtend, 7 years from submission to approval, there's a need to kickstart faster innovation in this industry, and I'm hopeful that there's conclusion, the conclusion of this deal. We'll see a phase shift on timing as well. So that's how I'm looking at it. And obviously, as owners and people interested in the company, we'll keep you up to speed as we get more to talk about.
So let me respect your time and I thank you for joining us today, and thanks to Laura and her team for continuing to bring, albeit streamlined communication, but keeping the facts in front of you during this period. So as we close out today, I'd say it's clear that the year ahead for us will be significant, and we here at Monsanto are clearly focused on our 2 key deliverables. To that end, our planned return EPS growth in '17 is tracking nicely. And to the previous comments from Frank, we continue to work towards closing the agreement to combine with Bayer by the end of this calendar year. I'm very proud of our teams here at Monsanto. They've maintained their focus on the business, and as always, they've maintained focus on our grower customers during a tough time and have done really good results. So thanks again for joining us in the call this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you again in June at our Q3 earnings. Thanks very much."

First, let me share our second quarter results, as shown on Slide 4. As outlined in our reconciliations, we delivered as-reported earnings per share of $3.09 and ongoing earnings per share of $3.19 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, well above the prior year as-reported earnings per share of $2.41 and ongoing earnings per share of $2.42.
With that brief overview, I'll hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook."

The end of the second quarter allows us to gauge progress against our 2 priorities for the year: number one, to deliver our fiscal year 2017 operational plan and key milestones; and number two, to",1044,"Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. The end of the second quarter allows us to gauge progress against our 2 priorities for the year: number one, to deliver our fiscal year 2017 operational plan and key milestones; and number two, to close the merger with Bayer. So let's start first with the deal as shown on Slide 6. Bayer has led the regulatory filing process with support from Monsanto, as appropriate, and as they indicated in their year-end earnings call, both parties are working towards closure at the end of this calendar year. They continue to expect the filing to be made with the EU Commission this calendar quarter, and progress has been made with the second request from the U.S. Department of Justice. Like you, we also see the other proposed combinations advancing, as this industry undergoes a necessary and a healthy transformation to serve farmers better around the world.
As the process moves forward, our emphasis at Monsanto is where it's always been, on bringing much needed innovation to growers. Robb and I have spent significant time sharing our perspectives with ag industry organizations, policymakers and grower groups on the benefits of this deal. Innovation is at the heart of the industrial logic for combining with Bayer, just as it was with the consolidation that we led in the industry 20 years ago.
Since then, we've seen scores of biotech, breeding and crop technology improvements, and our view is that the next 20 years will raise the level of agronomic performance even further. Very simply, this deal is about accelerating innovation, optimizing integrated solutions and expanding the offerings that will be available to farmers through broad licensing globally in the years to come. From delivering new choices even faster to expanding solutions in disease and insect control, our combination with Bayer is a real gateway to exciting possibilities in ag science, as shown on Slide 7. And it doesn't stop there. We think greater focus can be brought to historically underfunded crops, like wheat, as well as opportunities in geographies where agriculture could benefit from improvements in scale like parts of Asia, and certainly, in Africa. After outlining examples like these with growers, one thing is very clear, they want innovation and they fully recognize the role that it plays in bringing them solutions to run the profitable and sustainable operations necessary to meet the demand curves.
This overarching need to produce more hasn't changed. In fact, as seen on Slide 8, demand continues to strengthen. The trend line from WASDE forecasts projects that annual demand for corn and beans is expected to rise. Growth expectations for just the 2016, 2017 marketing year translates to demand for an incremental 1.7 billion bushels for corn and more than 600 million bushels for soybeans. To put that into context, if this incremental demand were met by new production acres in the U.S. alone, it would require more than 20 million new acres of corn and soybeans combined.
And as shown on Slide 9, it's Monsanto's proven innovation and unique platform advantages that position us well to meet these challenges and what makes us such an attractive complementary partner for Bayer. However, we're not sitting still, and we continue to invest in our future. We're building upon our industry-leading Climate FieldView platform and strong foundation of seed, trait and system solutions, particularly with our next-generation technologies in insect and weed control.
Shortly after we spoke back in January, we broke-ground our Luling, Louisiana glyphosate production site to make way for our first-ever dicamba production facility, expected to come online at the end of this decade. This plant, together with capacity being added by the industry, will be an integral part of delivering the top weed control system throughout the Americas. We're stoking this demand with the fastest trait ramp-ups in our company's history, with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans and Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton. Longer term, we're building out our leading platforms with investment in R&D capabilities. We've nearly completed the initial phase of our planned $400 million Chesterfield R&D site expansion, and we expect that the ribbon cutting will be later this year.
In addition, technical pipeline projects are progressing well, including our blockbuster NemaStrike Technology with exceptional nematode control. The public comment period for the EPA approval process for this new technology recently closed with positive feedback, and we're now well on track for commercialization next year. Also, we reached another significant positive milestone in the reregistration of glyphosate in Europe with the European Chemicals Agency concluding that glyphosate is not a carcinogen. Once again, this aligns with more than 800 studies, spanning 4 decades that all confirm the safety of this critical farming tool. In fact, this same conclusion has been reached by the U.S. EPA, the European Food Safety Authority, and regulators in Japan and Canada and numerous other countries. So despite some headlines to the contrary, sound science from respected organizations continues to prevail. 
And finally, on the business. We've done excellent first half, delivering $3.39 of ongoing earnings per share, as compared to $2.25 in the prior year. Our gross profit improved nearly 20% in the first half, due primarily to strong pricing and area expansion in corn in South America and the strong performance of our newest soybean seed and trait technologies. This growth in gross profit, coupled with the absence of the Argentina currency devaluation and the gain on the Latitude sale has propelled this strong start to the fiscal year. Given these results and our increased confidence in the outlook for the rest of the year, our guidance for fiscal year '17 now moves to the high end of the range for both as-reported and ongoing EPS.
So all in all, I'm very proud of our team and their focus on our business. We're making strides towards closure on the pending combination. Our record-breaking technology penetration continues to drive earnings growth and we're investing for the longer term in R&D. And we do all of this through our singular strategic lens to continue to bring value-added innovation to growers around the globe.
So with that overview, let me pass it to Brett to discuss the operational plans that support this outlook. Brett?"
528414,405049408,1166354,"Monsanto Company, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 05, 2017",2017-04-05,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone.

Our focus on delivering the business has continued through the second quarter and places our company on a path to provide earnings growth through the turn of the decade. To help illustrate how, let's begin the operational outlook with corn, as shown on Slide 10. We continue to expect to grow our corn gross profit even as the commodity prices remain challenging in the mid- to high $3 range. This is driven by a global germplasm price-mix lift in local currency and genetic share gains despite expectations that the global planted acres could now decline slightly. Starting in the U.S. with an early spring, our Q2 deliveries were ahead of expectations, and provided some timing benefit. In addition, I'm pleased to share that we're sold out of our first year DEKALB Disease Shield hybrids, which also came with our newest microbial seed treatment, Acceleron B-300 SAT. In Brazil, double-digit price-mix lift in local currency continues in the second quarter, and we're seeing strong demand for VT Triple PRO traited hybrids. In Argentina, we now are estimating even greater growth in acres at more than 40%. And finally, Europe remains on track with strong grower demand driving volumes in the second quarter, though we do expect some decline in acres planted compared to last year.
Let's move to our soybean franchise on Slide 11 next. We're very excited about the story developing here. We're on pace to deliver greater than 25% growth in global soybean gross profit, and are seeing nice margin improvement year-over-year. Our ramp of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in the United States is now moving fast, as shown on Slide 12. We have all the approvals in place for Xtendimax with VaporGrip Technology for the key soybean growing states we're seeking with the exception of Arkansas. We're also pleased to see that the recent EPA approvals of numerous tank mix partners, including glyphosate, providing industry-leading weed control and a convenient tool for growers. Seed supply is excellent, and we now expect 18 million acres of traded varieties to be planted from Mississippi to Minnesota. This demand-driven increase from our prior estimates matches our largest trait launch ever, and all together, at 18 million acres, would be the highest penetration we've ever achieved in the second year of a trait launch. 
Moving to South America on Slide 13, performance of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro continues to demonstrate its advantage over competing varieties, and we are in the early days of evaluating the first wave of our own yield trials. This adds to our confidence in the 45 million to 55 million acre range for the technology this year, as Intacta continues to set trait penetration records. In Argentina, our planning assumption is there is a continuation of the current royalty capture system for the upcoming season. 
Our other crops are also seeing steady growth, starting with cotton on Slide 14. Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton is now expected to exceed 4 million acres in the U.S., which will be a driver towards our target of delivering our third straight year of share gains. On top of that, we're starting to sell Bollgard 3 XtendFlex Cotton in the U.S. this year to further increase the spectrum and durability of insect control.
Moving to our Climate business on Slide 15. We're seeing major advancements in a number of areas. Digital ag tools are rapidly evolving, and the strategic differentiators for the Climate FieldView really set it apart. Collaborations and partnerships with others in this space as well as our pace of adoption and expansion have established our leadership role. Interest in joining our platform has been strong, and we're currently in discussions with more than 25 potential technology providers. We remain on track to deliver our fiscal year target of 25 million paid acres. And geographically, experience with the platform is growing in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Brazil, as shown on Slide 16. In fact, in Brazil, some of the largest growers in the country are using the technology on 750,000 acres. The feedback is good and we're off to a very promising start. Lastly, let's close with Ag Productivity. We're seeing first half price improvements for generic glyphosate acid translate to retail, which we expect to result in modest price improvements in the second half of the year. This anticipated price increase, plus volume growth, places glyphosate on a more positive trend line, although we do anticipate some higher cost with the increased volumes.
In addition, it was great to see the first shipments of Xtendimax with VaporGrip technology moving to retail, and we expect this to continue in the second half. In summary, I'll echo Hugh's comments. We delivered a great start to the year, and our operational plans set us up for a strong close. We have tremendous momentum with the record penetration we're seeing with our latest soybean and cotton technologies, and continue to anticipate genetic share gains across multiple crops and key geographies.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?"

In Q2, we delivered as-reported earnings of $3.09 per share and an ongoing earnings of $3.19 per share. These translated to growth of more than 28% in both as-reported and ongoing earnings per share, and was mostly driven by 3 things: more than $300 million of gross profit growth from our corn and soybean businesses; the absence of the approximate 180 million impact of the Argentine peso devaluation; and finally, the 83 million gain from the sale of the Latitude business recorded in other income this quarter. In corn, gross profit grew by 12% in the second quarter and came mainly from Brazil, Europe and the U.S. U.S. corn growth related primarily to improved cost of goods with the return of a more normalized production plan, while Europe and the U.S. combined had a volume-timing benefit of roughly $40 million, stemming from strong grower demand. In addition, they both delivered anticipated share gains, mitigated by expected planted acre declines. Finally, the single largest driver came from pricing in Brazil, where we continue to see strong double-digit germplasm price increases in local currency. In soybeans, the 19% growth in gross profit and 6 points of margin expansion came from reduced COGS and increased trait revenues from our Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans in the U.S., which were compounded by higher volumes from expected increased soybean acres and share gains. Cotton gross profit also grew nicely in the quarter, where we saw more than 50 million in growth in the U.S. This was due largely to a timing benefit from a change in our customer contracts, and to a lesser degree, from initial sales of our Bollgard II XtendFlex.
Moving to Ag Productivity. We saw our gross profit for the quarter grow by about 3% over the prior year. Regarding Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides, we continued to experience the pricing headwinds we expected. However, at the segment level, this was more than offset by incremental glyphosate volumes and the initial sales of our dicamba-based herbicides. Finally, as we expected, operating expenses increased in the quarter, mostly due to the return to growth of the business. These increases were primarily driven by increasing incentive accrual expense, higher commissions in South America and greater investment in the Climate FieldView platform. They were partially offset by the continued savings from our restructuring and transformation actions. We continue to expect these to generate $200 million of operating expense and COGS savings versus the prior year on our path to $500 million of savings by 2018 versus our 2015 baseline, as shown on Slide 17. For cash, for the first half of fiscal year '17, we delivered nearly $1 billion of free cash flow as compared to $900 million in the prior year. This improvement was driven by the considerable increase in our net income, offset by working capital increases from receivables and inventories and payments for restructuring actions accrued in the prior year. These results reflect our new definition of free cash flow, which is operating cash flows less CapEx. This new definition of free cash flow aligns to the more commonly used definition by publicly traded companies, and we've conformed our historical reporting and our guidance accordingly.
Let's move ahead to our full year outlook on Slide 18. With strong first half results, plus the outlook for the rest of the year, we now confidently expect to be at the high end of the as-reported earnings per share range of $3.95 to $4.44 and of the ongoing earnings per share range of $4.50 to $4.90. From a gross profit perspective, we continue to expect our Seeds and Genomics segment gross profit to increase mid-single digits as a percent year-over-year.
In corn, we expect some volume gains from global genetic share gains, particularly in the U.S., to contribute to this gross profit growth. However, we now anticipate acres planted to be down slightly on a global basis, with the upside in South America being more than offset by the expected declines in the northern hemisphere. Global germplasm price-mix lift in local currency is still expected to be flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages, with the strong increases in South America being muted by germplasm price-mix lift in the U.S. that is expected to be roughly flat. In soybeans, gross profit is expected to now grow by more than 25%, driven by new trait penetration and an anticipated cost of goods sold reduction. In cotton, with the strength of Bollgard II XtendFlex in the U.S. and the return of high-value acres in Australia, the gross profit is expected to grow by more than 35%. Meanwhile, other crops gross profit is expected to decline due to the absence of the onetime $210 million alfalfa technology license payment from Q3 of the prior year. Within Ag Productivity, considering deal dynamics and the variable Brett discussed, our gross profit guidance still remains within the range of $850 million to $950 million, albeit moving more towards the lower end. From a strategic deals perspective, with further advancement in our discussion, we are now expecting the benefit to be somewhat below the earlier estimate of $100 million from licensing and asset sales, and now shared between the EBIT of our 2 segments in the second half of the fiscal year. This shift is in the projected recording of the Ag Productivity deal benefit to other income. It is the primary reason we are pointing to the lower end of the range for gross profit for that segment. Overall, operating expense in 2017, excluding the pending Bayer transaction cost and restructuring expenses, are still expected to increase slightly. This is because inflation and the cost associated with the return to growth of the business are anticipated to more than offset our savings. Finally, our outlook also assumes that changes in currency rates will have a relatively neutral effect on net income for the full year, and we continue to expect the tax rate for the year to be in the range of 25% to 28%. If we look just at Q3, we expect as-reported earnings per share to be roughly flat with the prior year. This is due to the absence of last year's Argentine-related tax matters call-out of $0.50 per share, mostly offset by the expected decline in ongoing earnings per share from the absence of the alfalfa deal, which was roughly $0.34 of earnings last year, and the volume timing shift from Q3 to Q2 in the European and U.S. corn businesses.
For the full year, we now anticipate these earnings to translate to the high end of our range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flows, resulting from expecting operating cash flows at the high end of a range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion and CapEx of $1.2 billion.
In closing, at the midpoint of our year, we look back on a strong first half, driven by outstanding returns on innovation and financial discipline. As we look forward, we're increasingly confident in the outlook for our business and our continued progress towards closure of the pending combination with Bayer.
With that, I will now pass it to Laura for the Q&A."

So this has been something we've been observing in the first quarter, but also continuing into the safrinha market into the second quarter, so that was really a very strong performance in Brazil. And regarding costs, I mean, you remember we've always talked about having a penalty last year related to our cost of goods and reduced production plans. This year, we are going back to normal production plans. And as expected, we are seeing an improvement in our cost of goods position. So from a pure margin perspective, these would be the 2 critical drivers. And we've also seen really nice performance in terms of volumes in the U.S., in Europe, part of that being related to timing. I mean, we've got a really nice mild weather during the winter, but also expected share gains.

So we've got to see what actually gets planted, what the returns in replants look like.

I think, as all of you know, the environment for our customers continues to be very difficult with corn prices still, call it, plus-minus $3.50, hanging in there somewhere. And that's not a robust pricing scenario for our farmer customers, so it creates a challenging environment. So 2 things that, that impacts. Number one, as you increase yield, which we do with our new hybrids and introduce those into the marketplace, the value of that incremental yield is based upon the price of the commodity. So that has an effect, Bob, on how much you actually go up based on that yield gain that's occurring. And then it also plays into the farmers' expectation around how they set their portfolio. Here's what has not changed, and this has been consistent for many, many years. Farmers do not back away from buying the latest and greatest because they drive yield and productivity. That is their only friend, whether it's a good commodity environment or a bad commodity environment, that's their only friend, is drive yield and dilute the fixed costs that they're getting across their business. And when they start using tools, like Climate, and start managing their other inputs more effectively and efficiently and they can still get those yield increases, they can drive their cost per unit of production down. So that's the focus and that's why you look at this year, we completely sold out of our Disease Shield hybrid with the new B-300 SAT, which is -- that is our top of the line. It doesn't get any better than that, and those sold out. So farmer demand for high end is still there. They look at adjusting through the rest of the portfolio, and it's been hard to get those price increases with commodity price, and that's how it plays out and puts us where we're at."

What we're seeing in the second half is -- I mean, because of the sale of our Latitude business, we are not going to have the revenues from that business that we usually enjoy in the fourth quarter. And then from a cost of goods perspective, we've got a couple of increases in cost of goods in our glyphosate business and also a number of project costs on the manufacturing side that are going to impact our second half results. So these are the key drivers of our guidance into the second half of the year. Regarding the slight adjustment to our guidance in the second half, it's mostly that some of the deals we are contemplating based on the work we've been doing is also going to be recorded in other income rather than gross profit.

From the beginning of this, our position has been that all these deals should be done and that the industry really not only would benefit, but the industry really needed this consolidation. So as you think about despite the terrible commodity prices at the moment, the grower, to Brett's point, is desperately hungry for innovation, and a big piece of that innovation, I think, is going to come through this work. Each of these deals is unique, but we are heartened to see the deals ahead of us making progress because I think it underscores the fact that the regulatory process works. And then to your point on closure by year-end and confidence, we've learned over the years, it's never good to speculate on government agencies, but I would tell you the unique thing about our deal, I guess everybody thinks that their deal is unique, but the unique thing about this deal is the very limited amount of overlap. So as this call this morning has underscored, we're really strong in the area of seeds and biotech. Bayer is the premier company in the broad front of crop protection. And I think that -- I won't speak for regulatory agencies, but the remedy lies in the elimination of the overlap around the world. So we are working -- Bayer is taking the lead. We are supporting them, but we are working diligently towards a year-end close. And Robb and I have been bundling plane hours, going and talking to ag constituencies around the world, and those have gone well. The feedback there has been good because there's such a focus on the need for not just more innovation but faster innovation. The time lines, when you think about how long we waited on Xtend, 7 years from submission to approval, there's a need to kickstart faster innovation in this industry, and I'm hopeful that this conclusion -- or the conclusion of this deal will see a phase shift on timing as well. So that's how I'm looking at it. And obviously, as owners and people interested in the company, we'll keep you up to speed as we get more to talk about.
So let me respect your time and I thank you for joining us today, and thanks to Laura and her team for continuing to bring, albeit streamlined communication, but keeping the facts in front of you during this period. So as we close out today, I'd say it's clear that the year ahead for us will be significant, and we here at Monsanto are clearly focused on our 2 key deliverables. To that end, our plan to return to EPS growth in '17 is tracking nicely. And to the previous comments from Frank, we continue to work towards closing the agreement to combine with Bayer by the end of this calendar year. I'm very proud of our teams here at Monsanto. They've maintained their focus on the business, and as always, they've maintained focus on our grower customers during a tough time and have turned in really good results.

Also joining me from the IR team is Ben Kampelman. Our second quarter call marks a critical time during our annual business cycle, and importantly, allows us to provide a meaningful outlook for the balance of the fiscal year. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.
We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First, let me share our second quarter results, as shown on Slide 4. As outlined in our reconciliations, we delivered as-reported earnings per share of $3.09 and ongoing earnings per share of $3.19 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, well above the prior year as-reported earnings per share of $2.41 and ongoing earnings per share of $2.42.

The end of the second quarter allows us to gauge progress against our 2 priorities for the year: number one, to deliver our fiscal year 2017 operational plan and key milestones; and number two, to close the merger with Bayer. So let's start first with the deal as shown on Slide 6. Bayer has led the regulatory filing process with support from Monsanto, as appropriate, and as they indicated in their year-end earnings call, both parties are working towards closure at the end of this calendar year. They continue to expect the filing to be made with the EU Commission this calendar quarter, and progress has been made with the second request from the U.S. Department of Justice. Like you, we also see the other proposed combinations advancing, as this industry undergoes a necessary and a healthy transformation to serve farmers better around the world.
As the process moves forward, our emphasis at Monsanto is where it's always been, on bringing much needed innovation to growers. Robb and I have spent significant time sharing our perspectives with ag industry organizations, policymakers and grower groups on the benefits of this deal. Innovation is at the heart of the industrial logic for combining with Bayer, just as it was with the consolidation that we led in the industry 20 years ago.
Since then, we've seen scores of biotech, breeding and crop technology improvements, and our view is that the next 20 years will raise the level of agronomic performance even further. Very simply, this deal is about accelerating innovation, optimizing integrated solutions and expanding the offerings that will be available to farmers through broad licensing globally in the years to come. From delivering new choices even faster to expanding solutions in disease and insect control, our combination with Bayer is a real gateway to exciting possibilities in ag science, as shown on Slide 7. And it doesn't stop there. We think greater focus can be brought to historically underfunded crops, like wheat, as well as opportunities in geographies where agriculture could benefit from improvements in scale like parts of Asia, and certainly, in Africa. After outlining examples like these with growers, one thing is very clear, they want innovation and they fully recognize the role that it plays in bringing them solutions to run the profitable and sustainable operations necessary to meet the demand curves.
This overarching need to produce more hasn't changed. In fact, as seen on Slide 8, demand continues to strengthen. The trend line from WASDE forecasts projects that annual demand for corn and beans is expected to rise. Growth expectations for just the 2016, 2017 marketing year translates to demand for an incremental 1.7 billion bushels for corn and more than 600 million bushels for soybeans. To put that into context, if this incremental demand were met by new production acres in the U.S. alone, it would require more than 20 million new acres of corn and soybeans combined.
And as shown on Slide 9, it's Monsanto's proven innovation and unique platform advantages that position us well to meet these challenges and what makes us such an attractive complementary partner for Bayer. However, we're not sitting still, and we continue to invest in our future. We're building upon our industry-leading Climate FieldView platform and strong foundation of seed, trait and system solutions, particularly with our next-generation technologies in insect and weed control.
Shortly after we spoke back in January, we broke-ground our Luling, Louisiana glyphosate production site to make way for our first-ever dicamba production facility, expected to come online at the end of this decade. This plant, together with capacity being added by the industry, will be an integral part of delivering the top weed control system throughout the Americas. We're stoking this demand with the fastest trait ramp-ups in our company's history, with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans and Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton. Longer term, we're building out our leading platforms with investment in R&D capabilities. We've nearly completed the initial phase of our planned $400 million Chesterfield R&D site expansion, and we expect that the ribbon cutting will be later this year.
In addition, technical pipeline projects are progressing well, including our blockbuster NemaStrike Technology with exceptional nematode control. The public comment period for the EPA approval process for this new technology recently closed with positive feedback, and we're now well on track for commercialization next year. Also, we reached another significant positive milestone in the reregistration of glyphosate in Europe with the European Chemicals Agency concluding that glyphosate is not a carcinogen. Once again, this aligns with more than 800 studies, spanning 4 decades that all confirm the safety of this critical farming tool. In fact, this same conclusion has been reached by the U.S. EPA, the European Food Safety Authority, and regulators in Japan and Canada and numerous other countries. So despite some headlines to the contrary, sound science from respected organizations continues to prevail. 
And finally, on the business. We've done excellent first half, delivering $3.39 of ongoing earnings per share, as compared to $2.25 in the prior year. Our gross profit improved nearly 20% in the first half, due primarily to strong pricing and area expansion in corn in South America and the strong performance of our newest soybean seed and trait technologies. This growth in gross profit, coupled with the absence of the Argentina currency devaluation and the gain on the Latitude sale has propelled this strong start to the fiscal year. Given these results and our increased confidence in the outlook for the rest of the year, our guidance for fiscal year '17 now moves to the high end of the range for both as-reported and ongoing EPS.
So all in all, I'm very proud of our team and their focus on our business. We're making strides towards closure on the pending combination. Our record-breaking technology penetration continues to drive earnings growth and we're investing for the longer term in R&D. And we do all of this through our singular strategic lens to continue to bring value-added innovation to growers around the globe.
So with that overview, let me pass it to Brett to discuss the operational plans that support this outlook. Brett?"

Our focus on delivering the business has continued through the second quarter and places our company on a path to provide earnings growth through the turn of the decade. To help illustrate how, let's begin the operational outlook with corn, as shown on Slide 10. We continue to expect to grow our corn gross profit even as the commodity prices remain challenging in the mid- to high $3 range. This is driven by a global germplasm price-mix lift in local currency and genetic share gains despite expectations that the global planted acres could now decline slightly. Starting in the U.S. with an early spring, our Q2 deliveries were ahead of expectations, and provided some timing benefit. In addition, I'm pleased to share that we're sold out of our first year DEKALB Disease Shield hybrids, which also came with our newest microbial seed treatment, Acceleron B-300 SAT. In Brazil, double-digit price-mix lift in local currency continues in the second quarter, and we're seeing strong demand for VT Triple PRO traited hybrids. In Argentina, we now are estimating even greater growth in acres at more than 40%. And finally, Europe remains on track with strong grower demand driving volumes in the second quarter, though we do expect some decline in acres planted compared to last year.
Let's move to our soybean franchise on Slide 11 next. We're very excited about the story developing here. We're on pace to deliver greater than 25% growth in global soybean gross profit, and are seeing nice margin improvement year-over-year. Our ramp of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in the United States is now moving fast, as shown on Slide 12. We have all the approvals in place for Xtendimax with VaporGrip Technology for the key soybean growing states we're seeking with the exception of Arkansas. We're also pleased to see that the recent EPA approvals of numerous tank mix partners, including glyphosate, providing industry-leading weed control and a convenient tool for growers. Seed supply is excellent, and we now expect 18 million acres of traded varieties to be planted from Mississippi to Minnesota. This demand-driven increase from our prior estimates matches our largest trait launch ever, and all together, at 18 million acres, would be the highest penetration we've ever achieved in the second year of a trait launch. 
Moving to South America on Slide 13, performance of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro continues to demonstrate its advantage over competing varieties, and we are in the early days of evaluating the first wave of our own yield trials. This adds to our confidence in the 45 million to 55 million acre range for the technology this year, as Intacta continues to set trait penetration records. In Argentina, our planning assumption is there is a continuation of the current royalty capture system for the upcoming season. 
Our other crops are also seeing steady growth, starting with cotton on Slide 14. Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton is now expected to exceed 4 million acres in the U.S., which will be a driver towards our target of delivering our third straight year of share gains. On top of that, we're starting to sell Bollgard 3 XtendFlex Cotton in the U.S. this year to further increase the spectrum and durability of insect control.
Moving to our Climate business on Slide 15. We're seeing major advancements in a number of areas. Digital ag tools are rapidly evolving, and the strategic differentiators for the Climate FieldView really set it apart. Collaborations and partnerships with others in this space as well as our pace of adoption and expansion have established our leadership role. Interest in joining our platform has been strong, and we're currently in discussions with more than 25 potential technology providers. We remain on track to deliver our fiscal year target of 25 million paid acres. And geographically, experience with the platform is growing in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Brazil, as shown on Slide 16. In fact, in Brazil, some of the largest growers in the country are using the technology on 750,000 acres. The feedback is good and we're off to a very promising start. Lastly, let's close with Ag Productivity. We're seeing first half price improvements for generic glyphosate acid translate to retail, which we expect to result in modest price improvements in the second half of the year. This anticipated price increase, plus volume growth, places glyphosate on a more positive trend line, although we do anticipate some higher cost with the increased volumes.
In addition, it was great to see the first shipments of Xtendimax with VaporGrip technology moving to retail, and we expect this to continue in the second half. In summary, I'll echo Hugh's comments. We delivered a great start to the year, and our operational plans set us up for a strong close. We have tremendous momentum with the record penetration we're seeing with our latest soybean and cotton technologies, and continue to anticipate genetic share gains across multiple crops and key geographies.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?"

In Q2, we delivered as-reported earnings of $3.09 per share and an ongoing earnings of $3.19 per share. These translated to growth of more than 28% in both as-reported and ongoing earnings per share, and was mostly driven by 3 things: more than $300 million of gross profit growth from our corn and soybean businesses; the absence of the approximate 180 million impact of the Argentine peso devaluation; and finally, the 83 million gain from the sale of the Latitude business recorded in other income this quarter. In corn, gross profit grew by 12% in the second quarter and came mainly from Brazil, Europe and the U.S. U.S. corn growth related primarily to improved cost of goods with the return of a more normalized production plan, while Europe and the U.S. combined had a volume-timing benefit of roughly $40 million, stemming from strong grower demand. In addition, they both delivered anticipated share gains, mitigated by expected planted acre declines. Finally, the single largest driver came from pricing in Brazil, where we continue to see strong double-digit germplasm price increases in local currency. In soybeans, the 19% growth in gross profit and 6 points of margin expansion came from reduced COGS and increased trait revenues from our Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans in the U.S., which were compounded by higher volumes from expected increased soybean acres and share gains. Cotton gross profit also grew nicely in the quarter, where we saw more than 50 million in growth in the U.S. This was due largely to a timing benefit from a change in our customer contracts, and to a lesser degree, from initial sales of our Bollgard II XtendFlex.
Moving to Ag Productivity. We saw our gross profit for the quarter grow by about 3% over the prior year. Regarding Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides, we continued to experience the pricing headwinds we expected. However, at the segment level, this was more than offset by incremental glyphosate volumes and the initial sales of our dicamba-based herbicides. Finally, as we expected, operating expenses increased in the quarter, mostly due to the return to growth of the business. These increases were primarily driven by increasing incentive accrual expense, higher commissions in South America and greater investment in the Climate FieldView platform. They were partially offset by the continued savings from our restructuring and transformation actions. We continue to expect these to generate $200 million of operating expense and COGS savings versus the prior year on our path to $500 million of savings by 2018 versus our 2015 baseline, as shown on Slide 17. For cash, for the first half of fiscal year '17, we delivered nearly $1 billion of free cash flow as compared to $900 million in the prior year. This improvement was driven by the considerable increase in our net income, offset by working capital increases from receivables and inventories and payments for restructuring actions accrued in the prior year. These results reflect our new definition of free cash flow, which is operating cash flows less CapEx. This new definition of free cash flow aligns to the more commonly used definition by publicly traded companies, and we've conformed our historical reporting and our guidance accordingly.
Let's move ahead to our full year outlook on Slide 18. With strong first half results, plus the outlook for the rest of the year, we now confidently expect to be at the high end of the as-reported earnings per share range of $3.95 to $4.44 and of the ongoing earnings per share range of $4.50 to $4.90. From a gross profit perspective, we continue to expect our Seeds and Genomics segment gross profit to increase mid-single digits as a percent year-over-year.
In corn, we expect some volume gains from global genetic share gains, particularly in the U.S., to contribute to this gross profit growth. However, we now anticipate acres planted to be down slightly on a global basis, with the upside in South America being more than offset by the expected declines in the northern hemisphere. Global germplasm price-mix lift in local currency is still expected to be flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages, with the strong increases in South America being muted by germplasm price-mix lift in the U.S. that is expected to be roughly flat. In soybeans, gross profit is expected to now grow by more than 25%, driven by new trait penetration and an anticipated cost of goods sold reduction. In cotton, with the strength of Bollgard II XtendFlex in the U.S. and the return of high-value acres in Australia, the gross profit is expected to grow by more than 35%. Meanwhile, other crops gross profit is expected to decline due to the absence of the onetime $210 million alfalfa technology license payment from Q3 of the prior year. Within Ag Productivity, considering deal dynamics and the variable Brett discussed, our gross profit guidance still remains within the range of $850 million to $950 million, albeit moving more towards the lower end. From a strategic deals perspective, with further advancement in our discussion, we are now expecting the benefit to be somewhat below the earlier estimate of $100 million from licensing and asset sales, and now shared between the EBIT of our 2 segments in the second half of the fiscal year. This shift is in the projected recording of the Ag Productivity deal benefit to other income. It is the primary reason we are pointing to the lower end of the range for gross profit for that segment. Overall, operating expense in 2017, excluding the pending Bayer transaction cost and restructuring expenses, are still expected to increase slightly. This is because inflation and the cost associated with the return to growth of the business are anticipated to more than offset our savings. Finally, our outlook also assumes that changes in currency rates will have a relatively neutral effect on net income for the full year, and we continue to expect the tax rate for the year to be in the range of 25% to 28%. If we look just at Q3, we expect as-reported earnings per share to be roughly flat with the prior year. This is due to the absence of last year's Argentine-related tax matters call-out of $0.50 per share, mostly offset by the expected decline in ongoing earnings per share from the absence of the alfalfa deal, which was roughly $0.34 of earnings last year, and the volume timing shift from Q3 to Q2 in the European and U.S. corn businesses.
For the full year, we now anticipate these earnings to translate to the high end of our range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flows, resulting from expecting operating cash flows at the high end of a range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion and CapEx of $1.2 billion.
In closing, at the midpoint of our year, we look back on a strong first half, driven by outstanding returns on innovation and financial discipline. As we look forward, we're increasingly confident in the outlook for our business and our continued progress towards closure of the pending combination with Bayer.
With that, I will now pass it to Laura for the Q&A."

So pricing in South America, specifically pricing in Brazil, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, has been extremely strong, and we've seen a nice recovery and some growth in pricing in Brazil. So this has been something we've been observing in the first quarter, but also continuing into the safrinha market into the second quarter, so that was really a very strong performance in Brazil. And regarding costs, I mean, you remember we've always talked about having a penalty last year related to our cost of goods and reduced production plans. This year, we are going back to normal production plans. And as expected, we are seeing an improvement in our cost of goods position. So from a pure margin perspective, these would be the 2 critical drivers. And we've also seen really nice performance in terms of volumes in the U.S., in Europe, part of that being related to timing. I mean, we've got a really nice mild weather during the winter, but also expected share gains. And obviously, we'll see that before the end of the year, but a very strong performance in corn in this quarter, definitely."

I think, as all of you know, the environment for our customers continues to be very difficult with corn prices still, call it, plus-minus $3.50, hanging in there somewhere. And that's not a robust pricing scenario for our farmer customers, so it creates a challenging environment. So 2 things that, that impacts. Number one, as you increase yield, which we do with our new hybrids and introduce those into the marketplace, the value of that incremental yield is based upon the price of the commodity. So that has an effect, Bob, on how much you actually go up based on that yield gain that's occurring. And then it also plays into the farmers' expectation around how they set their portfolio. Here's what has not changed, and this has been consistent for many, many years. Farmers do not back away from buying the latest and greatest because they drive yield and productivity. That is their only friend, whether it's a good commodity environment or a bad commodity environment, that's their only friend, is drive yield and dilute the fixed costs that they're getting across their business. And when they start using tools, like Climate, and start managing their other inputs more effectively and efficiently and they can still get those yield increases, they can drive their cost per unit of production down. So that's the focus and that's why you look at this year, we completely sold out of our Disease Shield hybrid with the new B-300 SAT, which is -- that is our top of the line. It doesn't get any better than that, and those sold out. So farmer demand for high end is still there. They look at adjusting through the rest of the portfolio, and it's been hard to get those price increases with commodity price, and that's how it plays out and puts us where we're at."

So first of all, we are really happy to see the price of Roundup continuing to slowly go up, which is favorable, and which was one of our planning assumptions getting into the year. So this one will be a positive in the second half. What we're seeing in the second half is -- I mean, because of the sale of our Latitude business, we are not going to have the revenues from that business that we usually enjoy in the fourth quarter. And then from a cost of goods perspective, we've got a couple of increases in cost of goods in our glyphosate business and also a number of project costs on the manufacturing side that are going to impact our second half results. So these are the key drivers of our guidance into the second half of the year. Regarding the slight adjustment to our guidance in the second half, it's mostly that some of the deals we are contemplating based on the work we've been doing is also going to be recorded in other income rather than gross profit. But overall, I mean, the nice thing we are seeing in this segment is that our glyphosate business now is on the right trend."

From the beginning of this, our position has been that all these deals should be done and that the industry really not only would benefit, but the industry really needed this consolidation. So as you think about despite the terrible commodity prices at the moment, the grower, to Brett's point, is desperately hungry for innovation, and a big piece of that innovation, I think, is going to come through this work. Each of these deals is unique, but we are heartened to see the deals ahead of us making progress because I think it underscores the fact that the regulatory process works. And then to your point on closure by year-end and confidence, we've learned over the years, it's never good to speculate on government agencies, but I would tell you the unique thing about our deal, I guess everybody thinks that their deal is unique, but the unique thing about this deal is the very limited amount of overlap. So as this call this morning has underscored, we're really strong in the area of seeds and biotech. Bayer is the premier company in the broad front of crop protection. And I think that -- I won't speak for regulatory agencies, but the remedy lies in the elimination of the overlap around the world. So we are working -- Bayer is taking the lead. We are supporting them, but we are working diligently towards a year-end close. And Robb and I have been bundling plane hours, going and talking to ag constituencies around the world, and those have gone well. The feedback there has been good because there's such a focus on the need for not just more innovation but faster innovation. The time lines, when you think about how long we waited on Xtend, 7 years from submission to approval, there's a need to kickstart faster innovation in this industry, and I'm hopeful that this conclusion -- or the conclusion of this deal will see a phase shift on timing as well. So that's how I'm looking at it. And obviously, as owners and people interested in the company, we'll keep you up to speed as we get more to talk about.
So let me respect your time and I thank you for joining us today, and thanks to Laura and her team for continuing to bring, albeit streamlined communication, but keeping the facts in front of you during this period. So as we close out today, I'd say it's clear that the year ahead for us will be significant, and we here at Monsanto are clearly focused on our 2 key deliverables. To that end, our plan to return to EPS growth in '17 is tracking nicely. And to the previous comments from Frank, we continue to work towards closing the agreement to combine with Bayer by the end of this calendar year. I'm very proud of our teams here at Monsanto. They've maintained their focus on the business, and as always, they've maintained focus on our grower customers during a tough time and have turned in really good results. So thanks again to you for joining us on the call this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you again in June at our Q3 earnings. Thanks very much."

Our second quarter call marks a critical time during our annual business cycle, and importantly, allows us to provide a meaningful outlook for the balance of the fiscal year. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com.
We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First, let me share our second quarter results, as shown on Slide 4. As outlined in our reconciliations, we delivered as-reported earnings per share of $3.09 and ongoing earnings per share of $3.19 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, well above the prior year as-reported earnings per share of $2.41 and ongoing earnings per share of $2.42.

The end of the second quarter allows us to gauge progress against our 2 priorities for the year: number one, to deliver our fiscal year 2017 operational plan and key milestones; and number two, to",1044,"Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. The end of the second quarter allows us to gauge progress against our 2 priorities for the year: number one, to deliver our fiscal year 2017 operational plan and key milestones; and number two, to close the merger with Bayer. So let's start first with the deal as shown on Slide 6. Bayer has led the regulatory filing process with support from Monsanto, as appropriate, and as they indicated in their year-end earnings call, both parties are working towards closure at the end of this calendar year. They continue to expect the filing to be made with the EU Commission this calendar quarter, and progress has been made with the second request from the U.S. Department of Justice. Like you, we also see the other proposed combinations advancing, as this industry undergoes a necessary and a healthy transformation to serve farmers better around the world.
As the process moves forward, our emphasis at Monsanto is where it's always been, on bringing much needed innovation to growers. Robb and I have spent significant time sharing our perspectives with ag industry organizations, policymakers and grower groups on the benefits of this deal. Innovation is at the heart of the industrial logic for combining with Bayer, just as it was with the consolidation that we led in the industry 20 years ago.
Since then, we've seen scores of biotech, breeding and crop technology improvements, and our view is that the next 20 years will raise the level of agronomic performance even further. Very simply, this deal is about accelerating innovation, optimizing integrated solutions and expanding the offerings that will be available to farmers through broad licensing globally in the years to come. From delivering new choices even faster to expanding solutions in disease and insect control, our combination with Bayer is a real gateway to exciting possibilities in ag science, as shown on Slide 7. And it doesn't stop there. We think greater focus can be brought to historically underfunded crops, like wheat, as well as opportunities in geographies where agriculture could benefit from improvements in scale like parts of Asia, and certainly, in Africa. After outlining examples like these with growers, one thing is very clear, they want innovation and they fully recognize the role that it plays in bringing them solutions to run the profitable and sustainable operations necessary to meet the demand curves.
This overarching need to produce more hasn't changed. In fact, as seen on Slide 8, demand continues to strengthen. The trend line from WASDE forecasts projects that annual demand for corn and beans is expected to rise. Growth expectations for just the 2016, 2017 marketing year translates to demand for an incremental 1.7 billion bushels for corn and more than 600 million bushels for soybeans. To put that into context, if this incremental demand were met by new production acres in the U.S. alone, it would require more than 20 million new acres of corn and soybeans combined.
And as shown on Slide 9, it's Monsanto's proven innovation and unique platform advantages that position us well to meet these challenges and what makes us such an attractive complementary partner for Bayer. However, we're not sitting still, and we continue to invest in our future. We're building upon our industry-leading Climate FieldView platform and strong foundation of seed, trait and system solutions, particularly with our next-generation technologies in insect and weed control.
Shortly after we spoke back in January, we broke-ground our Luling, Louisiana glyphosate production site to make way for our first-ever dicamba production facility, expected to come online at the end of this decade. This plant, together with capacity being added by the industry, will be an integral part of delivering the top weed control system throughout the Americas. We're stoking this demand with the fastest trait ramp-ups in our company's history, with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans and Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton. Longer term, we're building out our leading platforms with investment in R&D capabilities. We've nearly completed the initial phase of our planned $400 million Chesterfield R&D site expansion, and we expect that the ribbon cutting will be later this year.
In addition, technical pipeline projects are progressing well, including our blockbuster NemaStrike Technology with exceptional nematode control. The public comment period for the EPA approval process for this new technology recently closed with positive feedback, and we're now well on track for commercialization next year. Also, we reached another significant positive milestone in the reregistration of glyphosate in Europe with the European Chemicals Agency concluding that glyphosate is not a carcinogen. Once again, this aligns with more than 800 studies, spanning 4 decades that all confirm the safety of this critical farming tool. In fact, this same conclusion has been reached by the U.S. EPA, the European Food Safety Authority, and regulators in Japan and Canada and numerous other countries. So despite some headlines to the contrary, sound science from respected organizations continues to prevail. 
And finally, on the business. We've done excellent first half, delivering $3.39 of ongoing earnings per share, as compared to $2.25 in the prior year. Our gross profit improved nearly 20% in the first half, due primarily to strong pricing and area expansion in corn in South America and the strong performance of our newest soybean seed and trait technologies. This growth in gross profit, coupled with the absence of the Argentina currency devaluation and the gain on the Latitude sale has propelled this strong start to the fiscal year. Given these results and our increased confidence in the outlook for the rest of the year, our guidance for fiscal year '17 now moves to the high end of the range for both as-reported and ongoing EPS.
So all in all, I'm very proud of our team and their focus on our business. We're making strides towards closure on the pending combination. Our record-breaking technology penetration continues to drive earnings growth and we're investing for the longer term in R&D. And we do all of this through our singular strategic lens to continue to bring value-added innovation to growers around the globe.
So with that overview, let me pass it to Brett to discuss the operational plans that support this outlook. Brett?"
528414,405049408,1166583,"Monsanto Company, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 05, 2017",2017-04-05,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Our focus on delivering the business has continued through the second quarter and places our company on a path to provide earnings growth through the turn of the decade. To help illustrate how, let's begin the ope",852,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Our focus on delivering the business has continued through the second quarter and places our company on a path to provide earnings growth through the turn of the decade. To help illustrate how, let's begin the operational outlook with corn, as shown on Slide 10. We continue to expect to grow our corn gross profit even as the commodity prices remain challenging in the mid- to high $3 range. This is driven by a global germplasm price-mix lift in local currency and genetic share gains despite expectations that the global planted acres could now decline slightly. Starting in the U.S. with an early spring, our Q2 deliveries were ahead of expectations, and provided some timing benefit. In addition, I'm pleased to share that we're sold out of our first year DEKALB Disease Shield hybrids, which also came with our newest microbial seed treatment, Acceleron B-300 SAT. In Brazil, double-digit price-mix lift in local currency continues in the second quarter, and we're seeing strong demand for VT Triple PRO traited hybrids. In Argentina, we now are estimating even greater growth in acres at more than 40%. And finally, Europe remains on track with strong grower demand driving volumes in the second quarter, though we do expect some decline in acres planted compared to last year.
Let's move to our soybean franchise on Slide 11 next. We're very excited about the story developing here. We're on pace to deliver greater than 25% growth in global soybean gross profit, and are seeing nice margin improvement year-over-year. Our ramp of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in the United States is now moving fast, as shown on Slide 12. We have all the approvals in place for Xtendimax with VaporGrip Technology for the key soybean growing states we're seeking with the exception of Arkansas. We're also pleased to see that the recent EPA approvals of numerous tank mix partners, including glyphosate, providing industry-leading weed control and a convenient tool for growers. Seed supply is excellent, and we now expect 18 million acres of traded varieties to be planted from Mississippi to Minnesota. This demand-driven increase from our prior estimates matches our largest trait launch ever, and all together, at 18 million acres, would be the highest penetration we've ever achieved in the second year of a trait launch. 
Moving to South America on Slide 13, performance of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 Pro continues to demonstrate its advantage over competing varieties, and we are in the early days of evaluating the first wave of our own yield trials. This adds to our confidence in the 45 million to 55 million acre range for the technology this year, as Intacta continues to set trait penetration records. In Argentina, our planning assumption is there is a continuation of the current royalty capture system for the upcoming season. 
Our other crops are also seeing steady growth, starting with cotton on Slide 14. Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton is now expected to exceed 4 million acres in the U.S., which will be a driver towards our target of delivering our third straight year of share gains. On top of that, we're starting to sell Bollgard 3 XtendFlex Cotton in the U.S. this year to further increase the spectrum and durability of insect control.
Moving to our Climate business on Slide 15. We're seeing major advancements in a number of areas. Digital ag tools are rapidly evolving, and the strategic differentiators for the Climate FieldView really set it apart. Collaborations and partnerships with others in this space as well as our pace of adoption and expansion have established our leadership role. Interest in joining our platform has been strong, and we're currently in discussions with more than 25 potential technology providers. We remain on track to deliver our fiscal year target of 25 million paid acres. And geographically, experience with the platform is growing in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Brazil, as shown on Slide 16. In fact, in Brazil, some of the largest growers in the country are using the technology on 750,000 acres. The feedback is good and we're off to a very promising start. Lastly, let's close with Ag Productivity. We're seeing first half price improvements for generic glyphosate acid translate to retail, which we expect to result in modest price improvements in the second half of the year. This anticipated price increase, plus volume growth, places glyphosate on a more positive trend line, although we do anticipate some higher cost with the increased volumes.
In addition, it was great to see the first shipments of Xtendimax with VaporGrip technology moving to retail, and we expect this to continue in the second half. In summary, I'll echo Hugh's comments. We delivered a great start to the year, and our operational plans set us up for a strong close. We have tremendous momentum with the record penetration we're seeing with our latest soybean and cotton technologies, and continue to anticipate genetic share gains across multiple crops and key geographies.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?"

In Q2, we delivered as-reported earnings of $3.09 per share and an ongoing earnings of $3.19 per share. These translated to growth of more than 28% in both as-reported and ongoing earnings per share, and was mostly driven by 3 things: more than $300 million of gross profit growth from our corn and soybean businesses; the absence of the approximate 180 million impact of the Argentine peso devaluation; and finally, the 83 million gain from the sale of the Latitude business recorded in other income this quarter. In corn, gross profit grew by 12% in the second quarter and came mainly from Brazil, Europe and the U.S. U.S. corn growth related primarily to improved cost of goods with the return of a more normalized production plan, while Europe and the U.S. combined had a volume-timing benefit of roughly $40 million, stemming from strong grower demand. In addition, they both delivered anticipated share gains, mitigated by expected planted acre declines. Finally, the single largest driver came from pricing in Brazil, where we continue to see strong double-digit germplasm price increases in local currency. In soybeans, the 19% growth in gross profit and 6 points of margin expansion came from reduced COGS and increased trait revenues from our Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans in the U.S., which were compounded by higher volumes from expected increased soybean acres and share gains. Cotton gross profit also grew nicely in the quarter, where we saw more than 50 million in growth in the U.S. This was due largely to a timing benefit from a change in our customer contracts, and to a lesser degree, from initial sales of our Bollgard II XtendFlex.
Moving to Ag Productivity. We saw our gross profit for the quarter grow by about 3% over the prior year. Regarding Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides, we continued to experience the pricing headwinds we expected. However, at the segment level, this was more than offset by incremental glyphosate volumes and the initial sales of our dicamba-based herbicides. Finally, as we expected, operating expenses increased in the quarter, mostly due to the return to growth of the business. These increases were primarily driven by increasing incentive accrual expense, higher commissions in South America and greater investment in the Climate FieldView platform. They were partially offset by the continued savings from our restructuring and transformation actions. We continue to expect these to generate $200 million of operating expense and COGS savings versus the prior year on our path to $500 million of savings by 2018 versus our 2015 baseline, as shown on Slide 17. For cash, for the first half of fiscal year '17, we delivered nearly $1 billion of free cash flow as compared to $900 million in the prior year. This improvement was driven by the considerable increase in our net income, offset by working capital increases from receivables and inventories and payments for restructuring actions accrued in the prior year. These results reflect our new definition of free cash flow, which is operating cash flows less CapEx. This new definition of free cash flow aligns to the more commonly used definition by publicly traded companies, and we've conformed our historical reporting and our guidance accordingly.
Let's move ahead to our full year outlook on Slide 18. With strong first half results, plus the outlook for the rest of the year, we now confidently expect to be at the high end of the as-reported earnings per share range of $3.95 to $4.44 and of the ongoing earnings per share range of $4.50 to $4.90. From a gross profit perspective, we continue to expect our Seeds and Genomics segment gross profit to increase mid-single digits as a percent year-over-year.
In corn, we expect some volume gains from global genetic share gains, particularly in the U.S., to contribute to this gross profit growth. However, we now anticipate acres planted to be down slightly on a global basis, with the upside in South America being more than offset by the expected declines in the northern hemisphere. Global germplasm price-mix lift in local currency is still expected to be flat to up low single digits in terms of percentages, with the strong increases in South America being muted by germplasm price-mix lift in the U.S. that is expected to be roughly flat. In soybeans, gross profit is expected to now grow by more than 25%, driven by new trait penetration and an anticipated cost of goods sold reduction. In cotton, with the strength of Bollgard II XtendFlex in the U.S. and the return of high-value acres in Australia, the gross profit is expected to grow by more than 35%. Meanwhile, other crops gross profit is expected to decline due to the absence of the onetime $210 million alfalfa technology license payment from Q3 of the prior year. Within Ag Productivity, considering deal dynamics and the variable Brett discussed, our gross profit guidance still remains within the range of $850 million to $950 million, albeit moving more towards the lower end. From a strategic deals perspective, with further advancement in our discussion, we are now expecting the benefit to be somewhat below the earlier estimate of $100 million from licensing and asset sales, and now shared between the EBIT of our 2 segments in the second half of the fiscal year. This shift is in the projected recording of the Ag Productivity deal benefit to other income. It is the primary reason we are pointing to the lower end of the range for gross profit for that segment. Overall, operating expense in 2017, excluding the pending Bayer transaction cost and restructuring expenses, are still expected to increase slightly. This is because inflation and the cost associated with the return to growth of the business are anticipated to more than offset our savings. Finally, our outlook also assumes that changes in currency rates will have a relatively neutral effect on net income for the full year, and we continue to expect the tax rate for the year to be in the range of 25% to 28%. If we look just at Q3, we expect as-reported earnings per share to be roughly flat with the prior year. This is due to the absence of last year's Argentine-related tax matters call-out of $0.50 per share, mostly offset by the expected decline in ongoing earnings per share from the absence of the alfalfa deal, which was roughly $0.34 of earnings last year, and the volume timing shift from Q3 to Q2 in the European and U.S. corn businesses.
For the full year, we now anticipate these earnings to translate to the high end of our range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flows, resulting from expecting operating cash flows at the high end of a range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion and CapEx of $1.2 billion.
In closing, at the midpoint of our year, we look back on a strong first half, driven by outstanding returns on innovation and financial discipline. As we look forward, we're increasingly confident in the outlook for our business and our continued progress towards closure of the pending combination with Bayer.
With that, I will now pass it to Laura for the Q&A."

So this has been something we've been observing in the first quarter, but also continuing into the safrinha market into the second quarter, so that was really a very strong performance in Brazil. And regarding costs, I mean, you remember we've always talked about having a penalty last year related to our cost of goods and reduced production plans. This year, we are going back to normal production plans. And as expected, we are seeing an improvement in our cost of goods position. So from a pure margin perspective, these would be the 2 critical drivers. And we've also seen really nice performance in terms of volumes in the U.S., in Europe, part of that being related to timing. I mean, we've got a really nice mild weather during the winter, but also expected share gains.

And that's not a robust pricing scenario for our farmer customers, so it creates a challenging environment. So 2 things that, that impacts. Number one, as you increase yield, which we do with our new hybrids and introduce those into the marketplace, the value of that incremental yield is based upon the price of the commodity. So that has an effect, Bob, on how much you actually go up based on that yield gain that's occurring. And then it also plays into the farmers' expectation around how they set their portfolio. Here's what has not changed, and this has been consistent for many, many years. Farmers do not back away from buying the latest and greatest because they drive yield and productivity. That is their only friend, whether it's a good commodity environment or a bad commodity environment, that's their only friend, is drive yield and dilute the fixed costs that they're getting across their business. And when they start using tools, like Climate, and start managing their other inputs more effectively and efficiently and they can still get those yield increases, they can drive their cost per unit of production down. So that's the focus and that's why you look at this year, we completely sold out of our Disease Shield hybrid with the new B-300 SAT, which is -- that is our top of the line. It doesn't get any better than that, and those sold out. So farmer demand for high end is still there. They look at adjusting through the rest of the portfolio, and it's been hard to get those price increases with commodity price, and that's how it plays out and puts us where we're at."

So first of all, we are really happy to see the price of Roundup continuing to slowly go up, which is favorable, and which was one of our planning assumptions getting into the year. So this one will be a positive in the second half. What we're seeing in the second half is -- I mean, because of the sale of our Latitude business, we are not going to have the revenues from that business that we usually enjoy in the fourth quarter. And then from a cost of goods perspective, we've got a couple of increases in cost of goods in our glyphosate business and also a number of project costs on the manufacturing side that are going to impact our second half results. So these are the key drivers of our guidance into the second half of the year. Regarding the slight adjustment to our guidance in the second half, it's mostly that some of the deals we are contemplating based on the work we've been doing is also going to be recorded in other income rather than gross profit. But overall, I mean, the nice thing we are seeing in this segment is that our glyphosate business now is on the right trend."

From the beginning of this, our position has been that all these deals should be done and that the industry really not only would benefit, but the industry really needed this consolidation. So as you think about despite the terrible commodity prices at the moment, the grower, to Brett's point, is desperately hungry for innovation, and a big piece of that innovation, I think, is going to come through this work. Each of these deals is unique, but we are heartened to see the deals ahead of us making progress because I think it underscores the fact that the regulatory process works. And then to your point on closure by year-end and confidence, we've learned over the years, it's never good to speculate on government agencies, but I would tell you the unique thing about our deal, I guess everybody thinks that their deal is unique, but the unique thing about this deal is the very limited amount of overlap. So as this call this morning has underscored, we're really strong in the area of seeds and biotech. Bayer is the premier company in the broad front of crop protection. And I think that -- I won't speak for regulatory agencies, but the remedy lies in the elimination of the overlap around the world. So we are working -- Bayer is taking the lead. We are supporting them, but we are working diligently towards a year-end close. And Robb and I have been bundling plane hours, going and talking to ag constituencies around the world, and those have gone well. The feedback there has been good because there's such a focus on the need for not just more innovation but faster innovation. The time lines, when you think about how long we waited on Xtend, 7 years from submission to approval, there's a need to kickstart faster innovation in this industry, and I'm hopeful that this conclusion -- or the conclusion of this deal will see a phase shift on timing as well. So that's how I'm looking at it. And obviously, as owners and people interested in the company, we'll keep you up to speed as we get more to talk about.
So let me respect your time and I thank you for joining us today, and thanks to Laura and her team for continuing to bring, albeit streamlined communication, but keeping the facts in front of you during this period. So as we close out today, I'd say it's clear that the year ahead for us will be significant, and we here at Monsanto are clearly focused on our 2 key deliverables. To that end, our plan to return to EPS growth in '17 is tracking nicely. And to the previous comments from Frank, we continue to work towards closing the agreement to combine with Bayer by the end of this calendar year. I'm very proud of our teams here at Monsanto. They've maintained their focus on the business, and as always, they've maintained focus on our grower customers during a tough time and have turned in really good results.

Our third quarter call marks a passage of a significant portion of the Northern Hemisphere ag season. And today, we'll provide a summary of our third quarter results, as well as the outlook for the balance of this year.
This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.
A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
Before handing it over to Hugh to share our strategic outlook, let me share our third quarter results, as shown on Slide 4. As outlined in our reconciliations and in line with our expectations, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93 as compared to last year's as reported earnings per share of $1.63 and ongoing earnings per share of $2.17. 
From a free cash flow perspective, we had a use of cash of $158 million for the first 3 quarters as compared to a use of cash of $251 million in the prior year. Hugh?"

I'm pleased to share that we've returned another solid quarter for fiscal year 2017. And in doing so, have an even clearer line of sight on our 2 priorities for the year, namely: Delivering on our operational plan and key business milestones; and moving to closure on the Bayer merger agreement.
So let's begin with the Bayer path to completion on Slide 6. Bayer continues to lead the filing process with support from Monsanto, and continues to target closing by the end of the year. The filing in the European Union is expected to be submitted in the next few days and the response to the second request issued by the U.S. Department of Justice was recently completed. Once the EU filing is in, all key initial submissions will have been made. In addition, we've already received clearance from several regulators, including South Africa, for which Bayer agreed to provide remedies. The clearance progress has been steady and consistent, and we remain encouraged by the advancement of other proposed combinations as our industry undergoes a healthy transformation to better serve the world's farmers.
And while other deals have [indiscernible], we believe this merger is uniquely beneficial, as shown on Slide 7. It has the capacity to benefit growers by accelerating innovation, by delivering integrated solution tools and by expanding offerings to new crops and geographies at a time when they're most needed.
One other benefit it delivers is complementary R&D expertise to enhance discovery efforts, leading to increasingly meaningful benefits for growers around the world. And global agriculture meets together to solve the conundrum of growing more with less inputs. We know that there are ways to grow food better, smarter and more efficiently. Collectively, we've created undelivered, many of the building blocks necessary to meet future needs, but there's still much more to do. Despite near-term supply, the demand for corn and soybeans continues to grow, as shown on Slide 8. The rigors of climate change and competition for resources will only serve to intensify this need.
We're well positioned to develop this next-generation of solutions, as shown on Slide 9, with the broadly licensed Climate Fieldview platform and our strong foundation of seed, trait and chemistry solutions. The combination with Bayer should only serve to accelerate our ability to bring those to the growers who need it the most. And our open platform continues to expand and evolve. I'm encouraged by the positive farmer experiences we've been hearing and seeing for Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton and Climate FieldView as they reach record levels of penetration. In fact, combined, these new technologies are on more than 125 million acres in the U.S. in just 2 to 3 short years.
In addition, we've recently received several regulatory approvals for our products. In April, we received the EPA approval of NemaStrike Technology, keeping this blockbuster product on track for commercial launch in fiscal year '18. We also recently obtained the EPA approval for SmartStax PRO, our next generation of cotton rootworm control technology, which we expect to launch around the [ term ] of the decade, pending receipt of certain import approvals. And finally, this [indiscernible] soybeans just received import approval from China, clearing its final regulatory [indiscernible] for full commercialization in 2018.
These factors also play into the high-quality performance that our business is delivering, with gross profit up more than 12% through the first 3 quarters. our innovation leadership is driving our growth and the completion of our third quarter bolsters our confidence and the outlook for the rest of the year. 
To that end, our guidance range for fiscal year '17 is expected to be at the high end of the range for as reported earnings per share and is confirmed at the high-end of the range for ongoing earnings despite the continued tough ag market. 
I am very pleased with what our team has accomplished, maintaining its focus while balancing our 2 [indiscernible]. The business remains on its growth trajectory and the progress and the combination continues at a steady clip. So with that, I'll pass it to Brett to provide the operational update. Brett?"

Our focus to delivering the key business imperatives has powered us through the third quarter. And achieving our 2017 key milestones will place our company on a path to deliver on our strong growth to the turn of the decade. Specifically, the ramp of our latest technologies has been record-breaking, with Roundup Ready Xtend, Intacta and Climate FieldView, our costs have been coming down in both U.S. corn and soybeans, and our pipeline continues to advance.
As we delve into the specifics, let's start with corn, as shown on Slide 10. This quarter is all about the Northern Hemisphere. Let's begin with the U.S., where we are sold out of our [indiscernible] disease shield hybrids in the first year of their introduction and we remain on track for genetic share gains. This was offset by lower than anticipated planted acres and a modest decline in our germplasm price/mix. A key inclusion on those disease shield hybrids was our Acceleron B300 SAT microbial product, which was first -- was the first launch from the BioAg joint venture with Novozymes. Early-season reaction has been positive, and we look forward to seeing how the rest of the season plays out.
In Europe, acres planted to corn year-over-year ended up relatively flat and our team delivered modest germplasm price/mix lift in local currency, along with anticipated genetic share gains. Overall, we're still expecting our full year global corn germplasm price/mix lift to be flat to up low single digits as a percent in local currency, primarily driven by the strong double-digit growth in the first half in Brazil and Argentina.
For soybeans, the momentum continues to be tremendous in our latest technologies, as shown on Slide 11. With 50% growth in gross profit in Q3 alone, we now expect to deliver approximately 30% growth in our soybean gross profit, as well as strong margin improvement for the full year. 
Let's start with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in the U.S., as shown on Slide 12, where our ramp year for the trait has been outstanding. There are about 20 million acres planted across the country and we're hearing great feedback on the performance of the varieties and the efficacy of the trait and herbicide system in managing tough-to-control weeds. Based on information we have to date, the overwhelming majority of our customers are experiencing success with on-target application of XtendiMax with VaporGrip technology, and are following the label and good stewardship practices. So I'm looking forward to seeing how the rest of the season unfolds.
In South America, the strong performance of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO technology, once again underpins the record penetration we are delivering. For a fourth consecutive year, Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO is delivering a greater than 4 bushel per acre yield advantage based on 2017 field trials. With this continued strong performance, growers have added another 15 million acres this year increasing penetration to more than 50 million planted acres across South America, as shown on Slide 13. 
Our focus is now shifting to next season, where we have established the price in Brazil, commensurate with the performance and reflecting an increase in local currency, which included the removal of the transition rebate that expired in fiscal year 2017 as expected.
In cotton, on Slide 14, the growing experience with a Bollgard II XtendFlex varieties and the ability to use dicamba herbicides in season has now driven our trait penetration to more than 5 million acres in the U.S. This is well over our anticipated penetration of more than 4 million acres and it's nice to see given the substantial growth in cotton acres this year. In addition, we're increasingly confident in our delivery of the third straight year of genetic share gains in cotton, and look to build upon this in the years ahead with the Bollgard III XtendFlex cotton.
Moving to our other crops. We still expect modest but steady growth in vegetables for the full year. We also continued to strategically manage our product portfolio as planned, with 2 additional deals struck recently, one in Ag Productivity and one in Seeds and Genomics, and we expect to receive the benefit in our fourth quarter results.
Shifting to digital tools, our Climate FieldView platform continues to see major advancements in its strategic differentiators in this space, with our partnerships, collaborations and strong adoption, as shown on slide 15. In terms of partnerships, we have signed up 3 new platform partners, Series Imaging, TerrAvion and Agribotix that will deliver valuable high-resolution inventory to farmers. In addition, in May, Climate acquired HydroBio, an agricultural software company, with unique irrigation-focused data and analytics capabilities. This not only reinforces our partner of choice reputation in this space, but also expands the suite of products we expect to be able to offer farmers in the years ahead. And we would expect even more announcements here before the end of the fiscal year as we continue to evaluate more than 25 potential technology partners.
In terms of adoption, we are ahead of where we expected to be for paid acres, registering more than 35 million, well above the original target of 25 million acres. We also just recently announced our official commercial launch in Brazil after concluding trials on nearly 1 million acres, as shown on Slide 16. With continued significant progress on adoption and partnerships and increasing interest in licensing opportunities, Climate FieldView remains a very promising area on the horizon for us. 
At our Ag Productivity segment, we are now seeing the anticipated glyphosate-based herbicide price improvement translating to the retail market. This has resulted in year-over-year improvement in gross profit for the segment for the third quarter, and we expect this improvement in pricing will extend into the fourth quarter, despite year-over-year headwinds we saw in the past. We're also increasingly confident in glyphosate's re-registration in Europe as discussions have been progressing positively. In addition, XtendiMax with VaporGrip technology continues to contribute to the bottom line as trait penetration for the Roundup Ready XTEND crop system drives demand for low volatility dicamba formulations. 
Moving to pipeline products. As you mentioned, we recently received the highly anticipated news from the U.S. EPA that NemaStrike Technology has been approved. This puts us on track for commercialization in 2018, and allowed us to place hundreds of ground breaker trials across the U.S. this year, as shown on Slide 17.
As we've done with numerous new technologies in the past, these trials will give growers firsthand experience with NemaStrike Technology, and will inform our launch for the 2018. With blockbuster value and strong interest from license [indiscernible] and growers, we are excited to move the technology into their hands.
All in all, this was a solid quarter, in line with our expectations. And as we look confidently to close out 2017, we've shifted our focus to growers and field experience with our latest technologies, managing returns in the northern hemisphere and to the selling season in South America. With that, I'll hand it over to Pierre for his financial review."
528414,405049398,1236233,"Monsanto Company, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2017",2017-06-28,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93, in line with our expectations. let's look at the specifics. Our soybeans gross profit grew b",739,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93, in line with our expectations. 
let's look at the specifics. Our soybeans gross profit grew by 50%, driven primarily by 3 factors in the U.S.: the reduced cost of goods for Roundup Ready Xtend; the increased acres planted to soybean; and the benefit from the sale of its [indiscernible] traded varieties. Similarly, cotton gross profit improved by 31%, thanks to the increase in U.S. planted acres, greater Bollgard II XtendFlex acreage and genetic share gains. Corn gross profit was down slightly, in line with expectations, and mostly due to lower planted acres in the United States, coupled with the previously mentioned grower demand driven timing shift into Q2. These was partially offset by lower cost of goods in the U.S. due to improved production volumes. Global corn price was essentially flat in the market where commodity prices continued to be challenging. Finally, other crops seasoned trade gross profit declined due to the absence of the benefit from the alfalfa license in the prior year. 
Ag Productivity gross profit increased about 12%, given the improvement in both pricing and volume for glyphosate-based herbicides and the continuation of XtendiMax dicamba-based herbicide sales coming through in the results. Our SG&A and R&D expense increased about 8%, primarily resulting from increased incentive expenses driven by the growth in the business and from the increased investments in Climate. However, we remain on track with our target of $500 million in savings by the end of the fiscal year 2018, as shown on Slide 18, across cost of goods and operating expenses as compared to our fiscal year [ 2016 ] base. These savings are helping to offset inflation rate increase globally. 
Lastly, free cash flow fiscal year-to-date is a use of cash of $158 million versus the prior year use of cash of $251 million. This improvement reflects the increase in operating cash flows from dollars as compared to the prior year. The increase in capital expenditure relates to the construction of the dicamba manufacturing facility in Luling, Louisiana. 
Looking out for the end of the fiscal year, as shown on Slide 19. We Confidently expect our as reported earnings per share to be at the high-end of the range of $4.09 to $4.55 and again, confirm our ongoing earnings per share at the high end of the range of $4.50 to $4.90. For free cash flow, we also still expect to be at the high-end of the range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. 
As we look at the specific [ confidence ] of guidance, let's start with [indiscernible] gross profit which is now expected to be up high single digits as a percentage for the year. These reflects outstanding growth in both soybeans and cotton, as well as modest growth in corn, partially offset by the absence of the benefits from the alfalfa license in Q3 of fiscal year '16.
In our other segments. Ag Productivity gross profit is still expected to be the range of $850 million to $950 million, as both glyphosate and dicamba deliver anticipated results. 
As part of our continued portfolio optimization efforts, I am pleased with the recent deals we signed, and we expect to receive the benefit of roughly $70 million in noncore asset sales gain in the fourth quarter. About half of these gains will benefit the Ag Productivity segments and half will benefit Seeds and Genomics. Both are expected to be reported in our other income and are considered in our guidance. 
Despite the recent weakening of the Brazilian reais, we still anticipate the change in currency rates year-over-year to be relatively neutral to earnings. And finally, we still expect our SG&A and R&D expense to be up mid-single digits as a percent due to increased [ commission ] in South America, incentive increases and greater spend at Climate, consistent with the drivers in the year-to-date results. 
In closing, we are delivering solid returns on innovation. And doing so with financial discipline as we return our business to growth this fiscal year. We have confidence that the outlook for the balance of the year is on sure footing, and we'll look forward to updating you at the fourth quarter. 
Thank you for your time today, and with that, I will pass it to Laura for the questions."

But we do continue to build it out for northern Argentina and work with the government on the system. And what really gets me excited about Intacta in South America is the work our R&D team has done to bring us the next-generation of Intacta 2, and we're already starting to build the plants to make the big transition from Intacta 1 to Intacta 2.

And the key thing there is, we're also expecting half the amounts of deals that we had last year, and this is one of the reasons at this point in time since we've calibrated the benefits from deal around $70 million, this is why despite the increase you see in our guidance from GP in both Ag Productivity and Seeds and Genomics, I mean, modest increases there, you see that total EPS not changing dramatically because we have scaled-down some of our assumptions as well on the deals. So all in all, I mean, pointing to the high end of our guidance, you're looking at a year where we're looking at a double-digit growth for the full fiscal year in terms of EPS in a really challenging environment.

What we've seen so far, Don, is the vast majority of farmers and applicators using our products are seeing great results both from a weed control and efficacy standpoint, as well as the application itself and the products they input. So we feel really good about what we're seeing. I'll remind you, to your point of the -- 33 out of 34 states have approved our XtendiMax with VaporGrip technology. But Arkansas, as you noted, was one of them that never approved that product or was the only one that never approved that product. As it stands today, as we look at inquires across the entire country in the [ 34 ] states where we're approved, it appears that the plant lord in Arkansas is getting a lot more inquiries than we're getting across the combined rest of the state or states that have approved XtendiMax with VaporGrip. So the key here is that, it's the largest launch ever. The number of inquiries we're experiencing would be normal for any product, even products haven't been established in the marketplace have experienced a number of inquiries every year.

Yes, we've been somewhat limited based on inflation in Brazil. It's not very often when you're talking about inflation being your friend, but inflation has been our friend when it comes to pricing of Intacta. So we haven't been holding our price flat in Brazil. We've actually been moving it up with inflation the past number of years. So we have improved our position. As noted, there was a transition payment that was occurring from the old Roundup Ready formulation or trait to the new Roundup Ready 2 and Intacta, and that expires. And with that expiration, it feels a bit like a price increase to the farmer and a benefit to us because it just goes away. So it just extinguishes itself. So we feel the benefit of that.

Our third quarter call marks the passage of a significant portion of the Northern Hemisphere ag season, and today, we'll provide a summary of our third quarter results, as well as the outlook for the balance of this year.
This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
Before handing it over to Hugh to share our strategic outlook, let me share our third quarter results, as shown on Slide 4. As outlined in our reconciliations and in line with our expectations, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93, as compared to last year's as reported earnings per share of $1.63, and ongoing earnings per share of $2.17. From a free cash flow perspective, we had a use of cash of $158 million for the first 3 quarters, as compared to a use of cash of $251 million in the prior year. Hugh?"

Thanks very much for joining us today. I'm pleased to share that we've returned another solid quarter for fiscal year 2017, and in doing so, have an even clearer line of sight on our 2 priorities for the year, namely delivering on our operational plan and key business milestones, and moving to closure on the Bayer merger agreement.
So let's begin with the Bayer path to completion on Slide 6. Bayer continues to lead the filing process with support from Monsanto, and continues to target closing by the end of the year. The filing in the European Union is expected to be submitted in the next few days and the response to the second request issued by the U.S. Department of Justice was recently completed. Once the EU filing is in, all key initial submissions will have been made. In addition, we've already received clearance from several regulators, including South Africa, for which Bayer agreed to provide remedies. The clearance progress has been steady and consistent, and we remain encouraged by the advancement of other proposed combinations, as our industry undergoes a healthy transformation to better serve the world's farmers. And while other deals have their merits, we believe this merger is uniquely beneficial, as shown in Slide 7. It has the capacity to benefit growers by accelerating innovation, by delivering integrated solution tools and by expanding offerings to new crops and geographies at a time when they're most needed.
One other benefit it delivers is complementary R&D expertise to enhance discovery efforts, leading to increasingly meaningful benefits for growers around the world, and global agriculture meets together to solve the conundrum of growing more with less inputs. We know that there are ways to grow food better, smarter and more efficiently. Collectively, we've created undelivered many of the building blocks necessary to meet future needs, but there's still much more to do. 
Despite near-term supply, the demand for corn and soybeans continues to grow, as shown on Slide 8. The rigors of climate change and competition for resources will only serve to intensify this need.
We're well positioned to develop this next-generation of solutions, as shown on Slide 9, with the broadly licensed Climate FieldView platform and our strong foundation of seed, trait and chemistry solutions. The combination with Bayer should only serve to accelerate our ability to bring those to the growers who need them most, and our open platform continues to expand and evolve. I'm encouraged by the positive farmer experiences that we've been hearing and seeing for Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton and Climate FieldView, as they reach record levels of penetration. In fact, combined, these new technologies are on more than 125 million acres in the U.S. in just 2 to 3 short years.
In addition, we've recently received several regulatory approvals for our products. In April, we received the EPA approval of NemaStrike Technology, keeping this blockbuster product on track for commercial launch in fiscal year '18. We also recently obtained the EPA approval for SmartStax PRO, our next generation of cotton rootworm control technology, which we expect to launch around the turn of the decade, pending receipt of certain import approvals. And finally, this Vistive Gold soybeans just received import approval from China, clearing its final regulatory hurdle for full commercialization in 2018.
These factors also play into the high-quality performance that our business is delivering, with gross profit up more than 12% through the first 3 quarters. Our innovation leadership is driving our growth and the completion of our third quarter bolsters our confidence and the outlook for the rest of the year. 
To that end, our guidance range for fiscal year '17 is expected to be at the high end of the range for as reported earnings per share, and is confirmed at the high end of the range for ongoing earnings despite the continued tough ag market. 
I am very pleased with what our team has accomplished, maintaining its focus while balancing our 2 imperatives. The business remains on its growth trajectory and the progress and the combination continues at a steady clip. So with that, I'll pass it to Brett to provide the operational update. Brett?"

Our focus on delivering the key business imperatives has powered us through the third quarter, and achieving our 2017 key milestones will place our company on a path to deliver on our strong growth t",1182,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Our focus on delivering the key business imperatives has powered us through the third quarter, and achieving our 2017 key milestones will place our company on a path to deliver on our strong growth to the turn of the decade. Specifically, the ramp of our latest technologies has been record-breaking, with Roundup Ready Xtend, Intacta and Climate FieldView. Our costs have been coming down in both U.S. corn and soybeans, and our pipeline continues to advance.
As we delve into the specifics, let's start with corn, as shown on Slide 10. This quarter is all about the Northern Hemisphere. Let's begin with the U.S., where we're sold out of our DEKALB Disease Shield hybrids in their first year of introduction, and we remain on track for genetic share gains. This was offset by lower than anticipated planted acres and a modest decline in our germplasm price/mix. A key inclusion on those disease shield hybrids was our Acceleron B-300 SAT microbial product, which was first -- was the first launch from the BioAg joint venture with Novozymes. Early season reaction has been positive, and we look forward to seeing how the rest of the season plays out.
In Europe, acres planted to corn year-over-year ended up relatively flat, and our team delivered modest germplasm price/mix lift in local currency, along with anticipated genetic share gains. Overall, we're still expecting our full year global corn germplasm price/mix lift to be flat to up low single digits as a percent in local currency, primarily driven by the strong double-digit growth in the first half in Brazil and Argentina.
For soybeans, the momentum continues to be tremendous in our latest technologies, as shown on Slide 11. With 50% growth in gross profit in Q3 alone, we now expect to deliver approximately 30% growth in our soybean gross profit, as well as strong margin improvement for the full year. 
Let's start with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in the U.S., as shown on Slide 12, where our ramp year for the trait has been outstanding. There are about 20 million acres planted across the country and we're hearing great feedback on the performance of the varieties and on the efficacy of the trait and herbicide system in managing tough-to-control weeds. Based on information we have to date, the overwhelming majority of our customers are experiencing success with on-target application of Xtendimax with VaporGrip technology, and are following the label and good stewardship practices. So I'm looking forward to seeing how the rest of the season unfolds.
In South America, the strong performance of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO technology once again underpins the record penetration we are delivering. For a fourth consecutive year, Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO is delivering a greater than 4 bushel per acre yield advantage based on 2017 field trials. With this continued strong performance, growers have added another 15 million acres this year, increasing penetration to more than 50 million planted acres across South America, as shown on Slide 13. Our focus is now shifting to next season, where we have established the price in Brazil, commensurate with the performance and reflecting an increase in local currency, which included the removal of the transition rebate that expired in fiscal year 2017 as expected.
In cotton, on Slide 14, the growing experience with Bollgard II XtendFlex varieties and the ability to use dicamba herbicides in season has now driven our trait penetration to more than 5 million acres in the U.S. This is well over our anticipated penetration of more than 4 million acres and is nice to see given the substantial growth in cotton acres this year. In addition, we're increasingly confident in our delivery of the third straight year of genetic share gains in cotton, and look to build upon this in the years ahead with Bollgard III XtendFlex cotton.
Moving to our other crops. We still expect modest, but steady growth in vegetables for the full year. We also continued to strategically manage our product portfolio as planned, with 2 additional deals struck recently, one in Ag Productivity and one in Seeds and Genomics, and we expect to receive the benefit in our fourth quarter results.
Shifting to digital tools, our Climate FieldView platform continues to see major advancements in its strategic differentiators in this space, with our partnerships, collaborations and strong adoption, as shown on Slide 15. In terms of partnerships, we have signed up 3 new platform partners, Series Imaging, TerrAvion and Agribotix that will deliver valuable high-resolution imagery to farmers. In addition, in May, Climate acquired HydroBio, an agricultural software company, with unique irrigation focused data and analytics capabilities. This not only reinforces our partner of choice reputation in this space, but also expands the suite of products we expect to be able to offer farmers in the years ahead, and we'd expect even more announcements here before the end of the fiscal year as we continue to evaluate more than 25 potential technology partners.
In terms of adoption, we are ahead of where we expected to be for paid acres, registering more than 35 million, well above the original target of 25 million acres. We also just recently announced our official commercial launch in Brazil after concluding trials on nearly 1 million acres, as shown on Slide 16. With continued significant progress on adoption and partnerships and increasing interest in licensing opportunities, Climate FieldView remains a very promising area on the horizon for us. 
At our Ag Productivity segment, we are now seeing the anticipated glyphosate-based herbicide price improvement, translating to the retail market. This has resulted in year-over-year improvement in gross profit for the segment for the third quarter, and we expect this improvement in pricing will extend into the fourth quarter, despite year-over-year headwinds we saw in the past. We're also increasingly confident in glyphosate's re-registration in Europe, as discussions have been progressing positively. In addition, XtendiMax with VaporGrip technology continues to contribute to the bottom line, as trait penetration for the Roundup Ready XTEND crop system drives demand for low volatility dicamba formulations. 
Moving to pipeline products. As Hugh mentioned, we recently received the highly anticipated news from the U.S. EPA that NemaStrike Technology has been approved. This puts us on track for commercialization in 2018, and allowed us to place hundreds of ground breaker trials across the U.S. this year, as shown on Slide 17.
As we've done with numerous new technologies in the past, these trials will give growers firsthand experience with NemaStrike Technology, and will inform our launch for 2018. With blockbuster value and strong interest from license orders and growers, we're excited to move the technology into their hands.
All in all, this was a solid quarter, in line with our expectations. And as we look confidently to close out 2017, we've shifted our focus to growers infield experience with our latest technologies, managing returns in the northern hemisphere and to the selling season in South America. With that, I'll hand it over to Pierre for his financial review."

Our soybeans gross profit grew b",735,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93, in line with our expectations. 
Let's look at the specifics. Our soybeans gross profit grew by 50%, driven primarily by 3 factors in the U.S.: the reduced cost of goods for Roundup Ready Xtend; the increased acres planted to soybeans; and the benefit from the sale of its both traded varieties. Similarly, cotton gross profit improved by 31%, thanks to the increase in U.S. planted acres, greater Bollgard II XtendFlex acreage and genetic share gains. Corn gross profit was down slightly, in line with expectation, and mostly due to lower planted acres in the United States, coupled with the previously mentioned grower demand driven timing shift into Q2. These was partially offset by lower cost of goods in the U.S. due to improved production volumes. Global corn price was essentially flat in the market where commodity prices continued to be challenging. Finally, other crops season trade gross profit declined due to the absence of the benefit from the alfalfa license in the prior year. 
Ag Productivity gross profit increased about 12%, given the improvement in both pricing and volume for glyphosate-based herbicides and the continuation of XtendiMax dicamba-based herbicide sales coming through in the results. Our SG&A and R&D expense increased about 8%, primarily resulting from increased incentive expenses, driven by the growth in the business and from the increased investments in Climate. However, we remain on track with our target of $500 million in savings by the end of the fiscal year 2018, as shown on Slide 18, across cost of goods and operating expenses as compared to our fiscal year 2015 base. These savings are helping to offset inflation rate increases globally. 
Lastly, free cash flow fiscal year-to-date is a use of cash of $158 million versus the prior year use of cash of $251 million. This improvement reflects the increase in operating cash flows from dollars as compared to the prior year. The increase in capital expenditure relates to the construction of the dicamba manufacturing facility in Luling, Louisiana. 
Looking out for the end of the fiscal year, as shown on Slide 19. We confidently expect our as reported earnings per share to be at the high-end of the range of $4.09 to $4.55, and again, confirm our ongoing earnings per share at the high end of the range of $4.50 to $4.90. For free cash flow, we also still expect to be at the high-end of the range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion.
As we look at the specific components of guidance, let's start with Seeds and Genomic gross profit, which is now expected to be up high single digit as a percentage for the year. These reflects outstanding growth in both soybeans and cotton, as well as modest growth in corn, partially offset by the absence of the benefit from the alfalfa license in Q3 of fiscal year '16.
In our other segments. Ag Productivity gross profit is still expected to be in the range of $850 million to $950 million, as both glyphosate and dicamba deliver anticipated results. As part of our continued portfolio optimization efforts, I am pleased with the recent deals we signed, and we expect to receive the benefit of roughly $70 million in non-core asset sales gains in the fourth quarter. About half of these gains will benefit the Ag Productivity segments, and half will benefit Seeds and Genomics. Both are expected to be recorded in other income, and are considered in our guidance. 
Despite the recent weakening of the Brazilian reais, we still anticipate the change in currency rates year-over-year to be relatively neutral to earnings. And finally, we still expect our SG&A and R&D expense to be up mid-single digits as a percent due to increased commission in South America, incentive increases and greater spend at Climate, consistent with the drivers in the year-to-date results. 
In closing, we are delivering solid returns on innovation, and doing so with financial discipline as we return our business to growth this fiscal year. We have confidence that the outlook for the balance of the year is on sure footing, and we look forward to updating you at the fourth quarter. 
Thank you for your time today, and with that, I will pass it to Laura for the questions."

The big, big driver on Intacta has been and continues to be another year of delivered 4 bushel yield increase, and that's where the real value is, and so we're excited about hitting 50 million acres this year. We continue to look to grow that into the total opportunity down there. We still expect somewhere around 75 million acres by 2019 on about 100 million acre opportunity. And we do continue to look at Argentina and building it out there. But again, I'll remind you that in Argentina, insect pressure isn't as severe as it is in Brazil. So Argentina has never been as big an opportunity as Brazil has been, but we do continue to build it out for Northern Argentina and work with the government on the system. And what really gets me excited about Intacta in South America is the work our R&D team has done to bring us the next-generation of Intacta 2, and we're already starting to build the plants to make the big transition from Intacta 1 to Intacta 2. And as I said for a couple of years, I don't think we'll ever fully penetrate with Intacta 1. We'll be making the transition to Intacta 2, bringing a new technology with a new and better insect control into the marketplace. But we feel reasonably good about where we sit right now in South America with soybean."

So Don, so as you know, historically, Q4 has always been a smaller quarter, and typically resulted in a loss. And last year, it was somewhat unusual with the favorable impact of the sorghum JV deal that we had and better-than-anticipated final volumes in both corn and soybeans. So this year, we are looking at a way more normalized volumes. And the key thing there is we are also expecting half the amounts of deals that we had last year, and this is one of the reasons at this point in time since we've calibrated the benefits from deal around $70 million, this is why despite the increase you see in our guidance on GP in both Ag Productivity and Seeds and Genomics, I mean, modest increases there. You see the total EPS not changing dramatically because we have scaled down some of our assumptions as well on the deals. So all in all, I mean, pointing to the high end of our guidance, you're looking at a year where we're looking at double-digit growth for the full fiscal year in terms of EPS in a really challenging environment. So that's the way we're thinking about it now."

That's a multiple fold larger launch than we've ever experienced with any technology. And I think it speaks volumes to the farmers need for additional tools and technology in the marketplace to control weeds. What we've seen so far, Don, is the vast majority of farmers and applicators using our products are seeing great results, both from a weed control and efficacy standpoint, as well as the application itself and the products they input. So we feel really good about what we're seeing. I'll remind you, to your point of the -- 33 out of 34 states have approved our XtendiMax with VaporGrip technology. But Arkansas, as you noted, was one of them that never approved that product or was the only one that never approved that product. As it stands today, as we look at inquires across the entire country in the 34 states, where we're approved, it appears that the plant lord in Arkansas is getting a lot more inquiries than we're getting across the combined rest of the state or states that have approved XtendiMax with VaporGrip. So the key here is, is that it's the largest launch ever. The number of inquiries we're experiencing would be normal for any product. Even products that have been established in the marketplace would experienced a number of inquiries every year. So we feel really good about where we're at, and we'll continue to work with every farmer that's purchased our technology and work with them to have a positive experience, but I couldn't be more excited about the performance we're seeing across all the states."

Yes, we've been somewhat limited based on inflation in Brazil. It's not very often when you're talking about inflation being your friend, but inflation has been our friend when it comes to pricing of Intacta. So we haven't been holding our price flat in Brazil. We've actually been moving it up with inflation the past number of years. So we have improved our position. As noted, there was a transition payment that was occurring from the old Roundup Ready formulation or trait to the new Roundup Ready 2 and Intacta, and that expires. And with that expiration, it feels a bit like a price increase to the farmer and a benefit to us because it just goes away. So it just extinguishes itself. So we'll feel the benefit of that. So we would expect going into this year that we'll see somewhere in the range of double-digit, but it still has to play out as we look at that transition payment expiring and the price move that we took, which was a positive uptick this year, again, on top of the previous years."

They start to plant early with great conditions, and then there's pockets, where it just -- it became really tough, and to your point, there were farmers replanting for the second and third time, unfortunately, this year. Here's the context and the reminders. Every year, there's replants. And if you're one of the farmers that's affected in that area, it can be devastating and it's incredibly frustrating. But when you look at it across the entire marketplace, it's always a relatively small percentage in total. We accrue for that to occur in the marketplace. Jeff, I would guess, there's probably a slight chance it's going to -- more than a slight chance that it's going to be more than average. But it isn't going to be all that high. So to your point of will it change our position with inventories, et cetera? No, we're well prepared for that.

Our third quarter call marks the passage of a significant portion of the Northern Hemisphere ag season, and today, we'll provide a summary of our third quarter results, as well as the outlook for the balance of this year.
This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results.

A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
Before handing it over to Hugh to share our strategic outlook, let me share our third quarter results, as shown on Slide 4. As outlined in our reconciliations and in line with our expectations, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93, as compared to last year's as reported earnings per share of $1.63, and ongoing earnings per share of $2.17.

I'm pleased to share that we've returned another solid quarter for fiscal year 2017, and in doing so, have an even clearer line of sight on our 2 priorities for the year, namely delivering on our operational plan and key business milestones, and moving to closure on the Bayer merger agreement.
So let's begin with the Bayer path to completion on Slide 6. Bayer continues to lead the filing process with support from Monsanto, and continues to target closing by the end of the year. The filing in the European Union is expected to be submitted in the next few days and the response to the second request issued by the U.S. Department of Justice was recently completed. Once the EU filing is in, all key initial submissions will have been made. In addition, we've already received clearance from several regulators, including South Africa, for which Bayer agreed to provide remedies. 
The clearance progress has been steady and consistent, and we remain encouraged by the advancement of other proposed combinations, as our industry undergoes a healthy transformation to better serve the world's farmers. And while other deals have their merits, we believe this merger is uniquely beneficial, as shown on Slide 7. It has the capacity to benefit growers by accelerating innovation, by delivering integrated solution tools and by expanding offerings to new crops and geographies at a time when they're most needed.
One other benefit it delivers is complementary R&D expertise to enhance discovery efforts, leading to increasingly meaningful benefits for growers around the world, and global agriculture meets together to solve the conundrum of growing more with less inputs. We know that there are ways to grow food better, smarter and more efficiently. Collectively, we've created undelivered many of the building blocks necessary to meet future needs, but there's still much more to do. 
Despite near-term supply, the demand for corn and soybeans continues to grow, as shown on Slide 8. The rigors of climate change and competition for resources will only serve to intensify this need.
We're well positioned to develop this next-generation of solutions, as shown on Slide 9, with the broadly licensed Climate FieldView platform and our strong foundation of seed, trait and chemistry solutions. The combination with Bayer should only serve to accelerate our ability to bring those to the growers who need them most, and our open platform continues to expand and evolve. I'm encouraged by the positive farmer experiences that we've been hearing and seeing for Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton and Climate FieldView, as they reach record levels of penetration. In fact, combined, these new technologies are on more than 125 million acres in the U.S. in just 2 to 3 short years.
In addition, we've recently received several regulatory approvals for our products. In April, we received the EPA approval of NemaStrike Technology, keeping this blockbuster product on track for commercial launch in fiscal year '18. We also recently obtained the EPA approval for SmartStax PRO, our next generation of cotton rootworm control technology, which we expect to launch around the turn of the decade, pending receipt of certain import approvals. And finally, this Vistive Gold soybeans just received import approval from China, clearing its final regulatory hurdle for full commercialization in 2018.
These factors also play into the high-quality performance that our business is delivering, with gross profit up more than 12% through the first 3 quarters. Our innovation leadership is driving our growth and the completion of our third quarter bolsters our confidence and the outlook for the rest of the year. 
To that end, our guidance range for fiscal year '17 is expected to be at the high end of the range for as reported earnings per share, and is confirmed at the high end of the range for ongoing earnings despite the continued tough ag market. 
I am very pleased with what our team has accomplished, maintaining its focus while balancing our 2 imperatives. The business remains on its growth trajectory and the progress and the combination continues at a steady clip. So with that, I'll pass it to Brett to provide the operational update. Brett?"

Our focus on delivering the key business imperatives has powered us through the third quarter, and achieving our 2017 key milestones will place our company on a path to deliver on our strong growth t",1181,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Our focus on delivering the key business imperatives has powered us through the third quarter, and achieving our 2017 key milestones will place our company on a path to deliver on our strong growth to the turn of the decade. Specifically, the ramp of our latest technologies has been record-breaking, with Roundup Ready Xtend, Intacta and Climate FieldView. Our costs have been coming down in both U.S. corn and soybeans, and our pipeline continues to advance.
As we delve into the specifics, let's start with corn, as shown on Slide 10. This quarter is all about the Northern Hemisphere. Let's begin with the U.S., where we're sold out of our DEKALB Disease Shield hybrids in their first year of introduction, and we remain on track for genetic share gains. This was offset by lower than anticipated planted acres and a modest decline in our germplasm price/mix. A key inclusion on those disease shield hybrids was our Acceleron B-300 SAT microbial product, which was first -- was the first launch from the BioAg joint venture with Novozymes. Early season reaction has been positive, and we look forward to seeing how the rest of the season plays out.
In Europe, acres planted to corn year-over-year ended up relatively flat, and our team delivered modest germplasm price/mix lift in local currency, along with anticipated genetic share gains. Overall, we're still expecting our full year global corn germplasm price/mix lift to be flat to up low single digits as a percent in local currency, primarily driven by the strong double-digit growth in the first half in Brazil and Argentina.
For soybeans, the momentum continues to be tremendous in our latest technologies, as shown on Slide 11. With 50% growth in gross profit in Q3 alone, we now expect to deliver approximately 30% growth in our soybean gross profit, as well as strong margin improvement for the full year. 
Let's start with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in the U.S., as shown on Slide 12, where our ramp year for the trait has been outstanding. There are about 20 million acres planted across the country and we're hearing great feedback on the performance of the varieties and on the efficacy of the trait and herbicide system in managing tough-to-control weeds. Based on information we have to date, the overwhelming majority of our customers are experiencing success with on-target application of Xtendimax with VaporGrip technology, and are following the label and good stewardship practices. So I'm looking forward to seeing how the rest of the season unfolds.
In South America, the strong performance of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO technology once again underpins the record penetration we are delivering. For a fourth consecutive year, Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO is delivering a greater than 4 bushel per acre yield advantage based on 2017 field trials. With this continued strong performance, growers have added another 15 million acres this year, increasing penetration to more than 50 million planted acres across South America, as shown on Slide 13. 
Our focus is now shifting to next season, where we have established the price in Brazil, commensurate with the performance and reflecting an increase in local currency, which included the removal of the transition rebate that expired in fiscal year 2017 as expected.
In cotton, on Slide 14, the growing experience with Bollgard II XtendFlex varieties and the ability to use dicamba herbicides in season has now driven our trait penetration to more than 5 million acres in the U.S. This is well over our anticipated penetration of more than 4 million acres and is nice to see given the substantial growth in cotton acres this year. In addition, we're increasingly confident in our delivery of the third straight year of genetic share gains in cotton, and look to build upon this in the years ahead with Bollgard III XtendFlex cotton.
Moving to our other crops. We still expect modest, but steady growth in vegetables for the full year. We also continued to strategically manage our product portfolio as planned, with 2 additional deals struck recently, one in Ag Productivity and one in Seeds and Genomics, and we expect to receive the benefit in our fourth quarter results.
Shifting to digital tools, our Climate FieldView platform continues to see major advancements in its strategic differentiators in this space, with our partnerships, collaborations and strong adoption, as shown on Slide 15. In terms of partnerships, we have signed up 3 new platform partners, Ceres Imaging, TerrAvion and Agribotix that will deliver valuable high-resolution imagery to farmers. In addition, in May, Climate acquired HydroBio, an agricultural software company, with unique irrigation focused data and analytics capabilities. This not only reinforces our partner of choice reputation in this space, but also expands the suite of products we expect to be able to offer farmers in the years ahead, and we'd expect even more announcements here before the end of the fiscal year as we continue to evaluate more than 25 potential technology partners.
In terms of adoption, we are ahead of where we expected to be for paid acres, registering more than 35 million, well above the original target of 25 million acres. We also just recently announced our official commercial launch in Brazil after concluding trials on nearly 1 million acres, as shown on Slide 16. With continued significant progress in adoption and partnerships and increasing interest in licensing opportunities, Climate FieldView remains a very promising area on the horizon for us. 
At our Ag Productivity segment, we are now seeing the anticipated glyphosate-based herbicide price improvement, translating to the retail market. This has resulted in year-over-year improvement in gross profit for the segment for the third quarter, and we expect this improvement in pricing will extend into the fourth quarter, despite year-over-year headwinds we saw in the past. We're also increasingly confident in glyphosate's re-registration in Europe, as discussions have been progressing positively. In addition, XtendiMax with VaporGrip technology continues to contribute to the bottom line, as trait penetration for the Roundup Ready XTEND crop system drives demand for low volatility dicamba formulations. 
Moving to pipeline products. As Hugh mentioned, we recently received the highly anticipated news from the U.S. EPA that NemaStrike Technology has been approved. This puts us on track for commercialization in 2018, and allowed us to place hundreds of Ground Breaker trials across the U.S. this year, as shown on Slide 17.
As we've done with numerous new technologies in the past, these trials will give growers firsthand experience with NemaStrike Technology, and will inform our launch for 2018. With blockbuster value and strong interest from licensors and growers, we're excited to move the technology into their hands.
All in all, this was a solid quarter, in line with our expectations. And as we look confidently to close out 2017, we've shifted our focus to growers' infield experience with our latest technologies, managing returns in the Northern Hemisphere and to the selling season in South America. With that, I'll hand it over to Pierre for his financial review."
528414,405049398,1238407,"Monsanto Company, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2017",2017-06-28,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93, in line with our expectations. Let's look at the specifics. Our soybeans gross profit grew b",734,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93, in line with our expectations. 
Let's look at the specifics. Our soybeans gross profit grew by 50%, driven primarily by 3 factors in the U.S.: the reduced cost of goods for Roundup Ready Xtend; the increased acres planted to soybeans; and the benefit from the sale of its both traded varieties. Similarly, cotton gross profit improved by 31%, thanks to the increase in U.S. planted acres, greater Bollgard II XtendFlex acreage and genetic share gains. 
Corn gross profit was down slightly, in line with expectation, and mostly due to lower planted acres in the United States, coupled with the previously mentioned grower demand-driven timing shift into Q2. This was partially offset by lower cost of goods in the U.S. due to improved production volumes. Global corn price was essentially flat in the market where commodity prices continued to be challenging. Finally, other crops season traits gross profit declined due to the absence of the benefit from the alfalfa license in the prior year. 
Ag Productivity gross profit increased about 12%, given the improvement in both pricing and volume for glyphosate-based herbicides and the continuation of XtendiMax dicamba-based herbicide sales coming through in the results. Our SG&A and R&D expense increased about 8%, primarily resulting from increased incentive expenses, driven by the growth in the business and from the increased investments in Climate. However, we remain on track with our target of $500 million in savings by the end of the fiscal year 2018, as shown on Slide 18, across cost of goods and operating expenses as compared to our fiscal year 2015 base. These savings are helping to offset inflation rate increases globally. 
Lastly, free cash flow fiscal year-to-date is a use of cash of $158 million versus the prior year use of cash of $251 million. This improvement reflects the increase in operating cash flows from dollars as compared to the prior year. The increase in capital expenditure relates to the construction of the dicamba manufacturing facility in Luling, Louisiana. 
Looking out for the end of the fiscal year, as shown on Slide 19. We confidently expect our as reported earnings per share to be at the high-end of the range of $4.09 to $4.55, and again, confirm our ongoing earnings per share at the high end of the range of $4.50 to $4.90. For free cash flow, we also still expect to be at the high-end of the range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion.
As we look at the specific components of guidance, let's start with Seeds and Genomic gross profit, which is now expected to be up high single digit as a percentage for the year. This reflects outstanding growth in both soybeans and cotton, as well as modest growth in corn, partially offset by the absence of the benefit from the alfalfa license in Q3 of fiscal year '16.
In our other segments. Ag Productivity gross profit is still expected to be in the range of $850 million to $950 million, as both glyphosate and dicamba deliver anticipated results. As part of our continued portfolio optimization efforts, I am pleased with the recent deals we've signed, and we expect to receive the benefit of roughly $70 million in non-core asset sales gains in the fourth quarter. About half of these gains will benefit the Ag Productivity segments, and half will benefit Seeds and Genomics. Both are expected to be recorded in other income, and are considered in our guidance. 
Despite the recent weakening of the Brazilian reais, we still anticipate the change in currency rates year-over-year to be relatively neutral to earnings. And finally, we still expect our SG&A and R&D expense to be up mid-single digits as a percent due to increased commission in South America, incentive increases and greater spend at Climate, consistent with the drivers in the year-to-date results. 
In closing, we are delivering solid returns on innovation, and doing so with financial discipline as we return our business to growth this fiscal year. We have confidence that the outlook for the balance of the year is on sure footing, and we look forward to updating you at the fourth quarter. 
Thank you for your time today, and with that, I will pass it to Laura for the questions."

We continue to look to grow that into the total opportunity down there. We still expect somewhere around 75 million acres by 2019 on about 100 million acre opportunity. And we do continue to look at Argentina and building it out there. But again, I'll remind you that in Argentina, insect pressure isn't as severe as it is in Brazil. So Argentina has never been as big an opportunity as Brazil has been, but we do continue to build it out for Northern Argentina and work with the government on the system. And what really gets me excited about Intacta in South America is the work our R&D team has done to bring us the next-generation of Intacta 2, and we're already starting to build the plants to make the big transition from Intacta 1 to Intacta 2. And as I said for a couple of years, I don't think we'll ever fully penetrate with Intacta 1.

And last year, it was somewhat unusual with the favorable impact of the sorghum JV deal that we had and better-than-anticipated final volumes in both corn and soybeans. So this year, we are looking at way more normalized volumes. And the key thing there is we are also expecting half the amounts of deals that we had last year, and this is one of the reasons at this point in time since we've calibrated the benefits from deal around $70 million, this is why despite the increase you see in our guidance on GP in both Ag Productivity and Seeds and Genomics, I mean, modest increases there. You see the total EPS not changing dramatically because we have scaled down some of our assumptions as well on the deals. So all in all, I mean, pointing to the high end of our guidance, you're looking at a year where we're looking at double-digit growth for the full fiscal year in terms of EPS in a really challenging environment.

So we feel really good about what we're seeing. I'd remind you, to your point of the -- 33 out of 34 states have approved our XtendiMax with VaporGrip technology. But Arkansas, as you noted, was one of them that never approved that product or was the only one that never approved that product. As it stands today, as we look at inquires across the entire country in the 34 states, where we're approved, it appears that the plant lord in Arkansas is getting a lot more inquiries than we're getting across the combined rest of the state or states that have approved XtendiMax with VaporGrip.

Even products that have been established in the marketplace would experience a number of inquiries every year.

Yes, we've been somewhat limited based on inflation in Brazil. It's not very often when you're talking about inflation being your friend, but inflation has been our friend when it comes to pricing of Intacta. So we haven't been holding our price flat in Brazil. We've actually been moving it up with inflation the past number of years. So we have improved our position. As noted, there was a transition payment that was occurring from the old Roundup Ready formulation or trait to the new Roundup Ready 2 and Intacta, and that expires. And with that expiration, it feels a bit like a price increase to the farmer and a benefit to us because it just goes away. So it just extinguishes itself. So we'll feel the benefit of that. So we would expect going into this year that we'll see somewhere in the range of double-digit, but it still has to play out as we look at that transition payment expiring and the price move that we took, which was a positive uptick this year, again, on top of the previous years."

But when you look at it across the entire marketplace, it's always a relatively small percentage in total. We accrue for that to occur in the marketplace.

Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on our website.

A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
Before handing it over to Hugh to share our strategic outlook, let me share our third quarter results, as shown on Slide 4. As outlined in our reconciliations and in line with our expectations, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93, as compared to last year's as reported earnings per share of $1.63, and ongoing earnings per share of $2.17. From a free cash flow perspective, we had a use of cash of $158 million for the first 3 quarters, as compared to a use of cash of $251 million in the prior year. Hugh?"

Thanks very much for joining us today. I'm pleased to share that we've returned another solid quarter for fiscal year 2017, and in doing so, have an even clearer line of sight on our 2 prior",714,"Thank you, Laura, and good morning to those of you on the phone. Thanks very much for joining us today. I'm pleased to share that we've returned another solid quarter for fiscal year 2017, and in doing so, have an even clearer line of sight on our 2 priorities for the year, namely delivering on our operational plan and key business milestones, and moving to closure on the Bayer merger agreement.
So let's begin with the Bayer path to completion on Slide 6. Bayer continues to lead the filing process with support from Monsanto, and continues to target closing by the end of the year. The filing in the European Union is expected to be submitted in the next few days and the response to the second request issued by the U.S. Department of Justice was recently completed. Once the EU filing is in, all key initial submissions will have been made. In addition, we've already received clearance from several regulators, including South Africa, for which Bayer agreed to provide remedies. 
The clearance progress has been steady and consistent, and we remain encouraged by the advancement of other proposed combinations, as our industry undergoes a healthy transformation to better serve the world's farmers. And while other deals have their merits, we believe this merger is uniquely beneficial, as shown on Slide 7. It has the capacity to benefit growers by accelerating innovation, by delivering integrated solution tools and by expanding offerings to new crops and geographies at a time when they're most needed.
One other benefit it delivers is complementary R&D expertise to enhance discovery efforts, leading to increasingly meaningful benefits for growers around the world, and global agriculture meets together to solve the conundrum of growing more with less inputs. We know that there are ways to grow food better, smarter and more efficiently. Collectively, we've created undelivered many of the building blocks necessary to meet future needs, but there's still much more to do. 
Despite near-term supply, the demand for corn and soybeans continues to grow, as shown on Slide 8. The rigors of climate change and competition for resources will only serve to intensify this need.
We're well positioned to develop this next-generation of solutions, as shown on Slide 9, with the broadly licensed Climate FieldView platform and our strong foundation of seed, trait and chemistry solutions. The combination with Bayer should only serve to accelerate our ability to bring those to the growers who need them most, and our open platform continues to expand and evolve. I'm encouraged by the positive farmer experiences that we've been hearing and seeing for Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton and Climate FieldView, as they reach record levels of penetration. In fact, combined, these new technologies are on more than 125 million acres in the U.S. in just 2 to 3 short years.
In addition, we've recently received several regulatory approvals for our products. In April, we received the EPA approval of NemaStrike Technology, keeping this blockbuster product on track for commercial launch in fiscal year '18. We also recently obtained the EPA approval for SmartStax PRO, our next generation of cotton rootworm control technology, which we expect to launch around the turn of the decade, pending receipt of certain import approvals. And finally, this Vistive Gold soybeans just received import approval from China, clearing its final regulatory hurdle for full commercialization in 2018.
These factors also play into the high-quality performance that our business is delivering, with gross profit up more than 12% through the first 3 quarters. Our innovation leadership is driving our growth and the completion of our third quarter bolsters our confidence and the outlook for the rest of the year. 
To that end, our guidance range for fiscal year '17 is expected to be at the high end of the range for as reported earnings per share, and is confirmed at the high end of the range for ongoing earnings despite the continued tough ag market. 
I am very pleased with what our team has accomplished, maintaining its focus while balancing our 2 imperatives. The business remains on its growth trajectory and the progress and the combination continues at a steady clip. 
So with that, I'll pass it to Brett to provide the operational update. Brett?"

Our focus on delivering the key business imperatives has powered us through the third quarter, and achieving our 2017 key milestones will place our company on a path to deliver on our strong growth t",1181,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Our focus on delivering the key business imperatives has powered us through the third quarter, and achieving our 2017 key milestones will place our company on a path to deliver on our strong growth to the turn of the decade. Specifically, the ramp of our latest technologies has been record-breaking, with Roundup Ready Xtend, Intacta and Climate FieldView. Our costs have been coming down in both U.S. corn and soybeans, and our pipeline continues to advance.
As we delve into the specifics, let's start with corn, as shown on Slide 10. This quarter is all about the Northern Hemisphere. Let's begin with the U.S., where we're sold out of our DEKALB Disease Shield hybrids in their first year of introduction, and we remain on track for genetic share gains. This was offset by lower than anticipated planted acres and a modest decline in our germplasm price/mix. A key inclusion on those disease shield hybrids was our Acceleron B-300 SAT microbial product, which was first -- was the first launch from the BioAg joint venture with Novozymes. Early season reaction has been positive, and we look forward to seeing how the rest of the season plays out.
In Europe, acres planted to corn year-over-year ended up relatively flat, and our team delivered modest germplasm price/mix lift in local currency, along with anticipated genetic share gains. Overall, we're still expecting our full year global corn germplasm price/mix lift to be flat to up low single digits as a percent in local currency, primarily driven by the strong double-digit growth in the first half in Brazil and Argentina.
For soybeans, the momentum continues to be tremendous in our latest technologies, as shown on Slide 11. With 50% growth in gross profit in Q3 alone, we now expect to deliver approximately 30% growth in our soybean gross profit as well as strong margin improvement for the full year. 
Let's start with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in the U.S., as shown on Slide 12, where our ramp year for the trait has been outstanding. There are about 20 million acres planted across the country and we're hearing great feedback on the performance of the varieties and on the efficacy of the trait and herbicide system in managing tough-to-control weeds. Based on information we have to date, the overwhelming majority of our customers are experiencing success with on-target application of Xtendimax with VaporGrip technology, and are following the label and good stewardship practices. So I'm looking forward to seeing how the rest of the season unfolds.
In South America, the strong performance of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO technology once again underpins the record penetration we are delivering. For a fourth consecutive year, Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO is delivering a greater than 4 bushel per acre yield advantage based on 2017 field trials. With this continued strong performance, growers have added another 15 million acres this year, increasing penetration to more than 50 million planted acres across South America, as shown on Slide 13. 
Our focus is now shifting to next season, where we have established the price in Brazil, commensurate with the performance and reflecting an increase in local currency, which included the removal of the transition rebate that expired in fiscal year 2017 as expected.
In cotton, on Slide 14, the growing experience with Bollgard II XtendFlex varieties and the ability to use dicamba herbicides in season has now driven our trait penetration to more than 5 million acres in the U.S. This is well over our anticipated penetration of more than 4 million acres and is nice to see given the substantial growth in cotton acres this year. In addition, we're increasingly confident in our delivery of the third straight year of genetic share gains in cotton, and look to build upon this in the years ahead with Bollgard III XtendFlex cotton.
Moving to our other crops. We still expect modest, but steady growth in vegetables for the full year. We also continued to strategically manage our product portfolio as planned, with 2 additional deals struck recently, one in Ag Productivity and one in Seeds and Genomics, and we expect to receive the benefit in our fourth quarter results.
Shifting to digital tools, our Climate FieldView platform continues to see major advancements in its strategic differentiators in this space, with our partnerships, collaborations and strong adoption, as shown on Slide 15. In terms of partnerships, we have signed up 3 new platform partners, Ceres Imaging, TerrAvion and Agribotix that will deliver valuable high-resolution imagery to farmers. In addition, in May, Climate acquired HydroBio, an agricultural software company, with unique irrigation focused data and analytics capabilities. This not only reinforces our partner of choice reputation in this space, but also expands the suite of products we expect to be able to offer farmers in the years ahead, and we'd expect even more announcements here before the end of the fiscal year as we continue to evaluate more than 25 potential technology partners.
In terms of adoption, we are ahead of where we expected to be for paid acres, registering more than 35 million, well above the original target of 25 million acres. We also just recently announced our official commercial launch in Brazil after concluding trials on nearly 1 million acres, as shown on Slide 16. With continued significant progress in adoption and partnerships and increasing interest in licensing opportunities, Climate FieldView remains a very promising area on the horizon for us. 
At our Ag Productivity segment, we are now seeing the anticipated glyphosate-based herbicide price improvement, translating to the retail market. This has resulted in year-over-year improvement in gross profit for the segment for the third quarter, and we expect this improvement in pricing will extend into the fourth quarter, despite year-over-year headwinds we saw in the past. We're also increasingly confident in glyphosate's re-registration in Europe, as discussions have been progressing positively. In addition, XtendiMax with VaporGrip technology continues to contribute to the bottom line, as trait penetration for the Roundup Ready XTEND crop system drives demand for low volatility dicamba formulations. 
Moving to pipeline products. As Hugh mentioned, we recently received the highly anticipated news from the U.S. EPA that NemaStrike Technology has been approved. This puts us on track for commercialization in 2018, and allowed us to place hundreds of Ground Breaker trials across the U.S. this year, as shown on Slide 17.
As we've done with numerous new technologies in the past, these trials will give growers firsthand experience with NemaStrike Technology, and will inform our launch for 2018. With blockbuster value and strong interest from licensors and growers, we're excited to move the technology into their hands.
All in all, this was a solid quarter, in line with our expectations. And as we look confidently to close out 2017, we've shifted our focus to growers' infield experience with our latest technologies, managing returns in the Northern Hemisphere and to the selling season in South America. With that, I'll hand it over to Pierre for his financial review."
528414,405049398,1238563,"Monsanto Company, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 28, 2017",2017-06-28,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93, in line with our expectations. Let's look at the specifics. Our soybeans gross profit grew b",734,"Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered as reported earnings per share of $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93, in line with our expectations. 
Let's look at the specifics. Our soybeans gross profit grew by 50%, driven primarily by 3 factors in the U.S.: the reduced cost of goods for Roundup Ready Xtend; the increased acres planted to soybeans; and the benefit from the sale of its both traded varieties. Similarly, cotton gross profit improved by 31%, thanks to the increase in U.S. planted acres, greater Bollgard II XtendFlex acreage and genetic share gains. 
Corn gross profit was down slightly, in line with expectation, and mostly due to lower planted acres in the United States, coupled with the previously mentioned grower demand-driven timing shift into Q2. This was partially offset by lower cost of goods in the U.S. due to improved production volumes. Global corn price was essentially flat in the market where commodity prices continued to be challenging. Finally, other crops season traits gross profit declined due to the absence of the benefit from the alfalfa license in the prior year. 
Ag Productivity gross profit increased about 12%, given the improvement in both pricing and volume for glyphosate-based herbicides and the continuation of XtendiMax dicamba-based herbicide sales coming through in the results. Our SG&A and R&D expense increased about 8%, primarily resulting from increased incentive expenses, driven by the growth in the business and from the increased investments in Climate. However, we remain on track with our target of $500 million in savings by the end of the fiscal year 2018, as shown on Slide 18, across cost of goods and operating expenses as compared to our fiscal year 2015 base. These savings are helping to offset inflation rate increases globally. 
Lastly, free cash flow fiscal year-to-date is a use of cash of $158 million versus the prior year use of cash of $251 million. This improvement reflects the increase in operating cash flows from dollars as compared to the prior year. The increase in capital expenditure relates to the construction of the dicamba manufacturing facility in Luling, Louisiana. 
Looking out for the end of the fiscal year, as shown on Slide 19. We confidently expect our as reported earnings per share to be at the high-end of the range of $4.09 to $4.55, and again, confirm our ongoing earnings per share at the high end of the range of $4.50 to $4.90. For free cash flow, we also still expect to be at the high-end of the range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion.
As we look at the specific components of guidance, let's start with Seeds and Genomic gross profit, which is now expected to be up high single digit as a percentage for the year. This reflects outstanding growth in both soybeans and cotton as well as modest growth in corn, partially offset by the absence of the benefit from the alfalfa license in Q3 of fiscal year '16.
In our other segments. Ag Productivity gross profit is still expected to be in the range of $850 million to $950 million, as both glyphosate and dicamba deliver anticipated results. As part of our continued portfolio optimization efforts, I am pleased with the recent deals we've signed, and we expect to receive the benefit of roughly $70 million in non-core asset sales gains in the fourth quarter. About half of these gains will benefit the Ag Productivity segments, and half will benefit Seeds and Genomics. Both are expected to be recorded in other income, and are considered in our guidance. 
Despite the recent weakening of the Brazilian reais, we still anticipate the change in currency rates year-over-year to be relatively neutral to earnings. And finally, we still expect our SG&A and R&D expense to be up mid-single digits as a percent due to increased commission in South America, incentive increases and greater spend at Climate, consistent with the drivers in the year-to-date results. 
In closing, we are delivering solid returns on innovation, and doing so with financial discipline as we return our business to growth this fiscal year. We have confidence that the outlook for the balance of the year is on sure footing, and we look forward to updating you at the fourth quarter. 
Thank you for your time today, and with that, I will pass it to Laura for the questions."

And we do continue to look at Argentina and building it out there. But again, I'll remind you that in Argentina, insect pressure isn't as severe as it is in Brazil. So Argentina has never been as big an opportunity as Brazil has been, but we do continue to build it out for Northern Argentina and work with the government on the system. And what really gets me excited about Intacta in South America is the work our R&D team has done to bring us the next-generation of Intacta 2, and we're already starting to build the plants to make the big transition from Intacta 1 to Intacta 2. And as I said for a couple of years, I don't think we'll ever fully penetrate with Intacta 1.

You see the total EPS not changing dramatically because we have scaled down some of our assumptions as well on the deals.

As it stands today, as we look at inquires across the entire country in the 34 states, where we're approved, it appears that the plant lord in Arkansas is getting a lot more inquiries than we're getting across the combined rest of the state or states that have approved XtendiMax with VaporGrip.

Even products that have been established in the marketplace would experience a number of inquiries every year.

Yes, we've been somewhat limited based on inflation in Brazil.

We've actually been moving it up with inflation the past number of years. So we have improved our position. As noted, there was a transition payment that was occurring from the old Roundup Ready formulation or trait to the new Roundup Ready 2 and Intacta, and that expires. And with that expiration, it feels a bit like a price increase to the farmer and a benefit to us because it just goes away. So it just extinguishes itself. So we'll feel the benefit of that.

The change in corn planted acres from last year to this year was more significant than the impact of replant. So we're well-balanced going into next year."

The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
Before handing it over to Hugh to share our strategic outlook, let me share our year-end results as shown on Slide 5. 
We delivered strong growth with as reported earnings per share of $5.09 and ongoing earnings per share of $5.50 as compared to last year's as reported full year earnings per share of $2.99 and ongoing earnings per share of $4.48. Our free cash flow for the fiscal year was $2 billion as compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year.

At the outset of this fiscal year, we outlined 2 clear priorities upon which we judge success at year's end. The first was delivering on our operational plan and key business milestones, and the second was to continue executing the necessary steps to close the deal with Bayer. With focus and discipline, our team did both, and I'm extremely proud of what we delivered. And what may be our final full year conference call as Monsanto, I couldn't be more pleased with the results. We delivered record sales and gross profit in our Seeds and Genomics segment in fiscal year 2017, fueled by the outstanding penetration of our latest soybean and cotton technologies and continued adoption of our newest corn hybrids around the globe, reflecting the need for new solutions and what continues to be a challenging ag economy. Clearly, our proven ability to innovate as well as our unique platform advantages position us well to meet the production challenges of today as well as the demands of tomorrow, as shown on Slide 6. 
New products and services will remain crucial to meeting that demand and leading the way as a strong foundation of seeds, traits, digital ag and chemistry solutions like the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, Climate FieldView offerings and NemaStrike Technology, all outlined on Slide 7.  The outlook for these new offerings is bright. 
In fiscal year '18, the Climate FieldView platform is expected to reach 50 million paid acres globally. Our blockbuster NemaStrike Technology is launching across 6 million to 8 million acres in the U.S. And we, along with our partners, expect to have supply to double the penetration of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans. Momentum builds with continued INTACTA penetration in South America and growers continue to demand our newest gotten hybrids, particularly our Disease Shield hybrids, which were sold out in fiscal year '17. 
Given these strong drivers, we remain confident in the outlook for the business. Looking specifically at the first quarter, we anticipate our earnings per share to be stronger than last year with growth expected to come primarily from soybean technologies and better pricing in Ag Productivity. Looking beyond Q1, we will refrain from specifics as we anticipate closing on the merger with Bayer at the beginning of the new year. 
With that, let's turn our focus towards the status of the pending combination with Bayer on Slide 8. Bayer continues to lead the regulatory filing process, and progress is moving along as expected around the world. All the key filings have been made, and more than 1/3 of the approvals have been received from the authorities with whom we filed. We continue to cooperate with regulators as they work through the refuse, and we look forward to positive outcomes. 
Beyond our work with regulators, we're also continuing outreach for stakeholders to convey the innovation opportunity that this deal can have on the future of agriculture. While some divestitures will occur in limited areas of overlap with Bayer, we believe in the potential to further evolve our leadership role in agriculture through this deal. We expect to meet this challenge by delivering even greater benefits to our customers as outlined in Slide 9. In fact, that commitment is exemplified by our significant R&D expansion in St. Louis that's just recently came online. 
In the interim, we remain focused on delivering our new technologies, and we look forward to the possibilities that our combined pipelines and world-class teams can create for growers in the future. 
So with that, I'll pass it to Brett to provide the operational update."

With record-setting sales and gross profit in Seeds and Genomics, 2017 was certainly a banner year for us. Our teams delivered strongly on our key business imperatives, and their unrelenting focus sets us up well for this year. We expect continued momentum for our new products, and my confidence has been reinforced by recent interactions with growers around the globe. Despite low commodity prices, the demand for new tools only grows.
Let's start first with corn, where our gross profit grew by 15%. This was driven primarily by better pricing, mostly in South America on a growing acreage base and a better-than-anticipated benefit from a strategic licensing deal in corn in the fourth quarter. Globally, we also delivered the improvement in cost of goods we were expecting with U.S. production volumes increasing. As harvest progresses in the northern hemisphere, we look forward to sharing our yield performance numbers in the months ahead. 
Taking a longer view on Slide 10, we expect that launching new hybrids globally will continue to create price-mix lift and genetic share gains. [ For ] the first quarter specifically, we expect corn acres to decline in the first season in Brazil and do not expect to repeat the price gains of last year given the decline in the commodity prices there. 
Moving to soybeans on Slide 11, we delivered an impressive 35% growth in our gross profit coupled with nice margin improvement year-over-year. Our ramp year in Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans saw our final U.S. acre count at greater than 20 million, as shown on Slide 12, which showcased the demand for better [ weed ] control. 
As outlined on Slide 13, the vast majority of growers had a positive experience with the system, and we are hearing from many who have a desire to significantly increase their on-farm use in the coming year. For those who did not, we remain dedicated to improving their experience with the system, and we are actively developing plans to reinforce and expand our training and grower education efforts across the country. We'll take full advantage of the months ahead to broaden and deepen the understanding of the technologies application requirements so that more farmers can experience the benefits that this system can offer. 
For 2018, this will set the stage in a year where we, along with our licensee partners, expect to have supply available to double penetration to more than 40 million acres and to offer the [ trade ] in more than 300 varieties in our brands alone. 
Moving to South America on Slide 14, INTACTA Roundup Ready 2 Pro soybeans continue to provide great value through better insect control and yields, and the trait reached more than 50 million acres this year. This lay solid footing for 2018 as we now expect more than 60 million acres throughout South America coupled with anticipated price improvement in Brazil. 
In our cotton business, shown on Slide 15, Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton reached more than 6 million acres, and our branded and licensed to cut and genetic share in the U.S. grew by nearly 13 points on a growing acreage base, which is the second year of that level of exceptional share growth. Next year, given the strong demand for our cotton technologies, we expect continued brand share gains and similar Bollgard II XtendFlex trait intensity even with planted acres likely to decline. 
Shifting to NemaStrike Technology on Slide 16, our teams are excited about launching this novel nematicide on an expected 6 million to 8 million acres of corn, soybeans and cotton in the U.S. It's been priced at a premium that reflects its consistent yield protection, and we planted more than 400 ground breaker trials this summer to allow growers to see it firsthand. 
Moving to the Climate FieldView platform on Slide 17, the strategic differentiators for Climate, the strength of the platform adoption and the collaborations and partnerships both saw meaningful advancements of this year. One significant development was the recent signing of a new connectivity agreement with AGCO as well as the sale of the precision planting business to them, which is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. This sale allows us to focus more exclusively on the Climate FieldView platform, which continues to make great strides. We landed on more than 35 million paid acres in fiscal year 2017 with a line of sight to reach 50 million paid acres globally next year, driven by 7 advancements and enhancements to the platform. 
Beyond the U.S., as shown on Slide 18, we continued global expansion with a commercial launch in Brazil and Europe, and we look forward to launching in western Canada this fiscal year. 
Moving to Ag Productivity. We remain optimistic about the anticipated results of the reregistration of glyphosate in Europe, which we expect sometime before mid-December. We're encouraged that the EU risk assessment process has reaffirmed the science supporting the safety and efficacy of glyphosate. And by the dialogue we're hearing from farmers across Europe who continue to reiterate that it is an indispensable tool. 
Within the Ag Productivity businesses, we saw the glyphosate price improvements over the prior year in the second half as we had anticipated. And our gross profit of $892 million for the full year was well within the range we outlined at the outset of the year. This improve to glyphosate pricing trend is continuing with recent increases in our U.S. branded prices, in line with our strategy to maintain a premium over generics. And we expect it to lead to better gross profit in the segment for the first quarter. In addition, we expect that volume sold of Xtendimax Herbicide with VaporGrip Technology will continue to grow with the expansion of the system. 
All in all, I'm pleased to see the record penetration levels of our newest traits and record results our teams delivered in seeds and genomics. As we move through harvest and begin fiscal year 2018, I look forward to continued momentum and adoption of the new solutions we're bringing to our customers. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Pierre for his financial review."
528414,405049383,1309581,"Monsanto Company, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 04, 2017",2017-10-04,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thank you, Brent, and good morning to everyone. Financial discipline and exceptional strategic risk and portfolio management contributed to the strong growth in both our earnings and free cash flow this year. I'd like to begin with a brief review of the f",740,"Thank you, Brent, and good morning to everyone. Financial discipline and exceptional strategic risk and portfolio management contributed to the strong growth in both our earnings and free cash flow this year. I'd like to begin with a brief review of the fourth quarter earnings per share, which came in better than the prior year and our expectations at $0.05 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.20 per share on an ongoing basis. These results came in stronger than we had anticipated due to additional tax benefits and better-than-expected corn gross profits from the strategic license Brett mentioned earlier. With the continuing consolidation in the industry, we had the opportunity to grant the right to some key corn licenses in Brazil, resulting in a benefit of more than 200 million in Q4. We expect to continue to receive ongoing royalties from those licensees. 
Beyond of these factors, the results were in line with our expectations. The U.S. business closed out much as we anticipated. Ag Productivity gross profit declined modestly, primarily from the absence of the [ large 2 ] fungicide business; and SG&A and R&D spend was higher, primarily due to higher incentive expense and commissions stemming from the strong growth in the business. 
In addition, we had gains from non-core asset sales of about $70 million in our income and expense roughly split between the segments as we had guided. This compares to $157 million in gains from [indiscernible] asset sales in Q4 of fiscal year '16. 
The fourth quarter was simply the capstone for how the entire year came together. We grew gross profit by an impressive 16% in seeds and genomics, busted a record high for both sales and gross profit in the segment while improving margins with new technology penetration. We remain true to our brand premium strategy and our productivity and delivered in gross profit in the range we expected. 
And finally, our SG&A and R&D spend, while growing with the business, remained relatively consistent as a percent of sales for the full year as we continue to execute on our cost savings and restructuring initiatives. 
In terms of free cash flow, we [ delivers ] $2 billion for the year, which was above the high end of our guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. This improvement from the prior year was driven by the excellent growth in the business and strong collections resulting from our prudent management of risk in a difficult ag environments. 
For fiscal year of 2018, as shown on Slide 19, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of the fiscal year to improve, with growth primarily coming from stronger INTACTA pricing and penetration in South America, higher Ag Productivity gross profit from improved glyphosate pricing and again on the sale of the precision [ planning ] business to AGCO. 
Looking now at the full year, let me share some guidepost to help shape your thinking. Hugh and Brent shared our outlook for penetration of many of our new technologies, which will greatly influence the results. Specifically, we expect the penetration of pricing of INTACTA, additional acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, price and share gains from the introduction of new corn hybrids and price premiums from the NemaStrike Technology to be growth contributors. Pricing for glyphosate is expected to be better, at least for the first quarter of the fiscal year; and volumes of Xtendimax Herbicide with VaporGrip technology are expected to expand. You have to balance those factors against the expected decline in corn acres in Brazil and against the fact that commodity pricing for corn remains challenging around the globe. We expect that our tax rate will normalize and that the contributions from strategic portfolio management will likely fall below the roughly $350 million pretax average annual contribution we've seen for the last 3 years. 
We remain committed to completing the restructuring and cost savings initiatives we began in fiscal year '15, shown on Slide 20. And expect our SG&A and R&D spend to be relatively flat year-over-year. 
In closing, our teams have done an exceptional job in delivering on our 2 imperatives for the year, and we look forward to continuing with that focus and discipline as we move through our first fiscal quarter and are anticipating closing with Bayer in early 2018.

I think the key that I look at this of the vast majority of farmers had a really good experience as you noted. But there are exceptions to that, and we are following up each and every one of those particular claims to ensure we have a full understanding of how the product performed in the marketplace. I'd also note that just last week, we participated in the Academic Summit that we had, and it was an exceptional meeting and surpassed our expectations and shared a lot of information with the academics and vice versa them sharing with us. So we're in the process of looking through all of that data to draw conclusions on the outcomes this year as well as working with the EPA in a collaborative way to make sure that we have a plan in place where all farmers have a great experience next year. I mean, as you look at some of the things to your specific point in the marketplace that we observed this year, there re some's cases where buffer's may be could have been followed a little better than they were. There's case where tank cleanout wasn't done quite as well as it should be and that's farmers have been using products that are a little more forgiving then the dicamba technologies we got to work on that in some cases we found nozzles that probably weren't the appropriate nozzle to be used in for the application. So there's a number of things, Don, that we'll double down onto the training and working with our academic colleagues to make sure that we have farmers fully aware and experience next year going into the season. I think it's notable to also note that as you said, the yields are coming in strong and we feel really good about our prospects for next year, and that's why we're, along with our licensees, prepared to double the penetration next year."

Thanks for the question. So INTACTA was a great success in South America again this year, and we've been talking about it to South America for a couple of years now rather than trying to differentiate between the various countries because you also have Paraguay and Uruguay stuck in the middle there between Argentina and Brazil. And the markets are a bit different in Argentina, particularly the North looks a lot like Brazil and the middle and southern looks a lot less insect pressure. So specific to your question in Argentina, we feel really good about our patent protection in Argentina. We have good patent coverage of multiple patents in Argentina. We feel really good about the progress that we've made in working with the coalition in the marketplace working both with farmers and farmer unions as well as the government on POD system in Argentina. It worked this year, and it's set up to work even better going into next year. So there's always the challenges with that and earlier is no different than the experience in Brazil but we feel good about our position. As we look at the penetration, we see substantial penetration in Brazil. We expect that to continue next year as well as in the following year. And we would anticipate that we'll see an acceleration in Argentina as the POD system becomes more sophisticated and spread out across the country more varieties available with INTACTA, et cetera. So when you look at year-over-year from '18 to '19, that's the anticipation of more activity in Brazil -- or excuse me, in Argentina coming online as more varieties are available. And as you know, we slowed down our efforts in Argentina when he had the early challenges with VOD. And because of that slowdown, both other seeds companies and us were slower to bring varieties and market fit. So we're starting to accelerate that now as the POD is in a better position, so I feel good about that 75 million number in '19."

Third parties saying that acres are going to be down 20% to 30% but we're doing fine in that market. In North America, harvest is coming in, products are performing. And as we see every year, regardless of the challenge in the marketplace, farmers are really in tune with the newest hybrids, the best products. For example, we sold out a disease shield products this year. That was where our latest release and our best products. We believe that we'll see that same kind of demand for our new releases and new hybrids this year. And we'll have to see how the market plays out. But right now, most of our new releases are up in price as you would expect. And with the products that are a bit older in the marketplace, they're flattish.

Am looking around the table. We don't think they have them at the site. The thing about NemaStrike guess it's brand-new chemistry that was built on the back born of the general mix of the nematode so we reverse engineered from biology and it really puts it in a very unique class of its own so I'm not aware of what they had in that space but I think the performance in NemaStrike that we've seen in our own small trials in the feedback we're getting that's I think it's going to carve out the completely unique niche and the much old nematode control. The fascinating thing about it is nematode's as a problem are extraordinarily widespread but growers have not really had the tool to control them until now so it really reminds me in a lot of ways of the early days with cut and burn where the actual market and the actual products that were there were dwarfed by the introduction of proper control.

At the outset of this fiscal year, we outlined 2 clear priorities upon which we judge success at year's end. The first was delivering on our operational plan and key business milestones, and the second was to continue executing the necessary steps to close the deal with Bayer. With focus and discipline, our team did both, and I'm extremely proud of what we delivered. 
In what may be our final full year conference call as Monsanto, I couldn't be more pleased with the results. We delivered record sales and gross profit in our Seeds and Genomics segment in fiscal year 2017, fueled by the outstanding penetration of our latest soybean and cotton technologies and continued adoption of our newest corn hybrids around the globe, reflecting the need for new solutions in what continues to be a challenging ag economy. 
Clearly, our proven ability to innovate as well as our unique platform advantages position us well to meet the production challenges of today as well as the demands of tomorrow, as shown on Slide 6. New products and services will remain crucial to meeting that demand. And leading the way is our strong foundation of seeds, traits, digital ag and chemistry solutions like the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, Climate FieldView offerings and NemaStrike Technology, all outlined on Slide 7. 
The outlook for these new offerings is bright. In fiscal year '18, the Climate FieldView platform is expected to reach 50 million paid acres globally. Our blockbuster NemaStrike Technology is launching across 6 million to 8 million acres in the U.S. And we, along with our partners, expect to have supply to double the penetration of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans. Momentum builds with continued INTACTA penetration in South America, and growers continue to demand our newest corn hybrids, particularly our Disease Shield hybrids, which were sold out in fiscal year '17. 
Given these strong drivers, we remain confident in the outlook for the business. Looking specifically at the first quarter, we anticipate our earnings per share to be stronger than last year with growth expected to come primarily from soybean technologies and better pricing in Ag Productivity. Looking beyond Q1, we will refrain from specifics as we anticipate closing on the merger with Bayer at the beginning of the new year. 
With that, let's turn our focus towards the status of the pending combination with Bayer on Slide 8. 
Bayer continues to lead the regulatory filing process, and progress is moving along, as expected, around the world. All the key filings have been made, and more than 1/3 of the approvals have been received from the authorities with whom we filed. We continue to cooperate with regulators as they work through the reviews, and we look forward to positive outcomes. 
Beyond our work with regulators, we're also continuing outreach with stakeholders to convey the innovation opportunity that this deal can have on the future of agriculture. While some divestitures will occur in limited areas of overlap with Bayer, we believe in the potential to further evolve our leadership role in agriculture through this deal. We expect to meet this challenge by delivering even greater benefits to our customers, as outlined in Slide 9. In fact, that commitment is exemplified by our significant R&D expansion in St. Louis that's just recently came online. 
In the interim, we remain focused on delivering our new technologies, and we look forward to the possibilities that our combined pipelines and world-class teams can create for growers in the future. 
So with that, I'll pass it to Brett to provide the operational update."

With record-setting sales and gross profit in Seeds and Genomics, 2017 was certainly a banner year for us. Our teams delivered strongly on our key business imperatives, and their unrelenting focus sets us up well for this year. We expect continued momentum for our new products, and my confidence has been reinforced by recent interactions with growers around the globe. Despite low commodity prices, the demand for new tools only grows.
Let's start first with corn, where our gross profit grew by 15%. This was driven primarily by better pricing, mostly in South America on a growing acreage base and a better-than-anticipated benefit from a strategic licensing deal in corn in the fourth quarter. Globally, we also delivered the improvement in cost of goods we were expecting with U.S. production volumes increasing. As harvest progresses in the Northern Hemisphere, we look forward to sharing our yield performance numbers in the months ahead. 
Taking a longer view on Slide 10. We expect that launching new hybrids globally will continue to create price-mix lift and genetic share gains. For the first quarter specifically, we expect corn acres to decline in the first season in Brazil and do not expect to repeat the price gains of last year given the decline in the commodity prices there. 
Moving to soybeans on Slide 11. We delivered an impressive 35% growth in our gross profit, coupled with nice margin improvement year-over-year. Our ramp year in Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans saw our final U.S. acre count at greater than 20 million, as shown on Slide 12, which showcased the demand for better weed control. 
As outlined on Slide 13, the vast majority of growers had a positive experience with the system, and we are hearing from many who have a desire to significantly increase their on-farm use in the coming year. For those who did not, we remain dedicated to improving their experience with the system, and we are actively developing plans to reinforce and expand our training and grower education efforts across the country. We'll take full advantage of the months ahead to broaden and deepen the understanding of the technology's application requirements so that more farmers can experience the benefits that this system can offer. 
For 2018, this will set the stage in a year where we, along with our licensee partners, expect to have supply available to double penetration to more than 40 million acres and to offer the trait in more than 300 varieties in our brands alone. 
Moving to South America on Slide 14, INTACTA Roundup Ready 2 Pro soybeans continue to provide great value through better insect control and yields, and the trait reached more than 50 million acres this year. This lay solid footing for 2018 as we now expect more than 60 million acres throughout South America coupled with anticipated price improvement in Brazil. 
In our cotton business, shown on Slide 15, Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton reached more than 6 million acres, and our branded and licensed to cotton genetic share in the U.S. grew by nearly 13 points on a growing acreage base, which is the second year of that level of exceptional share growth. Next year, given the strong demand for our cotton technologies, we expect continued brand share gains and similar Bollgard II XtendFlex trait intensity even with planted acres likely to decline. 
Shifting to NemaStrike Technology on Slide 16. Our teams are excited about launching this novel nematicide on an expected 6 million to 8 million acres of corn, soybeans and cotton in the U.S. It's been priced at a premium that reflects its consistent yield protection, and we planted more than 400 Ground Breaker trials this summer to allow growers to see it firsthand. 
Moving to the Climate FieldView platform on Slide 17. The strategic differentiators for Climate, the strength of the platform adoption and the collaborations and partnerships, both saw meaningful advancements this year. One significant development was the recent signing of a new connectivity agreement with AGCO as well as the sale of the Precision Planting business to them, which is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. This sale allows us to focus more exclusively on the Climate FieldView platform, which continues to make great strides. We landed on more than 35 million paid acres in fiscal year 2017, with a line of sight to reach 50 million paid acres globally next year, driven by 7 advancements and enhancements to the platform. Beyond the U.S., as shown on Slide 18, we continued global expansion with a commercial launch in Brazil and Europe, and we look forward to launching in western Canada this fiscal year. 
Moving to Ag Productivity. We remain optimistic about the anticipated results of the reregistration of glyphosate in Europe, which we expect sometime before mid-December. We're encouraged that the EU risk assessment process has reaffirmed the science supporting the safety and efficacy of glyphosate and by the dialogue we're hearing from farmers across Europe who continue to reiterate that it is an indispensable tool. 
Within the Ag Productivity businesses, we saw the glyphosate price improvements over the prior year in the second half, as we had anticipated, and our gross profit of $892 million for the full year was well within the range we outlined at the outset of the year. This improved glyphosate pricing trend is continuing with recent increases in our U.S.  branded prices, in line with our strategy to maintain a premium over generics, and we expect it to lead to better gross profit in the segment for the first quarter. In addition, we expect that volumes sold of XtendiMax Herbicide with VaporGrip Technology will continue to grow with the expansion of the system. 
All in all, I'm pleased to see the record penetration levels of our newest traits and record results our teams delivered in Seeds and Genomics. As we move through harvest and begin fiscal year 2018, I look forward to continued momentum and adoption of the new solutions we're bringing to our customers. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Pierre for his financial review."

Financial discipline and exceptional strategic risk and portfolio management contributed to the strong growth in both our earnings and free cash flow this year. I'd like to begin with a brief review of the",734,"Thank you, Brett, and good morning to everyone. 
Financial discipline and exceptional strategic risk and portfolio management contributed to the strong growth in both our earnings and free cash flow this year. I'd like to begin with a brief review of the fourth quarter earnings per share, which came in better than the prior year and our expectations at $0.05 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.20 per share on an ongoing basis. These results came in stronger than we had anticipated due to additional tax benefits and better-than-expected corn gross profits from the strategic license Brett mentioned earlier. With the continuing consolidation in the industry, we had the opportunity to grant the right to some key corn licenses in Brazil, resulting in a benefit of more than $200 million in Q4. We expect to continue to receive ongoing royalties from those licenses. 
Beyond of these factors, the results were in line with our expectations: the U.S. business closed out much as we anticipated; Ag Productivity gross profit declined modestly, primarily from the absence of the Latitude fungicide business; and SG&A and R&D spend was higher primarily due to higher incentive expense and commissions stemming from the strong growth in the business. 
In addition, we had gains from non-core asset sales of about $70 million in our income and expense roughly split between the segments as we had guided. This compares to $157 million in gains from sorghum asset sales in Q4 of fiscal year '16. 
The fourth quarter was simply the capstone for how the entire year came together. We grew gross profit by an impressive 16% in Seeds and Genomics, posted a record high for both sales and gross profit in the segment while improving margins with new technology penetration. We remain true to our brand premium strategy and our productivity and delivered in gross profit in the range we expected. 
And finally, our SG&A and R&D spend, while growing with the business, remain relatively consistent as a percent of sales for the full year as we continue to execute on our cost savings and restructuring initiatives. 
In terms of free cash flow, we delivered $2 billion for the year, which was above the high end of our guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. This improvement from the prior year was driven by the excellent growth in the business and strong collections resulting from our prudent management of risk in a difficult ag environment. 
For fiscal year of 2018, as shown on Slide 19, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of the fiscal year to improve, with growth primarily coming from stronger INTACTA pricing and penetration in South America, higher Ag Productivity gross profit from improved glyphosate pricing and gain on the sale of the Precision Planning business to AGCO. 
Looking now at the full year, let me share some guideposts to help shape your thinking. 
Hugh and Brett shared our outlook for penetration of many of our new technologies, which will greatly influence the results. Specifically, we expect the penetration of pricing of INTACTA, additional acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, price and share gains from the introduction of new corn hybrids and price premiums from the NemaStrike Technology to be growth contributors. Pricing for glyphosate is expected to be better, at least for the first quarter of the fiscal year, and volumes of XtendiMax Herbicide with VaporGrip Technology are expected to expand. You have to balance those factors against the expected decline in corn acres in Brazil and against the fact that commodity pricing for corn remains challenging around the globe. 
We expect that our tax rate will normalize and that the contributions from strategic portfolio management will likely fall below the roughly $350 million pretax average annual contribution we've seen for the last 3 years. 
We remain committed to completing the restructuring and cost savings initiatives we began in fiscal year '15, as shown on Slide 20, and expect our SG&A and R&D spend to be relatively flat year-over-year. 
In closing, our teams have done an exceptional job in delivering on our 2 imperatives for the year, and we look forward to continuing with that focus and discipline as we move through our first fiscal quarter and are anticipating closing with Bayer in early 2018.

As you mentioned, just a tremendous launch of the product, and I think it speaks volumes to the challenges that farmers have in controlling weeds in the market. I think the key that I look at is the vast majority of farmers had a really good experience, as you noted. But there are exceptions to that, and we are following up each and every one of those particular claims to ensure we have a full understanding of how the product performed in the marketplace. I'd also note that just last week, I participated in the academic summit that we had, and it was an exceptional meeting and surpassed our expectations and shared a lot of information with the academics and vice versa, them sharing with us. So we're in the process of looking through all of that data to draw conclusions on the outcomes this year as well as working with the EPA in a collaborative way to make sure that we have a plan in place where all farmers have a great experience next year. I mean, as you look at some of the things, to your specific point, in the marketplace that we observed this year, there are some cases where buffers maybe could have been followed a little better than they were. There's cases where tank cleanout maybe wasn't done quite as well as it should be, and that's -- farmers have been using products that are a little more forgiving than the dicamba technologies. So we got to work on that. In some cases, we found nozzles that probably weren't the appropriate nozzle to be used in -- for the application. So there's a number of things, Don, that we'll double down on the training and working with our academic colleagues to make sure that we have farmers fully aware and experienced next year going into the season. But I think it's notable to also note that as you said, the yields are coming in strong, and we feel really good about our prospects for next year. And that's why we're, along with our licensees, prepared to double the penetration next year."

And I think you're right, the combination with Bayer chemistry, I think, brings another great opportunity. The way we've always looked at this is we look for the best possible chemistry that's out there and you're optimizing yields. And when you put out brand-new hybrids every year, you -- our general philosophy has been you put the very best technology you can on that and remain agnostic for the source. But I think there's real opportunities with some of the Bayer stuff as well as others from other stables as well."

Thanks for the question. So INTACTA was a great success in South America again this year, and we've been talking about it to South America for a couple of years now rather than trying to differentiate between the various countries because you also have Paraguay and Uruguay stuck in the middle there between Argentina and Brazil. And the markets are a bit different in Argentina. Particularly, the North looks a lot like Brazil and the middle and southern looks a lot less insect pressure. So specific to your question in Argentina, we feel really good about our patent protection in Argentina. We have good patent coverage of multiple patents in Argentina. We feel really good about the progress that we've made in working with the coalition in the marketplace, working both with farmers and farmer unions as well as the government on a POD system in Argentina. It worked this year, and it's set up to work even better going into next year. So there's always the challenges with that in the early years, no different than the experience in Brazil, but we feel good about our position. As we look at the penetration, we see substantial penetration in Brazil. We expect that to continue next year as well as in the following year. And we would anticipate that we'll see an acceleration in Argentina as the POD system becomes more sophisticated and spread out across the country, more varieties available with INTACTA, et cetera. So when you look at year-over-year from '18 to '19, that's the anticipation of more activity in Argentina coming online as more varieties are available. And as you know, we slowed down our efforts in Argentina when he had the early challenges with POD. And because of that slowdown, well, other seed companies and us were slower to bring varieties and market fits. So we're starting to accelerate that now as the POD is in a better position, so I feel good about that 75 million number in '19."

Third parties saying that acres are going to be down 20% to 30%. But we're doing fine in that market. In North America, harvest is coming in. Products are performing. And as we see every year, regardless of the challenge in the marketplace, farmers are really in tune with the newest hybrids, the best products. For example, we sold out our Disease Shield products this year. Those were our latest release and our best products. We'll -- we believe that we'll see that same kind of demand for our new releases and new hybrids this year, and we'll have to see how the market plays out. But right now, most of our new releases are up in price, as you would expect. And with the products that are a bit older in the marketplace, they're flattish.

I would anticipate that those acres are replaced with soybeans, but they have options in Brazil to other crops as well and we'll just have to wait and see how it plays out. I remind you that in Brazil, they get 2 cracks at corn, so they have the summer season that they're going into, and then they have the winter safrinha season. So they're less sensitive to a singular planting. They can make up for corn in safrinha if they need to. And we don't anticipate the same kind of decline in safrinha that we're seeing in the summer season. So I would anticipate at this point that in most cases, beans replace the corn acres that are down, down there. In North America, I say it's way too early. Farmers aren't going to make those calls. They're worried about harvesting right now and getting the crop out of the field. And then they'll start thinking about next year."

I'm looking around the table. We don't think that they have a nematicide. The extraordinary thing about NemaStrike is its brand-new chemistry that was built on the backbone of the genomics of the nematode. So we reversed-engineered from biology, and it really puts it in a very unique class of its own. So I'm not aware of what Bayer has in that space, but I think the performance of NemaStrike that we've seen in our own small trials and the feedback we're getting, it's -- I think, is going to carve out a completely unique niche in nematode control. And the other fascinating thing about it is nematodes as a problem are extraordinarily widespread, but growers have not really had a tool to control them until now. So it really reminds me in a lot of ways of the early days with corn rootworm, where the actual market and the actual products that were there were dwarfed by the introduction of proper control. I think we'll probably see the same thing happen when NemaStrike comes in the future. Thanks for your question.

Before handing it over to Hugh to share our strategic outlook, let me share our year-end results, as shown on Slide 5. 
We delivered strong growth with as-reported earnings per share of $5.09 and ongoing earnings per share of $5.50 as compared to last year's as-reported full year earnings per share of $2.99 and ongoing earnings per share of $4.48. Our free cash flow for the fiscal year was $2 billion as compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year.

At the outset of this fiscal year, we outlined 2 clear priorities upon which we judge success at year's end. The first was delivering on our operational plan and key business milestones, and the second was to continue executing the necessary steps to close the deal with Bayer. With focus and discipline, our team did both, and I'm extremely proud of what we delivered. 
In what may be our final full year conference call as Monsanto, I couldn't be more pleased with the results. We delivered record sales and gross profit in our Seeds and Genomics segment in fiscal year 2017, fueled by the outstanding penetration of our latest soybean and cotton technologies and continued adoption of our newest corn hybrids around the globe, reflecting the need for new solutions in what continues to be a challenging ag economy. 
Clearly, our proven ability to innovate as well as our unique platform advantages position us well to meet the production challenges of today as well as the demands of tomorrow, as shown on Slide 6. New products and services will remain crucial to meeting that demand. And leading the way is our strong foundation of seeds, traits, digital ag and chemistry solutions like the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, Climate FieldView offerings and NemaStrike Technology, all outlined on Slide 7. 
The outlook for these new offerings is bright. In fiscal year '18, the Climate FieldView platform is expected to reach 50 million paid acres globally. Our blockbuster NemaStrike Technology is launching across 6 million to 8 million acres in the U.S. And we, along with our partners, expect to have supply to double the penetration of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans. Momentum builds with continued INTACTA penetration in South America, and growers continue to demand our newest corn hybrids, particularly our Disease Shield hybrids, which were sold out in fiscal year '17. 
Given these strong drivers, we remain confident in the outlook for the business. Looking specifically at the first quarter, we anticipate our earnings per share to be stronger than last year with growth expected to come primarily from soybean technologies and better pricing in Ag Productivity. Looking beyond Q1, we will refrain from specifics as we anticipate closing on the merger with Bayer at the beginning of the new year. 
With that, let's turn our focus towards the status of the pending combination with Bayer on Slide 8. 
Bayer continues to lead the regulatory filing process, and progress is moving along, as expected, around the world. All the key filings have been made, and more than 1/3 of the approvals have been received from the authorities with whom we filed. We continue to cooperate with regulators as they work through their reviews, and we look forward to positive outcomes. 
Beyond our work with regulators, we're also continuing outreach with stakeholders to convey the innovation opportunity that this deal can have on the future of agriculture. While some divestitures will occur in limited areas of overlap with Bayer, we believe in the potential to further evolve our leadership role in agriculture through this deal. We expect to meet this challenge by delivering even greater benefits to our customers, as outlined in Slide 9. In fact, that commitment is exemplified by our significant R&D expansion in St. Louis that's just recently came online. 
In the interim, we remain focused on delivering our new technologies, and we look forward to the possibilities that our combined pipelines and world-class teams can create for growers in the future. 
So with that, I'll pass it to Brett to provide the operational update."

Our teams delivered strongly on our key business imperatives, and their unrelenting focus",1028,"Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. 
With record-setting sales and gross profit in Seeds and Genomics, 2017 was certainly a banner year for us. Our teams delivered strongly on our key business imperatives, and their unrelenting focus sets us up well for this year. We expect continued momentum for our new products, and my confidence has been reinforced by recent interactions with growers around the globe. Despite low commodity prices, the demand for new tools only grows.
Let's start first with corn, where our gross profit grew by 15%. This was driven primarily by better pricing, mostly in South America on a growing acreage base and a better-than-anticipated benefit from a strategic licensing deal in corn in the fourth quarter. Globally, we also delivered the improvement in cost of goods we were expecting with U.S. production volumes increasing. As harvest progresses in the Northern Hemisphere, we look forward to sharing our yield performance numbers in the months ahead. 
Taking a longer view on Slide 10. We expect that launching new hybrids globally will continue to create price-mix lift and genetic share gains. For the first quarter specifically, we expect corn acres to decline in the first season in Brazil and do not expect to repeat the price gains of last year given the decline in the commodity prices there. 
Moving to soybeans on Slide 11. We delivered an impressive 35% growth in our gross profit, coupled with nice margin improvement year-over-year. Our ramp year in Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans saw our final U.S. acre count at greater than 20 million, as shown on Slide 12, which showcased the demand for better weed control. 
As outlined on Slide 13, the vast majority of growers had a positive experience with the system, and we are hearing from many who have a desire to significantly increase their on-farm use in the coming year. For those who did not, we remain dedicated to improving their experience with the system, and we are actively developing plans to reinforce and expand our training and grower education efforts across the country. We'll take full advantage of the months ahead to broaden and deepen the understanding of the technology's application requirements so that more farmers can experience the benefits that this system can offer. 
For 2018, this will set the stage in a year where we, along with our licensee partners, expect to have supply available to double penetration to more than 40 million acres and to offer the trait in more than 300 varieties in our brands alone. 
Moving to South America on Slide 14, INTACTA Roundup Ready 2 Pro soybeans continue to provide great value through better insect control and yields, and the trait reached more than 50 million acres this year. This lay solid footing for 2018 as we now expect more than 60 million acres throughout South America coupled with anticipated price improvement in Brazil. 
In our cotton business, shown on Slide 15, Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton reached more than 6 million acres, and our branded and licensed to cotton genetic share in the U.S. grew by nearly 13 points on a growing acreage base, which is the second year of that level of exceptional share growth. Next year, given the strong demand for our cotton technologies, we expect continued brand share gains and similar Bollgard II XtendFlex trait intensity even with planted acres likely to decline. 
Shifting to NemaStrike Technology on Slide 16. Our teams are excited about launching this novel nematicide on an expected 6 million to 8 million acres of corn, soybeans and cotton in the U.S. It's been priced at a premium that reflects its consistent yield protection, and we planted more than 400 Ground Breaker trials this summer to allow growers to see it firsthand. 
Moving to the Climate FieldView platform on Slide 17. The strategic differentiators for Climate, the strength of the platform adoption and the collaborations and partnerships, both saw meaningful advancements this year. One significant development was the recent signing of a new connectivity agreement with AGCO as well as the sale of the Precision Planting business to them, which is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. This sale allows us to focus more exclusively on the Climate FieldView platform, which continues to make great strides. We landed on more than 35 million paid acres in fiscal year 2017, with a line of sight to reach 50 million paid acres globally next year, driven by 7 advancements and enhancements to the platform. Beyond the U.S., as shown on Slide 18, we continued global expansion with a commercial launch in Brazil and Europe, and we look forward to launching in western Canada this fiscal year. 
Moving to Ag Productivity. We remain optimistic about the anticipated results of the reregistration of glyphosate in Europe, which we expect sometime before mid-December. We're encouraged that the EU risk assessment process has reaffirmed the science supporting the safety and efficacy of glyphosate and by the dialogue we're hearing from farmers across Europe who continue to reiterate that it is an indispensable tool. 
Within the Ag Productivity businesses, we saw the glyphosate price improvements over the prior year in the second half, as we had anticipated, and our gross profit of $892 million for the full year was well within the range we outlined at the outset of the year. This improved glyphosate pricing trend is continuing with recent increases in our U.S.  Branded prices, in line with our strategy to maintain a premium over generics, and we expect it to lead to better gross profit in the segment for the first quarter. In addition, we expect that volumes sold of XtendiMax Herbicide with VaporGrip Technology will continue to grow with the expansion of the system. 
All in all, I'm pleased to see the record penetration levels of our newest traits and record results our teams delivered in Seeds and Genomics. As we move through harvest and begin fiscal year 2018, I look forward to continued momentum and adoption of the new solutions we're bringing to our customers. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Pierre for his financial review."
528414,405049383,1309764,"Monsanto Company, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 04, 2017",2017-10-04,"Earnings Calls","Monsanto Company","Executives","Thank you, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Financial discipline and exceptional strategic risk and portfolio management contributed to the strong growth in both our earnings and free cash flow this year. I'd like to begin with a brief review of the",733,"Thank you, Brett, and good morning to everyone. 
Financial discipline and exceptional strategic risk and portfolio management contributed to the strong growth in both our earnings and free cash flow this year. I'd like to begin with a brief review of the fourth quarter earnings per share, which came in better than the prior year and our expectations at $0.05 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.20 per share on an ongoing basis. These results came in stronger than we had anticipated due to additional tax benefits and better-than-expected corn gross profits from the strategic license Brett mentioned earlier. With the continuing consolidation in the industry, we had the opportunity to grant the right to some key corn licenses in Brazil, resulting in a benefit of more than $200 million in Q4. We expect to continue to receive ongoing royalties from those licenses. 
Beyond these factors, the results were in line with our expectations: the U.S. seed business closed out much as we anticipated; Ag Productivity gross profit declined modestly, primarily from the absence of the Latitude fungicide business; and SG&A and R&D spend was higher primarily due to higher incentive expense and commissions stemming from the strong growth in the business. 
In addition, we had gains from non-core asset sales of about $70 million in our income and expense roughly split between the segments as we had guided. This compares to $157 million in gains from sorghum asset sales in Q4 of fiscal year '16. 
The fourth quarter was simply the capstone for how the entire year came together. We grew gross profit by an impressive 16% in Seeds and Genomics, posted a record high for both sales and gross profit in the segment while improving margins with new technology penetration. We remain true to our brand premium strategy and our productivity and delivered gross profit in the range we expected. 
And finally, our SG&A and R&D spend, while growing with the business, remain relatively consistent as a percent of sales for the full year as we continue to execute on our cost savings and restructuring initiatives. 
In terms of free cash flow, we delivered $2 billion for the year, which was above the high end of our guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. This improvement from the prior year was driven by the excellent growth in the business and strong collections resulting from our prudent management of risk in a difficult ag environment. 
For fiscal year of 2018, as shown on Slide 19, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of the fiscal year to improve, with growth primarily coming from stronger INTACTA pricing and penetration in South America, higher Ag Productivity gross profit from improved glyphosate pricing and gain on the sale of the Precision Planning business to AGCO. 
Looking now at the full year, let me share some guideposts to help shape your thinking. 
Hugh and Brett shared our outlook for penetration of many of our new technologies, which will greatly influence the results. Specifically, we expect the penetration of pricing of INTACTA, additional acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, price and share gains from the introduction of new corn hybrids and price premiums from the NemaStrike Technology to be growth contributors. Pricing for glyphosate is expected to be better, at least for the first quarter of the fiscal year, and volumes of XtendiMax Herbicide with VaporGrip Technology are expected to expand. You have to balance those factors against the expected decline in corn acres in Brazil and against the fact that commodity pricing for corn remains challenging around the globe. 
We expect that our tax rate will normalize and that the contributions from strategic portfolio management will likely fall below the roughly $350 million pretax average annual contribution we've seen for the last 3 years. 
We remain committed to completing the restructuring and cost savings initiatives we began in fiscal year '15, as shown on Slide 20, and expect our SG&A and R&D spend to be relatively flat year-over-year.

I think it's important to start that INTACTA has continued to deliver incredible insect control as well as yield gains for growers, and we reached 50 million acres this year and expect to be close to 60 million next year. One of the key things for pricing is through the transition from Roundup Ready 1 to INTACTA, there were some covenants with the growers in making that transition, and those have now expired. So as we look at the value that the product is delivering in the marketplace and priced into the marketplace this year, we would anticipate somewhere in the range of double-digit price improvement on INTACTA for next year."

As you mentioned, just a tremendous launch of the product, and I think it speaks volumes to the challenges that farmers have in controlling weeds in the market. I think the key that I look at is the vast majority of farmers had a really good experience, as Hugh noted. But there are exceptions to that, and we are following up each and every one of those particular claims to ensure we have a full understanding of how the product performed in the marketplace. I'd also note that just last week, I participated in the academic summit that we had, and it was an exceptional meeting and surpassed our expectations and shared a lot of information with the academics and vice versa, them sharing with us. So we're in the process of looking through all of that data to draw conclusions on the outcomes this year as well as working with the EPA in a collaborative way to make sure that we have a plan in place where all farmers have a great experience next year. I mean, as you look at some of the things, to your specific point, in the marketplace that we observed this year, there are some cases where buffers maybe could have been followed a little better than they were. There's cases where tank cleanout maybe wasn't done quite as well as it should be, and that's -- farmers have been using products that are a little more forgiving than the dicamba technologies. So we got to work on that. In some cases, we found nozzles that probably weren't the appropriate nozzle to be using for the application. So there's a number of things, Don, that we'll double down on the training and working with our academic colleagues to make sure that we have farmers fully aware and experienced next year going into the season. But I think it's notable to also note that as Hugh said, the yields are coming in strong, and we feel really good about our prospects for next year. And that's why we're, along with our licensees, prepared to double the penetration next year."

And I think you're right, the combination with Bayer chemistry, I think, brings another great opportunity. The way we've always looked at this is we look for the best possible chemistry that's out there and you're optimizing yields. And when you put out brand-new hybrids every year, you -- our general philosophy has been you put the very best technology you can on that and remain agnostic for the source.

Thanks for the question. So INTACTA was a great success in South America again this year, and we've been talking about it to South America for a couple of years now rather than trying to differentiate between the various countries because you also have Paraguay and Uruguay stuck in the middle there between Argentina and Brazil. And the markets are a bit different in Argentina. Particularly, the North looks a lot like Brazil and the middle and southern looks a lot less insect pressure. So specific to your question in Argentina, we feel really good about our patent protection in Argentina. We have good patent coverage of multiple patents in Argentina. We feel really good about the progress that we've made in working with the coalition in the marketplace, working both with farmers and farmer unions as well as the government on a POD system in Argentina. It worked this year, and it's set up to work even better going into next year. So there's always the challenges with that in the early years, no different than the experience in Brazil, but we feel good about our position. As we look at the penetration, we see substantial penetration in Brazil. We expect that to continue next year as well as in the following year. And we would anticipate that we'll see an acceleration in Argentina as the POD system becomes more sophisticated and spread out across the country, more varieties available with INTACTA, et cetera. So when you look at year-over-year from '18 to '19, that's the anticipation of more activity in Argentina coming online as more varieties are available. And as you know, we slowed down our efforts in Argentina when he had the early challenges with POD. And because of that slowdown, well, other seed companies and us were slower to bring varieties and market fits. So we're starting to accelerate that now as the POD is in a better position, so I feel good about that 75 million number in '19."

Third parties saying that acres are going to be down 20% to 30%. But we're doing fine in that market. In North America, harvest is coming in. Products are performing. And as we see every year, regardless of the challenge in the marketplace, farmers are really in tune with the newest hybrids, the best products. For example, we sold out of Disease Shield products this year. Those were our latest release and our best products. We'll -- we believe that we'll see that same kind of demand for our new releases and new hybrids this year, and we'll have to see how the market plays out.

I would anticipate that those acres are replaced with soybeans, but they have options in Brazil to other crops as well and we'll just have to wait and see how it plays out. I remind you that in Brazil, they get 2 cracks at corn, so they have the summer season that they're going into, and then they have the winter safrinha season. So they're less sensitive to a singular planting. They can make up for corn in safrinha if they need to. And we don't anticipate the same kind of decline in safrinha that we're seeing in the summer season. So I would anticipate at this point that in most cases, beans replace the corn acres that are down, down there. In North America, I say it's way too early. Farmers aren't going to make those calls. They're worried about harvesting right now and getting the crop out of the field. And then they'll start thinking about next year."

I'm looking around the table. We don't think that they have a nematicide.

So I'm not aware of what Bayer has in that space, but I think the performance of NemaStrike that we've seen in our own small trials and the feedback we're getting, it's -- I think, is going to carve out a completely unique niche in nematode control. And the other fascinating thing about it is nematodes as a problem are extraordinarily widespread, but growers have not really had a tool to control them until now. So it really reminds me in a lot of ways of the early days with corn rootworm, where the actual market and the actual products that were there were dwarfed by the introduction of proper control.

Given that, we plan to continue to execute on exactly the same deliverables as we move through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and we are really looking forward to the benefits that we envision that the pending combination with Bayer will bring to our grower customers around the world. So with that, thanks very much for joining us on the call this morning."

Before handing it over to Hugh to share our strategic outlook, let me share our year-end results, as shown on Slide 5. 
We delivered strong growth with as-reported earnings per share of $5.09 and ongoing earnings per share of $5.50 as compared to last year's as-reported full year earnings per share of $2.99 and ongoing earnings per share of $4.48. Our free cash flow for the fiscal year was $2 billion as compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year. 
Hugh, I'll turn it over to you."

At the outset of this fiscal year, we outlined 2 clear priorities upon which we judge success at year's end. The first was delivering on our operational plan and key business milestones, and the second was to continue executing the necessary steps to close the deal with Bayer. With focus and discipline, our team did both, and I'm extremely proud of what we delivered. 
In what may be our final full year conference call as Monsanto, I couldn't be more pleased with the results. We delivered record sales and gross profit in our Seeds and Genomics segment in fiscal year 2017, fueled by the outstanding penetration of our latest soybean and cotton technologies and continued adoption of our newest corn hybrids around the globe, reflecting the need for new solutions in what continues to be a challenging ag economy. 
Clearly, our proven ability to innovate as well as our unique platform advantages position us well to meet the production challenges of today as well as the demands of tomorrow, as shown on Slide 6. New products and services will remain crucial to meeting that demand. And leading the way is our strong foundation of seeds, traits, digital ag and chemistry solutions like the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system, Climate FieldView offerings and NemaStrike Technology, all outlined on Slide 7. 
The outlook for these new offerings is bright. In fiscal year '18, the Climate FieldView platform is expected to reach 50 million paid acres globally. Our blockbuster NemaStrike Technology is launching across 6 million to 8 million acres in the U.S. And we, along with our partners, expect to have supply to double the penetration of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans. Momentum builds with continued INTACTA penetration in South America, and growers continue to demand our newest corn hybrids, particularly our Disease Shield hybrids, which were sold out in fiscal year '17. 
Given these strong drivers, we remain confident in the outlook for the business. Looking specifically at the first quarter, we anticipate our earnings per share to be stronger than last year with growth expected to come primarily from soybean technologies and better pricing in Ag Productivity. Looking beyond Q1, we will refrain from specifics as we anticipate closing on the merger with Bayer at the beginning of the new year. 
With that, let's turn our focus towards the status of the pending combination with Bayer on Slide 8. 
Bayer continues to lead the regulatory filing process, and progress is moving along, as expected, around the world. All the key filings have been made, and more than 1/3 of the approvals have been received from the authorities with whom we filed. We continue to cooperate with regulators as they work through their reviews, and we look forward to positive outcomes. 
Beyond our work with regulators, we're also continuing outreach with stakeholders to convey the innovation opportunity that this deal can have on the future of agriculture. While some divestitures will occur in limited areas of overlap with Bayer, we believe in the potential to further evolve our leadership role in agriculture through this deal. We expect to meet this challenge by delivering even greater benefits to our customers, as outlined in Slide 9. In fact, that commitment is exemplified by our significant R&D expansion in St. Louis that's just recently came online. 
In the interim, we remain focused on delivering our new technologies, and we look forward to the possibilities that our combined pipelines and world-class teams can create for growers in the future. 
So with that, I'll pass it to Brett to provide the operational update."

With record-setting sales and gross profit in Seeds and Genomics, 2017 was certainly a banner year for us. Our teams delivered strongly on our key business imperatives, and their unrelenting focus sets us up well for this year. We expect continued momentum for our new products, and my confidence has been reinforced by recent interactions with growers around the globe. Despite low commodity prices, the demand for new tools only grows.
Let's start first with corn, where our gross profit grew by 15%. This was driven primarily by better pricing, mostly in South America on a growing acreage base and a better-than-anticipated benefit from a strategic licensing deal in corn in the fourth quarter. Globally, we also delivered the improvement in cost of goods we were expecting with U.S. production volumes increasing. As harvest progresses in the Northern Hemisphere, we look forward to sharing our yield performance numbers in the months ahead. 
Taking a longer view on Slide 10. We expect that launching new hybrids globally will continue to create price-mix lift and genetic share gains. For the first quarter specifically, we expect corn acres to decline in the first season in Brazil and do not expect to repeat the price gains of last year given the decline in the commodity prices there. 
Moving to soybeans on Slide 11. We delivered an impressive 35% growth in our gross profit, coupled with nice margin improvement year-over-year. Our ramp year in Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans saw our final U.S. acre count at greater than 20 million, as shown on Slide 12, which showcased the demand for better weed control. 
As outlined on Slide 13, the vast majority of growers had a positive experience with the system, and we are hearing from many who have a desire to significantly increase their on-farm use in the coming year. For those who did not, we remain dedicated to improving their experience with the system, and we are actively developing plans to reinforce and expand our training and grower education efforts across the country. We'll take full advantage of the months ahead to broaden and deepen the understanding of the technology's application requirements so that more farmers can experience the benefits that this system can offer. 
For 2018, this will set the stage in a year where we, along with our licensee partners, expect to have supply available to double penetration to more than 40 million acres and to offer the trait in more than 300 varieties in our brands alone. 
Moving to South America on Slide 14, INTACTA Roundup Ready 2 Pro soybeans continue to provide great value through better insect control and yields, and the trait reached more than 50 million acres this year. This lay solid footing for 2018 as we now expect more than 60 million acres throughout South America coupled with anticipated price improvement in Brazil. 
In our cotton business, shown on Slide 15, Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton reached more than 6 million acres, and our branded and licensed to cotton genetic share in the U.S. grew by nearly 13 points on a growing acreage base, which is the second year of that level of exceptional share growth. Next year, given the strong demand for our cotton technologies, we expect continued brand share gains and similar Bollgard II XtendFlex trait intensity even with planted acres likely to decline. 
Shifting to NemaStrike Technology on Slide 16. Our teams are excited about launching this novel nematicide on an expected 6 million to 8 million acres of corn, soybeans and cotton in the U.S. It's been priced at a premium that reflects its consistent yield protection, and we planted more than 400 Ground Breaker trials this summer to allow growers to see it firsthand. 
Moving to the Climate FieldView platform on Slide 17. The strategic differentiators for Climate, the strength of the platform adoption and the collaborations and partnerships, both saw meaningful advancements this year. One significant development was the recent signing of a new connectivity agreement with AGCO as well as the sale of the Precision Planting business to them, which is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. This sale allows us to focus more exclusively on the Climate FieldView platform, which continues to make great strides. We landed on more than 35 million paid acres in fiscal year 2017, with a line of sight to reach 50 million paid acres globally next year, driven by 7 advancements and enhancements to the platform. Beyond the U.S., as shown on Slide 18, we continued global expansion with a commercial launch in Brazil and Europe, and we look forward to launching in western Canada this fiscal year. 
Moving to Ag Productivity. We remain optimistic about the anticipated results of the reregistration of glyphosate in Europe, which we expect sometime before mid-December. We're encouraged that the EU risk assessment process has reaffirmed the science supporting the safety and efficacy of glyphosate and by the dialogue we're hearing from farmers across Europe who continue to reiterate that it is an indispensable tool. 
Within the Ag Productivity businesses, we saw the glyphosate price improvements over the prior year in the second half, as we had anticipated, and our gross profit of $892 million for the full year was well within the range we outlined at the outset of the year. This improved glyphosate pricing trend is continuing with recent increases in our U.S.  Branded prices, in line with our strategy to maintain a premium over generics, and we expect it to lead to better gross profit in the segment for the first quarter. In addition, we expect that volumes sold of XtendiMax Herbicide with VaporGrip Technology will continue to grow with the expansion of the system. 
All in all, I'm pleased to see the record penetration levels of our newest traits and record results our teams delivered in Seeds and Genomics. As we move through harvest and begin fiscal year 2018, I look forward to continued momentum and adoption of the new solutions we're bringing to our customers. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Pierre for his financial review."

Financial discipline and exceptional strategic risk and portfolio management contributed to the strong growth in both our earnings and free cash flow this year. I'd like to begin with a brief review of the",733,"Thank you, Brett, and good morning to everyone. 
Financial discipline and exceptional strategic risk and portfolio management contributed to the strong growth in both our earnings and free cash flow this year. I'd like to begin with a brief review of the fourth quarter earnings per share, which came in better than the prior year and our expectations at $0.05 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.20 per share on an ongoing basis. These results came in stronger than we had anticipated due to additional tax benefits and better-than-expected corn gross profits from the strategic license Brett mentioned earlier. With the continuing consolidation in the industry, we had the opportunity to grant the right to some key corn licenses in Brazil, resulting in a benefit of more than $200 million in Q4. We expect to continue to receive ongoing royalties from those licenses. 
Beyond these factors, the results were in line with our expectations: the U.S. seed business closed out much as we anticipated; Ag Productivity gross profit declined modestly, primarily from the absence of the Latitude fungicide business; and SG&A and R&D spend was higher primarily due to higher incentive expense and commissions stemming from the strong growth in the business. 
In addition, we had gains from non-core asset sales of about $70 million in our income and expense roughly split between the segments as we had guided. This compares to $157 million in gains from sorghum asset sales in Q4 of fiscal year '16. 
The fourth quarter was simply the capstone for how the entire year came together. We grew gross profit by an impressive 16% in Seeds and Genomics, posted a record high for both sales and gross profit in the segment while improving margins with new technology penetration. We remain true to our brand premium strategy and our productivity and delivered gross profit in the range we expected. 
And finally, our SG&A and R&D spend, while growing with the business, remain relatively consistent as a percent of sales for the full year as we continue to execute on our cost savings and restructuring initiatives. 
In terms of free cash flow, we delivered $2 billion for the year, which was above the high end of our guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. This improvement from the prior year was driven by the excellent growth in the business and strong collections resulting from our prudent management of risk in a difficult ag environment. 
For fiscal year of 2018, as shown on Slide 19, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of the fiscal year to improve, with growth primarily coming from stronger INTACTA pricing and penetration in South America, higher Ag Productivity gross profit from improved glyphosate pricing and gain on the sale of the Precision Planning business to AGCO. 
Looking now at the full year, let me share some guideposts to help shape your thinking. 
Hugh and Brett shared our outlook for penetration of many of our new technologies, which will greatly influence the results. Specifically, we expect the penetration of pricing of INTACTA, additional acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, price and share gains from the introduction of new corn hybrids and price premiums from the NemaStrike Technology to be growth contributors. Pricing for glyphosate is expected to be better, at least for the first quarter of the fiscal year, and volumes of XtendiMax Herbicide with VaporGrip Technology are expected to expand. You have to balance those factors against the expected decline in corn acres in Brazil and against the fact that commodity pricing for corn remains challenging around the globe. 
We expect that our tax rate will normalize and that the contributions from strategic portfolio management will likely fall below the roughly $350 million pretax average annual contribution we've seen for the last 3 years. 
We remain committed to completing the restructuring and cost savings initiatives we began in fiscal year '15, as shown on Slide 20, and expect our SG&A and R&D spend to be relatively flat year-over-year. 
In closing, our teams have done an exceptional job in delivering on our 2 imperatives for the year, and we look forward to continuing with that focus and discipline as we move through our first fiscal quarter and are anticipating closing with Bayer in early 2018. 
Thank you for your time today. And with that, I will pass it to Laura for the questions."

As you mentioned, just a tremendous launch of the product, and I think it speaks volumes to the challenges that farmers have in controlling weeds in the market. I think the key that I look at is the vast majority of farmers had a really good experience, as Hugh noted. But there are exceptions to that, and we are following up each and every one of those particular claims to ensure we have a full understanding of how the product performed in the marketplace. I'd also note that just last week, I participated in the academic summit that we had, and it was an exceptional meeting and surpassed our expectations and shared a lot of information with the academics and vice versa, them sharing with us. So we're in the process of looking through all of that data to draw conclusions on the outcomes this year as well as working with the EPA in a collaborative way to make sure that we have a plan in place where all farmers have a great experience next year. I mean, as you look at some of the things, to your specific point, in the marketplace that we observed this year, there are some cases where buffers maybe could have been followed a little better than they were. There's cases where tank cleanout maybe wasn't done quite as well as it should be, and that's -- farmers have been using products that are a little more forgiving than the dicamba technologies. So we got to work on that. In some cases, we found nozzles that probably weren't the appropriate nozzle to be using for the application. So there's a number of things, Don, that we'll double down on the training and working with our academic colleagues to make sure that we have farmers fully aware and experienced next year going into the season. But I think it's notable to also note that as Hugh said, the yields are coming in strong, and we feel really good about our prospects for next year. And that's why we're, along with our licensees, prepared to double the penetration next year."

And I think you're right, the combination with Bayer chemistry, I think, brings another great opportunity. The way we've always looked at this is we look for the best possible chemistry that's out there and you're optimizing yields. And when you put out brand-new hybrids every year, you -- our general philosophy has been you put the very best technology you can on that and remain agnostic for the source. But I think there's real opportunities with some of the Bayer stuff as well as others from other stables as well."

So there's always the challenges with that in the early years, no different than the experience in Brazil, but we feel good about our position. As we look at the penetration, we see substantial penetration in Brazil. We expect that to continue next year as well as in the following year. And we would anticipate that we'll see an acceleration in Argentina as the POD system becomes more sophisticated and spread out across the country, more varieties available with INTACTA, et cetera. So when you look at year-over-year from '18 to '19, that's the anticipation of more activity in Argentina coming online as more varieties are available. And as you know, we slowed down our efforts in Argentina when he had the early challenges with POD. And because of that slowdown, well, other seed companies and us were slower to bring varieties and market fits. So we're starting to accelerate that now as the POD is in a better position, so I feel good about that 75 million number in '19."

But the early responses has been -- I would put it in the category of as expected. As I noted and you confirmed, the commodity price situation is challenging around the world. As we've moved into South America, which is our early market, we're performing as expected down there. I'd say our orders feel reasonable. The market's going to be a lot smaller. That's clear. Third parties saying that acres are going to be down 20% to 30%. But we're doing fine in that market. In North America, harvest is coming in. Products are performing. And as we see every year, regardless of the challenge in the marketplace, farmers are really in tune with the newest hybrids, the best products. For example, we sold out of Disease Shield products this year. Those were our latest release and our best products. We'll -- we believe that we'll see that same kind of demand for our new releases and new hybrids this year, and we'll have to see how the market plays out. But right now, most of our new releases are up in price, as you would expect. And with the products that are a bit older in the marketplace, they're flattish. I'd see the competitive market being reasonable at this point in time, but we'll just have to keep following it through the next month or 2 to see how that plays out."

I don't see the same kind of reduction in Argentina. I would anticipate that those acres are replaced with soybeans, but they have options in Brazil to other crops as well and we'll just have to wait and see how it plays out. I remind you that in Brazil, they get 2 cracks at corn, so they have the summer season that they're going into, and then they have the winter safrinha season. So they're less sensitive to a singular planting. They can make up for corn in safrinha if they need to. And we don't anticipate the same kind of decline in safrinha that we're seeing in the summer season. So I would anticipate at this point that in most cases, beans replace the corn acres that are down, down there. In North America, I say it's way too early. Farmers aren't going to make those calls. They're worried about harvesting right now and getting the crop out of the field. And then they'll start thinking about next year."

I'm looking around the table. We don't think that they have a nematicide. The extraordinary thing about NemaStrike is its brand-new chemistry that was built on the backbone of the genomics of the nematode. So we reversed-engineered from biology, and it really puts it in a very unique class of its own. So I'm not aware of what Bayer has in that space, but I think the performance of NemaStrike that we've seen in our own small trials and the feedback we're getting, it's -- I think, is going to carve out a completely unique niche in nematode control. And the other fascinating thing about it is nematodes as a problem are extraordinarily widespread, but growers have not really had a tool to control them until now. So it really reminds me in a lot of ways of the early days with corn rootworm, where the actual market and the actual products that were there were dwarfed by the introduction of proper control. I think we'll probably see the same thing happen with NemaStrike comes in the future. Thanks for your question.
I -- I'll bring this session to a close and thank you for your attention and your support. I guess I would close the way that I started. I think my team has done an outstanding job of delivering on our operational plan and our deal milestones for the year while we continue to serve and support our customers. And that's quite remarkable given the risk of distraction, so I'm very proud of what they've done. Given that, we plan to continue to execute on exactly the same deliverables as we move through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and we are really looking forward to the benefits that we envision that the pending combination with Bayer will bring to our grower customers around the world.
